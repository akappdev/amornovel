The hood over her head made it hard to breathe, as did the smel of her friends\u2019 bodies. Through a tiny slit in her hood that her captors didn\u2019t know was there, she could see Bethany\u2019s lifeless eyes staring at her.</p><p>Lana tried to turn away, but even the smalest movement sent pain screaming through her broken limbs. The man who had broken them, Boris, came back into the cave, and she knew this was the end. Whatever her abductors told Boris to do, he did. She\u2019d heard them order him to kil her right before they left, and she\u2019d been lying here, waiting for the end, for what seemed like days.</p> <p>She was going to miss her family. Her friends. Her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>She wanted to see her nephew grow up and spoil him with loud presents that would drive her sister crazy. The little drum set Lana had bought him for his birthday was tucked in her closet. She hoped they\u2019d find it and give it to him when her family cleaned out her apartment.</p><p>Boris puled out his gun and crossed the dusty cave to where Lana lay. He was a skinny man with bright blue eyes and dimples that made her stomach turn. A sadistic kiler shouldn\u2019t have dimples.</p><p>His booted feet stopped only inches from her face. Part of her was afraid, but most of her was simply grateful he was using the gun instead of the pipe again. At least this way would be fast. She hoped.</p><p>She saw a shadow cross the mouth of the cave, then another and another. Maybe her abductors were back to watch it happen. Maybe she was halucinating. Lana couldn\u2019t bring herself to care. She was too tired. Too weak.</p> <p>He reached down and ripped at the tape that was holding her hood closed around her neck. The movement caused broken bones to grind, and her dry scream echoed against the cave wals.</p><p>She must have passed out, because when she opened her eyes, her kiler was looking down at her with a concerned frown, patting her cheek as if to revive her. When he saw she was awake again, he nodded once as if satisfied and stood up again. Apparently, he didn\u2019t want to kil her if she was unconscious.</p><p>His gun aimed for her head, thank God. Like with the others he\u2019d kiled, it would be a head shot. Quick and painless.</p><p>A thick arm appeared from nowhere and wrapped around Boris\u2019s head, puling it back while a second arm sliced his throat open with a knife. Blood spewed from the man\u2019s neck, and his gun clattered to the hard ground.</p><p>Lana tried to figure out what was happening, but she couldn\u2019t move her head. Couldn\u2019t keep her eyes open.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you out of here,\u201d said a deep, tight voice she\u2019d heard somewhere before.</p> <p>Pain sliced through her, and she realized she was being lifted. Her broken legs dangled painfuly over a man\u2019s arms, but she kept herself from screaming. She couldn\u2019t alert her captors that she was escaping.</p><p>Lana forced her eyes open just as he carried her out of the cave. Light seared her retinas, but she welcomed it. Light meant freedom\u2014something she thought she\u2019d never again experience.</p><p>He laid her down and spoke in a quiet voice to someone nearby. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long, she isn\u2019t,\u201d said a second man. \u201cAnd not if they find out she made it out alive.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s body throbbed in time with each beat of her heart. He was right. She wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. She could feel herself growing weaker by the second.</p><p>Maybe she was bleeding somewhere.</p><p>At least she wasn\u2019t going to die in that cave.</p><p>\u201cOur team took down three of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I only saw two, and not closely enough to ID them. I got orders from that skinny bastard, Boris. There could be another dozen for al I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took care of Boris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur men are in the hils. They\u2019l find anyone who got away,\u201d said the second man.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>Lana wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but she knew she should. What they were saying meant something to her, but her brain was too foggy to figure it out. She was using al her strength just to keep from screaming.</p><p>If she screamed, they could find her.</p><p>A shadow fel over her face, and Lana looked up into the face of Miles Gentry\u2014the man her abductors had hired to bomb a U.S. elementary school.</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t breathe. She wasn\u2019t safe. Not with him. He was a monster\u2014a man wiling to kil children for money.</p><p>He must have seen her fear, because he smoothed her matted hair back from her face and said, \u201cShh. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m a U.S. soldier. I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Liar! Lana tried to pul away from his touch, but her body wouldn\u2019t move, wouldn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Caleb. You\u2019re scaring her,\u201d said the second man.</p><p>Caleb, or Miles, or whoever he was moved away. Behind him, from high in the rocky hilside, she could see twin flashes of sunlight reflecting off glass. Binoculars.</p><p>With a painful stab of clarity, she realized she was being watched.</p><p>She tried to tel the men, but her lips were swolen and stuck together with dried blood and she couldn\u2019t seem to form a coherent word.</p><p>The wind kicked up and dust choked her lungs. She tried not to cough. Someone puled a sheet over her head to keep the dust out. It didn\u2019t help. She couldn\u2019t keep from coughing, and as soon as she did\u2014as soon as her broken ribs shifted\u2014the pain ricocheted inside her until al she could do was gasp for air.</p><p>All the pain and going without food or water for days was too much. She had to give up and let go. She couldn\u2019t take any more.</p><p>Lana\u2019s mind shut down, and she welcomed the oblivion as it came to claim her.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Columbia, Missouri, eighteen months later</p><p>Caleb Stone had no business being this close to the woman he\u2019d nearly kiled eighteen months ago. Just the thought of having to face Lana Hancock again made him break out in a cold sweat. This assignment was going to be as much fun as taking a bulet in the gut.</p><p>Lana\u2019s office at the First Light Foundation was nestled in the middle of a run-down line of smal one-story leased office spaces, between a walk-in clinic and a print shop.</p><p>The long prefab building was cheaply constructed and badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Early morning sun filtered through the line of trees adorning the front of the parking lot. It was late July in central Missouri, and even with the shade the decorative trees offered, Caleb\u2019s car was already beginning to grow uncomfortably warm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t shift to crack a window or turn on the air. With al the mistakes he\u2019d made, he figured he was headed for hel, anyway. Might as wel get used to the climate.</p><p>Another car puled into the lot and parked. It was Lana Hancock\u2019s white Saturn.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s body tensed and his stomach flooded with acid. This was not going to be fun.</p><p>She got out of her Saturn, putting Caleb no more than fifty feet away from her. It was too damn close, and every corner of his soul screamed for him to back away slowly before she got hurt again. But backing away wasn\u2019t an option. Colonel Monroe had ordered him to come here. The bastard.</p><p>If Caleb had thought for one second that Lana was in danger, he would have been the first one in line to play human shield, but that wasn\u2019t the case. Monroe was just being paranoid over a bit of random chatter the CIA had intercepted. Monroe was worried that the Swarm was back, but that couldn\u2019t be true. That particular terrorist group was gone. Caleb had been on the team that took them out six months ago. They\u2019d made sure no one survived.</p><p>Monroe was convinced something was going on, so here Caleb was, up close and personal with the only living reminder of the worst three days of his life. Lana Hancock.</p><p>She looked a lot different now than she had the last time Caleb had seen her. She stil had the same rich brown hair, but it no longer fel down her back, tangled and matted with blood. She\u2019d cropped it shorter so that it swung in a shiny wave that ended just above her shoulders. Her face was no longer swolen or bruised from repeated beatings, and he found himself staring at her, drinking her in, trying to replace this new, healthy image of her with the horrible one he\u2019d held in his head for too many months. He hadn\u2019t been able to tel when she\u2019d been lying unconscious in that army hospital bed, but now he could see how pretty she was, and that the fulness of her mouth hadn\u2019t been totaly due to sweling.</p><p>A man puled his Honda into the lot and waved at Lana. She smiled and waved back, and Caleb caught a glimpse of deep twin dimples in her cheeks. He\u2019d never seen her smile before, and until now he hadn\u2019t realized what he\u2019d been missing. The only expressions he\u2019d seen on her face were ones of terror and pain. He\u2019d stayed by her bedside for three long days and even longer nights, and neither the terror nor the pain had lessened. When he\u2019d been forced back to work, every day he\u2019d expected to hear that she had died, but that word never came.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d kept tabs on her recovery, this was the first time he\u2019d seen her since, and watching her walk around was like witnessing a miracle. It soothed him and eased some of the tension that had been growing in him ever since he\u2019d been ordered to come here.</p><p>Caleb watched with a mixture of respect and awe as she crossed the hot asphalt to her office. Her walk was smooth and steady, her hips swaying slightly beneath her faded jeans. If he hadn\u2019t known for a fact that it had taken her months to learn how to walk again, he\u2019d never have believed it by watching her move. There was nothing hesitant in her stride, no hitch of pain or jarring movement. She was al roling grace and swaying strength.</p><p>Her functional white T-shirt and matching tennis shoes were completely without frils, and there wasn\u2019t a single glitter of jewelry on her body or a speck of makeup on her face. She used a green canvas backpack instead of a purse, and that looked like it had seen better days. But even without the bels and whistles, even though she was nothing like the glamorous women he usualy dated, she stil had more pul on him than al the women he\u2019d known combined.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t fate\u2019s way of slugging him in the gut for fucking up, he didn\u2019t know what was. No matter how much she appealed to him, she\u2019d probably rather spit on him than look at him. Which was probably safest for both of them.</p><p>Caleb forced his breathing to even out into a steady rhythm while he wiled his heart to slow its pounding pace. He\u2019d known that seeing her again would affect him, but until now, he hadn\u2019t realized just how strongly. He\u2019d never known anyone who\u2019d come back after being that close to dying, and he\u2019d known a lot of strong, highly motivated men.</p><p>Lana was one hel of a woman. If only he\u2019d met her under other circumstances, things might have been a lot different between them.</p><p>If only. Caleb squashed that line of thinking before it could gain a foothold. If onlys could get a man kiled.</p><p>Lana hadn\u2019t even had time to pour a cup of coffee before the first crisis of the day hit. She rubbed her temples in an effort to stave off the tension headache that was growing by leaps and bounds with every passing hour. But headache or not, she had a fundraiser coming up in two weeks and it wasn\u2019t going to plan itself. \u201cAre you sure he said canceled?\u201d she asked Stacie Cramer, her assistant and friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stacie was a petite, consistently wel-dressed woman who was quick to smile even though life\u2019s tragedies had tried to strip away her sense of humor. She was old enough to need reading glasses but young enough to resent them, so more often than not, they hung on a beaded chain around her neck, ignored.</p><p>She squinted at the message pad, holding it out at arm\u2019s length. \u201cHis exact words were, \u2018Tel Lana-darling that I simply must go to Milan. My muse has left me, the bitch, and I wil surely find her there, whoring herself out to other men.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d said Lana. \u201cSo now that His Artistic Majesty, Armand, has abandoned us, the rest of the artists are going to see our fundraiser as more of an obligation than an honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was worried about,\u201d said Stacie.</p> <p>\u201cI should have forced him to sign a contract like the rest of the artists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried and he refused, remember?\u201d</p><p>Lana sighed, trying to release some of her frustration. She was putting on this fundraiser for a good cause, so couldn\u2019t fate just cut her a freaking break for once? \u201cHow many artists have committed to donating their work so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve. Sutter canceled this morning before signing his contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the word that Armand has canceled is already out.\u201d Lana stifled a curse before it spiled from her lips. If she let it out, Stacie would give her one of those motherly frowns of disappointment, and Lana didn\u2019t need any more of those in her life than she already had.</p> <p>Getting her foundation, First Light, off the ground had been both more difficult and more rewarding than she\u2019d ever imagined. Of course, it wasn\u2019t technicaly off the ground yet, but it was close\u2014almost hovering. The art auction would breathe enough monetary life into the foundation to help her hire another permanent staff member, which would free up Lana\u2019s time to work on expanding First Light\u2019s reach.</p><p>The focus of First Light was simple: to give kids a safe place to go after school and during the summer months so they wouldn\u2019t be as tempted to occupy themselves with drugs and violence. She gave them art and music and games to keep them busy in the hopes that there would be no time for the other stuff. They also offered help with homework, organized sports, and worked one-on-one with some of the more troubled or at-risk kids. Dozens of local volunteers gave their time and talents to help her make this happen, and she was proud of the work she\u2019d done, even though it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.</p><p>Her family thought she was wasting her life on a lost cause. She had no business doing something so stressful and financialy risky in her \u201cfragile\u201d state\u2014as if she hadn\u2019t been strong and healthy for months now. Her mother didn\u2019t understand why Lana felt the need to get involved when it would only put her in contact with troubled kids. Why did she want that burden?</p><p>Then again, Madeline Hancock had never met Eddie\u2014one of the men who was on a similar physical therapy schedule with Lana. He\u2019d been a narcotics officer before a ten-year-old boy\u2019s bulet had shattered his femur, basicaly ending his career. Not only had Eddie forgiven the boy, he\u2019d adopted the orphan, and now Eddie spent his time going from school to school talking to kids about everything from drugs to sex to gangs.</p><p>Lana had been so inspired by Eddie\u2019s passion for helping kids, and so desperate for a reason to get up in the morning, that she decided to join the cause. She didn\u2019t care if her parents approved. She was doing what she thought was right, and even if she helped only a handful of kids, it was enough for her.</p><p>She\u2019d done good. Maybe not much, but some. If this art auction went wel, she\u2019d be able to do even more. Maybe she\u2019d be able to move her work into St. Louis or other, smaler cities. Maybe she\u2019d even get to travel enough that no one could be able to predict her movements. She\u2019d be free from always looking over her shoulder, wondering if whoever she\u2019d seen on that hilside in Armenia was stil watching her.</p> <p>She would give almost anything for that kind of freedom.</p><p>Certainly, if that person wanted her dead, she\u2019d already be six feet under. She was sily to keep worrying about nothing. Life was finaly getting better. Why couldn\u2019t she just accept that gift and move on?</p><p>An almost paranoid sort of anxiety puled at her, but she forced it away with a cheerful smile that probably looked as fake as it felt. \u201cWhat\u2019s the status with finding an auctioneer?\u201d</p><p>Stacie\u2019s shoulders slumped, wrinkling her perfectly pressed blouse. \u201cI\u2019ve caled six, and none of them are wiling to donate their time.\u201d</p><p>That tension headache grew a little tenser and achier. She hadn\u2019t been sleeping wel, not that it was anything new.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l see what I can do with the rest of the auctioneers on our list,\u201d Lana said. \u201cI can make some money available if I put off the electric bil a few days. That might be enough to tempt someone, especialy if I give them a prime advertising spot in the auction book.\u201d</p><p>Stacie nodded and peered down at her paper again, squinting. \u201cI\u2019l make the adjustments to the auction listings courtesy of Armand. The layout for the auction book is nearly done. We should be able to send it to the printers as soon as we hire an auctioneer. They said it would take three days to print, so there\u2019s stil time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something, at least,\u201d said Lana, pushing her slippery hair behind her ears so she could rub her temples to ease the throbbing. Two more weeks until the auction and then she could relax. \u201cI\u2019l get onto our website tonight and post the updated artist list. I\u2019l deal with finding an auctioneer today, or I\u2019l sign myself up for a class and do the damn thing myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd when wil you find time to take a class\u2014even a one-day class? You\u2019re already working seventy-hour weeks. Maybe more. What about going to the youth center?</p><p>The whole reason you started this foundation was to help the kids, and you haven\u2019t seen them in days. They miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l find a way to fit that in, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it al.\u201d Stacie gave Lana her best maternal frown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to do it al. I just want to get through this auction without emptying out the foundation\u2019s bank account. Every hour I put in is one I don\u2019t have to pay someone else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it helps, you don\u2019t need to pay me this month.\u201d</p><p>Lana snorted. \u201cYou work for next to nothing. If I can\u2019t afford to pay you, then we\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI checked the books. You\u2019ve been without a paycheck for three months.\u201d</p><p>Lana winced. She didn\u2019t hide the financial records from Stacie, but there wasn\u2019t usualy a need. Stacie hated anything to do with numbers. She\u2019d been a pampered executive\u2019s wife most of her adult life and had never had to so much as lift a calculator. Until her husband and son were kiled in a car accident. That had ended Stacie\u2019s days of pampering.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take another paycheck until you do,\u201d insisted Stacie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Stacie arched a brow. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Lana felt a smile play at her lips, and she gave in to it. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to cal your boss a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what I make, I\u2019ve got to find my fringe benefits where I can,\u201d teased Stacie. \u201cI mean it, Lana. You can\u2019t run yourself into debt to keep this place going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in debt.\u201d Yet. But man, was it close. She had enough to pay her bils this month and buy some groceries, but that was it. After that, she had no idea what she would do.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. When\u2019s the last time you bought yourself a new pair of shoes, or even a new shirt? I swear I see you in the same clothes every week. And that backpack you use as a purse is ghastly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean. I\u2019m decent. That\u2019s enough. Besides, I set the dress code around here, so lay off.\u201d</p><p>Stacie shook her head, making her bun slide around on the back of her head. Lana had no idea how she kept the thing in place, but it had never falen. \u201cJust don\u2019t stretch yourself too thin. I know you want to make this work, but without you, it won\u2019t. If you go pushing yourself too hard, you\u2019l end up broke and sick, and our health insurance plan sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat health insurance plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point.\u201d</p><p>Lana held up her hands in an effort to ward off any more mothering. She got enough of that on the weekends as it was. \u201cOkay. I\u2019l be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Stacie as she rose to her feet and straightened a stack of papers into a file folder. \u201cThen you\u2019l be leaving with me tonight. No more staying late.\u201d</p><p>Lana was saved from having to lie to Stacie by the jingling of the bel on the office door.</p><p>She squinted against the sun as the tinted-glass door swung open. The transition from dim to bright light stil brought back a rioting swirl of emotions, the same way that some scents brought back vivid memories. It had been a long time since she\u2019d been carried out of that cave into the sunlight, but she had never forgotten the way it felt to know she\u2019d been rescued from her nightmare. Even though her body had been bleeding, broken, and knotted with pain, her heart had soared with the knowledge of her freedom.</p><p>Every time she saw the sun, she was reminded of that joy al over again. She welcomed the light, reveled in the fact that she was alive and free enough to enjoy it.</p><p>That brief feeling of freedom was short-lived, however, because as soon as she saw who\u2019d walked in, she knew she was in trouble.</p><p>Caleb Stone.</p><p>Lana would have known him anywhere, whether he went by Caleb or, as she\u2019d first come to know him, as Miles Gentry, amoral mercenary and demolitions expert for hire.</p><p>He was a huge man\u2014not just tal, but big everywhere\u2014and nearly overpowering just standing there a few feet away. He was wel over six feet and a whole heaping pile of muscles over two hundred pounds. His thick legs were braced apart, and his hands were fisted at his sides as if he were expecting a physical blow.</p><p>Shock stiled her mouth, and her pen fel from her hand onto the floor. Her heart squeezed hard, and dread flooded her system. He couldn\u2019t be here. This had to be some Shock stiled her mouth, and her pen fel from her hand onto the floor. Her heart squeezed hard, and dread flooded her system. He couldn\u2019t be here. This had to be some kind of sick joke\u2014a trick of her mind. Another nightmare.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he greeted her in that deep, soothing voice of his.</p><p>This was no nightmare, or rather it was, but she wasn\u2019t asleep. This was real. He was here, torturing her al over again, bringing back those first few days when her world had been only pain and the sound of his voice. He\u2019d been beside her, demanding that she live, compeling her not to give up. She was too weak to do anything but listen, too confused to do anything but obey his commands, and because of that\u2014because of him\u2014she\u2019d lived.</p><p>Sometimes she stil hated him for that.</p><p>Lana struggled to remain calm. He was watching her expectantly, waiting for a response to his greeting. What could she say? She wanted to scream at him to leave, to drive her fists into that solid body of his until he\u2019d never dare show his face again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swalowed hard to ease her constricted vocal cords. \u201cWhat the hel do you want?\u201d she asked him in a biting tone that had Stacie\u2019s thin eyebrows lifting.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth tightened, and he flicked a glance toward Stacie. \u201cIs there someplace private we can talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, not sure if she could keep her cool without Stacie there to back her up, and she did not want this man to see her lose that frail composure.

She wanted nothing from him but his absence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m under orders to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>If listening was the quickest way to get him to leave, then that\u2019s what she\u2019d do. \u201cStart talking. I\u2019m a busy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivately,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cLana? Do you know this man?\u201d asked Stacie in an uneasy tone.</p><p>Stacie\u2019s hand was on the phone, and Lana didn\u2019t need two guesses to figure out she was ready to cal for help. The last thing she needed was to have Stacie panic and cal the police. It was best\u2014fastest\u2014if Lana sucked it up and got rid of Caleb quietly without any interference.</p> <p>Lana gave Caleb a hard stare. \u201cStay right there,\u201d she ordered as she took Stacie by the arm and led her back to the storeroom at the back of the office.</p><p>The smal room contained several shelves of office supplies and their photocopier. It was stuffy and cramped, but Lana shut the door anyway.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Stacie.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the soldier who puled me out of that cave in Armenia.\u201d</p><p>Stacie\u2019s eyes lit with a bad case of hero worship. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tel me he was so handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly thinking about that at the time.\u201d She\u2019d been too busy writhing in pain.</p> <p>Stacie\u2019s mouth turned down in a pained frown. \u201cSorry. That was insensitive of me.\u201d</p><p>Lana waved the remark away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Handsome or not, I\u2019l get rid of him soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved your life and you act like you don\u2019t want to see him? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>Lana hadn\u2019t told anyone that he was also the man who had witnessed her torture and done little to stop it. He\u2019d been undercover, trying to figure out which elementary school the terrorist group was planning to attack. He couldn\u2019t break cover to save her or any of the other Americans with her. If he\u2019d done that, hundreds of children could have died.</p><p>She understood that his hands were tied, and if he\u2019d been able to ask her if she was wiling to suffer to save those kids, she would have agreed without hesitation. But that didn\u2019t mean she wanted to see him again and relive that horror and pain.</p><p>Her life was finaly getting better. Not good, but tolerable. She couldn\u2019t handle any setbacks right now\u2014couldn\u2019t stand to be reminded of everything those three days had cost her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d said Lana, nearly choking on the understatement.</p><p>\u201cWhy is he here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019l tel me as soon as we\u2019re alone.\u201d That thought was enough to make her skin grow cold with apprehension. She did not want to be alone with him. That would have been too much like being back in that hospital bed, drowning in pain and fear with him at her side as her only lifeline. She couldn\u2019t go back to that dark place. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look like he wants to be here,\u201d said Stacie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get rid of him for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought you could, I would let you, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work. I\u2019l let him have his say and then he\u2019l leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of errands to run,\u201d offered Stacie. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure you want to be alone with him.\u201d</p><p>Lana didn\u2019t want to, but she guessed from the stubborn set of Caleb\u2019s jaw that he wasn\u2019t going to go away until he\u2019d had his say. The sooner she got rid of him, the better.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead,\u201d she told Stacie. \u201cI\u2019l be fine.\u201d</p><p>Lana led Stacie out of the storage room. Caleb was stil there, right where she\u2019d left him. He looked at her with a solemn expression, and Lana had to turn away. She didn\u2019t know how she was going to get through the next five minutes, but she knew she would. Her recovery had taught her that lesson over and over again.</p><p>Stacie made a hasty exit out the front door, and Lana went straight for some coffee. There was no way she was going to be able to face this man without the support of caffeine. She poured a cup and turned to go back to her desk, nearly running right into the wal of his chest. \u201cDamn it! Don\u2019t go sneaking up on me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, ma\u2019am.\u201d He backed away a step, but she stil felt overwhelmed. The man knew how to take up space in a room.</p><p>Lana cringed at being caled ma\u2019am again. That was what people caled her mother, and she didn\u2019t want anyone treating her like her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d he repeated, and to her amazement, that was much worse. Hearing that deep voice saying her name flooded her with bleak memories of torment and terror. She was thrown back to those horrible days in the hospital where there was only pain and the sound of his voice speaking her name. She could feel the tearing agony of her body trying to rip away her sanity. She could smel the hospital stink, her own blood, and the warmth of his skin. She could see only blackness\u2014a hungry mouth waiting to swalow her whole.</p><p>Lana felt a familiar wave of panic head toward her. She couldn\u2019t do this. She couldn\u2019t go back there and live in that nightmare for even one more second. She was forced to relive it every night, but it was broad daylight, and she was supposed to be safe in the light. She couldn\u2019t let the fear invade her days, too. She wouldn\u2019t have anything left if that happened.</p><p>Her coffee was stripped from her hands before she could spil it on herself. A warm hand grasped her elbow, steadying her. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said, easing her into a chair.</p><p>Lana sat, unable to do anything else. She clawed at the memories, fighting them back, trying desperately to force her body to remember she was safe. In her office. With plenty of light. Nothing could hurt her here.</p><p>\u201cPlease . . . please leave.\u201d She was begging him. There was no pride in her words, no dignity, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed him to leave and take al those memories with him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His voice sounded strained, thick. \u201cI swear to you that if I wasn\u2019t under orders to be here, I\u2019d turn around and never bother you again. But I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Lana found the strength to pul herself out of that spiraling void of the past. She opened her eyes, realizing that she\u2019d started crying and her face was wet with tears. Those tears were just one more reason to hate Caleb Stone.</p><p>Lana wished she had the energy to hate him, because hating him would have made things a whole lot easier. She liked to think that if he hadn\u2019t been such a noble freaking hero, she would have hated him for what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cJust say what you want and get out,\u201d she told him, angrily swiping the wetness from her cheeks.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth hardened into a grim line. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not going to be that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got three minutes to simplify it, and then I\u2019m caling the police.\u201d</p><p>His voice was gentle, almost apologetic. \u201cMy boss thinks you might be in danger.\u201d</p><p>Panic tightened her insides until she could barely breathe. This was al supposed to be over. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been some chatter, conversations we\u2019ve intercepted that have happened between some very bad people. Your name was mentioned. More than once.\u201d</p><p>Had someone figured out what she\u2019d seen in Armenia? Had they found the slit in her hood and realized what it meant? \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing incriminating, or we\u2019d have already taken action. My boss was stil concerned. He sent me here to see if you\u2019d remembered anything new or could think of a reason why someone would want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere never was a reason for them to hurt me. People like them don\u2019t need one. Do they?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s jaw tightened, and a violent light glinted in his dark eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. They don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She hated asking, but she had to know. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m in danger?\u201d</p><p>He stared right into her eyes. \u201cIf I did, no one would have had to force me to come here. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am safe.\u201d Please, God, let him say yes.</p><p>\u201cUntil I am sure, I\u2019m sticking close enough to protect you, just in case.\u201d</p><p>Her knees went a little weak, and she was glad she was already sitting. She gathered her anger, because it was so much more comfortable than the fear that was crawling around in her gut. \u201cI don\u2019t want you here, and I\u2019m not interested in your protection. Besides, since when do average civilians get personal military bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss thinks you\u2019re hiding something.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t know. She was stil safe. Her family was safe. \u201cHe and his men interrogated me for five days after I woke up. I\u2019l tel you what I told them. I didn\u2019t hear anything of military value in Armenia, because I don\u2019t speak the language. I couldn\u2019t have seen anything, because there was a hood over my head.\u201d She uttered the lie like a politician, smoothly and without a blink. \u201cI can\u2019t help you, so please. Get. The. Fuck. Out.\u201d</p><p>He was leaning his big body over her, hovering in a way that made her feel crowded and shielded al at once. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make this easy on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, unable to see his expression with the bright fluorescent lights shining behind his head. \u201cCan you think of a single reason why I should?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Not one. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I was ordered to come here, protect you, and convince you to cooperate or stay here until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a long, boring road to retirement, then. I don\u2019t have anything to say to you, and I never wil.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Forget the bulet in the gut. Caleb was wiling to take a bulet in the bals if it meant he never had to see Lana cry again. Those tears had torn at his heart like rusted razor wire.</p><p>It was the kind of torture military training couldn\u2019t teach a man to resist. It had taken every last scrap of wilpower he had to keep from puling her into his arms. And wouldn\u2019t that have been a fun time for her? Who was he to think he could comfort a woman, when most of her problems could rightfuly be placed squarely on his shoulders?</p><p>Damn Monroe for his hand in this. He had to have known what it would do to Lana to be forced to face Caleb again. He had to have known what it would do to Caleb, too. The bastard.</p><p>Caleb puled a chair into the farthest corner of the office and tried to disappear\u2014no smal feat for a man his size. He\u2019d refused to leave, and she refused to acknowledge he was there. For now, the stalemate was the best he could hope for. Maybe once she got over the shock of seeing him, she\u2019d be wiling to listen. Until then, Caleb would just have to be patient and keep his eyes open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not ten minutes after Lana had finaly managed to push Caleb\u2019s silent presence out of her mind, her ex-fianc\u00e9, Oran Sinclair, came striding into her office. He moved with the arrogant confidence of a man who was sure that everyone around him was watching and enjoying the view. Lana\u2019s stomach twisted at the sight of him, sending up a flare of anger and disgust\u2014anger that he\u2019d come waltzing in here like he owned the place, and disgust that she hadn\u2019t come to know him for the selfish man he was before he broke her heart.</p><p>He was just as handsome now as he had been when she\u2019d falen in love with him during her sophomore year at MU. With his perfectly trimmed blond hair and those al-American, camera-friendly good looks, he\u2019d swept her off her feet. She\u2019d been too young then to realize that she\u2019d only land on her ass a few years later.</p><p>So much for true love.</p><p>Oran straightened his power tie and gave her a disarming smile\u2014the one he used when posing for the press after a successful trial.</p> <p>He gave Caleb a speculative glance as he strode over to her desk. \u201cLana,\u201d he greeted, taking her hand from her side when she didn\u2019t offer it.</p><p>His fingers were cold and a little clammy, as if he was nervous, which was ridiculous, because Oran hadn\u2019t been nervous a day in his life. He fed on pressure, bloomed under stress\u2014like some sort of exotic fungus.</p><p>Lana puled away from Oran\u2019s grip a little too fast, giving away her dislike for the man. Caleb saw it and stood from his seat, taking a warning step forward. She gave Caleb a smal shake of her head, and although his frown was grim, he stayed on his side of the room.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d asked Oran with a nod toward Caleb.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my friend. Just ignore him. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>Oran\u2019s smile widened, and a touch of victory lit his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Oran?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTroling for campaign contributions for that lofty political career you\u2019ve had your eye on?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a handsome smile that crinkled the corners of his flashing blue eyes. \u201cNothing like that, darling. I haven\u2019t heard from you since Easter. Why haven\u2019t you returned my cals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have nothing to say to you. Mom never should have invited you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Nothing new there.</p> <p>He continued, \u201cShe told me how strapped you are for cash these days. I wanted to discuss what I could do for you.\u201d</p><p>Warning bels gonged in Lana\u2019s head. Oran never did anything outside of his own self-interest. \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she said and sat down, dismissing him without explanation.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even hear me out,\u201d he said, puling up a chair too near her own.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need to. Whatever it is, I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if I told you that I\u2019m wiling to fund your foundation for the next five years?\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s hand stiled its scribbling and she looked up. He wore that same disarming smile that had made her give her heart away to him so easily six years ago. The same one that would win votes.</p><p>His offer of funding sounded too good to be true. Oran was not a generous man. \u201cYou only give to charity when the press is watching. If I actualy believed you, I might listen, but I know better.\u201d</p><p>He reached out toward her, and it was al she could do not to flinch away and draw Caleb\u2019s attention. She hated having an audience for this. It was hard enough without one.</p> <p>His fingers settled against her cheek in a mockery of a caring touch. \u201cYou look tired. You\u2019re working too hard, Lana. I know how much this place means to you, and I want to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, knowing she\u2019d regret being puled into his world\u2014a world where nothing else mattered beyond his political aspirations. She had to remember that.</p><p>\u201cWould you believe I want to help because I care about you?\u201d he asked, sounding sincere.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He gave a self-deprecating smile that reeked of long hours of practice in front of a mirror. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so. I know things didn\u2019t end wel between us, and I just wanted you to know how badly I feel about that. I should have been more understanding.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she could see Caleb watching them without even the pretense of trying to give them privacy.</p><p>Lovely. As if she hadn\u2019t had enough awkwardness today.</p><p>\u201cYou told me that I was no good to you in a wheelchair, Oran. You told me that a woman who might not be able to give you children just wasn\u2019t an option for you. Tel me how you could have been any less understanding.\u201d</p><p>Oran threw a quick, questioning glance at Caleb, then lowered his voice. \u201cI was an ass. I\u2019m sorry, Lana. I want a chance to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy helping fund my foundation?\u201d she asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cBy giving us another shot. You and I were good together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not good enough for you to stick around. You dumped me before I was even out of the hospital!\u201d</p><p>Caleb surged to his feet, and from over Oran\u2019s shoulder, she pinned Caleb with a hard glare. \u201cYou stay out of this. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Oran. \u201cCan you send him away so we can talk in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him away?\u201d she nearly screeched. \u201cThat is so like you, Oran. Everyone is your servant to be ordered around as you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d said Caleb in a warning growl. His dark eyes were fixed on Lana, daring her to try to get him to leave. As if she needed to cause any more of a scene than she already was with Oran.</p><p>\u201cJust ignore him,\u201d Lana told Oran. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t live here, so he can\u2019t vote against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hurt that you think that\u2019s al I care about,\u201d said Oran.</p><p>\u201cI know that\u2019s al you care about.\u201d She jabbed a finger hard into Oran\u2019s chest. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t wait to unload the burden of having a handicapped woman hanging around your neck. I\u2019ve told you over and over that it\u2019s over between us. Period. What makes you think I\u2019d give you another chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you do, I\u2019l make sure the First Light Foundation doesn\u2019t fold. I know how important it is to you.\u201d</p><p>He knew it and was using it to shameless advantage. If she had even the slightest reason to believe him, she might be tempted to play along, but she knew better. \u201cAre you saying you want to buy my forgiveness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know better than to try to do that. Al I want is for you to see how sorry I am for the way I treated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now? Why not six months ago, when I was struggling to get the foundation started? Did you just now realize what a complete asshole you were? Or did one of your campaign managers run the numbers and find out that I\u2019m a better attachment than Brittney?\u201d</p><p>A guilty flush rose up from under his colar.</p><p>\u201cYou do remember her, right?\u201d asked Lana. \u201cBrittney? The woman you\u2019re supposed to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can never be to me what you were. My first love.\u201d His fingers stroked along her jaw, and Lana pushed his hand away with a hard shove.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw Caleb\u2019s big hands tighten into fists, but he stayed put.</p><p>Lana wanted to snort at Oran\u2019s ludicrous statement. Once upon a time, his comment would have made her go sappy, but that was a lifetime ago. \u201cThen perhaps you shouldn\u2019t marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was hoping you\u2019d say. Somewhere deep down, you know we belong together.\u201d He reached for her again, but Lana leaned away and he took the hint, letting his hand drop.</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is that the only person you\u2019ve ever truly loved is yourself. I don\u2019t care how much money you\u2019re offering the foundation, it\u2019s not enough to buy my forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what about your time? Al I want is another chance. Come have dinner with me. Just dinner.\u201d His voice was coaxing.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep asking me out? Didn\u2019t you just get engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Did Brittney use the wrong fork while dining with the governor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019ve just been doing a lot of soul-searching and realized that you\u2019re the woman I want. If that means supporting your chosen career, then that\u2019s what I\u2019l do.\u201d He made it sound like he would be making a sacrifice to let her do her job.</p><p>Lana had a flash of insight and decided to test her theory. \u201cWhat if I want to quit my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it too much. I wouldn\u2019t want you to do that, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing good work. The press loves you. Why on earth would you want to quit?\u201d</p><p>The press. That was it. Lana had been the focus of several major news articles lately, and Oran wanted a piece of the coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re done here, Oran. See yourself out.\u201d</p><p>Lana went back to her work, trying to focus on the page in front of her. The words made no sense, but she stared at them as if they held the meaning of life.</p><p>How could she have ever believed he loved her? It was so clear to her now that that emotion was beyond him. He was just one more foolish mistake she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Lana.\u201d That gentle, caring tone he used nearly kiled her. He was offering her everything she wanted, but she knew it was an ilusion. No matter how much she loved him, he\u2019d never be able to love her back the way she wanted. Needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d said Lana. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come here. I didn\u2019t ask anything of you at al. But now I am asking you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Caleb took a step forward, scowling, looking hugely intimidating. Oran didn\u2019t seem to notice the threat, but then, he didn\u2019t know what Caleb was capable of the way she did. She\u2019d seen him kil the man who\u2019d beaten and tortured her. In fact, he made kiling look frighteningly easy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave things like this. You and I can have a future together. Come back to me and let me prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no future for us. You ruined any chance of that when you abandoned me when I needed you most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019m sorry. Can\u2019t we move past it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for that,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>\u201cThe lady asked you to leave,\u201d said Caleb, his voice low and steady. He was stil several feet away, but no less threatening because of it. \u201cYou should do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hel are you, anyway?\u201d asked Oran, his nose twitching as if he smeled something bad.</p><p>Lana wasn\u2019t quick enough to think of a reason for Caleb to be here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the man who\u2019s going to help you find the door if you can\u2019t do it on your own,\u201d said Caleb. His voice was even, calm.</p><p>Oran looked up and down Caleb\u2019s big body. \u201cDo you work with Lana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Caleb at the same time Lana said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Oran looked between them, his photogenic smile nowhere to be found. \u201cThink about what I said, Lana. I\u2019l give you some time to think things over, and then I\u2019l be back for your answer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt wil be the same as it is has been for months. The same as it is now. You might as wel not waste your time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Oran just shrugged and pasted on his look-at-me smile as he headed for the door, just in case someone outside was watching. \u201cWe\u2019l see. One of these days you may decide you need me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I did need you, you walked away. I\u2019l never make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>Caleb had learned at a young age that he had to control his temper, because he\u2019d always been bigger and stronger than the other kids. Without that patience and self-control, he would have hurt people, and those traits had always served him wel until today.</p> <p>As he watched Oran walk away, he wished that he\u2019d slammed his fist right into Oran\u2019s handsome nose. Blacking both of that asshole\u2019s eyes would have been fun.</p><p>Therapeutic.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe that Oran had been stupid enough to dump Lana. And the thought of him doing it while she was stil weak and vulnerable made Caleb clench his fists against the urge to hit something.</p><p>\u201cDoes he always come around here like that?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>Lana\u2019s face was stil tight with anger, which was now aimed directly at him. Caleb had kept quiet, trying to stay out of her personal business, but he just couldn\u2019t keep quiet any longer. Not after that.</p> <p>\u201cEventualy, he\u2019l get the point.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t like the idea of her hanging around with scum like Oran. Not that it was any of his concern. She was a grown woman and could make as many bad choices as she wanted. Heaven knew he\u2019d made plenty of his own.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an ass,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cIf it\u2019s any consolation, you were lucky not to have been stuck with him.\u201d</p><p>Lana let out a deep breath and looked back down at her work. \u201cI know that now.\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t known it when he dumped her, was the obvious subtext.</p><p>Caleb clenched his fists again and tried to remind himself that he wasn\u2019t here to inflict violence on Lana\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9, no matter how appealing the idea was.</p> <p>It was time for Lana to go home, and Caleb was stil sitting there. Stacie had left a couple of hours ago, giving Lana that maternal frown that could make her feel like she was nine years old. She\u2019d scolded Lana for working too hard and then left, saying she\u2019d be in early in the morning.</p><p>Lana glanced over at Caleb. He\u2019d hardly moved al day. He intervened when Oran wouldn\u2019t leave. He ate the burgers Stacie had brought him, thanking her politely for thinking of him. He used the bathroom at the back of the office a couple times, but other than that, he hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>Lana felt him watching her, but every time she looked up, he was never looking her way. She wished he had been, because then she could have scolded him for that and maybe even worked up the nerve to cal the police and have him hauled off for stalking or something.</p><p>Like that would work. They\u2019d get one glimpse of his military record and likely take him out for drinks or invite him to date their sisters. That was just the kind of thing Lana had come to expect from fate where her life was concerned.</p><p>Caleb was watching the street outside. Sometimes he\u2019d scribble something on a little notebook he carried. She had no idea what he was doing, but it was clear that it was taking up al his concentration. She used the opportunity to just look at him.</p><p>His black hair had been a little longer in Armenia. It was stil long enough to defy military regulations, but then again, he was special. He did things like pretend to be a criminal in order to infiltrate a terrorist group. He couldn\u2019t go around looking like GI Joe and expect to be accepted as scum by scum.</p><p>His skin was deeply tanned, with a few paler lines of scar tissue on both his hands and face that showed where his dangerous career had damaged his body.</p><p>His face wasn\u2019t as handsome as it was simply . . . powerful. Intense. His jaw was wide and bold, covered in five-o\u2019clock shadow that accentuated the sharp, masculine angles. His eyes were a deep, rich black. Only the faintest slivers of golden brown gave away where his pupils started and his irises ended. She remembered them in vivid detail. They were the first thing she\u2019d seen when she\u2019d opened her eyes in the hospital and knew she was going to live.</p> <p>Lana didn\u2019t want to like him, and she sure as hel didn\u2019t want him sticking around, but she couldn\u2019t keep herself from respecting him. He\u2019d done something she wasn\u2019t sure she could ever do. He\u2019d held the fate of innocents in his hands and chosen who would live and who would die.</p><p>She didn\u2019t envy him that responsibility.</p><p>\u201cAre you sleeping here tonight?\u201d he asked her without turning around. Night had falen outside, and he was looking at her in the mirrorlike reflection of the tinted windows.</p><p>Lana felt her face heat as she realized that he\u2019d been watching her watch him. \u201cNo. I\u2019m just about done. Feel free to tel your boss you tortured me, or whatever, to get me to talk, but I just didn\u2019t have anything to say. I wouldn\u2019t want him to think any less of you for failing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019ve failed? I\u2019m a patient man, Lana.\u201d</p><p>Lana swalowed a vile curse by force of habit, even though Stacie wasn\u2019t here to hear her. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you in tomorrow. That\u2019s final. You want to sit outside in the parking lot and bake, that\u2019s fine, but you\u2019re not coming in here where it\u2019s al cool and comfy.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a shrug of indifference. \u201cI\u2019ve been hotter places than here.\u201d</p><p>He probably had, too. He\u2019d probably climbed frozen mountains and swum crocodile-infested rivers, and crossed scorching deserts with no water, and jumped over tal buildings in a single leap. He was a freaking hero. He\u2019d saved hundreds of lives. He could probably walk on water if he tried.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he just go away and leave her in peace? Her life was bad enough without the constant reminder of what she\u2019d suffered.</p><p>And if any of the terrorists who had escaped justice found out he was here, they might figure out she\u2019d seen them. Having Caleb here was like putting a giant neon sign over her head, reading, \u201cWitness here. Come get her.\u201d</p><p>She needed him to go. Now. Before any more attention was drawn her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. Don\u2019t try to folow me, or I\u2019l cal the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my orders,\u201d was al he said.</p><p>\u201cScrew your orders. Stalking is a crime, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He looked completely unconcerned by her threat, and that\u2019s when Lana knew the ugly truth. No matter where she went or what she did, he was going to be there. He wasn\u2019t going away until she told him what he wanted to hear, and there was no way she was going to do that. Not if she wanted to live.</p><p>Caleb sat in his car outside Lana\u2019s nearly deserted apartment building. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to ask her to let him in so he could check the place out. He knew what the answer would be, and he realy didn\u2019t want to give her the chance to scream at him.</p><p>From what he could tel from the outside, the place was run-down and badly in need of repair. Closer to the highway, several similar buildings had been polished up and remodeled, but not this one. It looked like it had been built in the seventies and not much had been done since then. There weren\u2019t even many cars in the lot, just her Saturn, his car, and an ancient Taurus that looked like its tires had rotted into the concrete.</p><p>Trees grew up al around the apartment building, shielding it from the noise and stink of the highway. As beautiful as they were, they were also an excelent source of concealment for anyone who might want to get into Lana\u2019s apartment. She had a ground-level unit with plenty of windows to climb through\u2014windows that also happened to be on the side facing the thick growth of trees. It wouldn\u2019t have taken a genius to find a way in. Hel, a kid could have done it without putting down his Game Boy.</p><p>After he was sure she was asleep, he\u2019d get out of his car and scout the place more closely to see if his first impressions of security here were accurate, but he didn\u2019t want to scare her by snooping around while she was stil awake to watch.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s bely growled in hunger, but he ignored it. He had some MREs in his duffel and he\u2019d break one out later, but not until the lights in Lana\u2019s apartment went out. It was nearly ten, and he hoped she\u2019d get some rest soon. She looked like she could use it.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lana\u2019s face peeked out from between the slats of her cheap blinds. She was too far away for him to make out much more than the shape of her head, but somehow he got the feeling that she was scowling at him.</p><p>Caleb sighed. Not much he could do to change her opinion of him. As it was, she\u2019d already shocked him by not caling the police. No matter how tough she wanted to sound, he could tel the idea of him sitting out in the heat bothered her. She didn\u2019t want him to suffer. How ironic.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s gut twisted in a slow rol of regret. Wishing things had been different never made them so, and even if he had to go back and live that nightmare al over again, he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently.</p><p>Except maybe he wouldn\u2019t have gone to Lana\u2019s hospital room. Seeing her suffer like that had slain something inside him\u2014some innocent little piece of his soul that believed in fairness, justice.</p><p>Of course, had he not gone there, he\u2019d never have been able to live with himself. There were just some things a man didn\u2019t do, and walking away from a dying woman that he\u2019d helped kil was one of them.</p><p>The blinds cracked open again, and a minute later, Lana came stomping out of her apartment. She carried a plate of food in one hand and a glass of water in the other. By the time she\u2019d gotten to his car, he\u2019d roled down the window.</p><p>Lana shoved the food at him. \u201cHere,\u201d was al she said.</p><p>Caleb took the food and thanked her, but she was already stomping off again. He thought he heard her mutter something about hoping he\u2019d choke.</p><p>Caleb stared at the plate in amusement. She\u2019d made spaghetti for him.</p><p>The door of her apartment slammed shut, and Caleb couldn\u2019t help but smile. She didn\u2019t like him, she had every reason to hate him, yet she couldn\u2019t stand to let him go hungry\u2014couldn\u2019t stand the thought of him baking in the hot sun.</p><p>Maybe there was stil hope for this mission yet.</p><p>Caleb wolfed down the meal, grateful for real food when faced with the option of a lukewarm MRE instead. He\u2019d had enough of those to last him a lifetime.</p><p>When he\u2019d cleaned the last noodle from the plate, he figured he had just been handed the best excuse he could think of to get a look inside her home. He had to return her dishes.</p><p>Caleb pocketed one of his wireless mini-cams and made his way up the concrete stairs that led to the sidewalk that ran along the apartment building. One of the security lights was out, casting the trees behind her unit into deep shadows. Decorative bushes sat in thick clumps beneath her windows, and they were in desperate need of a haircut.</p><p>He was too big to make much use of a hiding place like that, but a lot of people wouldn\u2019t be. Al they\u2019d have to do was sit there and wait to break in after she\u2019d left her apartment, then wait inside for her to return. She\u2019d never even suspect she was walking into a trap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But none of that bothered him nearly as much as her front door. It was a flimsy piece of construction with a lock that wouldn\u2019t have taken him twenty seconds to bypass.</p><p>Even an amateur would have had no trouble getting through that door. A stiff wind could do the job.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t have time to knock before the door was opened. Lana stepped out onto her welcome mat, blocking his path, a clear sign he was not welcome inside.</p><p>\u201cI brought you back your dishes. The food was great. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>Lana gave a grudging nod and took the dirty plate and glass. \u201cPlease tel me you\u2019re not going to stay out there al night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m under or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrders. Yes, I know. And I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. At least go where I can\u2019t see you watching me. You\u2019re making me nervous, and I can\u2019t get anything done.\u201d It was the weariness in her tone that nearly had him backing off. She looked exhausted, with dark smudges under her blue eyes and a tired droop to her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave you alone, but I\u2019l try to keep out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, but it sounded like she was admitting defeat, and he hated that he\u2019d pushed a strong woman like Lana that far.</p> <p>She turned to go back into her apartment, and Caleb knew he had one more job to do before he could let her go. \u201cWould it be okay if I used your bathroom?\u201d</p><p>He could tel she wanted to say no, but there was that look in her eyes again\u2014the one that told him she didn\u2019t like the idea of him suffering. She let out a long, weary sigh.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>She held the door open for him, and he had to nearly touch her to squeeze past. He caught her scent as he passed, and something deep in his chest tightened. He remembered that scent; under the sterile, sickly stench of the hospital, she had smeled the same way. Like honeysuckle and miracles, like spring and second chances.</p><p>That scent had haunted him last spring when flowers had started to bloom and he\u2019d caught a whiff of honeysuckle. He\u2019d remember Lana lying in the hospital bed and wish that he could have saved her, too.</p><p>If only.</p> <p>Caleb shoved the thought away and took in her smal apartment with one sweeping glance. It was like countless other rental places, with white wals, matted gray-brown carpet, and cracked vinyl floors. There was an open living/kitchen area that took up most of the apartment and a single bedroom and bathroom off to one side. A sturdy plaid couch in front of a tiny TV filed most of the living area, with heavy wooden bookcases filing the rest. The shelves nearly bowed under the weight of dozens of travel books, as wel as thick guides on fundraising and how to build your own business.</p><p>The wals were decorated with sketches where other people used photographs. The art was good\u2014lifelike enough that it captured the emotion and personality of each subject. A much older version of Lana, which Caleb guessed was her mother, was holding a newborn who stil wore the tiny hospital band on his chubby wrist. Pride filed the older woman\u2019s face, and Caleb swore he could almost see the tears of joy running down her cheeks. Another sketch showed a teenage girl in a soccer uniform holding a trophy while a crowd of other girls hoisted her high overhead. Cheers and praise were frozen on their lips, and it was easy to imagine the sound they had made. Another sketch was of a man in his sixties, pruning shears in hand, tending a rosebush. The look of contentment on his face was nearly palpable, and the roses were so intricately drawn that Caleb was sure he would feel the velvet texture of rose petals if he ran his finger over the paper. He had to force himself not to keep staring at the artwork and move on.</p><p>On the smal dining table sat an outdated PC and piles of bils and paperwork. The kitchen counters were nearly bare, with the exception of a coffee pot and a toaster sitting out, ready to use.</p><p>Caleb made quick use of the bathroom and came back out. Lana was at the sink washing the dishes, and he took the opportunity to mount the minuscule wireless camera on the frame above her bathroom door. No one was getting in through her front windows or door without him seeing it. When no one came through, he could prove to Monroe that Lana wasn\u2019t in danger and get out of this blasted assignment. Anyone who wanted to do Lana harm could walk right in here and do it. Once Monroe saw how easy it would be to get to her, he\u2019d be satisfied that she was safe. Anything that was going to happen would have already happened by now.</p><p>Or maybe that was just wishful thinking on Caleb\u2019s part. Maybe he wanted to believe she was safe too much.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Perfect politeness, but Lana didn\u2019t turn around. The line of her back was straight and stiff. He needed no further reminder that she didn\u2019t want him here. The least he could do was get out and leave her in peace.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget to lock the door when I leave.\u201d</p> <p>She turned then, and Caleb thought he saw fear flitter over her eyes for just a split second before it vanished. \u201cI never forget to lock the door.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Denny Nelson jumped when his cel phone rang, causing beer bottles to topple over and crash onto his kitchen floor.</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting for this cal for so long he was beginning to think his new boss had forgotten him.</p><p>\u201cHelo,\u201d Denny answered, hoping he didn\u2019t sound as drunk as he felt.</p><p>\u201cI have a job for you,\u201d said the man on the other end of the phone. His voice was creepy\u2014a metalic monotone that was artificial and emotionless. It sounded like a robot was talking, but Denny knew better. The man just didn\u2019t want Denny to recognize his voice, which was fine with him. The less contact he had with his boss, the better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Denny said, scrambling for a notebook and pen.</p><p>\u201cGo to Meg\u2019s Diner. In the restroom, behind the prophylactic machine, you\u2019l find instructions for the job I want you to do. When you\u2019re finished, go home, turn on your porch light, and wait for my cal.\u201d</p><p>Denny felt the spidery legs of paranoia crawling up his back. \u201cYou can see my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see everything you do. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Denny swalowed a lump of fear and peered out of his kitchen window. It was too dark to see anything out there, but suddenly he could feel his boss\u2019s eyes on him. He needed another beer. Bad. \u201cWhat\u2019s the pay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as it was for the last job,\u201d said the robot voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat if that\u2019s not enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know it is. Your father\u2019s debts increase daily. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to start paying them off before the interest rate increases to broken bones.\u201d</p><p>Denny shoved that thought out of his mind before he got sick. He\u2019d seen what the men who held his dad\u2019s debt had done to him before they\u2019d finaly kiled him. Denny had no fondness for the man, but he didn\u2019t wish that kind of punishment on anyone. Especialy himself. \u201cOkay. I can be at Meg\u2019s in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Denny opened the fridge and puled out a beer to settle his nerves.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. I knew you\u2019d make the right decision.\u201d</p><p>Denny tightened his jaw over the caustic words that wanted to spew out. He was twenty-two, hardly a boy, yet his boss insisted on saying that every time they made a deal. It was enough to make a man crazy.</p><p>\u201cAnd Dennis?\u201d</p><p>Not Denny, Dennis. He hated that, too. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had enough beer tonight.\u201d</p><p>Caleb was getting angrier by the minute. It was after one in the morning, and Lana\u2019s lights were stil burning bright. He opened his laptop and puled up the image from the camera he\u2019d planted. Along the far edge of the image, he saw Lana sitting at her computer, working. Her body was slumped with fatigue, but her fingers continued to fly over the keyboard. He heard the buzz of some infomercial in the background spewing something about building better abs. Beside her sat a steaming cup of coffee that she must have just poured.</p><p>He wanted to bust into her apartment and demand that she go to bed, but he didn\u2019t dare. He wasn\u2019t ready to let her know about the camera he\u2019d planted, nor was it realy any of his business. If she wanted to work herself sick, he just had to live with it.</p><p>Caleb closed his laptop before he could change his mind about barging into her life.</p><p>His dashboard clock read one-eighteen. The perfect time to cal in and report to Monroe. Waking his CO up from a nice, cozy bed with the missus was the perfect way for Caleb to let him know just how much he was enjoying this job.</p><p>The colonel picked it up on the first ring, and there was no hint of sleep in his voice. The bastard.</p><p>\u201cMonroe,\u201d greeted the colonel in a terse voice.</p><p>\u201cSir, it\u2019s Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout time you caled. Report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at her place.\u201d Caleb didn\u2019t use Lana\u2019s name, on the off chance that someone would monitor the cal. Even though they\u2019d taken every precaution to secure his cel phone, there was always new technology out there that could thwart their efforts and countersurveilance.</p><p>Caleb could hear the smile in Monroe\u2019s voice. \u201cThat\u2019s quick work. The closer you are to her, the safer she\u2019l be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, sir. I\u2019m outside. In my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrant would have already been in the woman\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not Grant,\u201d growled Caleb, hating the thought of another man in her bed more than he should have.</p><p>\u201cSitting outside isn\u2019t good enough. Do whatever you have to do to stick by her side. She knows something she didn\u2019t tel us when we debriefed her. Find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>Anger swirled in Caleb\u2019s gut. He didn\u2019t like the colonel implying that she\u2019d lied, even though he knew that it was a possibility. \u201cHow do you know there\u2019s anything to find out, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a hunch.\u201d</p><p>Fuck your hunch, is what Caleb wanted to say, but he bit back the remark and showed the colonel the respect he deserved. \u201cI\u2019l feel her out and see if I can get her to talk, but I\u2019m not going to go dragging up bad memories if I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be gained by it. She doesn\u2019t need me to force her to relive her torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to see her dead, son?\u201d</p><p>Caleb snarled, and his hand tightened around the phone until he heard the plastic groan in protest. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cThen you damn wel better find out what she\u2019s hiding. I never did buy her story that she didn\u2019t hear or see anything over those three days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spent five days interrogating her. Are you saying that our men aren\u2019t good enough to break one weak, bedridden woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought we had the whole story, son. We were wrong.\u201d There was no smugness in Monroe\u2019s tone, only the heavy weight of responsibility.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we weren\u2019t wrong, then why is her name being tossed about by men we know were linked to the Swarm before we took them down? Men they hired to do some of their dirty work?\u201d</p><p>Caleb had no answers. \u201cThe good news is that if she did witness something, then we got al the terrorists that day. If any of them survived, they would have already tried to capture or kil her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot necessarily. They might have thought she was dead. Lord knows she looked dead when you puled her out.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mind filed with that horrible image of her broken, bleeding body, the way he\u2019d puled the sheet over her head to keep the dust from choking her. The memory alone was enough to nearly send him into a rage. He held on to his temper by a thin thread. \u201cSo why now? Why haven\u2019t they come after her sometime in the past eighteen months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took her six months before she could even walk again. It took another six months before she was able to take care of herself and move out of her parents\u2019 home to live on her own. She\u2019s only recently gotten any sort of media attention for her foundation, and I think that\u2019s what did it. Her name started popping up on the CIA transcripts right after that big news article that plastered her face on the front page of the local paper. If there\u2019s anyone out there who wants her eliminated as a witness, they might not have even realized she was stil alive until recently.\u201d</p><p>That made too much sense for Caleb\u2019s peace of mind. \u201cI want to get her into protective custody.\u201d</p> <p>Monroe sighed. \u201cYou can try to talk her into it, son, but she\u2019s been refusing it ever since she regained consciousness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cWe should make her. Even if she isn\u2019t hiding anything, someone might think she is. That alone puts her in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want to go into hiding, I won\u2019t force her. It wouldn\u2019t work anyway without her cooperation, and I\u2019m not wiling to waste resources like that. Convince her to give in if you can, but any woman who can live through what she did has got to be about as stubborn as God can make her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat stubbornness is going to make this job ten times harder,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cSince this is going to take a while, you might as wel send in my replacement. She\u2019l be more comfortable with someone she can trust. Lots of them, just to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Stone. Can\u2019t do that. Al my men are tied up at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb felt his patience puling into thin shreds. His words hissed out from between his clenched teeth. \u201cThen drag in someone else\u2019s men, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already there and know the situation. She knows you. You\u2019re the best man for the job, and she deserves the best, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop trying to manipulate me, damn it. It won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about manipulating you? I\u2019m just stating a fact. You\u2019re the best man for the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt she thinks so. It\u2019s got to be hel for her to have to see me again.\u201d He knew it was. He\u2019d made her cry, damn it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that wil convince her to cooperate faster, just to get you out of her life. Stay put. I\u2019l send someone else if and when I can.\u201d</p> <p>With that, Monroe cut the connection and left Caleb writhing in frustration. Lana needed someone else to watch out for her\u2014someone who wouldn\u2019t remind her of how she nearly died. Someone she could trust not to get her hurt again.</p><p>Bedtime was always the worst time of the day for Lana. She put it off a little longer each night, but it was nearly two in the morning, and after the dose of sleeping pils she\u2019d taken so she wouldn\u2019t remember her dreams, she was too exhausted to put off the inevitable.</p><p>Lana turned on every light in her bedroom until it glowed with brightness. It helped ease the fear that clawed at her bely, but only a little. Caleb showing up and unearthing al those memories was going to make her nightmares worse. She was sure of it. She wanted to scream at him or put a gun to his head or whatever it took to make him leave, but in her heart, she knew it was too late. Even if he left now, the damage was done. The memories Caleb had stirred caused a wound to reopen, and she was going to have to go through the long, torturous process of letting it heal. Again.</p><p>Lana lay on her bed and curled up into a tight bal as she struggled not to cave in under the weight of her fear. This shouldn\u2019t be happening. Not now. Not after al this time and al her effort to make something of the shattered remains of her life. To forget what had happened.</p><p>She\u2019d worked so hard to get to this point. She\u2019d sacrificed everything\u2014her career, her fianc\u00e9, her friends, her money, and any hope of ever having a normal life. Al of that was gone, ripped away by the three longest, most horrible days in her life. And stil, she hadn\u2019t let it beat her. She\u2019d fought and struggled and forced herself to endure the pain of rehabilitation so that she could survive and do something meaningful with her life.</p><p>And now it was al spinning out of control, caving in around her. It was so fucking unfair that she choked on the rage weling up in her throat. She wanted to lash out and break something, but she didn\u2019t dare. Her control was stretched too thin to alow her to let go for even a moment. She had to get a grip on herself. There was too much work to do and not enough time or manpower to get it done. She feared that if her foundation crashed and burned, she\u2019d lose her last reason to keep going, to keep fighting off the pressure to give in to her terror and let it consume her.</p><p>It was a dark temptation to just let go. As close as she was hovering to the limits of her sanity, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to go over the edge. Just a short fal. She could colapse in on herself and let the world go away. She\u2019d almost done it once after the doctors had told her she\u2019d never walk again, probably never have children because the beatings had damaged her too badly. She could do it again and let the calm, black numbness embrace her.</p><p>It was so tempting she felt herself slip that much closer before she puled herself back, shocked that she\u2019d even consider giving in. People needed her. The kids needed her. She couldn\u2019t let them down. She\u2019d fight this threat with every ounce of effort she had left in her. There wasn\u2019t much strength left after al the fighting she\u2019d already done, but she had to try. It was the only way she could live with herself.</p> <p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>I n her nightmares it was always dark. Choking, thick darkness that crawled into her nose and mouth and filled her lungs with clotted, oily air. She couldn\u2019t see, but she could feel the cold metal pipe hammering against her ribs until they cracked. She could hear her own screams, high-pitched and gurgling wetly with the blood that filled her mouth. She was bound, helpless. She couldn\u2019t fight. She couldn\u2019t even move. Hard plastic bindings sliced through the skin on her wrists as she struggled to crawl away. It was futile. Her legs had been broken in so many places she couldn\u2019t even climb to her knees.</p><p>Pain swamped her body, a bone-deep, writhing, living pain that clawed through her blood with every terrified beat of her heart. She didn\u2019t believe that she could endure this much pain without dying. It didn\u2019t seem possible, but that was just one more cruel torture they had devised to punish her. They wanted her pain; they reveled in it.</p><p>They laughed when she screamed.</p><p>They were laughing now, and she realized in some distant sliver of her mind that remained sheltered and sane that it must mean she was screaming, even though she didn\u2019t know she had been. She\u2019d screamed so much for so long that it almost seemed as natural as breathing. But she didn\u2019t want to give them that pleasure, so she tried to be quiet. She tried to calm herself enough to pull in a decent breath. Her lungs were burning, and her heart was pounding way too hard. She couldn\u2019t think. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She panicked as the cold blackness closed in around her, swallowing her whole.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t fight it. She wasn\u2019t strong enough. She\u2019d been worn down too hard for too long, and there was no strength left to fight it anymore.</p><p>Then she felt Caleb\u2019s hand wrap around hers, a rough warmth of skin-to-skin contact. The heat tore through her, lashing out at the cold black claws of terror that were tugging her down. She focused on that warmth, knowing it had saved her before and it could again. She couldn\u2019t die if he was here. Not if he was here.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s low, insistent voice puled her from her nightmare. \u201cWake up, Lana. Come on. Wake up, honey. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>Her body trembled, but her breathing slowed until she could pul in a ful breath before it was hastily forced from her lungs. She was dimly aware of Caleb\u2019s low, calming voice muttering hushed tones of comfort against her temple. She felt his hard, hot body surrounding her. He was rocking her back and forth like a child, stroking her back with one hand while his other was clutched inside her death grip.</p><p>She could smel his skin, a hot, masculine scent, and remembered it from the day he\u2019d carried her out of the cave into the sunlight. He\u2019d saved her. She was safe.</p><p>Lana shuddered and relaxed against him. She was too tired to fight, but she didn\u2019t have to now. He was here and she could rest. He wouldn\u2019t let her die.</p><p>Caleb had risked his life countless times. He\u2019d jumped from planes in the dead of night into enemy territory. He\u2019d infiltrated buildings ful of men bristling with weapons and hatred. He\u2019d fought his way through war zones and felt bulets fly by so close they burned his skin. But he\u2019d never known true terror until he heard Lana\u2019s screams coming through the microphone on the camera he\u2019d planted in her apartment.</p><p>Adrenaline flooded his body, and he\u2019d busted open her front door, weapon in hand, before she had time to pul in a breath for her second scream. He raced to her bedroom to find it was brightly lit, every one of the many lamps blazing.</p><p>It took him only a brief instant to realize no one was in there with her and that she was just dreaming. Although just dreaming wasn\u2019t the right way to put what she was going through.</p><p>Her body writhed on the bed, wrapped in a cocoon of sheets and blankets. Sweat poured off her, wetting her hair and the colar of her oversized sleep shirt. Her head was thrown back, and her neck was stretched at an extreme angle, as if she were trying to get away from something.</p><p>Horrible, wailing sounds of terror weled from her mouth, and her face was streaked with tears.</p><p>Caleb puled her into his arms, covers and al, trying to wake her. He shook her and caled her name, but she was too caught up in the nightmare to hear him. Franticaly, he tried to drag her back into consciousness, squeezing her hand while he rocked her in his lap.</p><p>Something he\u2019d done must have helped, because she started to calm down. Her harsh breathing evened out, and she curled against him. \u201cCaleb.\u201d Her voice was groggy and rough from the strain of screaming. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me again.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure he heard her right. She sounded like she was stil half-asleep. She\u2019d asked him to stay, which meant she couldn\u2019t be thinking straight. But her words were too aluring for him to refuse. Maybe he was just hearing what he wanted to hear, but for now, that was enough.</p><p>He ran his hands over her bare arms and down her back, letting himself imagine that she actualy wanted his comfort. She was stil bathed in sweat, and as she relaxed, he could feel her skin roughen with cold. Caleb didn\u2019t even stop to think how she\u2019d react if she were awake. He just arranged her on the bed, puled up the covers to her neck, and moved his body against hers to keep her warm. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t thank him for the intimacy when she was awake, but in her sleep, she wiggled closer to him, seeking his warmth. After a few minutes, she was sleeping peacefuly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb let out a long breath and held her tight. Adrenaline subsided, leaving him shaking harder than he had since he went on his first real op before he was even old enough to drink legaly.</p><p>Her head was tucked under his chin, and he could feel her breath fanning out across his neck. Her tears left cool, wet spots on his T-shirt. The honeysuckle scent of her skin wafted between them, and Caleb dragged it into his lungs, praying it would calm his frayed nerves.</p><p>She was safe. Plagued with nightmares likely caused by PTSD, but safe.</p><p>Caleb cupped the back of her head in his palm while the other hand smoothed down her delicate spine over and over. She fit against him perfectly, and the feel of her soft curves under his hands was like coming home. For about half a second, he nearly alowed himself to think of her as a woman, al sweet and soft in his arms. But then he ruthlessly slaughtered that thought and cursed himself for being such a selfish ass.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t enough that he\u2019d nearly kiled her, or that he now had to come back into her life and make her relive her past\u2014he had to heap on a ful serving of dick-centered lust to go with it.</p><p>God, how could he be such a low-life scum?</p><p>He closed his eyes in regret, wishing that there wasn\u2019t a huge canyon of ugly past between them. It would have been so nice to alow himself to think of her as a woman rather than an assignment. He would have shucked his jeans and T-shirt, crawled under those covers with her, stripped her naked, and warmed her with the most primitive of methods. If the rest of her skin was as silky as her arms, it would be like stroking sunshine when he touched her. The urge to find out was almost too much to bear, but Caleb held back. She deserved his restraint. She deserved a hel of a lot more, but right now, restraint was al he had to offer.</p><p>Her lips pressed against his throat. Caleb\u2019s body clenched in a fit of pure animal lust. His jeans became uncomfortable, and his blood prowled in hot pulses through his veins. His fingers curled into soft flesh, and until then, he hadn\u2019t realized her hip was under his palm. Somehow, his hand had snaked under her blankets without his permission and was resting on her nearly naked flesh. Only a narrow strip of her cotton panties separated his hand from her skin. He relaxed his grip, and his fingertips grazed over her skin as he did so, causing his stomach muscles to tighten.</p><p>God, she was so soft and smeled sweet and womanly against him. He\u2019d always had a good sense of smel, and he knew that for the rest of his life, he\u2019d remember just how she smeled right now, lying al warm and trusting and sleeping in his arms.</p> <p>Her fingers slid up his chest and curled over the colar of his shirt. She had elegant hands. He remembered that from the hours he\u2019d spent holding them, wiling her to live.</p><p>He probably knew the texture of her skin better than he knew his own, and her fragile bones were so slender that he could hardly feel them laced between his fingers.</p><p>He had no right getting this close to her. Hel, he could probably rol over in his sleep and hurt her without even trying.</p><p>She let out a sigh, which moved her lips and breath over his throat in a soft caress.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s eyes slid shut, and he pushed his mind away from the physical feelings of his body. He\u2019d spent years learning to ignore pain, fatigue, and hunger. Certainly he could ignore his lust.</p><p>Slowly, with so much effort it was almost humorous, Caleb untangled his body from Lana\u2019s. If he stayed here holding her, he\u2019d do something he\u2019d regret. There was not a single doubt in his mind.</p> <p>Lana woke up slowly, fighting off the grogginess that often plagued her after a rough night. She stretched and roled over onto a patch of pilow that held a subtle, masculine scent\u2014a scent that brought back the memory of her dream last night. For the first time in months, she\u2019d had a good dream\u2014one in which Caleb had driven away her nightmares and held her in his arms. For a while, she\u2019d felt like a normal woman with normal desires.</p><p>She\u2019d actualy been happy, and it had been so long since she\u2019d last been happy, she\u2019d forgotten what that felt like.</p><p>The grogginess faded, but the scent of Caleb\u2019s skin was stil on the pilow. It hadn\u2019t just been a dream. He\u2019d actualy been there.</p><p>Which meant he\u2019d seen her at her worst, locked inside her nightmares.</p><p>Humiliation filed her stomach until she wanted to vomit. He\u2019d seen her in her lowest, most vulnerable state, helpless and screaming over things that were no longer real</p><p>\u2014things that were al in her head. Surely he\u2019d think she was a total mental case now, which, she supposed, wasn\u2019t far from the truth.</p><p>Her cheeks burned with shame, and she briefly thought about caling in sick so she wouldn\u2019t have to go to work. She couldn\u2019t face him today, not after last night. She\u2019d die of humiliation.</p><p>She heard the gurgle of her coffee pot, and a few seconds later she smeled it brewing. He was stil here, in her apartment. There was no avoiding him, even if she caled in sick. She had to face him one way or another. Preferably after she\u2019d showered and brushed her teeth.</p> <p>Lana pushed out of bed and raced to the bathroom too fast for him to stop her from getting there safely. Fifteen minutes later, she was clean and dreading seeing him even more than before. She should have gotten her humiliation over with first and enjoyed her shower.</p><p>Lana wrapped herself in a plaid flannel robe she\u2019d permanently borrowed from her father and bravely stepped out of the bathroom. He was sitting on her kitchen counter next to the coffee pot, reading her newspaper. He wore a white cotton T-shirt that blazed in comparison against the deeply tanned skin of his throat and arms. He looked up from the paper as she padded into the kitchen, suddenly feeling indecent wearing only a thin layer of body lotion and her father\u2019s huge bathrobe.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked, watching her with solemn black eyes.</p><p>Lana nodded, not trusting herself to speak when those feelings of shame were starting to swel again upon the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I helped myself to your paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not. I rarely have time to read it anymore, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He slid off the counter and stood to his ful height. He seemed to fil the kitchen with his large presence, nearly blocking out the overhead fluorescent lighting.</p><p>The memory of him carrying her out into the sun flashed in her mind, so potent and powerful that it made her sway. Lana gripped the counter behind her to steady herself and felt Caleb\u2019s hands wrap around her upper arms. His fingers were hard, hot bands that completely encircled her biceps, making her feel vulnerable and protected al at the same time. She had no idea how he did that, and it kept putting her off balance.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat something. You had a rough night.\u201d</p><p>Lana blinked up at him, trying to make sense of his words. \u201cRough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nightmares,\u201d he said in a bleak, harsh tone.</p><p>She felt her face heat with embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see that. They\u2019re not usualy so bad,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Rage flared in his eyes and tightened his jaw. His cheeks darkened with anger, and his hands tightened slightly around her arms. \u201cBulshit.\u201d</p><p>Lana shrugged, feeling the strength of his grip around her arms. She couldn\u2019t think straight when he was touching her. \u201cThink what you like. It\u2019s none of your business, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He cursed a low, violent word. \u201cI\u2019l take care of the door if you give me your landlord\u2019s name and number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe door?\u201d Lana hadn\u2019t even noticed until he\u2019d said something that her front door was lying in two splintered pieces against the hole it had once fit into. \u201cYou did that?</p><p>With or without the help of a battering ram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I heard you screaming and I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you thought. This never should have happened, and it wouldn\u2019t have if you\u2019d left like I asked you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done last night if I hadn\u2019t been here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe same thing I do every night. Get through it.\u201d She wished the words back into her mouth the second she saw his face darken.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you have those nightmares every night?\u201d He was so close she could see the golden brown flecks in his black eyes nestled against his pupils.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. Can\u2019t you get that through your head? I don\u2019t want your help.\u201d</p><p>His jaw bunched under the force of his clenched teeth. He released her arms and turned around, but not before she saw the look of hurt that crossed his hard features. The cloth of his shirt stretched to contain the thick layers of muscle over his ribs and along his spine. Lana\u2019s mouth went dry, and she couldn\u2019t help but stare. He was such a powerfuly built man, yet when he touched her, he was achingly gentle.</p><p>Lana rubbed her arms, trying to hold in the heat of his touch. Whether or not she wanted him here, there was something soothing in his touch\u2014something that calmed the parts of her soul that were constantly screaming in fear.</p><p>He turned back around a moment later, looking solemn and calm once more. His gaze fel to her hands, which were stil futilely trying to hold the memory of his touch. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She let her arms fal hastily to her sides and felt that embarrassed flush rise up her throat again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He took her arm and shoved the loose sleeve of her robe up to her shoulder. There was not a sign that he\u2019d even touched her. Not even a pink mark of irritation, just pale, naked skin.</p><p>His nostrils flared, and his fingertips just barely grazed along her arm.</p><p>Lana shivered in a purely feminine reaction, and Caleb\u2019s gaze shot up to meet hers. She was sure he could see every bit of her feelings about him in her face\u2014every bit of solace his touch gave her, every sliver of calm he offered, every single horrible memory he dredged up with his presence. He just kept looking, making her feel stripped bare of al her secrets.</p><p>Those golden slivers in his eyes widened, outlining the sudden dilation of his pupils. Then his thick black lashes lowered, veiling his eyes as he went about the job of checking her other arm for damage.</p><p>When he was satisfied that she was whole, he stepped back, and in that single step, he put an entire world of distance between them. His emotions vanished, and he donned the mask of professionalism so easily it left Lana reeling, wondering if she\u2019d seen anything at al in his eyes.</p><p>Caleb slugged down his coffee, poured another cup, and finished that one off, too. Even though it burned al the way down, it was much cooler than the blood pumping through his veins.</p><p>God, he wanted Lana.</p><p>He knew he shouldn\u2019t want her. He figured his attraction to her was just a cruel joke of fate, but he wasn\u2019t laughing.</p><p>It was al he could do not to rip that oversized robe off her and run his hands over every bit of the naked skin beneath. And he knew for a fact that she\u2019d been naked under that robe, too. He could smel her body al warm from her shower, the lotion she\u2019d smoothed onto her skin, and the subtle, womanly scent that was al her own.</p><p>When he\u2019d touched her, she\u2019d blushed. He wasn\u2019t sure whether it was out of anger or embarrassment or desire, but he knew which he wanted it to be. He\u2019d wanted to part the lapels of that droopy robe and see just how far down her chest that blush went. He\u2019d bet his last dolar that it would go al the way down to cover her smal, high breasts and her tight little nipples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He congratulated himself for being strong and not jumping her. It hadn\u2019t been easy to resist her when he\u2019d known she\u2019d just as soon slit his throat as speak to him, but now that he had a sliver of doubt about her feelings toward him\u2014a faint hope that she might feel even a tenth of the desire he did\u2014it was going to be impossible.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Lana\u2019s landlord, Mr. Simmons, showed up just before Lana left for work. Caleb stayed behind to deal with her broken door rather than leave her apartment open and unguarded.</p><p>Mr. Simmons was a potbelied man in his sixties with a ring of white hair orbiting the back of his bald head. He greeted Caleb with a firm handshake and a smile. \u201cGood to see Lana\u2019s found herself a man.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb saw no point in correcting Mr. Simmons. \u201cBeen a long time for her, huh?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons went around to the back of his truck and began loosening the ropes that held Lana\u2019s new door in place. \u201cI\u2019m not the kind to snoop, but I try to keep an eye on the little lady, seeing as how she\u2019s al alone out here. I\u2019ve never seen her with a man before you.\u201d</p><p>A fierce little spurt of satisfaction made Caleb smile. He hopped up into the back of the truck and finished freeing the door. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know someone\u2019s been watching out for her.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons shook his white head. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t make it easy, that\u2019s for sure. I keep teling her she should move back home with her folks again until she\u2019s wel enough to be on her own.\u201d</p><p>Caleb lifted the pre-hung door out of the truck and eased it onto the ground. \u201cWhat do you mean? She seems healthy enough to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, her body is fine, I\u2019m talking about the rest of her.\u201d Mr. Simmons tapped his temple. \u201cThe poor girl needs therapy. I\u2019ve seen the same kind of thing in a couple of my buddies who fought in \u2019Nam. I don\u2019t know a lot about what happened to her, but I know it had to have been bad.\u201d</p><p>Caleb turned away before Mr. Simmons could see the look of anger he felt on his face. The idea of Lana suffering the same way war veterans did made a lot of sense.</p><p>Too much for his peace of mind. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who broke down the door trying to get to her. I figure you heard the screams.\u201d</p><p>Helpless rage clenched his gut at the reminder of those screams. He picked up the heavy door by himself, needing a physical outlet to vent some of his anger. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons nodded and folowed Caleb with a toolbox in hand. \u201cIt\u2019s why I had to move her out to this empty building. She was in one of the units I\u2019d just renovated, but her neighbors kept complaining about the noise. We had the cops out here six times in three weeks. I tried to get her to go back home, or to get some help, but she refused, so I put her out here in this building that I\u2019ve emptied so it can be renovated next. Once the renovation is done, though . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019l have to leave.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons nodded. \u201cI hate to kick the girl out, but I have to make a living. I\u2019ve already put off the renovation longer than I should have, trying to give her some time to heal, but apparently it hasn\u2019t helped.\u201d</p><p>Caleb set the new door against the outside wal of Lana\u2019s apartment and surveyed the old one lying in pieces. \u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning on moving in with her, maybe? Maybe it\u2019s nosy of me to ask, but I figure that if she\u2019s got someone there at night, maybe her nightmares wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p><p>\u201d</p><p>The idea of being able to help Lana with something as simple as his presence was a strong lure, but Caleb knew it was just wishful thinking. Even if she did let him into her life in such an intimate way, chances were his presence would just make things worse by reminding her of what had happened.</p><p>Then again, she had quieted last night when he\u2019d held her. Maybe the old man wasn\u2019t completely wrong. \u201cLana\u2019s a bit independent,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>Mr. Simmons let out a bark of laughter that made the shirt over his potbely gape open around the buttons. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying the sun\u2019s a bit bright.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you do know her pretty wel, huh?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons puled out a crowbar and went to work puling the frame off the doorway. \u201cAbout as wel as anyone, I suppose. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of people in her life, from what I\u2019ve seen. Her folks go to church with me, and her father worries about her something fierce. He\u2019s told me a little bit about what she\u2019s gone through, but I don\u2019t think even he knows the whole story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to protect him from the truth,\u201d said Caleb before he thought better. Instinctively, he knew it was true. Lana was not the type of woman to dump her problems onto her friends and family. She\u2019d shoulder the burden herself rather than bring them down with her.</p><p>Caleb wondered if she\u2019d even told them enough to alow them to help her.</p><p>\u201cHel of a thing for a father, though\u2014to want to help your little girl, but not know how,\u201d said Mr. Simmons.</p><p>Caleb needed to know how much Lana had shared with her family. Maybe that was the key to finding out if she was hiding something or if she was in danger. \u201cHow much do you know about what happened to her?\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons lowered the crowbar and ripped off a section of molding with his rough hands. \u201cJust what her father told me one night after a few beers. She went to Armenia with some do-good group that was hoping to help out there. She was supposed to teach art classes to kids or something. I\u2019m not exactly sure. Something went wrong, and she was taken hostage by a terrorist group. They held her and a bunch of other Americans for three days, beat her up pretty bad, but she was the lucky one. The others al died.\u201d</p><p>The facts were right, but only in the same way as it was a fact that the ocean was wet. It was a hel of a lot more than that, but Caleb didn\u2019t feel the need to expand on what the man knew. \u201cI\u2019m not sure she\u2019d agree about being the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Simmons gave a slow, grim nod. \u201cThat\u2019s just what my buddy who survived \u2019Nam said.\u201d</p><p>Lana saw Stacie\u2019s car in the parking lot and knew she\u2019d lost the race again. Man, but that woman got into work early. One of these days, Lana was going to win their contest to see who could show up first, but only if she didn\u2019t sleep at al.</p><p>Lana parked her car and went into the office, expecting to smel coffee brewing and hear Stacie singing off tune along with her MP3 player. Instead, the office was silent.</p><p>The lights were al out. Papers littered the floor.</p><p>The place looked like it had been ransacked.</p><p>Lana stood there in shocked silence, trying to understand what she saw. Then she heard a low moan coming from the bathroom at the back of the office and her shock turned to terror. She raced back to the bathroom to find Stacie lying on the floor. Blood soaked her crisp yelow shirt and pooled under her slim body. More blood trickled from a smal wound on her head.</p><p>Lana cried out in anguish as she bent down to see if Stacie was stil alive. At Lana\u2019s touch, she moaned again but didn\u2019t move. Panic seized Lana\u2019s heart, and a flood of fears and memories flickered through her mind until her brain was clogged with a jumble of horrible images of blood and pain. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she heard herself chanting, \u201cNo, no, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLana?\u201d whispered Stacie, puling Lana out of her frozen panic and spurring her into action.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, sweetie. Don\u2019t move. I\u2019l be right back.\u201d Lana sprinted for the cordless phone, ripped her T-shirt over her head, and dialed 911.</p><p>The emergency operator picked up while Lana was folding her shirt into a thick pad, her voice calm in the midst of the chaos. \u201cNine-one-one. Please state your emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need an ambulance. My friend\u2019s been hurt. Shot, I think.\u201d Her voice was tight with fear, but clear enough to make out, thank God. She repeated the address and threw the phone down despite the operator\u2019s request that she stay on the line.</p><p>Lana pressed the folded T-shirt against the wound in Stacie\u2019s side, making her hiss in pain.</p><p>\u201cI know it hurts,\u201d she told Stacie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetie, but I\u2019ve got to stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Stacie started to come around. Her skin was ghostly pale, her voice weak. \u201cI told him he could take whatever he wanted. I wouldn\u2019t have tried to stop him. He didn\u2019t have to shoot me.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s heart broke open, bleeding tears of guilt. \u201cShhh. Try not to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything here worth stealing,\u201d said Stacie in a pained voice.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetie. I know. Just lie stil.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to take an eternity for the ambulance to arrive. Sirens wailed in the distance, coming ever closer, but not close enough. Lana wiled them to hurry as she watched blood seep slowly through her T-shirt, turning it red.</p><p>A few moments later, the door swung open with a merry tinkle of bels. \u201cBack here,\u201d she shouted.</p><p>A pair of EMTs came hustling back, loaded down with gear. Lana backed out of the bathroom to give them room to work. She just stood there, her hands and clothes covered in blood, watching them work. She was helpless, trapped, out of control.</p><p>Her friend was dying, and there was nothing Lana could do.</p><p>Caleb saw the flashing lights in front of Lana\u2019s office while he was stuck at a traffic light. There were several police cars. An ambulance.</p><p>Panic iced over his insides, and he felt himself slip into battle mode\u2014that space where time slowed down and emotions were put on hold. He couldn\u2019t let himself feel anything right now. Not until he knew Lana was safe.</p><p>The light turned green, but al the entrances to Lana\u2019s office building were blocked by patrol cars. Caleb drove his car over the curb and parked in the grass on a steep incline. He had just jumped out of his car when he saw them wheel a gurney out of Lana\u2019s office. A woman\u2019s slim body was on it. She was wheeled out feet first, and for a moment, al Caleb could see was blood.</p><p>That cold inside him hardened and began to splinter.</p><p>A swarm of cops had gathered, and the sound of radio communication buzzed in the air. A policeman stepped in his path, but Caleb just shoved him out of his way without a thought. \u201cLana!\u201d he roared.</p><p>Nearly every head turned, but Caleb didn\u2019t care. He raced toward the gurney. \u201cLana!\u201d</p><p>He was close enough now to see them loading Stacie onto the ambulance. Not Lana. Stacie. A second later, Lana came out of the office. She was shirtless, wearing only a modest bra, and blood soaked her jeans from the knees down, but her walk was smooth, and Caleb knew then that it wasn\u2019t her blood.</p><p>That ice inside him shattered. He hadn\u2019t failed Lana again. She was alive.</p><p>She stood there, brittle with tension and deathly pale, smeared with blood. He saw her try to straighten her spine and lift her chin\u2014saw her try to regain her composure</p><p>\u2014but it wasn\u2019t fooling him. Inside she was sobbing.</p><p>Caleb crossed the space between them, ignoring repeated questions about his business here from the surrounding officers. None of them dared to stop him physicaly. He reached Lana and, without asking permission, took her into his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCaleb, I\u2014\u201d Her voice broke, so he saved her pride.</p><p>\u201cJust hush and let me hold you a minute,\u201d he told her. Her arms wrapped around him in a tentative hug, and then she gripped him hard as if afraid he\u2019d let go.</p><p>He just held her, her lithe body pressed fuly against his from chest to knees. He felt the soft mounds of her breasts flatten against his ribs and the warm rush of her breath over his skin. Her mouth was nestled just above his heart, and he could hear low, fervent words spiling from her lips, even though he couldn\u2019t kick his brain into functioning enough to understand them.</p><p>He bowed his head over hers, pressing his lips against the top of her head to mumble incoherent, soothing words into the silky strands. She smeled so good. And she was safe.</p> <p>Lana shuddered against him as if soaking up his heat, and it was al Caleb could do not to pick her up and carry her off somewhere private where she could cry in peace while he held her.</p><p>She sniffed and puled away enough that there was room for air to swirl between their bodies. Sweat had gathered along Caleb\u2019s ribs, and it cooled as it evaporated in the slow morning breeze.</p><p>Lana wiped her face with her hands and then wiped her hands on her thighs. Dried blood stained the skin between her fingers. Her nose was pink, and her blue eyes were luminous from her tears. Caleb just stared into her eyes, losing himself in their blue depths. It was like flying over a tropical ocean, seeing the varying shades of blue as the depth of the water changed. Her irises went from the palest silver blue near her pupils to a deep indigo around the rim. Her lashes were a thick black fringe that needed no help from cosmetics to add to their lushness.</p><p>Caleb realized he was stil holding her. He took a deep breath and puled his hands away quickly, like ripping a bandage off of hairy skin. Not touching her hurt a hel of a lot worse, though.</p><p>She gathered herself, and Caleb began to realize they had an audience. Mostly men.</p> <p>Caleb stripped his shirt off and puled it over Lana\u2019s head to cover her breasts. As lovely as the sight was, he didn\u2019t like sharing it with the other officers present.</p><p>She snaked her arms through the sleeves. \u201cThanks. I had to use my shirt as a bandage. There was so much blood.\u201d Her voice broke, but she held together.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s gut twisted at the pain vibrating in her tone. He puled her back up against him, unable to let her stand there and hurt without offering his comfort. His touch. Lana didn\u2019t resist, and he knew then just how desperate she had to be if she was wiling to take comfort from him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not finished interviewing Miss Hancock,\u201d said a detective, whose role was given away by his inexpensive suit and tie. His hazel eyes roamed over Caleb as if categorizing him in an instant. He had a muscular build and the kind of posture that told Caleb he knew how to use it. The name on his badge read Jacob Hart.</p><p>\u201cI told you everything I know,\u201d she said as if she\u2019d already repeated it twenty times. \u201cI came in, saw the place was a wreck, heard Stacie in the bathroom, then . . .\u201d Her voice broke again, but she puled in a deep breath and continued on. \u201cI caled nine-one-one, and then you showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Stacie say anything?\u201d asked the detective.</p> <p>\u201cJust something about how she would have let him take whatever he wanted. He didn\u2019t have to shoot her.\u201d She turned to Caleb. \u201cSomeone shot Stacie.\u201d</p><p>Caleb smoothed a hand over her shiny brown hair. \u201cI know, honey. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have been there earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have stopped him, either, Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if I\u2019d shown up earlier\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d be the one lying on that gurney right now, miss,\u201d said Detective Hart, gently.</p><p>Lana\u2019s eyes darted toward the concrete, but not before Caleb could read the thought that passed through them\u2014one that he\u2019d had a thousand times while sitting next to Lana\u2019s hospital bed. She would have done anything to trade places with Stacie.</p><p>\u201cI need to go to the hospital,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, but we have just a few more questions,\u201d said the detective.</p><p>Caleb felt Lana\u2019s body tighten, and the urge to protect her\u2014even from a few questions\u2014was overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough questions for now,\u201d stated Caleb in the voice he used to command other men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we have to go over this just one more time,\u201d said the detective, unfazed.</p><p>Caleb took a step forward and put on his intimidation face. He didn\u2019t use it often, since his size was usualy more than enough to get nearly anyone to cooperate, but on the rare occasions that he needed to, he knew how to make another man back down. This was just one of those occasions.</p><p>He gave the detective a smile that was mostly just a baring of teeth and dropped his voice until the detective had to strain to hear him. \u201cI\u2019m taking Lana to the hospital to check on her friend. You may speak to her later today, if she\u2019s up to it. If not, she\u2019l talk with you again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2019s eyes slid to the dog tags hanging over Caleb\u2019s bare chest, then to the tattoo on his arm. \u201cActive duty?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on leave,\u201d he lied.</p><p>A flash of keen inteligence lit up Detective Hart\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re both free to go as long as you stay in town. We\u2019l finish here and let you know when you\u2019re alowed back in the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>Caleb was pretty sure that thanking him was a bit premature. Whatever Detective Hart was, he wasn\u2019t stupid, and he was letting them go, which meant he had another plan for getting the information he wanted.</p><p>Uploaded by Coral</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Jacob Hart wrote down the name and number he\u2019d read off Caleb\u2019s dog tags. He stil had a few buddies in the army that could help him use that bit of information to figure out who this giant was. His gut told him that he had nothing to do with the shooting this morning, but it also told him that something more was going on here than just a simple robbery gone bad.</p><p>Nothing of value had been touched. The little metal box containing a few bucks of petty cash was sitting out in plain sight. The CD player by the coffee pot was untouched, as was the MP3 player on one of the desks. The only thing that had been rummaged through was paperwork, and something about that nagged at him.</p><p>Jacob went back into the office, careful not to get in the way of the officers and techs colecting evidence. One of the men was sawing away a section of drywal to retrieve the spent round. With any luck, it would be in good enough shape for a balistics match\u2014assuming they had anything to match it to.</p><p>Jacob let his vision blur and just stared at the scene. White paper nearly carpeted the floor. It was everywhere. On each of the two desks was a stack of spiral notebooks.</p><p>Why were they stil stacked when everything else was a mess? Had the ladies who worked here left them like that?</p><p>Jacob wrote down the question so he\u2019d remember to ask it later.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jacob,\u201d said one of the uniformed officers. \u201cFound something.\u201d</p><p>Jacob crossed the room, trying not to step on any of the trash. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The officer held up a little bit of plastic and metal. It almost looked like a broken piece of circuitry from the inside of a computer or something. It was thin, black, and no larger than the tip of his little finger. Jacob snapped on a rubber glove and took the tiny thing. A slim, short wire poked out of the back, and next to it was a thin adhesive pad.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d</p><p>The officer motioned to the picture hanging behind the coffee pot. It was one of those cheesy motivational posters that offices everywhere used. This one showed a picture of an astronaut floating in space high above the earth, al alone. The caption read, \u201cCourage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the poster?\u201d asked Jacob.</p><p>\u201cOn the frame, along the top.\u201d</p><p>Where it wouldn\u2019t be noticed. Jacob took another look at the device and suddenly knew what it was. A listening device.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Lana hated hospitals. They made her want to curl up into herself, or run away or throw up, or maybe al three at the same time. The sterile stink burned her nose, but she ignored it. Stacie had been taken into surgery immediately upon her arrival. That had been three hours earlier, and Lana was wearing a hole in the carpet of the waiting area.</p><p>Caleb had disappeared a few minutes ago and Lana tried not to freak out. Ever since she\u2019d seen him walking toward her this morning, belowing her name like he was afraid something had happened to her, Lana had been grateful that he\u2019d come barging back into her life. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of facing this alone, and there was no way she was going to cal her family. Not after what had happened to Stacie. Caleb\u2019s arrival being folowed closely by the shooting couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. Whoever had escaped Caleb\u2019s men in Armenia had found her. It was safest if she kept as much distance as possible between herself and everyone she loved.</p><p>Caleb came back bearing a steaming cup of coffee and some cheese crackers from the vending machine. He didn\u2019t bother to try to make her sit down or be calm like her mother would have. He let her walk out her worry and frustration without scolding her for fidgeting.</p><p>Lana took the coffee but turned down the crackers. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something I can get you to eat? Worry and coffee on an empty stomach aren\u2019t such a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a little while.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded. He didn\u2019t ask her any stupid questions like whether she was okay. He just stayed there, silent and strong, ready to support her in any way she wanted.</p><p>It was such a precious gift it nearly made her start crying again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know her, but he seemed to somehow know just what she needed. Then again, in his line of work, maybe this was normal for him.</p><p>On the way to the hospital, he\u2019d puled a clean shirt from the luggage in his car and covered his bare chest. She stil wore his old shirt, which hung loosely on her but kept her from causing a scandal in the gift shop. The scent of his skin was with her constantly now, somehow helping to ease some of her tension.</p><p>He sat down to watch her pace, and after a few minutes, finaly, Lana felt like resting herself. She sat down next to him and sipped her coffee. Caleb\u2019s arm draped over the back of her chair without touching her\u2014offering support without forcing it on her. She could lean back and let him touch her or stay upright and know he wouldn\u2019t push.</p><p>She wanted to lean back into his embrace, and she didn\u2019t even care that it made her weak to need his touch. She was at her limit and would do whatever it took to be strong for Stacie, even if it meant taking comfort from a man she should have distanced herself from.</p><p>They sat in silence, his strong arm so near, her body frozen in indecision. He didn\u2019t ask anything of her, nor did he try to push her. He let her take what she needed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d wailed a voice that made Lana flinch. She turned to see who had just walked into the waiting room, praying it was someone else\u2019s mother.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>Madeline Hancock raced across the room, streaks of mascara running down her cheeks. Her dark hair was just starting to turn noticeably gray, and even though she was past fifty, she had the skin of a woman half her age. Madeline was a crier. She always had been, and every time Lana cried, she knew she took one step closer to becoming just like her mother. It was enough to make Lana want to have her tear ducts surgicaly closed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby, are you okay?\u201d asked Madeline. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in blood.\u201d</p><p>Lana decided not to go into detail about how the blood got there.

I caled your office and kept caling until the police answered and told me you were safe.\u201d Madeline puled Lana in for a tight hug, and despite knowing how this scare would make her mother overreact, a hug from Mom felt good. \u201cSit down, honey. You shouldn\u2019t be on your feet at a time like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy feet are fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense. I know how much your legs ache when you overdo. Sit.\u201d</p><p>Lana puled in a deep breath in an effort not to take off her mother\u2019s head with the scathing remarks leaping behind her sealed lips.</p><p>\u201cI bet you haven\u2019t eaten anything today, either. Let me take you home and make you some nice soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStacie is in surgery and you want me to go have soup?\u201d Lana asked her mother.</p><p>\u201cYou have to keep your strength up if you want to be of any use to her at al.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy strength is fine. I don\u2019t need to sit and I don\u2019t need soup. Just stop, okay?\u201d</p><p>Madeline gave Lana a disapproving frown that made Lana feel like a child. \u201cYou\u2019re upset. You\u2019l feel better if you just rest for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l feel better if you just leave. Let me deal with this on my own. Please, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Madeline pretended not to hear the plea in Lana\u2019s voice. \u201cYou should have caled me earlier. You need a cel phone, Lana. You had me scared half to death.\u201d</p><p>Lana realized that her mother\u2019s fear was driving her now, and she couldn\u2019t blame her for being worried. Lana might have been the one hurt in Armenia, but Madeline had to watch her suffer through a mother\u2019s eyes. That couldn\u2019t have been easy. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this. I can\u2019t afford one right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me buy you one.\u201d</p> <p>Lana closed her eyes in an effort to gather her patience. \u201cMom, please. Not now. Stacie is in surgery, and I just can\u2019t deal with you, too.\u201d</p><p>The hurt look on Mom\u2019s face made Lana feel like she\u2019d just kicked a dog. \u201cNo one\u2019s asking you to deal with me. I came here to support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. You should go home and make sure Dad knows I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Madeline patted Lana\u2019s arm. \u201cYou can come with me. After a scare like this, you should come stay with us for a few days.\u201d</p><p>It had taken Lana months to get out of the house the last time, and she wasn\u2019t strong enough for that kind of battle again. As far as her mother was concerned, Lana should just come live at home permanently, because she was too weak to live on her own. \u201cThank you, but I\u2019l be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You shouldn\u2019t have to be alone at a time like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d said Lana before she could stop the words from coming out of her mouth. Too late now.</p><p>Lana motioned to where Caleb sat a few feet away watching them silently. \u201cMom, this is Caleb. He\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d A lie, but a necessary one. She couldn\u2019t let her mother get involved. It wasn\u2019t safe.</p> <p>Madeline\u2019s blue eyes narrowed. \u201cA friend or a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Caleb stood up to his impressive height and stepped over to them, offering Madeline his hand. \u201cJust a friend, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Madeline\u2019s expression turned from skeptical to speculative, and Lana realized her mistake. If Mom couldn\u2019t control Lana\u2019s life, a husband was the next best candidate.</p><p>That\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t given up hope that Lana and Oran would patch things up.</p><p>Lana was sure that in Madeline\u2019s eyes, Caleb had gone from friend to boyfriend to husband in the blink of an eye.</p><p>\u201cYou should come over for dinner tonight,\u201d invited Madeline.</p><p>\u201cMom, now isn\u2019t a good time,\u201d said Lana. \u201cI need to be here for Stacie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen she\u2019s better, then,\u201d replied Madeline, stil addressing Caleb. \u201cYou can come over and meet the family. We\u2019l have a cookout, and Lana\u2019s father can show off his new roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cNo promises, Mom,\u201d said Lana before Caleb could make any. He had no idea what he was dealing with\u2014that in Madeline\u2019s mind, they were probably already engaged by now. \u201cMaybe after the fundraiser I\u2019l have some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should make time for your family, Lana. We\u2019re al you have now.\u201d</p><p>That was not true. She also had Stacie and the foundation. And the kids. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time. I\u2019l cal you later, as soon as we know about Stacie\u2019s condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re asking me to leave.\u201d</p><p>Lana puled in a deep breath. Aside from the fact that she realy couldn\u2019t deal with her mother\u2019s wel-intended interference, the less she was around her family, the safer they\u2019d be. She couldn\u2019t forget that. \u201cI am. I\u2019l be fine. There\u2019s no sense in you spending your day here. You hardly even know Stacie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for her, Lana. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Lana wanted to say that she didn\u2019t need her, but that was too cruel and hurtful. Instead she settled for, \u201cCaleb is here with me. I\u2019l be fine.\u201d</p><p>As if trying to help her prove it, Caleb looped his thick arm over her shoulders and puled her against his side. \u201cI\u2019l keep an eye on her for you,\u201d he told Madeline.</p><p>Lana was too shocked to move. She just stood there, soaking in his heat. And it felt good being inside his embrace. Too good. Caleb\u2019s comfort was something she could get used to in a hurry, and that was a dangerous thing to her hard-won independence.</p><p>Madeline looked from Lana to Caleb, and that speculative light flared in her eyes. \u201cI suppose you two have this handled. You\u2019l cal if you need me?\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Madeline hugged Lana, making Caleb step back and take his warm comfort with him. It felt strange being swept from one set of arms to another, and Lana gave herself permission to enjoy something so rare.</p><p>Madeline repeated the motherly hug with Caleb, who took it like a man, smiling down indulgently at the top of Madeline\u2019s head. \u201cYou take good care of my baby girl,\u201d she told Caleb in a firm tone.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d He gave her a solemn nod.</p><p>\u201cCal me tonight or I\u2019m coming to stay at your place. A mother can only take so much worry,\u201d said Madeline.</p><p>\u201cI wil, Mom. See you later.\u201d</p><p>Madeline left, wiping a new set of tears from her cheeks, and infuriatingly, Lana felt an answering sting in her own eyes. Despite Madeline\u2019s interference, Lana loved her.</p><p>\u201cSomething tels me that there isn\u2019t a force on this planet that would keep that woman away if you needed her,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d warned Lana. \u201cShe was looking at you like you were prime son-in-law material.\u201d</p><p>Lana expected a look of surprise or horror to cross his face, but instead he just gave her a level stare. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know who I am, does she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best that way. Mom wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the truth.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but before he had time, a man in rumpled scrubs pushed through the double doors, heading straight for Lana.</p><p>She surged toward him, her fingers twisting together with nerves. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you family?\u201d asked the man.</p><p>\u201cThe closest thing Stacie\u2019s got. She works for me.\u201d</p><p>That seemed enough to satisfy him, and he ran an elegant surgeon\u2019s hand through his messy hair. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay. There was some bleeding, but we got it under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s stil in recovery. When we move her to a room in a few hours, then you can see her.\u201d</p><p>Lana felt hot tears of relief wel up in her eyes, and she blinked hard to hold them back. \u201cThank you for saving her.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon gave her a charming smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. Now, you look like you could use a bit of cleanup yourself,\u201d he said, looking down at her bloody jeans. \u201cGo home and get a shower, get a meal. Come back in four hours. No sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay,\u201d she told him.</p><p>The surgeon\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cHow do you think she\u2019s going to feel if she wakes up to see you covered in her blood?\u201d</p><p>Lana hadn\u2019t thought about it that way. She just hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Stacie alone.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do for her now. Go home.\u201d He looked up at Caleb for support. \u201cShe realy should go home and clean up.\u201d</p><p>Lana almost told him that she\u2019d make up her own mind, but she didn\u2019t have the energy for a pointless squabble. \u201cWil you cal if she wakes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it wil take to get you to leave, sure.\u201d</p><p>Lana gave him her number and left the hospital with Caleb by her side. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Lana repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Caleb agreed.</p><p>\u201cI almost kiled her.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her, a fierce frown on his face. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. You can\u2019t think like that.\u201d</p><p>Lana swalowed hard to dislodge the lump of guilt in her throat. \u201cShe\u2019s my employee. My responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a grown woman who makes her own decisions. You can\u2019t control her any more than you could those terrorists.\u201d</p><p>Lana flinched as if she\u2019d been hit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to control her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hold yourself responsible for something out of your control,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it wasn\u2019t out of my control? What if I caused this?\u201d</p><p>Caleb puled her to a halt. The summer heat beat down on her head, and out here in the sun, she could see those golden chips in Caleb\u2019s eyes clearly. He had amazing eyes. So dark they were black in al but the brightest light, where they were a rich, mink brown.</p><p>\u201cHow could you have caused this?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you ask that guy to shoot her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me how this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s eyes slid away from his. She didn\u2019t want him to see her thoughts\u2014didn\u2019t want him to know that she was hiding something from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulshit. What aren\u2019t you teling me?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being paranoid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cParanoid is just another word for cautious if there\u2019s a reason for it. Is there a reason for it, Lana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tel me. You\u2019re the one who showed up teling me I might be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur history together proves otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He jerked as if she\u2019d slapped him, and then his face went hard. Expressionless. \u201cHate me al you want. I\u2019m stil not going anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had to stop by the apartment-complex office to pick up the keys to Lana\u2019s new door, but Caleb was pleased by the sturdy steel barrier and deadbolt. At least this door would take some effort to break through. Her windows were another story, but he\u2019d take what he could get.</p><p>Caleb pocketed the spare key, which Lana didn\u2019t even notice. It was just one more sign how thinly she\u2019d been stretched today. He waited for her to start the shower before he caled Monroe.</p><p>\u201cWe had an incident today,\u201d he told the colonel.</p><p>\u201cI heard. Seems Detective Jacob Hart has done a little snooping into your records.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you let him see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe public stuff. The honors and commendations. I think he\u2019s got a crush.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave an amused grunt. \u201cI\u2019m sure. Be careful with that one. He\u2019s smart.\u201d</p><p>Monroe offered a noise of acknowledgment. \u201cI heard about the woman being shot. Did she make it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We\u2019re going back to the hospital to see her soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFind out what happened. The police weren\u2019t able to get much out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l try. She took a blow to the head, so I don\u2019t know how much she\u2019l remember,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cOne thing is for sure. That shooting was no coincidence.\u201d</p><p>Monroe grunted in agreement. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer office was bugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d growled Caleb, feeling his muscles tighten.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t cheap tech, either. Professional stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you want to proceed?\u201d asked Monroe.</p><p>\u201cI have some names of people she works with who need background checks. A list of license-plate numbers from cars that drove by her office too many times. I\u2019d like to see if Stacie has any background of her own that might be to blame for her shooting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend the info via e-mail and I\u2019l take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Lana regretted losing the comfort of Caleb\u2019s shirt, but it didn\u2019t make sense for her to keep it now that she had her own clothes to wear. After she showered and dressed, she folded it back up, tossed her bloody jeans in the trash\u2014no way was she ever wearing them again\u2014and went out into the living room.</p><p>Caleb had rummaged in her fridge and thrown together some sandwiches. \u201cI thought you might want to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She grabbed a plate and went to the living room to sit down. There wasn\u2019t enough room for a table in her kitchen, and she\u2019d gotten so used to eating in front of the TV that she hardly thought about it anymore.</p> <p>Caleb folowed her and sat on the other end of the couch. She placed his shirt between them. \u201cThanks for the loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of those blasted cops should have done the same thing. Guess they just liked looking a little too much.\u201d</p><p>His big body was sprawled out, his long legs crossed at the ankle. Tight denim covered his thick thighs, and it was al Lana could do not to stare.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t so much as had a spark of attraction for anyone since Armenia. There was simply nothing left of her to spare on a relationship. But as she stared at him, she felt something long dead come back to life\u2014some deeply feminine part of her that took notice of things like thick, powerful legs. She should have been too worried about Stacie to even think such thoughts, a realization that doused her little spurt of longing with a dose of guilt.</p><p>Lana finished eating. \u201cI need to get back to the hospital. Can you take me to get my car? The police are probably finished blocking off the parking lot by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a nap or something? The doc said it would be a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Lana looked up at him. \u201cIs that what you did when I was in the hospital? Did you go home and sleep? Because to me, it felt like you were there the whole time.\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked away and took a drink of water. It was a delay tactic, and she knew it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you knew I\u2019d been there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI heard you. Saw you.\u201d She\u2019d felt his hand stroke hers so she knew she wasn\u2019t alone even when she\u2019d been too weak to open her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou saw me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOnce. After you\u2019d shaved.\u201d Miles Gentry had a bushy beard that obscured much of his face, but Caleb\u2019s jaw was smooth, only shadowed by the midnight stubble just beneath his skin. Just like it was right now.</p><p>\u201cYou remember seeing me even though you were ful of pain meds and barely conscious?\u201d</p><p>She wished those drugs had done a better job of obscuring her memory. Her life would have been a lot easier if she didn\u2019t have those memories of him caring about her to muddy the waters. Hatred was so much easier.</p><p>\u201cI have a good memory for faces, and yours stuck, because at that moment, I hated you,\u201d she admitted quietly.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth hardened and his voice went gruff. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Lana heard the sound of self-loathing in his tone, and she knew he was thinking about the seven people that died beside her in that cave. She knew because she spent a lot of time thinking about them, too, wondering why she was stil alive and they weren\u2019t. What made her so special?</p><p>\u201cSurvivor\u2019s guilt\u201d was what the doctors caled it, but naming it didn\u2019t make it any easier to live with. Didn\u2019t make it go away.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just let me die?\u201d she asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d lost everyone else in that cave. I didn\u2019t want to lose you, too. You were al so young, trying to do good. I should have found a way to save everyone.\u201d</p><p>What could she say to a confession like that? Words held no value, so she reached out her hand and placed it on his much larger one in an attempt to offer what comfort she could. The blind leading the blind, maybe, but it was al she had to offer.</p><p>His hand was deeply tanned, in contrast to her sun-deprived skin, and so incredibly warm. Little scars dotted the flesh here and there but didn\u2019t detract from their masculine beauty. She imagined he\u2019d earned every one of those scars fighting to protect others. Maybe there was even one there to mark the day he puled her out of that cave after kiling the man who had hurt her.</p><p>From the depth of his silence, she sensed his guilt, his suffering, and she didn\u2019t want that for him. Maybe things hadn\u2019t worked out so wel for her, but it wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>She knew in her heart he was a good man. A noble hero. He\u2019d saved countless others, and she couldn\u2019t stand to watch him suffer, no matter how many bad memories his presence unearthed.</p><p>She had to swalow to relax her throat before she could speak. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wondering for a long time, and whenever I asked, Monroe and his men dodged the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l tel you if I can,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of things I can\u2019t talk about, but I\u2019l tel you the truth, even if it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t tel you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy us?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWhy was my group targeted? We weren\u2019t in hostile territory. We weren\u2019t doing any antiterrorist work. We were just a group of young people trying to make a smal difference in the lives of a few women and children. I don\u2019t understand why we were taken.\u201d</p><p>Caleb puled in a deep breath and stayed silent as if trying to find the right words. \u201cThe people who took you were out to prove themselves. They were trying to gain entry into a terrorist group, and that video that they took of the torture and kiling was their audition tape, so to speak. It wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to them what you were doing there. Al they wanted was an easy target\u2014a group of several innocents they could use to earn their bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we were just in the wrong place at the wrong time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s not much more to it than that. It was bad luck that you were there, but if it hadn\u2019t been you, it would have been someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis group, are they the ones Monroe caled the Swarm?\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he told you that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he thought I was going to die, so it wouldn\u2019t realy matter,\u201d she told him. \u201cHe never told me what they want, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney. Power. There\u2019s nothing altruistic about them. They aren\u2019t fighting for some noble cause. They kil whoever they need to to get what they want. In much of the world, fear is power. People wil do nearly anything to protect those they love. The Swarm knew that and used it as they would any other tool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re teling me they\u2019re into torturing and kiling people for money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn most cases, yes. In your case it was for status. Prestige. Acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if they were al about money and power, then what were they doing targeting children?\u201d</p><p>He paused as if deciding what to tel her, or maybe what not to tel her. \u201cSometimes the only way to get someone to cooperate\u2014to give them information or help they need</p><p>\u2014is to threaten to take away the only thing that means more to a person than their honor or integrity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir child,\u201d guessed Lana.</p><p>Caleb nodded. \u201cIt happens more often than anyone would like to believe. Sometimes we get a chance to stop it, but most of the time, people take the safer route where their children are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She thought about her nephew, about her sister and her parents. There wasn\u2019t much she wouldn\u2019t do to protect them, be it honorable or not. \u201cYour job . . . it\u2019s a lot harder than anyone knows, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his wide shoulders as if it didn\u2019t matter how he felt about it. It was his job.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, I\u2019d have died, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have done a better job of protecting you and the others. I should have found a way to save them al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there, remember. I know the kind of evil you were up against. You did the best you could\u2014the only thing you could.\u201d</p><p>She toyed with the soft fabric of his folded shirt, feeling restless and edgy. She didn\u2019t like dealing with the past, but she knew there was something she had to tel him. She owed him that much. \u201cFor a long time, I hated you for what you did. I know it wasn\u2019t fair, and that you were only doing your job, but you were an easy target, and I needed that anger to fuel my recovery\u2014to give me the strength to keep going.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed as if he was in pain. \u201cLana, please. We don\u2019t have to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You need to know.\u201d She had to get rid of this burden. Her life was too heavy to keep carrying it around, too. \u201cI pushed myself to recover so that I could walk up to you one day and tel you how much I hated you for letting them hurt me. I thought about it al the time\u2014how shocked you\u2019d be. How humiliated and guilty you\u2019d feel. Some days, it was the only thing that got me through physical therapy.\u201d</p><p>Her anger was the only thing holding her together then. She could barely stand living like that, but if she hadn\u2019t had that hatred and the goal it gave her, she was sure she would have given up. Her recovery had been nearly as painful as her torture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lana pushed those bleak memories aside. \u201cAnd then you were here. And I had the chance to live out my fantasy and tel you how much I hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. There was no accusation in his voice, just gentle curiosity.</p><p>\u201cBecause it would have been a lie. I hate what happened and I hate thinking about it, but for what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t hate you. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>His hand turned over, and he laced his thick fingers through hers. \u201cYou have no idea how much that means to me.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb felt like he\u2019d been handed a rare gift. She didn\u2019t hate him anymore. It was more than he\u2019d ever hoped to hear her say.</p><p>She tidied up the kitchen while he just sat there in stunned silence. She didn\u2019t hate him.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s chest sweled with hope, and some unseen burden he\u2019d been carrying lightened until he felt ten years younger. He hadn\u2019t realized until now just how much her opinion of him mattered. He should have been scared by how much it mattered, knowing that if he cared what she thought, he was already in trouble. But instead, he was too grateful for the gift she\u2019d given him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hate him. It was a long way from trust, but it was a start.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p> <p>Denny knew better than to let the cal rol over to voice mail. Again. His boss had caled three times, and until now, Denny hadn\u2019t been drunk enough to answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat a naughty boy you are,\u201d said that emotionless robot voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was going to come into work that early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have handled the situation better. Now the police are crawling al over the place, patroling her office every twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, propping his pounding head in his hand. He\u2019d fucked up big-time. He\u2019d panicked when that lady came in. He hadn\u2019t meant to shoot her, but the damn gun had gone off, and then there was al that blood.</p><p>Denny swalowed hard to keep from puking.</p> <p>\u201cDid you find what I was looking for?\u201d asked the robot.</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that. Just business stuff. There was a flyer that had some photos of kids on it, but no drawings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you checked everywhere?\u201d</p><p>Denny considered lying, but the thought that his boss might figure it out, on top of him botching the job, was just too frightening. Bruce had come by today and told him he had a week to pay up his dad\u2019s debt. He hadn\u2019t said anything else, but the basebal bat propped up in the back of Bruce\u2019s convertible had done plenty of talking for him.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t get to one of the file cabinets in back. The lady walked in before I finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go back now. The police wil interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I screwed up. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said his boss, but whether it was in response to his first statement or his second, Denny had no idea. That was less than comforting.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can trust you any longer.\u201d</p><p>Desperation clawed inside Denny\u2019s sour stomach. \u201cPlease give me another chance. I swear I won\u2019t fuck up this time.\u201d</p><p>Silence stretched out for a long time, making Denny squirm.</p><p>\u201cThere is one more thing I need you to do, but it is considerably more dangerous than your last job.\u201d</p><p>Nothing was more dangerous than facing Bruce again without money in hand. \u201cAnything. I\u2019l do it.\u201d</p><p>He could almost hear the smile in the metalic voice. \u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>Stacie was pale but smiling when Lana was finaly alowed to see her. They shared a teary hug that Lana was careful not to put too much force behind. Stacie\u2019s normaly perfect makeup was smudged in some places and missing in others, and rather than a crisp blouse, she wore a droopy hospital gown.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asked Lana.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve been shot,\u201d joked Stacie. \u201cBut they tel me I\u2019l live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave the police been bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. They had a few questions, but there was so little I could tel them they just gave up and went away.\u201d</p><p>Lana felt Caleb\u2019s presence as he stepped up behind her. He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have to ask you more questions, but I realy need to have you tel us what you saw.\u201d</p><p>Stacie leaned her head back on the pilow. \u201cNot much. I unlocked the door, turned on the lights, and a man came out of the back room where we keep al the files and office supplies. He pointed a gun at me, told me to get into the bathroom, so I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wore a mask, but I could see enough skin around his eyes and mouth to tel he had coloring about like yours, Caleb. He was youngish. His eyes were bloodshot like maybe he was on drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wrinkles yet, and there was this . . . wildness about his eyes that make me think he was new to the whole armed-robbery experience. I\u2019d guess midtwenties, but it\u2019s hard to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then what happened?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI went into the bathroom like he said. I backed in, keeping my eyes on that gun. I guess I wasn\u2019t fast enough, because he shoved me. I started to fal and reached for him to catch my balance\u2014which was a stupid reflex. That\u2019s when the gun went off. I hit my head on the sink, or maybe the toilet. That\u2019s al I remember until Lana showed up.\u201d</p><p>Stacie smiled at her. \u201cThey said you saved my life\u2014that if I\u2019d gone much longer without help I would have bled to death. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. If it weren\u2019t for me, you\u2019d never have been there in the first place. You\u2019d have been working in an office with decent security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. You didn\u2019t invite that robber in. He made his choices al on his own.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s voice was gentle but insistent. \u201cIs there anything else you can remember? The sound of his voice? The way he smeled? Something he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d said Stacie. Her eyes drooped heavily and she gave a big yawn. \u201cI wish I could help more. Now you see why the police stopped bothering me so fast.\u201d</p><p>Lana saw Stacie was wilting. \u201cWe\u2019l get out of your hair so you can get your rest. Is there anything you need?\u201d</p><p>Stacie\u2019s eyes shut as if she just couldn\u2019t keep them open any longer. \u201cJust promise me you\u2019l go see the kids and meet our new volunteer. I know you\u2019re busy, but I told them I\u2019d get you out there this week, one way or another. Don\u2019t make me a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go,\u201d agreed Lana.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d It was almost six, and most of the kids would be gone. The center closed at seven, so going tonight would ensure a quick visit, and then she could get back to work. There was a lot to catch up on, and Stacie was in no condition to help.</p><p>Lana was on her own.</p><p>Lana had Caleb park behind the youth center and took him in the back entrance. Caleb folowed her in through the employees\u2019 door she had to use a card key to open. They went down a long hal lined with office doors.</p><p>This part of the building was made up of offices, storage and utility areas, and a smal break room. Down the long hal were restrooms and double doors that led into the gymnasium and craft area.</p><p>Most of the offices were empty, but that was going to change once they had better funding. This building would become the headquarters for the First Light Foundation, filed with people like herself who were passionate about making a difference in kids\u2019 lives.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep your office here?\u201d asked Caleb. \u201cYou\u2019d be safer around more people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lease on the other office isn\u2019t up yet, but Stacie and I wil move when it is.\u201d Maybe sooner, now.</p><p>\u201cHow many people work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour, including Stacie. The rest are volunteers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you do background checks on those volunteers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I\u2019d never let them near the kids without one. Plus we have strict rules for our volunteers as another layer of protection for the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Smart.\u201d</p><p>Peggy, one of Lana\u2019s employees, was stil working when Lana and Caleb walked by.</p><p>\u201cHey, Lana,\u201d she caled from her desk. \u201cHold on a sec.\u201d</p><p>Lana stepped into the woman\u2019s office, feeling Caleb\u2019s bulk right behind her. Peggy\u2019s office was a chaotic mess, but Lana didn\u2019t feel the need to say a thing. As long as Peggy kept bringing in the volunteers, she could raise livestock in here for al Lana cared.</p><p>\u201cHow is Stacie?\u201d Peggy asked. Concern lined her wide face, looking odd on her. Lana was too used to seeing her smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing okay. A little weak, but they said she\u2019l pul through. She\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go see her tomorrow before work if you think she\u2019l be up to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to see you.\u201d</p><p>Peggy eyed Caleb. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine visiting from out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d greeted Caleb in a deep drawl.</p><p>Peggy smiled and blushed. She was a happily married mother of four, grandmother of ten, but with al his muscles and that quiet confidence, Caleb was the kind of man a woman enjoyed watching no matter how old she was.</p><p>\u201cCare to join the ranks of volunteers?\u201d asked Peggy.</p><p>Lana explained, \u201cShe\u2019s in charge of recruiting our volunteers. Watch out, or she\u2019l have you slaving away before you know what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help out while I\u2019m here if I can,\u201d offered Caleb.</p><p>\u201cSold. I\u2019l hold you to it,\u201d said Peggy. \u201cSpeaking of volunteers, we have a new one. She\u2019s a little upper-crust, but I think she\u2019l be great once the kids break her out of her shel. I\u2019d like you to meet her if you have the time. She\u2019s here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d said Lana. \u201cJust let me duck into the little girls\u2019 room and I\u2019l be right there. Do you mind showing Caleb around for a minute?\u201d</p><p>Peggy grinned wider. \u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Caleb offered the older woman his thick arm. \u201cShal we?\u201d</p><p>Lana watched them walk down the hal. Caleb\u2019s steps were slow and careful in deference to Peggy\u2019s aged gait. He said something low that Lana couldn\u2019t hear and had Peggy laughing before they\u2019d disappeared through the double doors.</p><p>Lana went into the bathroom and found herself anxious to get back to Caleb\u2019s side. She wasn\u2019t sure how it had happened, or when, but she was getting used to having him around.</p><p>She scolded herself for being so foolish. Caleb couldn\u2019t stay. He had a job to do and as soon as he was convinced she knew nothing, he\u2019d leave.</p><p>Lana flushed the toilet and opened the stal door. Standing there, not ten feet away, alone in the bathroom with her, was the woman who had ordered Lana\u2019s death.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>The kiler was tal, maybe three or four inches taler than Lana. And beautiful\u2014elegant in her tailored suit and expensive jewelry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your new volunteer, Kara McIntire,\u201d she said. She smiled and reached out her hand for Lana to shake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lana couldn\u2019t move. Couldn\u2019t breathe. Time crawled by, suffocating her more with every passing second. Her heart stil pounded, her blood stil moved in painfuly sluggish pulses through her body, but it didn\u2019t matter. She was already dead. Kara had found her, and it was al over. She was going to die on a dirty bathroom floor with help only a shout away.</p><p>But Lana couldn\u2019t shout. Her lungs burned from lack of oxygen, but she couldn\u2019t drag in any air\u2014just like in her nightmares.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asked Kara in a mockery of concern.</p><p>A sliver of doubt stabbed at Lana, getting her attention. Maybe she was halucinating. Certainly a kiler wouldn\u2019t walk up and introduce herself. Not unless she was toying with Lana.</p> <p>Or testing her.</p><p>Kara couldn\u2019t know that Lana had seen her face. No one knew, which was why she was stil alive after eighteen months. If Lana could fool Kara into believing it, maybe Kara would let her live. What use could there be in kiling her and risking getting caught when al Kara had to do was walk away knowing her secret was safe? Al Lana had to do was pretend Kara was a stranger and she might live.</p><p>Reach out and shake her hand. That\u2019s what she was supposed to do now.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help?\u201d Kara asked, taking a step forward.</p><p>Lana barely stifled a flinch. \u201cSorry. I thought I was going to get sick again for a minute there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a stomach bug,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little better now.\u201d</p><p>A smile brightened Kara\u2019s face, and she extended her hand again. \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. I\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting you. Everyone around here loves you.\u201d</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t bring herself to touch Kara. She wasn\u2019t strong enough to touch her and not scream. So, she said, \u201cHaven\u2019t washed my hands yet,\u201d and proceeded to do just that, taking her time.</p><p>Her fingers were trembling, and she prayed Kara hadn\u2019t seen it. \u201cSo, you\u2019re our new volunteer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Just signed on this week. I\u2019ve heard so much about your work I had to come help out.\u201d</p> <p>Lana\u2019s hands were more than clean. She was starting to look foolish, so she turned off the water and dried them. \u201cDo you live nearby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust down the road. Wel, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s house, but I decided to move back after she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d Lana was sure the words didn\u2019t sound sincere. She was too stunned by the fact that this kiler had a mother to put any feeling into her voice.</p><p>Kara shrugged. \u201cDeath is just part of life.\u201d</p><p>She would know. She\u2019d caused enough of it.</p><p>Lana shoved her hands into her pockets to ward off any more of Kara\u2019s attempts to shake. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a day trader. You know, stocks and options?\u201d</p><p>Liar! Lana wanted to scream and lash out at her for what she\u2019d done, but she managed to hold her tongue. \u201cSounds exciting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has its moments. I think working with the kids wil be even more . . . rewarding, though. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>No way was Lana letting her spend any time alone with the kids. The thought made her skin crawl. \u201cPeggy explained our rules to you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean how I\u2019m not alowed to do any activities with the children for at least three months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You can help set up and clean up, but we have to be strict about screening out the weirdos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s what the background check was for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. We\u2019re just careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. You wouldn\u2019t want any unpleasantness.\u201d</p><p>Too late for that.</p><p>Kara cocked her head to one side. \u201cYou look familiar. Have we met?\u201d</p><p>Lana felt acid rise in her throat. She had to get out of here. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have sworn I\u2019ve seen you somewhere before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably in the newspapers.\u201d</p><p>Lana reached for the door, but Kara was faster. Their hands colided near the handle, and Kara\u2019s were reptile cold.</p><p>Her voice was elegant and warm. \u201cIt\u2019s such a thril to be here. I\u2019m sure you and I wil be spending lots of time together.\u201d</p><p>Over Lana\u2019s dead body. Maybe literaly.</p><p>This was too much. Lana needed to get away and think for a minute\u2014decide what to do.</p><p>She let Kara open the door for her rather than risk contact again. When she came out, Caleb was waiting for her. As soon as he saw her, he frowned and stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d</p><p>Behind Caleb, Kara was talking with Peggy. The older woman smiled at something Kara said and Kara put a hand on Peggy\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Lana puled her eyes away. She couldn\u2019t stand to watch that kiler touch her friend.</p><p>She had to get away and think. Pul herself together. Caleb was watching her too closely. He was going to see something was wrong and give her away. She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Stacie. I need to cal her. I\u2019m going back to one of the offices to use the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to tag along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019l be back in a few minutes,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure an eternity would be long enough to calm her down, but she had to try.</p><p>Caleb gave her a solemn nod. \u201cDon\u2019t be long, or I\u2019m coming to find you.\u201d</p><p>Great. Like she didn\u2019t have enough pressure.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d she told him and retreated back to the offices. Lana found the first empty office she could and locked herself inside.</p><p>Kara was here at First Light.</p><p>Panic started to close in around her, blocking off her air. She slid to the floor, hugging her knees to her chest, trying to take up as little space as possible. Maybe if she was smal enough, Kara wouldn\u2019t find her.</p><p>She was panting. Nearly hyperventilating. A low, terrified whimper fel from her lips with every rapid breath.</p><p>What if Kara could hear her? What if she was on the other side of the door, listening?</p><p>Lana clamped her mouth closed and sucked in air through her nose. She scrambled away from the door to the farthest corner of the office. She huddled there, hugging herself and rocking. She had no idea how long she was there, but slowly, she got control over her panic, and her breathing started to even out.</p><p>She had to think.</p><p>From the time Lana had seen that flash of sunlight reflecting off binoculars on the hilside outside of the cave in Armenia, she knew someone might find her. She didn\u2019t know who had been watching her then, but she did now. The only protection she could devise was based on a short conversation she\u2019d overheard while in the cave.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to kill his wife, too?\u201d asked one of Kara\u2019s goons.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered. \u201cShe knows nothing. Killing her would only draw attention we don\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>If Lana pretended to know nothing, could that save her life as it had saved that unknown woman? Could it keep her family safe?</p><p>She had to believe so. It was the only thing she could think to grasp a hold of. The only glimmer of hope she could find.</p><p>Sure, she could tel Caleb. Maybe he\u2019d even be able to get rid of Kara forever. But what good would that do when the other three men she\u2019d seen found out Kara was gone? They\u2019d know she\u2019d identified Kara and realize she\u2019d seen them, too. They\u2019d come after her.</p><p>They\u2019d come after her family.</p><p>Her parents and sister were listed in the phone book. Anyone with an Internet connection could find out where they lived and retaliate. If Lana said a thing, she was sure that whether she lived or died, her family would suffer. She had to protect them, and the only way to do that was to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>Staying silent had worked for eighteen months. Everyone she loved was stil safe. It would continue to work. She had to believe that. She couldn\u2019t face the possibility that she would fail. She\u2019d find a way to smile at Kara if that\u2019s what it took. She\u2019d shake her hand. Hug her. Whatever it took, she\u2019d do it. It was the only way.</p><p>Once Kara believed that Lana knew nothing, she\u2019d go away. Everyone would be safe, and this nightmare would finaly be over for good.</p><p>Lana pushed her trembling body to her feet and puled in a deep breath. She wiped the tears off her face, straightened her clothes, squared her shoulders, and went to face her enemy.</p><p>Caleb had just decided to hunt Lana down when she came back into the gymnasium. Something was definitely wrong. She was pale, and even from here he could see her shaking. He watched as Lana took a few deep breaths like he used to do when he\u2019d first learned how to parachute out of airplanes.</p><p>Caleb excused himself from Peggy and went to Lana. Up close, he could see a fine layer of sweat along her hairline and goose bumps on her arms. Without thinking, he rubbed his hands up and down her arms to warm her. \u201cIs Stacie okay? You looked a little freaked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine.\u201d He pressed his wrist to her forehead to see if she was fevered. She was cool and clammy.</p><p>She swatted him away and plastered a fake, dimpleless smile on her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not sick. It\u2019s just been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home.\u201d Where he could take care of her.</p><p>\u201cIn a little while. I want to play with the kids first.\u201d</p><p>One of the younger children saw her and squealed, racing over to give her a hug. \u201cLana\u2019s back!\u201d shouted several of the other kids as they, too, saw her.</p><p>Lana\u2019s fake smile turned genuine, and her dimples returned as she soaked up the attention of about ten kids. Hugs al around, they finaly backed up enough to let her walk into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna give us art class today?\u201d asked a boy about seven years old. He wore a stained shirt and jeans with too many holes. His hands were covered in smudges of green marker, some of which had transferred to his face where he\u2019d touched it.</p><p>\u201cNot today, Jeremy. It\u2019s too late to start a class, but I\u2019d love to see your latest drawings.\u201d</p><p>Jeremy grinned and raced off to the wal that was lined with coat racks and smal lockers, and started digging for his papers.</p><p>After a few minutes of excited chatting and an art show by Jeremy, the kids thinned out. They went back to their basketbal games and coloring books. Two adults who\u2019d been watching the mob of kids came over. One was a man in his late thirties, and the other was a strikingly beautiful woman. The man would have been handsome if anger hadn\u2019t shaped his face into a sour mask. He was heavily muscled but moved awkwardly, as if he wasn\u2019t used to his own body. His arms swung out at his sides, sticking out like there just wasn\u2019t room for them to hang against his body with al that muscle in the way. He looked at Lana with frankly sexual interest, tainted with the anger of repeated rejections. Caleb sized him up swiftly and decided to keep a close eye on this man. Between his bulk and attitude, he was a possible threat to Lana.</p><p>The woman was nearly six feet tal and simply gorgeous. Her golden blond hair was puled back in a sleek twist of some kind, and she wore an outfit that looked like it had been stripped from a first lady, complete with pearls. She wore a subtle floral perfume that probably cost more per ounce than gold. The legs peeking out under her skirt were shapely and long, and even though she was likely nearing forty, she stil had the kind of beauty that could turn men\u2019s heads. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was something familiar about her that Caleb couldn\u2019t place, and he worked his brain to remember.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend?\u201d asked the woman, giving Caleb a thorough perusal.</p><p>He felt Lana tense beside him and shot her a quick glance. That plastic, dimple-less smile was bright on her face, but her eyes were too wide. \u201cThis is my friend Caleb.</p><p>Caleb, meet Kara McIntire and Phil Macy. Volunteers.\u201d</p> <p>Phil held out a beefy hand in greeting. \u201cNew boyfriend, Lana?\u201d He squeezed Caleb\u2019s hand hard, entering one of the older, more childish pissing contests around. Caleb smiled as he squeezed back hard enough to make the bones in Phil\u2019s hand shift. Phil relented with a grimace and put his hand behind his back, likely to massage it.</p><p>Caleb nodded his head toward the woman but didn\u2019t offer to shake hands, because she didn\u2019t seem inclined to, either. \u201cMa\u2019am. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is entirely mine,\u201d purred Kara in a rich voice that matched her elegant attire.</p><p>\u201cWe heard about Stacie,\u201d said Phil. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l recover, but it\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d said Lana.</p> <p>Kara offered a gentle smile. \u201cI hardly got a chance to know her, but I could tel we were going to be good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l be back in a couple weeks, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019l tel her you were thinking about her next time I talk to her,\u201d offered Lana.</p><p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d said Kara, dismissing the topic of Stacie with a wave of her hand. Her eyes roamed up and down Caleb\u2019s body in a blatant show of admiration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing you again,\u201d she said, then walked away in a lovely swing of hips. Phil wasn\u2019t far behind, panting after her.</p><p>Lana stood there, motionless, breathing a little too rapidly as if relieved.</p><p>Caleb stepped in front of her, blocking her from the rest of the room. He bent his knees and tilted up her chin so she couldn\u2019t escape eye contact. For a moment, he was distracted by the startling beauty of her blue eyes fringed by dark lashes. \u201cHas Phil been bothering you, Lana?\u201d</p> <p>He saw her face shut down. No warmth, no anger. Just the neutral mask of a mannequin. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can speak with him. Make sure he knows to leave you alone. I promise when we\u2019re done chatting he won\u2019t go within twenty feet of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. He\u2019s harmless and I don\u2019t want your interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, especialy not after what happened to Stacie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me that if he bothers you, you\u2019l let me know.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment as if she was going to say something different, but what came out was, \u201cOkay. I promise that if Phil bothers me, I\u2019l tel you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave a nod, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied at al. There was something she wasn\u2019t saying, but he had no idea what. He hated not being able to read her beneath that artificial expression.</p> <p>She walked off to join the kids who were coloring at the table. Caleb hung back and watched as she chatted with them, sometimes picking up a crayon or marker to help them color. One of the little girls asked her to draw a puppy, and Lana smiled indulgently. \u201cHere, sit right beside me and draw what I draw,\u201d said Lana to the girl.</p><p>The little girl watched Lana\u2019s paper as if waiting for a miracle to appear, but Lana hesitated. The pencil in her hand quivered as her hand shook and she closed her eyes in defeat. \u201cMy hand is tired. How about I use yours?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded happily as Lana put the child on her lap and guided the chubby little hand over the paper. The puppy they drew was lopsided, but the girl ran off squealing with pride to show it to her big brother, who was playing basketbal.</p><p>Caleb looked back at Lana and saw the pain of loss on her face. He remembered those sketches in her apartment\u2014how lifelike they were\u2014and wondered if something had happened to her hands to make her unable to draw. Her left hand had been broken in Armenia, but her right had only been a little bruised. He knew because he\u2019d spent hours holding her hand, praying that she\u2019d live.</p><p>Before he realized what he was doing, Caleb had gone to her and wrapped his hands over her slim shoulders. She felt delicate under his fingers, but Caleb knew that was an ilusion. Lana Hancock was made of tempered steel.</p><p>She was stiff under his grip, but she didn\u2019t flinch away.</p><p>\u201cYou look beat. Let me take you home,\u201d he offered.</p><p>He felt her sigh, her shoulders rising and faling with the long breath. \u201cI should go back to the office, clean up the mess, see what can be salvaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. Let it go for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but there\u2019s so damn much to do, and now, with Stacie in the hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go tonight and I\u2019l lend a hand tomorrow. I\u2019m not Stacie, but maybe I can help.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and leaned back so she could look up at him. She had the oddest look on her face\u2014a mix of hope and desperation that made his heart ache with the need to hold her and make her life a happy place. \u201cI wish you could, Caleb. You have no idea how much.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Kara\u2019s hand shook with excitement as she dialed Marcus Lark. She wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to be pleased or angry that Caleb Stone was in town, but both prospects were thriling, each in its own way.</p><p>\u201cHelo, love,\u201d came Marcus\u2019s deep voice from over a thousand miles away.</p><p>Kara let a shiver course over her body at the sound of his voice. \u201cI miss you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. I was hoping you\u2019d be home soon.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said he missed her, but Kara refused to pout. Marcus wasn\u2019t a man given to affection or empty words. He was a man of action, and Kara was determined to prove to him that she was the kind of woman who could be his equal, the kind of woman who wouldn\u2019t turn squeamish in the face of hardship.</p><p>\u201cI was making you a gift.\u201d</p><p>An interested lilt colored his tone. \u201cOh? What sort of gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA video. Would you like to hear a sample?\u201d</p><p>At his silence, she pressed play and held the phone near the speaker on her laptop. Lana\u2019s terrified screams shrieked from the speakers, and the image of her body writhing in imagined pain filed the screen. Marcus was going to love it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve finished the job, then, I take it.\u201d</p><p>He thought those screams meant Lana was dead. Kara did pout then. She\u2019d worked hard to colect al this footage and meld it together in a seamless montage of Lana\u2019s suffering. It was a gift from the heart and yet stil not enough for him.</p><p>Nothing she did for him was ever enough. That had to change. She couldn\u2019t let him send her out on her own again. She would never go back to that life.</p><p>\u201cI saw her today. Spoke to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there to toy with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned to finish it tonight,\u201d she told him, unable to keep the sharpness from her tone. He\u2019d punish her for that when she got home, but she\u2019d learned to like that, too.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to cal until it was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would want to know that there\u2019s been a development. Caleb Stone came to town. He\u2019s with her now.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause and the sound of grating teeth coming from the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, then. You\u2019l never get to her now. Come home. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Icy fear lanced through her body. She knew that tone. Marcus was more than simply mad, he was enraged. She\u2019d failed him, and he was going to send her away. \u201cI can stil do it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you plan to kil her without getting caught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no faith in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much is at stake. We alowed Caleb and his men to destroy the Swarm so they would leave us alone. If Caleb finds out that any of the old members survived, it wil start a hunt. It\u2019s much easier to do business when none of his kind are watching us. I wil not let you compromise that advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I would never do anything like that to you.\u201d Surely she\u2019d proved her loyalty to him by now.</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly prevent it if you proceed now? If anything happens to the girl, it wil be obvious who did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m being careful. I\u2019ve hired help that can\u2019t be linked back to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course, to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are expendable,\u201d he reminded her in a cruel tone.</p><p>And that cruelty hurt. She loved him so much. Al she ever wanted was to make him happy, to be by his side and feel like she belonged there. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The heat left his voice. It dropped to a low, seductive tone. \u201cCome home to me, love. We\u2019l figure out what to do together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you down like that. I\u2019l finish what I started. You\u2019l see I can do it. Just give me a little time.\u201d</p><p>Another long pause had her sweating. She knew that if he ordered her to come home, she would go. She would do anything for him, even if it meant letting him vent his anger on her. It wasn\u2019t his fault she made him so angry.</p><p>\u201cFine. But if you do anything to compromise me, don\u2019t bother coming back. I\u2019l find you.\u201d</p><p>Lana slid under the cool sheets and stared at the ceiling. The fan twirled lazily overhead, sending a breeze over her arms and face. With al the lights in the room on and the heat of summer outside, the fan was the only thing keeping the room comfortable.</p><p>Lana should have been too wired to sleep after a day like today, but instead she was exhausted. Even the fear of dreaming couldn\u2019t keep her from her bed. The worry that Caleb would bust in again made her hesitate, but she couldn\u2019t do anything to drive him away. He was stil sitting outside in his car after stuffing her ful of food and driving her home.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d managed to get the food down, but she did. It was al part of the act. Nothing was wrong. He might as wel leave, although she wasn\u2019t so sure she wanted him to go anymore.</p><p>At least she knew he could protect himself if Kara came after him.</p><p>Lana wondered if Kara recognized Caleb as Miles Gentry. More important, she wondered if he\u2019d recognized Kara\u2014if he knew she was the woman who\u2019d run the operation in Armenia, the woman who had ordered Lana\u2019s death.</p><p>Lana wasn\u2019t sure that Caleb and Kara had ever actualy met, since Kara\u2019s goon had served as the go-between as wel as the muscle. Lana had seen her only once, but that had been enough. Fear had imprinted her face on Lana\u2019s memory the way nothing else could.</p><p>Tonight Lana had been watching both Kara and Caleb closely, and she didn\u2019t think that either one of them recognized the other. If so, they hid it wel.</p><p>Al this subterfuge made Lana\u2019s head ache. She couldn\u2019t keep up with al the lies, and it was wearing her thin. If it hadn\u2019t been for Caleb\u2019s support today at the hospital, she didn\u2019t think she would have made it through.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t hovered or pushed her. He\u2019d just been there, ready to help in whatever way she needed. Lana wasn\u2019t used to that kind of treatment. Her family\u2019s idea of helping was either babying her to the point where she wasn\u2019t even alowed to feed herself or pushing her to lay al her pain and grief out in the open so she could \u201cheal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Neither one worked for her, but there was something about Caleb\u2019s quiet support that made her burdens feel lighter.</p><p>Maybe fate hadn\u2019t sent him back into her life to torture her, after al.</p><p>Then again, maybe this was fate\u2019s way of giving her something only to rip it away later. Like her ex-fianc\u00e9, or her drawing, or her feeling of security. She had to remember that Caleb wasn\u2019t going to become a permanent fixture. She couldn\u2019t come to depend on him too much, because, unlike what she believed she\u2019d had with Oran, Lana knew that Caleb\u2019s presence was only temporary. The more temporary, the better\u2014the safer\u2014for everyone.</p><p>Caleb stretched out as much as he could in his rental car and downloaded the data from the mini-cam in Lana\u2019s apartment. The break-in at her office bothered him, and not just because Stacie had been hurt, or because it could have just as easily been Lana who\u2019d shown up to work first. It bothered him because there was nothing of value to steal, and any robber worth his salt would have broken in to either the walk-in clinic for a possible score of pain meds or the print shop, which was ful of expensive computer equipment. So if the break-in wasn\u2019t for the sake of robbery, then it was for something else. The perp had definitely been looking for something. What could Lana have in her office that someone would want? And what did it have to do with what happened in Armenia, if anything? Even if the Swarm had somehow survived and was stil operating, the only thing they\u2019d want is Lana\u2019s death\u2014proof that no one could escape their grasp. Whoever had broken in had wanted something more. What could they possibly think she was hiding at work? It didn\u2019t make any sense inside the framework the Swarm operated in.</p> <p>His laptop chimed, indicating the data stored on the camera was ready to view. Caleb puled up the image of Lana\u2019s apartment during the time they\u2019d been gone today and scanned through it in fast motion, looking for anything unusual. About seven hours into the footage, Lana\u2019s new front door opened, and someone who was covered from head to toe in black came in. He was fairly tal, nearly six feet, with a thin build. He moved confidently as he swept into the apartment, heading straight for Lana\u2019s bookshelves. He puled out a book and leafed through it, looking carefuly at each page. Caleb couldn\u2019t read the title or see what the intruder was looking at.</p><p>After he finished looking at the book, he went to the far wal, unscrewed the faceplate on the electrical outlet, and puled something out of the hole. Something else went back in, the faceplate was put back on, and the man left the apartment as easily as he\u2019d come in.</p><p>The whole section of footage covered maybe a minute, and Caleb realized that he\u2019d just seen a pro at work. Whoever that man was, he knew what he was doing. And he was listening to every word Lana said.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s stomach iced over, and he felt himself slipping into that adrenaline-altered state that prepared him for battle, stretching out each second into an endless eternity. By the time he reached Lana\u2019s apartment, he knew exactly what he needed to do to get her out of her bugged house safely without letting whoever was listening, and possibly watching her, know.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>Lana had just changed into a comfy pair of short pajamas when she saw Caleb striding toward her apartment. There was a strange look on his face that she\u2019d never seen him wear before. It was fierce, determined, without a hint of mercy anywhere.</p><p>He knocked once before she got the door unlocked and opened it for him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t wait for her to step aside to let him in, he just moved forward, crowding her with his big body. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby,\u201d he said in a low, fervent voice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away. I need you too much.\u201d</p><p>Lana blinked in confusion and opened her mouth to ask him what the hel he was talking about when his mouth covered hers in a kiss, silencing her. His arms slid around her, and she heard the front door being kicked shut.</p><p>Lana went stiff with shock for about two seconds before al her questions faded away. She hadn\u2019t been kissed since before she left for Armenia. She\u2019d forgotten how wonderful it was. That flush of heat, that spurt of excitement shooting through her limbs, that heavy, languid warmth that made her go weak in a realy nice way. She was hungry for it. Her body took over and decided that this was a good thing. Very good.</p><p>She had no clue why Caleb was kissing her, but she didn\u2019t care. She drank it in, starved for the contact of a man after being alone so long. And not just any man. Caleb. A hero with a body that that was carved by the hand of God for a woman\u2019s pleasure. He was strength personified, and she felt al those masculine ridges pressing against her body. It was enough to make a woman melt and give herself up to whatever he had in mind, no matter how insane.</p> <p>His tongue teased her mouth open and she gave him entry, sighing with pleasure at his boldness. One wide hand pressed against the smal of her back, holding her tight to his hard body while the other hand cradled her head, guiding her so he could nibble his way to her ear. Everything he did felt right and she wanted more\u2014wanted to kiss him back so he\u2019d never stop. She tried to kiss his mouth, but he held her immobile.</p><p>In a quiet, breathless voice, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re being watched. Play along.\u201d</p><p>Her brain stuttered trying to make sense of what he said, but finaly gave up. There was no sense to be made. Her whole world narrowed to the few square inches where his bare skin touched hers\u2014his fingertips sliding under the hem of her pajama shirt, the press of his lips along the edge of her ear. She\u2019d never felt anything so completely right in her life, and nothing else mattered.</p><p>Her heart pumped hard, heating her blood, making her feel both powerful and weak at the same time. Lana went up on tiptoe and guided his mouth back to hers, where it belonged. A rough, pleased male rumble vibrated against her breasts, making her nipples harden.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d he whispered against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get you into the shower.\u201d He sounded tense. Desperate. When her feet didn\u2019t move fast enough, he picked her up and carried her into the bathroom, then set her down to turn on the water.</p><p>Lana didn\u2019t understand why he needed the shower, but she wasn\u2019t sure she cared. Without his touch fogging her brain, her head had cleared enough to ask him, \u201cCaleb, what are you\u2014\u201d but then he puled her back up against his big body and silenced her with another scorching kiss. His fingers clenched against her hips, and she could feel the hard length of his erection pressing into her bely.</p> <p>Lana\u2019s mouth went dry at the proof of his desire for her. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she felt desired, and she\u2019d never felt it quite like that before. The man was definitely built in perfect proportion\u2014big everywhere.</p><p>He stripped his shirt off over his head, giving Lana access to the sprawling width of his bare chest. Dark hair accentuated the deep ridges of his muscles, which his clothing had partialy concealed. Her hands couldn\u2019t resist the lure of al that naked male skin, and she trailed her fingertips lightly over his pecs and down his ribs. Caleb shuddered, and his dark eyes shut tight as if he were trying to focus.</p><p>He grabbed her wandering hands and held them hostage as he tested the temperature of the water. A second later, Lana was lifted into the tub, and he puled the curtain closed behind them. He maneuvered her under the pounding stream of water, dousing her from head to toe despite her clothing.</p><p>She surrendered to his strange treatment, alowing her hands to slide up over his thick shoulders and back down along the muscles of his spine. Needy little noises were rising up in her throat, and there was nothing she could do to stop them. He felt too good. Tasted too good.</p><p>Lana\u2019s hands encountered his clothing, and she looked down to see he stil wore his jeans, which had turned dark with moisture, and his heavy boots.</p><p>Something about this picture wasn\u2019t right, but Lana\u2019s brain was too busy dealing with a sudden dose of lust poisoning to care. She tugged her wet PJ shirt over her head, boldly displaying her naked breasts.</p><p>Caleb let out a low, pained groan, and his fingers clenched against her hips. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much more I can take,\u201d he whispered so softly she barely heard it over the pounding of water on the tiles.</p><p>\u201cA lot more, I hope,\u201d she told him and pressed her breasts against his muscled body. The springy hair rasped lightly over her nipples, sending shockwaves of current racing along her nerves. She felt her body heat further until the warm water felt cool against her skin.</p><p>His fingers plunged into her wet hair, and he bent down to whisper in her ear. \u201cWe have to stop now or I\u2019m not going to be able to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be watching, and if things are going to go any farther, I\u2019d rather not have an audience.\u201d</p><p>Lana had no idea what he was talking about. \u201cWatching?\u201d</p><p>Her voice wasn\u2019t as quiet as his had been, and he silenced her with his mouth. Lana parted her lips and made a demanding foray with her tongue. She felt Caleb\u2019s muscles trembling with effort, and after a moment, he puled away from her mouth. Lana tried to folow him, but he used his body to pin her against the cool tile.</p><p>She shuddered as she felt the weight of his body hot along her front and the hard tiles cold against her back. Her wrists were captured tight in one of his big hands, and even as slippery as the water made their skin, she couldn\u2019t break away to touch him.</p><p>He gave her a stern look, but his eyes were black with need. \u201cListen!\u201d he whispered urgently. \u201cI need you to listen.\u201d</p><p>Without his mouth on hers driving her stupid, sanity started to return. Something was wrong. He was trying to tel her something was wrong.</p><p>Lana stopped fighting against his hold.</p><p>Caleb let out a relieved sigh and leaned near her ear again, stil holding her body immobile. \u201cYour house is bugged. The water is covering our voices, but we need to get out without them knowing we know.\u201d</p><p>Fear made blood drain from Lana\u2019s limbs until she was hardly strong enough to stand. Her house was bugged. Oh, God.</p><p>Caleb must have seen that she\u2019d finaly come to her senses, because his grip on her hands relaxed. \u201cI\u2019m going to get you out of here\u2014I just need you to folow my lead.\u201d</p><p>Lana gave him a shaky nod.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d said Caleb loud enough to be heard over the water. \u201cI forgot the condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot them?\u201d she asked. Her voice was perfect\u2014al rough with unquenched desire and frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. I\u2019l make it up to you,\u201d he gave her an open-mouthed kiss just under her ear.</p><p>Lana\u2019s body arched against him despite her orders to stay stil. \u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a nice getaway. Hotel room with room service. Champagne. Giant tub big enough for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and sex in the shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you nice and wet,\u201d he said in a deep, sexy tone.</p><p>Lana felt something low in her bely clench tight against a wave of lust. Caleb\u2019s grip tightened again, and it wasn\u2019t until she felt it that she realized she\u2019d tried to get free to touch him again. She wanted to run her hands over his body until she convinced him to strip naked and slide hot and thick inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb\u2019s voice shook when he asked, \u201cIs it a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoom service and champagne?\u201d she asked, trying to sound petulant, and failing. There was too much need in her voice, and she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.</p><p>\u201cYou bet, baby. Anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEspecialy me.\u201d</p><p>Moving his body away from Lana\u2019s had been one of the hardest things Caleb had ever done. He backed away slowly, feeling the caress of her tight little nipples over his skin.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself from letting out a nearly silent hiss of pleasure.</p><p>He was shaking with unsatisfied lust. It pumped hot and hard through his veins, luring him to finish what his ingenious lie had started. The plan had seemed simple enough</p><p>\u2014get Lana to pretend to have sex with him in the shower while he used the water to cover their conversation, as wel as possibly shorting out any bugs that might be on her clothing.</p> <p>Not that she was wearing much. Just a tiny little shirt and matching shorts that showed off legs so shapely he barely even noticed the surgical scars. She wore no bra or panties underneath, just smooth, hot skin that shivered under his touch.</p><p>That part hadn\u2019t been acting. In fact, he didn\u2019t think that anything she\u2019d done had been an act until the very last. Lana wanted him, and the knowledge was enough to bring Caleb to his knees. If the history between them hadn\u2019t been so ful of land mines, he would have taken her without hesitation. He would have pinned her against the tile and filed her up until they were both too wild to care that the water had run cold. He would have tried to give her the kind of pleasure that erased past pain, or at least duled the memory of it. When she stripped her shirt off and bared her sweet, pink-tipped breasts, Caleb nearly lost his resolve not to do just that. It had been a close thing, and he knew that if he watched her getting out of the shower, he\u2019d be a goner.</p><p>Caleb dunked his head under the spray, making sure enough water went into his eyes to keep him blind. A moment later he heard her say, \u201cHere\u2019s a towel.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shut off the water. She was wrapped in a thick towel, her dark hair dripping water onto her slender shoulders. Her lips were a bit puffy and her eyes a bit wide, but her chin was high and she showed no sign of fear. Caleb admired the hel out of her for that courage. Not just any woman could stand there calmly after just finding out that her house was bugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l throw some clothes on and be out in a sec,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Caleb did the best he could to dry off his soaked jeans and puled his shirt back on. He gathered up her toothbrush, her hairbrush, and a few toiletries he thought she\u2019d need, and by the time he had, she was dressed and waiting for him.</p> <p>She gave him an impatient wave of her hand, and he hoped that anyone watching wouldn\u2019t be able to see the way it shook. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Lana sat in the car unable to speak. She\u2019d made such a complete fool of herself coming on to Caleb like that. How could she have been so stupid not to see that he was just playing a role? He played Caleb the seducer as easily and convincingly as he\u2019d played Miles Gentry, amoral mercenary.</p><p>How could she not have thought about the possibility that her house was bugged?</p><p>Lana wondered how long she\u2019d been without privacy. Had Kara heard her screams at night? Seen her writhing on the bed? Did her screams stil make her smile?</p><p>Lana shoved the questions away before they made her sick. She could never go back there now. She had no home.</p><p>Caleb scribbled something on a notepad and handed it to her as he drove out of the parking lot.</p><p>Don\u2019t say anything. Your clothes may be bugged.</p> <p>Lana felt her neck tighten another notch, making her head throb. Was this nightmare ever going to end? Did she have to give up her life and disappear before she\u2019d be free?</p><p>And if that was the cost of freedom, did she even want it?</p><p>She\u2019d spent enough hours thinking about that very thing to know that she didn\u2019t. She would never again be caged, trapped like she had been in that cave. She was going to live free, or die trying. Period.</p><p>Caleb puled into the nearest drugstore and parked away from the clump of cars nestled near the door. He reached into the backseat, fumbled in a bag, and puled out something about the size and shape of a cel phone. He pushed a couple buttons and a line of three LEDs lit up. He reached over and ran the device over her backpack turned purse. The little lights flickered, and Caleb puled a complicated knife out of his damp jeans. He slit open the lining in one of the pockets and pried out a listening device no larger than a button on her shirt.</p><p>Lana\u2019s stomach cramped, and it was al she could do not to let out a hoarse cry of frustration. She carried that backpack with her everywhere, which meant they\u2019d listened to every word she\u2019d said\u2014at work, at home, even in the hospital with Stacie. She felt betrayed. Violated.</p><p>Thank God she\u2019d never told anyone what she\u2019d seen in Armenia. Anyone who shared her secret would be dead right now, and it would have been her fault.</p><p>Caleb continued running the device over her purse, then her shoes. He found two more bugs. When he motioned for her to lift her arms, Lana thought he\u2019d lost his mind. At least until the little lights went off when he ran the thing along the underwire of her bra.</p><p>Lana choked down her rage, unfastened the bra, and slipped it out through her sleeve.</p><p>Caleb gave her that look al men have when they see a woman remove her bra without taking off her shirt\u2014the one that kids get when they see a new magic trick. She handed him the lacy bit of fabric, and he used his knife to cut open the casing that held the underwire. Another tiny listening device slid into his wide palm. He offered her the bra, but she refused. There was no way that was going back on her body.</p><p>He took al the little bits of plastic and metal and folded them into a makeshift envelope he made out of a piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be right back with those condoms,\u201d he said and got out of the car, locking the doors behind him.</p><p>Lana sat there in the dark parking lot, feeling trapped. What else didn\u2019t she know about besides the bugs? Had her food been tampered with? What about her office? Was it bugged, too? Could Kara just hear her, or had she also been watching her? Was it just Kara or had the others found her, too? She hadn\u2019t seen them, but that didn\u2019t mean anything.</p><p>Lana felt her stomach tighten painfuly, and she took slow, deep breaths in an effort to keep her dinner down.</p><p>What was she going to do? She couldn\u2019t go back to her apartment, and she sure wasn\u2019t going to go live with her parents again. As much as her folks would love having her there to fuss over, Lana couldn\u2019t stand the thought of bringing any possible harm to them, even if she could tolerate the fussing.</p><p>If her apartment had been bugged, maybe her parents\u2019 house was, too. Not that it would do any good. Her parents knew nothing. And she\u2019d stopped drawing altogether now. Her hand would only sketch those faces, and if anyone saw, that could get her and anyone else around her kiled.</p><p>Even Caleb.</p><p>Lana buried her face in her hands, riding the wave of humiliation and regret his name caused to swel inside her. She had to find some way to make him leave. Kara would never believe Lana knew nothing if he continued to stay. Her only hope was to continue to pretend she knew nothing until Caleb believed her and left. Until she\u2019d lied to herself so long she started to believe it, too.</p><p>He came out of the drugstore, walking toward her in a long, easy stride. Lana couldn\u2019t help but stare and admire his strength as he moved. The tight denim of his stil-damp jeans did nothing to hide the flexing bulges of his thighs, nor did the thin knit of his black T-shirt disguise the thick layers of muscles over his chest and ribs. He was built along a grand scale that would make it impossible to hide his bulk under regular clothing. Not that she\u2019d ever want him to hide from her. She liked looking too much. He radiated strength and power with every breath, and Lana felt herself wondering if he was completely invincible. He certainly looked like it.</p><p>He got in the car and just watched her with those dark, solemn eyes. He didn\u2019t seem in a hurry to speak or do anything until she acted first. Maybe he was just trying to be polite, since she\u2019d humiliated herself so thoroughly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clear,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got rid of the bugs. Hopefuly it wil take whoever\u2019s listening a while to realize that no one spends that much time on the makeup aisle of a drugstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then whoever is listening wil know that we know. They\u2019l either plant more or rely on whatever bugs they have planted elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike in my office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. And your car. I\u2019l cal in a team to sweep for them, but in the meantime, be careful of what you say.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shaky nod.</p><p>He started the car, and a few minutes later they were gliding along the buzz of traffic on I-70. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hotel.\u201d He glanced over for a second, and in the flash of oncoming headlights, she could see the grim set of his jaw.</p><p>Lana felt her body tighten at the memory of what he\u2019d said about room service and a big tub. Too bad it had al been a lie.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to ask him what it was. It was the giant pink elephant in the car with them, weighing her down with embarrassment. It was the way she\u2019d melted in his arms and acted like the biggest hussy ever. It was the fact that she\u2019d do just about anything to get back to the point where he was kissing her and she\u2019d thought it was real.</p><p>Where she wasn\u2019t thinking about danger for the first time in more than a year.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him in a firm, unyielding tone.</p><p>Caleb nodded and drove in silence for a couple minutes. \u201cThen I guess we\u2019re up to the topic of the bugs. I don\u2019t suppose you know who planted them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue.\u201d</p><p>He sighed as if he didn\u2019t quite believe her. \u201cIs there any chance that you accidentaly left your backpack at home one day, giving them a chance to sew a bug in the lining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I keep my life in there. Copies of my work files, photos of my family, my sketch pad. I never go anywhere without it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid of. You know what that means, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s stomach gave a sickening twist. \u201cIt means that the bug was planted by someone I know.\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked over at her with narrowed eyes. \u201cI suppose that could be true, but I was actualy thinking that it meant that whoever planted the bugs did it while you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>Cold little legs of fear scampered down her back. She hadn\u2019t thought about that, though it made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that someone you know did this?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Oh, crap. She hadn\u2019t realized at the time she said it how strange it would sound to him. Of course he wouldn\u2019t expect her to think the bugs had been planted by someone she knew, unless she knew more than she was letting on. Damn, this lying stuff was hard. She couldn\u2019t keep up with al the little strands of truth that dangled around, just waiting to be puled on so her lie would unravel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lana gathered her wits and shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think that. I was just guessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Just guessing. What aren\u2019t you teling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth flattened, losing that fulness that had been so soft and warm against her lips. She found herself hoping that they\u2019d be forced to pretend to be lovers again. It was the only way she could see a man like him kissing her.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you if you lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help me at al. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulshit. You\u2019re scared to death, but not about the news that someone\u2019s been in your apartment while you were sleeping. I\u2019d think something like that would creep you out more than it has. Why is that, Lana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but no more than you have been since I came to town. You\u2019ve been living in fear, and I\u2019l be damned if I know why you won\u2019t let me help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you won\u2019t be honest with me. At least not about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that the only honesty you\u2019ve given me since I showed up was in your shower tonight. You weren\u2019t lying then, by God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you were.\u201d Her voice was quiet, barely audible over the hum of traffic.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hands tightened on the wheel. \u201cI let things go too far. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cForget it. I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother lie for the pile?\u201d</p><p>Lana turned away and looked out the window, watching buildings slide by in the darkness. Maybe she should just disappear. Someone else could take over the foundation, and she could just go away where no one would find her. Not even Caleb. Who knows, maybe she\u2019d start some new life and find a little happiness. She didn\u2019t need much to be happy. A decent job, a few friends, a place to go home where she\u2019d feel safe. It wasn\u2019t much to ask for.</p><p>Caleb puled the car into a hotel and parked. \u201cI know that you have no reason to trust me, but I promise you that I can help. Whatever it is you\u2019re dealing with, you\u2019re not alone.\u201d</p><p>And that was the problem. If she\u2019d been alone, it would have been easy. It was al those people she cared about that chained her to her lies, her secrets. She couldn\u2019t let them get hurt. But rather than explain that to him, Lana just nodded and got out of the car.</p><p>Kara wiped a drop of blood from the video screen, so she could see Caleb\u2019s image clearly. The smal office at the back of the drugstore was cramped and hot, but it was the only place where she could view the security-camera footage. It showed her al too clearly how easily Caleb had thwarted her.</p><p>He\u2019d stripped al of Kara\u2019s toys from Lana and left them sitting next to a bottle of cheap perfume. Not fair. If she hadn\u2019t already been planning to kil him, this stunt would have been enough to convince her.</p><p>Marcus was right. Caleb\u2019s presence was going to make getting to Lana much harder. Kara had promised Marcus she\u2019d finish this tonight, but she didn\u2019t even have a clue where Lana was. Not in her apartment, certainly. Al of those cameras and microphones were stil in place, and no one was home.</p> <p>Kara kicked the corpse of the security guard in frustration. He fel from the chair onto the floor in a squishy heap, with his pants stil around his ankles. His wife was going to be pissed when they found him like this, but that was his fault for being so easy to seduce.</p><p>With her rubber gloves carefuly in place, Kara removed the VCR tape from the outdated surveilance equipment, making sure her entrance into the store wouldn\u2019t be found by the police. She was going to have to face Marcus with her failure to kil Lana tonight, but there was no way she was going to do it from behind bars. That\u2019s what Dennis was for.</p><p>Caleb went into the bathroom of their hotel room and stripped out of his wet jeans. He needed a few minutes away from Lana to gather his thoughts. Ever since the fiasco in the shower, he hadn\u2019t been able to think straight. How could he think about anything else but the way she\u2019d tasted, the sweet little sounds she\u2019d made when he\u2019d kissed her?</p><p>The scent of her need rising up with the steam of the shower? Five years from now, he\u2019d probably stil be thinking about it, wishing he\u2019d gone farther while cursing himself for having gone too far as it was. Her taste was in his memory now\u2014the scent of her hunger for him.</p><p>Caleb tossed his jeans over the shower curtain rod to dry. This shower was bigger than Lana\u2019s. They\u2019d fit in here a lot easier. He\u2019d have lots of room to maneuver when he braced her against the wal to thrust up inside her, and the endless supply of hot water would give him plenty of time to make her come over and over.</p><p>Lana would let him. He knew it without a doubt. Her reaction to him had been honest\u2014maybe the only honest thing about her. It was almost as if she needed the connection to another human, as if she was starved for affection. Or maybe just pleasure. There had been dark times in his life when he\u2019d sought out female company just to drive away the guilt and fear and loneliness. Maybe this was one of those dark times for Lana. Maybe he could ease her pain, if only for a little while.</p><p>Caleb gritted his teeth and pushed away the temptation. He was trying to justify seducing her, and there was simply no justification. She was his assignment. He had to keep his dick out of it.</p><p>Like that was going to happen.</p><p>His wet boxers did nothing to stave off his erection, but getting the clammy material off was a considerable chore with the added obstacle. He took his time, trying to think about something else, something completely unsexy\u2014anything else to ease his lust.</p><p>It took a while, but he finaly got himself under control.</p><p>Caleb stormed out of the bathroom ready to do whatever it took to get her to tel him what was going on. He would use coercion or scare tactics or whatever he had to to get her to talk. He wasn\u2019t going to let his guilt or sympathy for her get in the way of his job.</p><p>But she had falen asleep while he\u2019d been working himself up to interrogating her, and al those good intentions went out the window. She hadn\u2019t even taken off her shoes.</p><p>She was just lying there across the blankets on one of the beds, her chest rising and faling in the rhythm of sleep.</p><p>Caleb sighed and tried to fight back al the softness that seeing her like that brought up in him. There was no place in his life for softness right now, but despite his best efforts, he failed to feel anything else.</p><p>He slipped her shoes off her feet, but she didn\u2019t stir. He puled the blankets down on one side of the double bed and slid her under them. She made sleepy sounds of protest but didn\u2019t wake. She must have just been at the end of her strength. It had been a long day and he was glad she was getting some rest. Maybe it would make her more reasonable\u2014make her see that she could trust him.</p><p>Maybe it would just make her that much more stubborn and silent.</p><p>Caleb went back into the bathroom, turned on the shower, and dialed Monroe. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou were right.\u201d</p><p>Smug satisfaction hung in Monroe\u2019s voice. \u201cIs that so? What am I right about this time?\u201d</p><p>Caleb bit back an insult he would have flung at anyone but a superior officer. \u201cShe\u2019s hiding something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She just let something slip tonight. Her house was bugged, and so was her purse. Her first thought was that they\u2019d been planted by someone she knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I caled her on it and she clammed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans for getting her to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPush her until she breaks.\u201d He hated the idea, but he had to protect her.</p><p>\u201cSorry, son, but playing bad cop isn\u2019t going to work for you. Not with her. We tried that approach for hours. Just made her more stubborn. I suggest a more . . . subtle approach.\u201d</p><p>Caleb did not like the sound of this. \u201cSubtle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentle. Coaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean seduce her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeduce her. Fuck her. Whatever gets the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bastard, sir.\u201d</p><p>Monroe laughed. \u201cI remember David saying the same thing to me a few months ago. He\u2019s expecting his first child, by the way. Did you know?\u201d</p><p>Caleb had found out just before he came here. David had offered him a job with his new security company. He\u2019d never seen David happier, and it was about damn time.</p><p>The man had suffered long enough. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you and Lana\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare finish that sentence, sir.\u201d</p><p>Monroe just chuckled and moved on. \u201cI\u2019l send Grant out to clear the bugs from her apartment, car, and office. It sounds like you could use some help, and Grant\u2019s good with the ladies.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure whether to thank Monroe for the help or try to reach through and slug him for sending the biggest womanizer on the face of the planet. Then again, maybe that was a good thing, too. Grant had a way with women that boggled the mind. If anyone could convince Lana to talk, it\u2019d be Grant.</p><p>Of course, Caleb would have to kil Grant if he touched her, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>\u201cIf Grant was available, why didn\u2019t you send him here in the first place?\u201d So Caleb would never have had to know what it was like to kiss Lana.</p><p>\u201cTo piss you off. Obviously. At least that\u2019s what you\u2019l tel yourself anyway, so it works for me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stayed silent. Barely.</p><p>\u201cLet me know what you find out,\u201d ordered Monroe. \u201cGrant wil be there tomorrow. I\u2019l enjoy puling him out of whoever\u2019s bed he\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Monroe hung up, and Caleb stood there in the bathroom a long time. He didn\u2019t want Grant to come. He loved Grant like a brother and had spent more time with him in the past few years than he had alone, but that didn\u2019t change the way he felt. Once Grant was here, any chance he had with Lana was gone. Grant would toss her a wink and a smile, and they\u2019d be naked together within an hour. And when Grant left her, she wouldn\u2019t even frown. He had the magic touch, and he\u2019d used it on countless women, leaving al of them smiling.</p><p>Lana would just be one more, but at least she\u2019d be safe. That\u2019s what realy mattered.</p><p>\u201cI have another job for you,\u201d said the metalic voice Denny had grown to hate.</p><p>He grabbed a pen in his shaking hand. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve left directions in your mailbox. I want you to go to the address listed and pick up a package for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you realy want to know?\u201d asked the robot.</p><p>No. No he did not. This shit was way deeper than he\u2019d signed up for. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and wil. Bruce is coming for a visit tomorrow. I made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Denny felt his beer coming back up into his throat, and he swalowed hard to keep it down. \u201cI\u2019l find another way to get the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time for Bruce\u2019s visit?\u201d</p><p>Shit. Denny saw the image of his father\u2019s body flare in his mind. The bastard had looked like hamburger\u2014al that blood against fish-bely white skin. No way was Denny gonna let that happen to him. What the hel did he care what his boss wanted him to do? There wasn\u2019t a damn person in the whole world he cared about enough to let Bruce take that bat to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019l do it, but you\u2019re paying double.\u201d</p><p>He could almost hear the grating smile in that metalic voice. \u201cYou\u2019re a good boy, Dennis. A very good boy.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>I t was dark, but Lana could see just enough through the tiny slit in her hood to make out the bodies of her colleagues, her friends, lying lifeless on the floor of the cave. The stench of death filled the dank hole in the ground until there was no air left to breathe. Terror choked her lungs as she realized that she was the only one left\u2014the only victim left alive.</p> <p>Boris stepped over the leg of one of the dead and set up a video camera. They always filmed the beatings, the torture, the killing.</p><p>Lana tried to scream for help, but the air was too thick, and it wouldn\u2019t pass through her throat. She tried to curl into a ball to protect herself from what was to come, but her broken body wouldn\u2019t respond. She was frozen, trapped without any means of escape. Everything had been taken from her\u2014her freedom, her dignity, her control. She had nothing left to fight with.</p><p>The man picked up the heavy pipe he\u2019d beat her with yesterday and came toward her. Small flecks of blood dotted the pipe\u2019s gray surface. Her blood? Allen\u2019s?</p><p>Bethany\u2019s? They had been the last ones to die.</p><p>Lana heard the muffled thud of her killer\u2019s combat boots on the dirt floor. The emotionless eye of a video camera sat silently, watching as the man came nearer.</p> <p>He rolled his shoulders as if warming up so he wouldn\u2019t strain a muscle. Lana almost wished she hadn\u2019t been able to see. Maybe blindness would have been easier.</p><p>Not knowing what was coming.</p><p>She closed her eyes, testing the theory, but the terrifying blackness was worse.</p><p>She opened them again just as the pipe came down on her legs.</p><p>Pain roared through her system, sending her brain a jumble of signals she couldn\u2019t understand. Her limbs twitched in automatic response, but she had no control.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d came a harsh command. Miles Gentry. He leaned against the wall in an impassive stance, but his bearded face was hidden in shadow. She couldn\u2019t see him clearly.</p> <p>Lana struggled to breathe. It was all she could do, and even that was an effort. Her body was on fire, flooding her with searing waves of agony. One on top of another, so close together there wasn\u2019t time to breathe in between.</p><p>\u201cYou kill her and you\u2019ll have to go hunting for more leverage. Not smart,\u201d said Miles.</p><p>The man with the pipe turned around. \u201cIt\u2019s not about leverage. Boss says we\u2019re in the group now. We\u2019re done with her.\u201d</p><p>Miles pushed away from the wall with a bulge of strength. \u201cWhat if I want her?\u201d</p><p>The man scoffed. \u201cShe\u2019s no good for that now.\u201d</p><p>Miles shrugged. \u201cDepends on whether you like screamers or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said, handing Miles the pipe. \u201cJust finish her when you\u2019re finished with her.\u201d</p><p>He left the cave. Miles switched off the camera and came near her. She could see his face clearly now\u2014a hard mask of suppressed rage. Lana tried to curl up, but nothing moved.</p> <p>Miles leaned down close to her, looking like he ached to say something. He reached out a hand, but Lana whimpered, knowing that wherever he touched her, it was going to hurt. His hand halted in midair and curled into a fist. She prayed he\u2019d be quick and release her from her pain. She gathered the little strength she had left, begging him to kill her, \u201cPlease.\u201d It was hardly even a sound. Her lips were stuck together with dried blood, muffling the word.</p><p>Through the tiny split in her hood, she saw his expression harden further, and then he stood with a jerk. Miles shoved the pipe under the pile of dead bodies, effectively hiding it, and left her alone.</p><p>He was gone for only a blink of time before the man with the pipe was back. Somehow he\u2019d figured out where it was. He lifted it over his head and smiled, and Lana watched as the blood-flecked metal sped toward her.</p><p>Caleb woke as soon as Lana started whimpering. He threw the sheet back, crossed the smal space between the double beds, and sat down next to her. He\u2019d left the bathroom light on so she wouldn\u2019t be disoriented if she woke up in the middle of the night, and a soft glow lit one side of her face. She was sweating and shaking, curled up in a tight bal.</p><p>Something deep inside Caleb split open, filing him with a mixture of grief and self-loathing. He should have saved her. He should have found a way to prevent the beatings she suffered. He wasn\u2019t sure how, and he\u2019d spent a lot of sleepless nights trying to figure out how he could have done things differently, but he knew a better man would have found a way.</p><p>He gave her shoulder a shake, hoping to wake her up before the nightmare got any worse. At his touch, her whimpers deepened into agonized moans. Her whole body vibrated with tension.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Lana. Come back to me,\u201d he coaxed in the gentlest voice he could find beneath al his anger.</p><p>Her breathing sped, and she flailed her arms as if trying to fight him off. Caleb feared that if he restrained them, it would only frighten her more, so he let her hit him, welcoming the blows. He deserved so much worse.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lana. It\u2019s only a dream. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and finaly opened. Terror was plain on her face, and he saw her trying to sort out the reality of him sitting there from her nightmare.</p><p>Caleb smoothed her hair back from her sweaty forehead with one hand while he stroked the inside of her wrist with the other. She went stiff for a moment, then slowly relaxed as the dream lost its grasp. Her breathing was stil labored, and he could feel her pulse speeding beneath his fingers.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment and puled in a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, knowing what a stupid question it was. Of course she wasn\u2019t okay. No one who lived with nightmares like she had was okay.</p><p>\u201cJust give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>Caleb did. He sat silently, but nothing could have pried him away from her. He kept stroking her hair because he simply couldn\u2019t not do it. He had to touch her\u2014to convince himself she was safe.</p><p>A few moments later, she sat up and slid out from under the covers on the far side of the bed. Away from him. She went into the bathroom and shut the door. He heard the water run, then turn off.</p><p>She came out but kept her eyes carefuly off of him. \u201cDid I . . . did I make much noise? Wake anyone?\u201d</p><p>Caleb stood, his heart aching for her shredded pride. \u201cNo. I woke you up before you could.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quick glance, then looked away, staring at the cheap art print over his bed. \u201cThanks. I\u2019d hate to get us kicked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sharp, humorless laugh. \u201cEasier said.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stood up slowly and went to her. Light from the bathroom cast her face in shadows, but his night vision was good enough that he could stil see the humiliation staining her cheeks. He longed to see her smile again\u2014a real smile with deep twin dimples.</p><p>He knew it was a mistake to touch her, but he couldn\u2019t help himself. His hands settled on her shoulders and smoothed down her arms, reveling in the feel of her bare skin below the short sleeves of her T-shirt. A shiver went through her, but he couldn\u2019t tel if it was because she didn\u2019t want him touching her or because she liked it too much. \u201cDo you want to tel me about the dream?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her expression tightened, and he thought she was going to shut him out, but instead, she puled away and went to the far side of the hotel room. Caleb didn\u2019t folow her, respecting her need for distance.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t control them,\u201d she told him in a smal, frightened voice. \u201cThe nightmares.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t speak. He didn\u2019t even move. He didn\u2019t want to do anything to jeopardize the thin thread of trust she\u2019d offered him. He just waited, wiling her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI went to therapy. The doctor said that al I had to do was realize they were dreams and then I\u2019d be able to control them\u2014change them. He said that with practice, I\u2019d even be able to get rid of them altogether.\u201d She shook her head, and her shiny hair swung above her shoulders. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. I tried, Caleb. I swear to God I did. Every night, but these nightmares . . . they aren\u2019t just some story my head has made up. They\u2019re real. They actualy happened.\u201d He heard her throat tighten with tears, but she turned her back before he could see them.</p><p>Caleb had to clench his fists to keep from reaching out for her, to keep from puling her into his arms to offer whatever meager comfort he could. But he knew that she didn\u2019t need that now. She needed his restraint. His control. She had none of her own. It had been stripped from her eighteen months ago, and he knew then that he\u2019d do anything to find a way to give it back. Anything.</p><p>It was a scary thought for a man with the kind of resources he had.</p><p>He saw her square her shoulders and heard her sniff. When she spoke again, her voice was steady. \u201cThe doctor prescribed me some sleeping pils. They didn\u2019t stop the dreams, just made it harder to wake up from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop apologizing. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but knowing doesn\u2019t change a damn thing.\u201d She let out a gusty sigh and turned around. Her eyes were red but dry. \u201cWil you drop me off back to my office? I need to get to work on the auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get more sleep. You were only down for three hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than I get a lot of nights. I know myself wel enough to know that tonight, three is al I\u2019m going to get. If you don\u2019t want to leave, just let me borrow your car. I\u2019l come back and get you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t about to let her out of his sight. He\u2019d made some progress tonight, and he could already see her closing up, trying to revoke the trust she\u2019d offered. \u201cNo, I\u2019m happy to take you if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want. We don\u2019t know if your office is bugged, though. You\u2019l have to be careful of what you say.\u201d</p><p>She looked like she was about to say one thing but changed her mind. Instead she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry. I don\u2019t have anything to say that anyone would want to hear.\u201d</p><p>It was dark outside the First Light Foundation office, not quite three a.m. Lana could hear an occasional car drive by, but most of the city was asleep. She took a deep breath, trying to gather the courage to unlock her office door. Monsters waited in there\u2014the mess she had to clean up, the auction that was faling apart, the worry that everything she said or did was being recorded. She couldn\u2019t slip, even a little.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s big warm hand wrapped around the joint of her shoulder. She could see his thick fingers, feel the warmth of them sink through the knit of her T-shirt. She refused to wear the bra that had been handled by Kara, and she wondered if he noticed the missing strap beneath her shirt. Such a sily thing to wonder, but it popped into her head, a welcome distraction from her lack of courage.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to do it?\u201d he offered. She could feel her hair sway under his breath. He was so close. Too close. It wasn\u2019t safe for her resolve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019l do it.\u201d And she did. She turned the key in the lock, opened the door, and flipped on the lights. Her eyes ached from the searing brightness, but at least now she was no longer in the dark.</p><p>Papers were everywhere. Black fingerprint dust coated several surfaces. Blood had dried to a dark brown pool on the bathroom floor. Stacie\u2019s blood.</p><p>Lana squared her shoulders and prayed for strength. This was not going to be easy.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p>Marcus Lark regretted giving Kara his private number. The woman was growing far too clingy for his tastes.</p><p>He lifted the phone from the cradle on his bedside table and shifted his body until he was sitting against the headboard. Elaborate carvings dug into his back, but he ignored the discomfort.</p><p>\u201cYes, love?\u201d he answered in a gentle voice. He\u2019d learned long ago that Kara was more easily controled with gentleness than fear. She\u2019d grown up alone on the streets of New York and wasn\u2019t easily frightened.</p><p>Kindness, on the other hand . . . the woman would do anything for the merest scrap of approval or acceptance. That trait made her quite useful on occasion.</p><p>\u201cThey found my surveilance equipment. I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t finish the job tonight like I told you I would.\u201d She was out of breath, almost panicked.</p> <p>\u201cCalm down, love,\u201d cooed Marcus, even as his hand tightened on the phone in anger at her incompetence. \u201cEverything is fine. I\u2019ve taught you wel. Is there any trace of you on the equipment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. I was careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. And you wore gloves?\u201d He hoped not. It would be easy to make her fingerprints available in any one of the American databases. Kara was becoming too reckless, too desperate to please him, which didn\u2019t please him at al. He thought letting the CIA overhear that Lana was in danger would be enough to bring them running to save her. They\u2019d find Kara and get rid of her so he wouldn\u2019t have to do it himself.</p><p>Apparently he\u2019d misjudged.</p><p>\u201cYes. Always.\u201d</p><p>A stab of frustration made him tense up, and the woman at his side let out a sleepy sigh. Marcus forced himself to relax and lowered his voice. After last night, his bed partner needed her rest. \u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always do what you say.\u201d</p><p>Her simpering tone grated on his nerves, but he didn\u2019t let his irritation come through in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a good girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get the video?\u201d</p><p>Marcus did but knew better than to watch it. Kara\u2019s taste in entertainment was more . . . undomesticated than his. \u201cIt was lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the clip at the end?\u201d she asked in a sexy tone. \u201cThe one of us together?\u201d</p><p>Marcus stiled in shock as her words settled in. She had video of him? With her?</p><p>He kept his voice low and even, though inside he was seething in anger. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch it again right now just for you.\u201d</p><p>He slid from the high bed and walked naked across the room to his private office. A moment later, he found the encrypted e-mail she\u2019d sent and opened it. He sped through images of a young woman\u2019s terror\u2014flashes of her twisting in bed with tears streaming down her temples. Her body was contorted in fear and pain, but she didn\u2019t wake.</p> <p>Kara had done that to her. He wasn\u2019t sure whether that made him admire her or despise her. But such dedication, as ugly as it was, had its uses.</p><p>Then he saw the short clip at the end, which clearly showed his face contorted in the throes of an orgasm. Kara was in front of him on her hands and knees, and the camera\u2014wherever it had been hidden\u2014had a perfect shot of his face.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let this video get into the wrong hands. He\u2019d worked too hard to hide himself\u2014to become a man who did not exist\u2014to let Kara ruin everything. Now that the Swarm was destroyed, he was able to operate his business more easily. Profits had never been higher. He was not going to go back to being a hunted man at the head of a condemned organization.</p><p>Marcus Lark was tired of being a target.</p><p>\u201cYou naughty girl,\u201d he said into the phone. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like my picture taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I needed something to remember you by. It\u2019s horrible being without you every night. At least I have that.\u201d</p><p>And that video changed everything. If Kara was eliminated now, they\u2019d find the video. \u201cCome home to me, love. I miss you too much to let you stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to finish my work here. I promised you I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the promise. I\u2019d rather have you here.\u201d Where he could safely kil her and destroy the video.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m almost done. I\u2019l record the rest of the show for you tonight, and then I\u2019l come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said, more hastily than he should have. Then more gently, \u201cYou can\u2019t do it now, love. She\u2019s guarded now. It\u2019s too dangerous for you. Just come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be careful. I won\u2019t let you down. Not again.\u201d</p><p>Damn it! He\u2019d made too much of her failure in Armenia. He\u2019d rubbed her nose in the fact that Lana Hancock had survived, and now he had to live with that error in judgment. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to happen to you. At least wait a day or two. They\u2019l be expecting you to make a move now that your equipment was found.\u201d</p><p>A day or two was al he\u2019d need to have one of his men move in and get rid of that video. Then Kara could do whatever foolish thing she wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, as always,\u201d she said. \u201cI can find a good use for the time\u2014punish her for making things difficult and keeping me from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me what you\u2019re going to do, love,\u201d he coaxed as he sent an e-mail to one of his best hit men containing instructions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to surprise you. I\u2019m going to make you proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always proud of you, love. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He could hear her soaking up the praise. \u201cAfter I take care of things here, you\u2019l be even more proud.\u201d</p><p>After a long, unproductive talk with Stacie Cramer, Detective Hart decided to have another chat with Lana. It was midmorning, and he found her at her office, nearly finished with the chore of cleaning up the mess. The big bruiser, Caleb, was in the bathroom with the door shut, but when the bels on the door jingled, he stepped out, checking to see who was there. Jacob caught the scent of disinfectant and figured Caleb was taking care of cleaning up the blood rather than leaving it to Lana.</p><p>Good man.</p><p>Caleb nodded at him and continued his work, only this time the door was open. Jacob couldn\u2019t see any blood on the tile, not even a stain on the grout.</p><p>Jacob left Caleb to finish cleaning and turned his attention back to Lana. She looked tired today, worried, but that wasn\u2019t surprising considering what her friend had been through. Her dark hair was puled back in a short ponytail, but a bunch of the slippery strands had worked their way free and hung around her face. She was pretty in that natural, girl-next-door kind of way. There was nothing exotic in her features, but she reminded him a little of the first woman he\u2019d ever had a crush on. Miss Parish, his sixth-grade English teacher. Although he\u2019d missed most of her lectures, spending the time daydreaming instead, Miss Parish had taught him some interesting things about how his adolescent body worked.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Ms. Hancock,\u201d he greeted her. She swept a loose lock of hair behind her ear and gave him a fake smile.</p><p>\u201cHave you figured out who did this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?\u201d</p><p>She looked like she wanted to say no, but she nodded and puled up a spare chair for him to sit in.</p><p>\u201cI saw Mrs. Cramer this morning. She seems to be doing wel.\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. \u201cI talked to her on the phone earlier and she asked me to bring her work, so that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed anything missing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything unusual or out of place?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated too long, which meant she was either deciding whether or not to lie or thinking up one. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so not much intricate thinking involved in that answer, so she must have been debating about lying. Whether or not she had, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI noticed the stacks of notebooks on the desks. Is that how you left them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember. Maybe. Or it could have been something Stacie was working on.\u201d</p><p>Jacob scribbled down another note to remember to ask Stacie about it. \u201cWe found what appears to be a listening device. Do you know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>She tensed up but covered it by shooting to her feet. \u201cWould you like some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he replied as if she hadn\u2019t just tried to distract him.</p><p>She poured him a cup of coffee that looked like it had been there for several hours\u2014just like he was used to back at the station.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d he prodded. \u201cKnow any reason why your office would be bugged?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shrug that was too stiff to be nonchalant. \u201cWe don\u2019t do anything top secret here. Our financial records are public, and we certainly don\u2019t have a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said no, just given him an evasive answer. Interesting.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in this office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the furniture come with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I bought the desks and chairs. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the blinds? The artwork?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a confused frown. \u201cThe blinds were here when I moved in. The posters were free when I bought the desks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you buy them?\u201d He sipped his coffee.</p><p>\u201cThat used-furniture store two blocks down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the one,\u201d said Jacob.</p><p>\u201cCan you think of any reason why someone would want to hurt Stacie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any enemies,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone want to hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question,\u201d said Jacob.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t? Jacob wasn\u2019t sure which. What he was sure about was that Lana had a bad past. Her office was bugged. A highly decorated soldier was staying nice and close, and she was terrified.</p><p>Whatever was going on here was both bigger and uglier than he\u2019d hoped, which meant he had a lot of extra work to do. Between this and the homicide at the drugstore last night, he had his hands ful.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked her. \u201cIs there any reason someone would want to hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking al these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStandard procedure.\u201d</p><p>She raised a disbelieving brow. \u201cI have a ton of work to do.\u201d</p><p>Jacob nodded and puled out his business card. \u201cKeep this in case you think of anything else.\u201d Not that she\u2019d tel him if she did.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She took the card and set it on top of what looked like a stack of trash on her desk.</p><p>Jacob waved a hand at Caleb as he left. He wasn\u2019t sure why the man was hanging out with Lana, but he was glad Caleb was here. Jacob wouldn\u2019t have felt safe leaving the woman alone. He knew her history, and she\u2019d been through hel. The last thing he wanted was for her to go through it al again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>Lana set the phone back in the cradle and tried not to cry out of sheer frustration. One more thing was swept out of her control, adding to the growing pile. Maybe she was wearing some giant galactic KICK ME sign. That would explain a lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Caleb, crossing the office toward her. Concern narrowed his black eyes and made her want to either punch him or beg him for a hug. She did neither, just sat there, trying to stay composed.</p><p>\u201cThe hotel canceled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have reservations for tonight. I didn\u2019t want to sleep in the same place twice,\u201d he told her in a near whisper.</p><p>The bugs. In the flurry of activity, she\u2019d almost forgotten about them.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not that hotel. The hotel that agreed to host the art auction for free. They canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Lana didn\u2019t want to tel him that Oran had struck again. Shame burned bright in her cheeks, she knew, but she didn\u2019t want to say it. Knowing she was embarrassed and teling him why were two different things.</p> <p>Caleb took hold of her hand, his calused fingers gentle. He just held her hand, waiting for her to speak. She hated that about him\u2014that silent patience that urged her to spil her guts better than demanding ever could. It was hopeless to try to fight him. She had to pick and choose her battles carefuly, because there just wasn\u2019t enough energy left in her to fight them al, or to keep up with al of the lies each battle created.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend who runs the place, which is why I managed to convince the hotel to let us use the space in exchange for free advertising. The only catch was that if anyone else wanted to book at least half the rooms in the hotel, I\u2019d have to reschedule my event. Tomorrow was the last day before they couldn\u2019t bump me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone reserved the rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just someone. Oran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOran? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s throwing his engagement party the same day as the auction. Guess he figured that Brittney was a good candidate for a wife, after al. There isn\u2019t room for both events, and Oran is wiling to pay big bucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you teling me that your ex-fianc\u00e9 booked his engagement party to interfere with your auction? On purpose?\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded, humiliation burning her cheeks. \u201cProbably. I didn\u2019t fal al over myself accepting his advances the other day. This is obviously his way of punishing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me his address and I\u2019l have a talk with him.\u201d The words were steady, but she heard the anger that strung them together.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t you dare interfere. I\u2019ve made my peace about him and that\u2019s the end of it. Let him think he\u2019s won some imaginary battle. I don\u2019t care anymore. I\u2019l figure something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should postpone the auction. There\u2019s a lot happening right now, and a big public event might not be the best thing.\u201d</p><p>Lana felt panic wel up from deep inside her. If she gave up on the auction, she\u2019d have nothing left to work for. The foundation would crumble, and she\u2019d have to find another reason to get out of bed in the morning. The possibility that she might not be able to find that reason was more than just scary, it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I need to do this.\u201d She heard the desperation in her voice and wished she could hide her feelings better.</p><p>Caleb gave her a slow nod, and she could tel by the carefuly neutral expression on his face that he\u2019d seen her panic. \u201cOkay, so we do this. Together.\u201d</p> <p>No, no, no. Not that sweet voice of temptation again. She could not lean on him. He\u2019d leave soon, and then what would she do? How would she get along on her own? It was best if she didn\u2019t relax at al. She had so little control in her life that if she let go even a little, she\u2019d never recover.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ve got it under control.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knelt down in front of her and reached out. His big hands swalowed hers, the tanned skin of his fingers dark against the paler skin of her wrists. His touch was warm. Comforting.</p><p>Damn it, she could not do this. She could not give in to that lure of comfort.</p><p>\u201cLet me help,\u201d he said, ducking his head so he could look into her eyes. \u201cYou have al kinds of volunteers at the youth center. I\u2019l just be one more. What\u2019s the harm in that?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea the temptation he was, so steady and confident in the midst of her chaotic world. Al she had to do was grab a hold and let his strength add to the last dwindling reserves of her own. He was such a dangerous seduction, puling at her senses as if he\u2019d been made just for that purpose. Everything about him appealed to her</p><p>\u2014those sinfuly dark eyes, the way he used his size to shield rather than intimidate her, his quiet patience. The devil himself couldn\u2019t have devised a more appealing temptation.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get in your way,\u201d he said. She felt the calused pad of his thumb rasp over the back of her hand, and it sent little jolts of sensation streaking up her arms. Right to her heart. Just like the rest of him.</p><p>Lana closed her eyes in defeat. What use was it to fight him? He\u2019d just win in the end, anyway. She was tired of fighting. She was just plain tired in general. At least if Caleb helped her through the auction, the kids would have the funding they needed. If she had to figure out a way to live without his help when he left, then she\u2019d do it for the kids. When he left, they\u2019d stil need her, and she\u2019d stil be here to help them. One way or another. She wasn\u2019t sure what that way would be, but she\u2019d figure it out later.</p><p>\u201cFine. You can help, but you\u2019re taking orders from me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave her a grin. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my first order is for you to never cal me \u2018ma\u2019am\u2019 again.\u201d</p><p>Caleb was pleased with his progress. Lana trusted him enough to let him help with her beloved foundation, which was more than he\u2019d ever dreamed. He knew how much it meant to her, or rather, how much the kids she helped meant to her. He\u2019d seen the way she doted on them at the youth center\u2014the way they cheered and clung to her when she showed up. The fact that she\u2019d alow him to help her keep that love going was enough to put a smile in his heart. He was sure now that she didn\u2019t hate him, which was a miracle, but one he was wiling to accept with great satisfaction.</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t going to let her down. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about charity auctions, but he knew plenty about organizing men toward a common goal.</p><p>It was nearly four when the bels on the office door jingled. Grant Kent came stroling in, his long-legged stride casual as a Sunday drive. Sun bounced off Grant\u2019s blond hair, which was tousled as if he\u2019d just gotten out of bed. Likely with some wiling woman he\u2019d passed on his way into town.</p><p>Grant had a way with the ladies that Caleb could only marvel at. It wasn\u2019t just that he got a lot of women, it\u2019s that he couldn\u2019t seem to help it. Ladies flocked to him. It was enough to make a man question his sanity\u2014or at least physics. There was definitely some sort of warp in the space\u2013time\u2013chick continuum around him.</p><p>Lana looked up as Grant walked in, the phone plastered to her ear as it had been for the past hour. She was trying to find an alternate hotel, with little success.</p><p>For a moment, Caleb felt his gut tighten with jealousy. Never before had he cared that Grant was a ladies\u2019 man, but he did now. He didn\u2019t want Grant going anywhere near Lana with his magic dick.</p><p>Smoothly, Caleb stepped up, putting his body squarely between Grant and Lana. Or at least he thought he\u2019d been smooth. Grant just grinned as he shook Caleb\u2019s hand and puled him into a hard hug. \u201cPossessive much?\u201d asked Grant quietly.</p><p>Caleb puled away from the hug but held his position, blocking Lana from sight. As soon as Grant got one look at her, he\u2019d want to pursue her and al that sweet, classic beauty. What man wouldn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t mind if I go introduce myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the phone,\u201d said Caleb, his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l get off soon enough.\u201d The double meaning of Grant\u2019s words were clear, his tone teasing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cut off any body part of yours that touches her,\u201d warned Caleb.</p><p>\u201cAh, so I was wrong about the possessive thing. Thanks for clearing that up.\u201d Grant\u2019s golden eyes were glittering with amusement.</p><p>Caleb growled.</p><p>Grant went on tiptoe and leaned over to see past Caleb\u2019s body. \u201cShe\u2019s cute, but she looks a little stressed. Either you haven\u2019t nailed her yet or you\u2019re not very good at it.</p><p>Want some pointers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kent.\u201d</p><p>Grant just laughed and puled Caleb into another man-hug. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you. You wouldn\u2019t believe what they\u2019ve had me doing the past few months, but I\u2019l have to tel you later, when I\u2019ve cleared this place. Al those extra eyes and ears make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring a team with you?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cJust two.\u201d</p><p>Whoever was watching and listening to Lana already knew they knew about the surveilance, so there was no reason not to discuss the sweep Grant was here to do. Caleb knew better than to ask whom he\u2019d come with when there was stil a chance that everything they said was being listened to. The men Monroe sent would not be just any soldiers. They\u2019d be Delta Force, with plenty of secrets to keep, including their names.</p><p>\u201cWhen wil you start the sweep?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>Grant jerked his head toward where Lana chatted on the phone with yet another hotel, trying to find a place to hold her auction. \u201cDepends on the woman\u2019s constitution.</p><p>Think she can stomach watching this?\u201d</p><p>Caleb had witnessed the kind of emotions that went along with learning that a person\u2019s privacy had been invaded. They felt violated. Betrayed. Angry and afraid. Caleb would have preferred not to subject Lana to that, but he knew the woman never backed down from a bad situation. \u201cShe\u2019s tougher than she looks,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>Grant grunted. \u201cWouldn\u2019t be hard. She looks like she\u2019d fal over if you shouted too loud.\u201d</p><p>Caleb turned and stared at Lana, trying to see what Grant did. Sure, she wasn\u2019t a bodybuilder or anything, but there was a quiet sort of strength about her. A steel beneath the softness that Caleb had seen with his own eyes. Maybe that was the difference. Caleb had seen Lana through the worst kind of hel a person could suffer, and she\u2019d never given up. Grant had no idea what she was capable of, and for some reason, it gave Caleb a little spurt of satisfaction. He and Lana had a connection. Maybe not a fun one, but the kind that was born of pain and fear and survival. Even if Grant did seduce her, there was no way he\u2019d ever be able to match that.</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of doing it any other way, buddy. I\u2019l get the gear and be back.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded absently, stil staring at Lana. He loved looking at her\u2014loved the way her shiny dark hair swung around her face, how she\u2019d tuck a wayward lock behind her ear only to have it slip out again a second later. He loved the way her dark lashes covered her eyes when she was trying not to let him catch her watching him. He loved the sweet curve of her cheek and how a real smile would cause those twin dimples to show up out of nowhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wished things between them had been different, but he was glad that he\u2019d had the chance to know her, regardless of their past. Women as strong and selfless as her were rare, and knowing one made him feel like he\u2019d been given a gift.</p><p>Lana hung up the phone and was watching him with a suspicious frown. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t keep his distance, even though he knew that was the smart thing to do. Any excuse he could find to touch her, he took advantage of. This was one of those times. Caleb squatted down so he was on eye level with her. She had the most amazing eyes, with so many shades of blue, that for a second he found himself distracted.</p><p>Caleb blinked and focused on what was happening. He kept his voice low, though by now, it wasn\u2019t a big issue if their listeners knew what was happening. The bugs would be gone within the hour. \u201cIn a minute, they\u2019re going to do a sweep. You might not like what they find, and I think it wil be easier on you if we go grab some food and let them work.\u201d</p> <p>She arched a dark brow. \u201cYou think that I\u2019m going to let complete strangers into my office to rummage around? I just got finished cleaning up from the last guy who did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t strangers. They\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you staying with them while they do this sweep thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d go with you.\u201d</p><p>Lana shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d rather stay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sure? This can be hard to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at doing the hard stuff,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Caleb gave her a smile and tucked some hair behind her ear. \u201cI know you are, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be. Let\u2019s get out of here for a while. Go see the kids at the youth center. Get your mind off of it.\u201d</p><p>She went tense as if he\u2019d slapped her, and the center of her eyes shrank to frightened pinpoints. What the hel?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her in a low, urgent voice.</p><p>She swalowed and blinked, and just like that, the fear was gone, leaving behind a smooth mask of neutrality. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>Just like that she shut down, and al the warmth in her eyes evaporated. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Going to the youth center is a great idea. I\u2019l meet you in the car.\u201d She grabbed her backpack, tossed him the office keys, and left the building.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>The youth center was stuffed ful of kids, their cheerful noise ricocheting off the high ceiling of the gym. The thrum of bouncing basketbals and squeak of tennis shoes filed one side of the gym while the other was quieter. Three long tables lined the space, and several of the volunteers sat with kids, reading to them or helping them with their homework.</p><p>Lana just stood in the doorway, drinking in the joy she\u2019d created. It was a happy place, a safe place. At least for everyone but her.</p><p>Kara saw her come in and crossed the large room with Phil hot on her heels. Kara wore a starched white shirt under her tailored peach pants suit. Her hair was in an elegantly casual updo, showing off the sparkle of diamond studs in her earlobes. She was such a classy-looking lady, it was hard to believe she was also a kiler.</p><p>Lana felt Caleb\u2019s wide hand smooth over her back as if trying to comfort her. She straightened her shoulders and cleansed her expression of al emotion.</p><p>\u201cBack so soon?\u201d asked Phil, giving Caleb a scowl. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to see you today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI needed a break from planning the auction,\u201d said Lana, praying her voice wouldn\u2019t shake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard. Anything we can do to help?\u201d asked Kara in that elegantly rich voice of hers that made Lana\u2019s skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. It\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard. Is it true the hotel canceled?\u201d asked Phil.</p><p>Lana swalowed an ugly word. Bad news traveled too fast, even for a city the size of Columbia. \u201cYes, but we\u2019l find another one.\u201d</p><p>The front door of the youth center opened and Lana\u2019s sister, Jenny, stormed in, carrying her son, Taylor. Lana flinched and tried to cover it before anyone could see.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Jenny or Taylor anywhere near Kara. She needed to get rid of them. Now.</p><p>Lana felt panic bubbling up inside her as she tried to figure out the best way to protect her family.</p><p>From beside her, she heard Caleb say, \u201cIt\u2019s under control.\u201d His deep, calm voice brushed over her raw nerves, soothing them.</p><p>She could do this. Al she had to do was act normal\u2014like nothing was wrong. Kara didn\u2019t even have to know who Jenny was. Hopefuly the family resemblance wouldn\u2019t give them away as sisters.</p><p>Jenny set down Taylor, who ran eagerly across the room on chubby legs toward Lana. She stepped away from the group and bent down to catch him in her arms, enjoying the solid weight of her two-year-old nephew.</p><p>\u201cKiss?\u201d he asked, angling his cheek for the greeting he expected.</p><p>Lana gave him a kiss and he squirmed in her arms, pushing against her so he could get down. Lana didn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>Jenny stomped up to Lana. Her dark hair was a mess, as if she\u2019d been running her hands through it. Or possibly trying to pul it out.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much you upset Mom?\u201d Jenny demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past two days listening to her cry. You\u2019re going to go home and apologize to her if I have to drag you there myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I realy am. I didn\u2019t mean for you to be the one to deal with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought about that before you told her you didn\u2019t need her.\u201d</p><p>Taylor pushed hard against Lana\u2019s neck in an effort to get down.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to come out like that. I was worried about Stacie, and you know how she is in a crisis. I couldn\u2019t deal with her, too.\u201d</p><p>Jenny rubbed her temples. \u201cDamn it, Lana. You\u2019ve got to be more careful with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lana,\u201d mimicked Taylor as he tried to get out of her arms.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s face darkened and she let out a weary sigh. \u201cLet him down. He\u2019l be fine playing with the other kids for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like holding him,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, wel, I don\u2019t want him hearing what I have to say to you.\u201d Jenny puled Taylor from Lana\u2019s arms and set him on the floor. He toddled off toward the flurry of activity on the basketbal court.</p><p>Lana shifted her body so she could keep a careful eye on him. Between him and those tempting basketbals roling around the floor were Caleb, Kara, and Phil, and Taylor was headed right toward them. Lana tensed. No way was Kara going near her baby nephew.</p><p>And if she did, Lana was going to . . . what? Scream at her? Attack her? The only way she could keep Taylor safe was to pretend that it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d demanded Jenny in a frustrated voice.</p><p>Lana nodded her head vaguely. Taylor was headed straight for Kara.</p><p>Kara saw her watching the boy and gave Lana a smile.</p><p>Oh, God. She couldn\u2019t do this.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>\u201cI said that I can\u2019t keep cleaning up your messes with Mom,\u201d continued Jenny. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own problems to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Kara took a step to the left and reached out her arms to little Taylor. Her eyes never left Lana\u2019s.</p><p>It was a test. Kara was testing her to see if she knew who Kara was. If Lana failed, Kara would know, and if Kara knew, Lana\u2019s life and the lives of those she loved would be in jeopardy.</p><p>Jenny shook Lana\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to a word I say, are you? What is it with you lately?\u201d</p><p>Kara lifted Taylor\u2019s compact weight into her arms and cuddled him.</p><p>Lana\u2019s insides hardened and threatened to shatter. On the outside, she didn\u2019t react, not by so much as a fluttering of an eyelash.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s voice rose a notch. \u201cYou don\u2019t give a crap about the rest of the family after everything we did to help you. Mom was right. You are ungrateful.\u201d</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t have answered if her life depended on it. It took everything she had to keep herself from ripping Taylor out of Kara\u2019s arms. Her whole body trembled as she fought the urge.</p><p>Kara kissed Taylor\u2019s offered cheek, leaving behind an ugly blotch of lipstick. Phil ruffled Taylor\u2019s baby-fine hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d said Jenny. \u201cI\u2019m done trying to help. The next time Mom wants a tearfest, I\u2019m sending her to your place.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave Lana an odd look, but she barely registered it. He reached over to Taylor and wiped the lipstick off his chubby cheek and smoothed his hair back in place.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s arms shot up toward Caleb, and he puled Taylor from Kara\u2019s arms.</p><p>Lana had to lock her knees to keep from colapsing to the ground. She puled in a shaky breath and let it out slowly. Dizziness threatened to make her faint, but she managed to stay upright. \u201cYou should leave,\u201d she told her sister.</p><p>\u201cSo now you\u2019re sending me away like you did Mom? What the hel is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should go on a vacation. A cruise. Take Mom and Dad. I\u2019l pay.\u201d She sounded desperate, but she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Jenny\u2019s anger dissolved into a concerned frown. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the money for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l find it somewhere. Take out a loan.\u201d</p><p>Caleb set Taylor down and led him by the hand to the edge of the basketbal court. He found an unused bal and handed it to the toddler.</p><p>Taylor wrapped his arms around it and grinned up at Caleb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l take out a loan on what?\u201d asked Jenny. \u201cYou don\u2019t own anything. I bet you haven\u2019t even paid off the Saturn yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just go. Set it up and tel me how much it costs. I\u2019l find a way to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been horrible to al of you, and I want to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Jenny tilted her head. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. Why do you want us al gone? Is there something wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she lied. \u201cI\u2019m just dealing with a lot of stress with the fundraiser coming up, and as much as I love you al, it would be nice to have a little space.\u201d</p><p>Kara gave Lana one last perusing stare before she went to where some of the younger kids were coloring. Phil was right on her heels, and Caleb was splitting his attention between Taylor and Lana.</p><p>\u201cSo, you want me to take Mom and Dad and spend a week trapped on a boat with them? I can see how much you love me. Besides, Dad would never leave his roses for that long. You\u2019re just going to have to suffer. You\u2019re stuck with us, sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please do what you can to keep them out of my hair for a couple weeks. Please? I need some space. Just until the fundraiser is over.\u201d</p><p>Jenny\u2019s jaw tightened, but she nodded. \u201cYou owe me big-time. Once you get back on your feet, I\u2019m going to take you up on that offer to pay for a cruise, only I\u2019m going with Todd. Alone. You\u2019re babysitting\u2014both Taylor and Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>Jenny motioned toward Caleb. \u201cIs he the guy Mom told me about?\u201d</p><p>Lana stifled a groan. \u201cShe\u2019s probably already writing the wedding invitations in her head.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite that bad, though I do have to admit that hearing Mom talk about what a nice butt he has gave me the wilies.\u201d</p><p>Caleb saw them watching him, so he picked up Taylor and headed their way.</p><p>\u201cTaylor likes him, which is a good sign. Is it serious?\u201d asked Jenny.</p><p>\u201cDead serious.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb split his attention between Lana\u2019s art lesson and Kara. He didn\u2019t trust the woman, and Lana\u2019s reaction to her was only making him more suspicious.</p><p>He phoned Monroe and had him run a quick background check on her. There was nothing out of the ordinary. Her record was clean other than a single speeding ticket.</p><p>Stil, something was off. Caleb moved to a quiet corner and dialed Grant. \u201cGot any men to spare for surveilance duty?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Lana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Another woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou dog,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cThis is serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Give me details.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave him Kara\u2019s car make, model, and license plate and her address from the background check. \u201cKeep an eye on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Grant hung up, and Caleb went back to the group.</p><p>The finger painting went on in messy glee as the kids smeared globs of color over giant sheets of paper. They were cute wearing too-large men\u2019s shirts that hung over their smal frames like tents, protecting their clothes. One young girl in particular caught Caleb\u2019s eye. Her long braided pigtails reminded him of his sister, Hannah, when she was five.</p> <p>She had a smear of pink paint on one cheek, and she was frowning in concentration as she tried to place one more perfect petal on her flower.</p><p>Lana crouched down beside the girl and said something Caleb couldn\u2019t hear. The girl listened carefuly, as if Lana was teling her the secret of life. A minute later, Lana produced a paintbrush from the smock she wore over her clothes and handed it to the girl. The little girl\u2019s eyes brightened, and she took the brush as if it were a delicate instrument. Lana guided her hand over the paper, and after a moment, the flower had a set of neat petals. The girl\u2019s smile was wide as Lana left her with the new toy and came to stand beside him.</p><p>\u201cTina has advanced beyond mere fingers,\u201d said Lana, grinning as she watched the girl.</p><p>\u201cI see. A Picasso in training.\u201d</p><p>Lana wrinkled her nose. \u201cI see more Monet than Picasso in her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt a smile stretch his mouth. \u201cThe kids love you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to love someone who gives you a fun place to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but they don\u2019t need to know that. Not at this age. Just let them play.\u201d</p><p>Caleb watched as Tina carefuly dipped the brush in green paint and went after the leaves of her flower with the same intense concentration she did the petals. \u201cTina looks more like she\u2019s working than playing.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s ful mouth flattened with sadness. \u201cShe\u2019s had it rough. Her dad\u2019s in prison. She spent the first several years of her life in the room next to the one where her mom turned tricks to make ends meet.\u201d</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to a child, and he was torn between anger at Tina\u2019s mother and sympathy that life had backed her into a corner where she thought she had no choice. \u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>Lana sighed. \u201cHer mom is stil a prostitute, but at least Tina doesn\u2019t have to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I keep teling myself. I can\u2019t fix al the world\u2019s problems, but at least I can do some good. I just hope that I get to keep doing it.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s arm was around her before he even realized it moved. She felt good there, and he was getting way too familiar with the feel of her body against his. \u201cWe\u2019l find a way to make the auction happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how. I can\u2019t find any hotel wiling to rent us space for what I can pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not use this place? It\u2019s big enough to hold a crowd, and there\u2019s that giant basebal field outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place isn\u2019t swanky enough for the kind of crowd we\u2019l be puling in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo pul in a different crowd. Aim to attract the middle class rather than the rich folks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I need the rich folks and al their nice money,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>\u201cYou can earn just as much money if you attract a larger crowd of not-so-rich people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do I do that? I\u2019m not a fundraising genius, no matter how many books I read. This is the only thing that\u2019s ever worked for me in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a carnival instead of an art auction? You might even be able to draw in more kids if their parents see what good work you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know the first thing about setting up a carnival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just so happens that my buddy Grant and I do. We\u2019ve helped with two carnivals for the families at Fort Bragg, and they both were big hits.\u201d They hadn\u2019t been large carnivals, but she didn\u2019t need to know that. He was sure he could pul this off.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the money to rent rides and I\u2019m not entirely convinced they\u2019re safe, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rides, then. Just some games and plenty of junk food.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with a hopeful expression. \u201cYou realy think something like that could earn money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it can. If you want, have the art auction be part of the event. Not everyone who\u2019s rich is too snobby to show up just because it\u2019s not a nice banquet room.\u201d</p><p>He could see his idea growing on her. Those blue eyes sparkled as excitement took over the fear that seemed to lurk constantly under the surface.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019l try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lana didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Stacie looked stronger today, her color better. Lana came to visit bearing pizza and a stack of magazines she\u2019d seen Stacie reading during her lunch break. Caleb was a silent shadow at her back, and she\u2019d nearly gotten used to having him around. It was dangerous to become accustomed to his company, but she couldn\u2019t think of any way around it, not that she\u2019d tried very hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel,\u201d said Stacie, eyeing the magazines. \u201cI\u2019ve been bored out of my mind today. Wel, the part of it that I wasn\u2019t asleep, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lana puled the roling table nearby and helped Stacie raise the head of the bed. \u201cYou should be getting your rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m getting plenty of that. They\u2019ve had me walking around a bit today, and it\u2019s worn me out both times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know when they\u2019re going to release you yet?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cProbably not tomorrow, but maybe the day after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anyone who can help you at home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Lana hadn\u2019t even thought that far ahead, and she felt horrible that her head had been so ful of her own problems. \u201cI\u2019l come stay with you,\u201d offered Lana.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. You\u2019ve got the auction to worry about. Besides, I caled my sister, and she\u2019s going to fly in for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you had a sister,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>Stacie gave her a sad smile. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken in years. It seems foolish now that I\u2019d let a little squabble get in the way. I figured I\u2019d been stubborn long enough. Al Sarah needed was an invitation back into my life and she was on the next flight out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to deal with any uncomfortable family issues on top of your injury.\u201d</p><p>Stacie took Lana\u2019s hand. Her skin felt cool and thin. \u201cIf being shot brings Sarah back into my life, it\u2019s more than worth it. Sometimes it\u2019s the tragedies that bring people together.\u201d Stacie\u2019s eyes slid to Caleb, just briefly, but Lana saw it.</p><p>Lana wasn\u2019t sure Stacie was right, but she didn\u2019t want to argue with the woman while she was lying there in a hospital bed. \u201cIf you need anything, just let me know,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>\u201cWhen Sarah gets here, I\u2019l have everything I need.\u201d</p><p>They shared pizza, and Lana could see Stacie tiring before her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave and let you get some rest, but you\u2019l cal if you need anything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil. I promise. Oh, and tel Kara thanks for the flowers, wil you? She left them while I was sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKara was here?\u201d asked Lana.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the nurse said. I felt bad that I didn\u2019t wake up for her visit.\u201d</p><p>Lana could picture Kara standing over Stacie\u2019s bed, watching her sleep. Helpless. Alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l tel her,\u201d lied Lana as she hurried out of the room. Stacie was fine. She kept teling herself that over and over, but it didn\u2019t make that sick feeling in her stomach go away.</p><p>She had to get out of here\u2014away from the stench of death and pain and hopelessness. She felt Caleb\u2019s silent bulk at her back, keeping pace with her rushed steps.</p><p>When Lana passed through the automatic doors of the hospital, she puled in the clean night air, trying to drive out the hospital stench that filed her lungs.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her limbs were shaking, but she managed a weak nod.</p><p>As if he\u2019d heard her thoughts, Caleb took her hand and twined his fingers through hers. Such a smal thing, but it offered so much comfort. Skin against skin. Human contact.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about her,\u201d said Lana, feeling the relief of being able to speak the truth, even if it wasn\u2019t the whole truth.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be recovering wel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I mean I\u2019m worried that whoever did this to her wil try to come back and finish the job.\u201d</p><p>Caleb puled her to a halt and ran his hands over her bare arms. She hadn\u2019t realized until now that she was covered in goose bumps. \u201cI can post a guard outside her door if it wil make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded and made a brief phone cal. He gave an order for a guard and said Stacie\u2019s room number. As easily as that, Stacie was protected.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>They got into his car, having left hers behind so it could also be checked for listening or tracking devices. \u201cWhere to now?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>Lana\u2019s brain ground to a halt. She couldn\u2019t go back home, not with the knowledge that the place might stil be bugged. She didn\u2019t want to sleep in the office, because she knew she\u2019d spend the night thinking about Stacie\u2019s attack. She didn\u2019t have the money to stay in a hotel, and she wasn\u2019t about to sleep in her car. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t started the engine yet, and inside the car it was quiet. The darkness outside was driven away by the bright lights of the parking lot, leaving deep pockets of shadows over the car\u2019s interior. Caleb turned sideways in his seat, adjusting his big body beneath the wheel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you alone tonight,\u201d he told her. \u201cWherever you go, I go.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d have been lying to herself if she pretended not to be relieved that she wouldn\u2019t have to be alone with her nightmares. He\u2019d been with her twice during those dreams and hadn\u2019t shown any sign he was disgusted by her weakness. She knew he was a good actor, but she preferred to believe he was being honest. \u201cMaybe Mr. Simmons wil let me use another apartment tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can go back to your own apartment if you like. We had a team sweep it for bugs, too, and a man\u2019s been posted guard to keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy go to al this trouble when there\u2019s nothing I can offer you in return?\u201d</p><p>Shadows outlined his wide jaw and accentuated the high ridge of his cheekbone. He was watching her with a hint of sadness in those black eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019re scared, but I hope that you\u2019l figure out you can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Lana ached to give in to the hope she heard in his voice. He wanted her to trust him, and she wanted the same thing, but she knew better. He was only one man. He couldn\u2019t possibly protect everyone she cared about, and even if he puled in whatever resources were at his disposal, Lana couldn\u2019t bring herself to trust them. Too many lives were at stake. Al she had to do was keep her mouth shut and everyone would be okay.</p> <p>She just had to pretend a little longer and Kara would go away.</p><p>Lana looked away, feigning interest in an older couple getting into their car a few yards away. The little old man opened the door for the little old lady and tucked her into the seat as if she were the most precious treasure on earth.</p><p>She wondered if they knew how lucky they were to have each other.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to trust you with,\u201d she lied. \u201cI wish I could help you, but I don\u2019t know what it is you want me to do or say.\u201d</p><p>His expression hardened, and she saw that faint hope in his eyes die. \u201cWould you feel safer in a hotel, or would you rather go home?\u201d</p> <p>At home at least she had work to distract her. \u201cIf I go home, are you sure no one wil be listening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. These men are nothing if not thorough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then. I\u2019l go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you trust me about that. It\u2019s something, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Lana realized with a shock that it was true. She did trust him enough to believe he\u2019d take care of the bugs when he said so. Maybe it was foolish to trust so easily, but she couldn\u2019t seem to help herself. She prayed she wasn\u2019t getting in over her head with Caleb, even as she feared it was already too late.</p><p>Grant was sitting outside Lana\u2019s apartment on guard duty when Caleb puled in. He\u2019d managed to avoid getting the two of them together earlier today because she\u2019d been stuck on the phone, but now there was no reason not to introduce her to his womanizing buddy.</p> <p>Damn it, there was no way he was going to sit by while Grant seduced Lana with his charming smile or whatever it was about him that had women\u2019s panties faling off at every turn.</p><p>If Lana\u2019s panties were coming off, Caleb wanted to be the one doing it.</p><p>Grant unfolded his lean body from the car, stretching for a moment before striding toward them. He had the build of a runner, with long, lean muscles rather than the heavier bulk of Caleb\u2019s build. They\u2019d been friends for nearly a decade, and Caleb would do anything for the man.</p><p>Anything except let him have Lana.</p><p>They met on the sidewalk, and Grant had that panty-dropping smile on his face. \u201cYou must be Lana,\u201d he said, reaching his hand out for her to shake.</p><p>Lana gave Caleb a questioning glance as if to ask if Grant was safe. Caleb wanted to hesitate, to give her just a hint of a reason to keep her distance, but he just couldn\u2019t do it. Not to Grant. The man had puled his ass out of more fires than he cared to remember, and he couldn\u2019t repay him that way.</p><p>Caleb nodded, giving Lana a reassuring smile. \u201cHe\u2019s safe,\u201d he said, wishing the words back the moment they left his lips.</p><p>Lana took his hand and Grant did that just-hold-it thing that seemed to make women swoon. Caleb wasn\u2019t sure how he did it without coming off as stalker material, but he did. Every damn time. \u201cI\u2019m Grant. At your service.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb waited for the slow smile of feminine approval to dimple her cheeks, but it never came. Instead, she puled her hand back as soon as was polite and took half a step nearer to Caleb.</p><p>He felt like he\u2019d just won the freaking lottery. That smal show of trust was worth more to him than every penny he\u2019d ever made. The surprised grin Grant shot him only made the feeling sweeter.</p><p>\u201cYou two in for the night?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>Caleb had told Lana he was going to stay with her, but he hadn\u2019t actualy explained to her that he meant to stay by her side. No more hanging out in the car waiting for her nightmares to strike. If she had another bout of bad dreams, he was going to be right there. He owed her that much.</p><p>Or maybe that was just a handy excuse to get himself in her door. Either way, he didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t going to leave her to suffer alone.</p><p>Lana licked her lips in a nervous gesture, and Caleb felt that lick al the way to his toes. Wanting her and not being able to have her wasn\u2019t pleasant, but it sure was easy. As easy as breathing.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d answered Caleb before Lana had a chance to argue.</p><p>\u201cThe place is spotless, so feel free to do . . . you know, whatever.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knew exactly what whatever was, and there wasn\u2019t going to be any of that going on. Stil, Grant didn\u2019t need to know that. \u201cGood night,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>Lana looked confused but said nothing.</p><p>Caleb shifted his duffel bag and held out his hand. \u201cGive me the keys and I\u2019l go in first.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a second before saying, \u201cNo. I need to do this. I can\u2019t stand the thought of being frightened out of my own home. Such as it is.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt a new spark of pride for the woman. She was no wilting flower, and he loved that about her.</p><p>Lana unlocked the door and stepped inside. The apartment was a little worse for wear thanks to the search Grant and his team had done. One of the electrical outlet covers was cracked, and several of her books were lying in a stack on the floor. Her couch cushions were crooked, and her TV was missing.</p><p>Caleb shut and locked the door, giving Lana time to absorb her home. She just stood there, stil and calm, looking at everything slowly. Tears weled up in her eyes but did not fal.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t stand to see her suffer. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, hoping she wouldn\u2019t pul away. She stood in the loop of his arms for a long time. The honeysuckle scent of her skin filed the space between them, and Caleb fought the urge to bury his face in her hair and breathe her in.</p><p>Without realizing it, his thumbs were stroking over her stomach as if searching for a patch of bare skin. He stiled his wayward hands and just waited. He\u2019d hold her al night, if that\u2019s what she needed, and consider himself privileged to be given the honor.</p><p>A few minutes later, he watched her pul herself together. It was a miraculous thing to behold. First the tears that had never falen disappeared, then her shoulders squared, her chin lifted, and she seemed to grow a couple inches taler. One moment she appeared fragile and delicate, the next she had the stance of a warrior maid bent on battle.</p><p>Caleb felt his world shift just then, like the ground beneath him had vanished for a split second. He knew then he was lost. If she\u2019d been weaker or more bitter, he could have resisted. If she\u2019d become cold and cynical, he would have been safe. But she was none of those things. She was selfless warmth and enduring strength, and he couldn\u2019t help but love her.</p><p>It was the biggest mistake of his life, and there was nothing he could do to stop himself. He\u2019d falen in love with a woman who could never love him back.</p><p>Lana let the hot water spray against her skul and tried not to think about the last time she was in this shower. With Caleb.</p><p>Of course, trying not to think of something only made her think about it more, and eventualy her body was aching, her movements jerky with need. Man, what she wouldn\u2019t have given for one of those detachable shower massagers right now. She\u2019d have taken care of business and gone to bed with a smile. But instead she just stood there, aching for more than she was wiling to let herself have.</p><p>Caleb.</p><p>His presence was no longer jarring when she\u2019d turn and see him nearby. She\u2019d gotten used to his casual touches\u2014a hand on her shoulder, tucking hair behind her ear, lacing his fingers with hers. She wasn\u2019t sure how that had happened. She hadn\u2019t been comfortable even with casual touches from anyone but the kids in a long time. He\u2019d ducked under her guard when she wasn\u2019t looking, and he\u2019d stayed there. And now she wanted him. There was no denying how she felt\u2014it would only be a waste of precious energy.</p><p>The question was, what was she prepared to do about it? Could she realy let herself get physicaly involved with a man she knew would leave soon? Could she find the strength to resist the pul he had on her?</p><p>Lana turned the water warmer. She\u2019d heard that a cold shower was better for unquenched lust, but she wasn\u2019t a sadist, and no amount of water, cold or otherwise, was going to quench her thirst for the real thing.</p><p>\u201cYou okay in there?\u201d came his deep voice through the door.</p><p>Lana\u2019s body heated at the sound, and she briefly thought about asking him to join her. Take up where they left off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just getting out now.\u201d She turned off the water and let it drip from her hair. She was going to need every second she could get to pul her defenses back up. A man like Caleb was a powerful force to withstand, but in the end, there wasn\u2019t much choice but to try to fight and hope he\u2019d leave before she crumbled.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>I t was dark. She knew the moment the nightmare began but was powerless to stop it. The fear came first, followed by the pain, then the fear of more pain. An endless, hungry cycle that ripped at her sanity until she was screaming for mercy.</p><p>Then he was there, light streaming down behind him, casting his features into shadow and forming a halo around his head. He held her in his strong arms and she knew she was safe.</p><p>Or at least she thought she was.</p><p>The dream shifted as time reversed. The man with the pipe was dead. Caleb had killed him, but he didn\u2019t get them all. Four of them had run and escaped to torment her. It would never stop. The fear. The pain. It would never stop. She was trapped. Helpless. She had no control. No control.</p><p>Screams tore at Lana\u2019s throat until al that came out was a ragged gasp for air. Caleb tried to shake her awake, but she was apparently trapped in her nightmare. Every light in her bedroom burned bright, and he wondered how she\u2019d falen asleep at al, much less stayed asleep while he was shaking her, shouting her name.</p><p>Then he remembered the sleeping pils. She had trouble waking up when she took them.</p><p>Caleb gathered her writhing body and held her against him. He crooned soft words into her hair and stroked his hands over her face and arms, trying to soothe her. He repeated her name over and over, and finaly, she opened her eyes.</p><p>Caleb sent up a prayer of thanks and brushed the hair off her sweating brow. How had she endured this every night? Had she been plagued by these nightmares when her body was stil broken and healing? Had she thrashed around like this?</p><p>For months she\u2019d lived alone. No one had been here to wake her and free her from her dreams. No one had been here to hold her. She\u2019d gone through this al alone, and the thought made him long for a reason to do violence.</p><p>He felt a kiler\u2019s cold anger pumping through his blood, and he fought against it, trying to be gentle. It was like stopping a freight train with a feather\u2014hopeless and futile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was making sobbing sounds of anguish now, and they ripped at his guts. How could he have let this happen to her? Why hadn\u2019t he found a way to protect her?</p><p>No new answers came to the old questions, just a familiar aching regret that he hadn\u2019t done more to prevent her pain.</p><p>Her sobbing halted, and he felt her wake up more fuly, felt her pul a heavy cloak of detachment around her. She was drawing away from him, and he\u2019d be damned if he let it happen again. He didn\u2019t know how to get through to her, but he knew what he wanted to do, what he\u2019d been craving since the moment he laid eyes on her again.</p><p>With a touch more gentle than he felt, he wiped away a wet trail of tears from her temple. She was awake now, closing herself off more with every passing second.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered, his throat tight. \u201cDon\u2019t pul away from me.\u201d</p><p>She knew what he meant. He saw the knowledge flash in her eyes. An ocean of blue brightened with understanding. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her mouth to quiet her. \u201cYou need me. There\u2019s no shame in needing someone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a man like you to say. You don\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>Grant pounded on the door. \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d growled Caleb.</p><p>\u201cThose didn\u2019t sound like fun screams. She okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Lana in a breathless voice. Then again, louder. \u201cYes. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l just be, uh, outside, then. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Grant\u2019s footsteps faded.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t need anyone, then why is Grant outside watching your apartment? Why is another man watching your office and another guarding Stacie?\u201d</p><p>She tried to turn away, but Caleb held her chin and made her look at him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there because I can\u2019t protect you on my own. I need their help, just like you need mine. Let me help you. Tel me why you\u2019re so afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s eyes slid shut. \u201cI can\u2019t. Just let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t. Not anymore. I\u2019m not going to let you destroy yourself like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your choice.\u201d</p><p>Caleb muttered a caustic curse under his breath. She was right. If she wanted to ruin her life and keep her secret, there wasn\u2019t much he could do to stop her.</p><p>Caleb started to move off of the bed. Lana\u2019s hand stopped him. Her fingers wrapped around his wrist, pale against his tan skin. She hadn\u2019t reached out for him since the incident in the shower, and Caleb hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d been craving for her to do just that.</p><p>He stared at her hand, unable to take his eyes off her slender fingers.</p><p>\u201cWil you stay?\u201d she asked. \u201cJust for a while? The dreams . . . they\u2019re easier when you hold me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart filed up with a bittersweet mix of joy that she wanted him to hold her and guilt that she needed him to. He pushed the guilt aside and focused on the joy. He didn\u2019t want her accidentaly reading anything into his actions that would make her think he didn\u2019t want to be right here.</p><p>He scooted his body against hers and wrapped his arm over her waist. She snuggled with her back against his front and closed her eyes. His body hummed in delight, happy to be horizontal with the woman he wanted, nagging him to get naked and horizontal. He ignored his desire for her as much as any man could, hoping she\u2019d fal asleep before she\u2019d figure out just how much he wanted her. Another inch closer and his traitorous body would give him away in a big way.</p><p>The god of sleeping pils was on his side, and she fel back to sleep in a few minutes. For Caleb, sleep came much, much later.</p><p>Caleb remembered hearing on a TV ad that if you had an erection that lasted longer than four hours, it was a bad thing. Of course, that was after having taken some medication. He wasn\u2019t sure what it meant for a man who didn\u2019t do anything stronger than aspirin.</p><p>Just the act of taking a shower had him hard. Al he could think about was how Lana had sounded when he pressed her against the tile wal, or how she\u2019d tasted when her demanding little tongue had swept into his mouth. It was enough to make a sane man mad.</p><p>He finished in the shower, ending with a cold blast that had him shivering but did little for the lust prowling through his system. Sleeping next to Lana al night had been hard enough, so to speak, but waking up with his hands on her bare stomach and her fingers curled just inside the waistband of his jeans was sheer torture. Not that it had affected her one bit.</p><p>She was stil sleeping peacefuly and would stay that way as long as he had anything to say about it. He\u2019d unplugged her clock and covered her up to her neck before leaving her room. Had things been different between them, he\u2019d have woken her with just his tongue, but that was material best left stored in the back of his mind. His imagination was way too vivid when it came to Lana. He could almost imagine what she\u2019d look like al stretched out and naked beneath him. Her breasts were smal, but her nipples stood at attention every time he touched her. Her hips were slim under her jeans, but she had womanly curves that would fit his hands perfectly. She was smooth everywhere he touched, and he already knew the unique taste of her skin, her unique scent. Woman and honeysuckle and miracles.</p><p>It was almost enough to make a cynical man believe. Almost.</p><p>Caleb dried himself off with a rough brush of a towel. He should have just taken matters into his own hand and come out of the shower with a smile, but he knew that a simple session with his fist wasn\u2019t going to do the trick. He wanted Lana. Hot and wet and naked. Nothing else would even come close to scratching his itch.</p><p>When he came out of the bathroom, Grant was waiting with coffee and donuts. \u201cHave I ever told you you\u2019re my hero?\u201d asked Caleb as he puled a double chocolate out of the box.</p><p>\u201cGet in line. Ladies first.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shook his head and took a sip of coffee strong enough to make his chest sprout new hair. Perfect. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her,\u201d said Caleb, only half joking.</p><p>\u201cI know. Between you and David, the world is losing al the good women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are only two of us, and Lana isn\u2019t exactly my woman.\u201d The word yet seemed to float between them, unspoken but understood.</p><p>\u201cYou slept with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuly clothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh,\u201d said Grant with a sympathetic wince.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. Gives new meaning to the term hardship post. \u201d</p><p>Caleb finished off the donut and went for a second. Grant had brought a whole dozen. What a guy.</p><p>\u201cIs she stil asleep?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hopefuly she wil be for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. There\u2019s something I didn\u2019t want to tel you in front of her last night. Her car was sabotaged. The brakes had been tampered with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. When did that happen? I thought you were watching her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were. When was the last time she drove it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe morning Stacie was shot.\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201cCould have happened any time between then and when we arrived. It wasn\u2019t a professional job, though. I mean, brakes going out on the highway is one thing, but here in the city, the chances of her getting kiled in an accident aren\u2019t very high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it sure would scare the hel out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone\u2019s toying with her?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe. She\u2019s not exactly forthcoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this wil help. There\u2019s something I want to show you,\u201d said Grant. He flipped open his laptop and puled up a diagram of Lana\u2019s apartment. It was a 3-D model complete with furniture. Several red and blue dots glowed in various locations, along with dotted lines fanning out from each. Caleb had seen diagrams like this before. It showed the location of every bug they found in Lana\u2019s apartment and the estimated area each had covered.</p><p>Caleb studied the image, frowning. \u201cIs red video or audio?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVideo. See anything odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel, yes.\u201d For some reason, her bookshelves were covered by two separate video cameras. Those cameras wouldn\u2019t have picked up anything more than a passing glance at someone walking by, so why were they there?</p><p>Caleb went to the bookcase, looking for the reason behind the unusual setup.</p><p>\u201cIf you find anything let me know,\u201d said Grant. \u201cI looked for over an hour, took out every book and leafed through it just in case one had a hidden pocket. I found nothing.</p><p>Whatever those cameras were trying to catch, it beats me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Lana would know.\u201d Something in the back of Caleb\u2019s mind nagged at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd wil she also share?\u201d</p><p>Caleb sank down onto the couch and took a slug of hot, thick coffee. He didn\u2019t even bother to respond to Grant\u2019s question. They both knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cAnything else I should know?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cIt was al pretty standard equipment, al up-to-date with no serial numbers to trace. No fingerprints. Everything we found is available in the States.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the shower? Was it bugged?\u201d</p><p>Grant raised a golden brow. \u201cWhy? Want some footage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Hard habit to break,\u201d said Grant with an unapologetic grin. \u201cNo, the shower was clean, though there was audio hidden under the sink.\u201d</p><p>Caleb let out a relieved breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Got something to hide? A little monkey-spank going on, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Caleb just roled his eyes and reached for a third donut.</p><p>Grant stared at Caleb for a moment, his grin growing wider until it bloomed into a knowing smile. \u201cYou got her in there, didn\u2019t you? You had our pretty little lady in the shower and you didn\u2019t want anyone to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off, Kent.\u201d</p><p>Grant let out a deep laugh. \u201cI\u2019m right. You sly devil you, and here I thought this thing you had for her was al one-sided. I should have known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend, your love life is my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, even in the most deranged minds like yours, could you think that was true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need you and David out of the way, al happily settled down, so that I can have my turn. David\u2019s done his part, now it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel are you talking about?\u201d asked Caleb, totaly confused.</p><p>Grant closed the file on his laptop and shut the screen. \u201cI have this theory that since I was the third man to join the team, I\u2019l be the third one to leave. After you and David.</p><p>If you don\u2019t get al domestic and have the little wifey-poo convince you to quit, I\u2019l never get out.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stared at Grant, struggling not to let his brains spil out his ears from trying to understand such convoluted logic. \u201cHow long have you had this theory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple years before David left. The first time he left, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been waiting al this time for us to settle down in suburbia somewhere so you could, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYep. Something like that. That job David offered me is looking pretty good. Nice cushy work here at home. No more dragging my ass halfway around the world for months on end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just quit if you want out?\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you without someone to cover your hairy ass, so hurry up and nail you a woman already.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave Grant a steady look. \u201cYou know there\u2019s not enough therapy or antipsychotics in the world to fix what\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d</p> <p>Grant waggled his eyebrows. \u201cBut the ladies love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord help them.\u201d</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a while, and that nagging feeling in Caleb\u2019s head wasn\u2019t going away. \u201cPul up that diagram again, would you?\u201d</p><p>Grant did and handed Caleb the laptop. Caleb stared at the screen, letting his eyes wander, trying to see a pattern. Nothing stood out, but he kept looking at the bookshelves again. Something wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Then he remembered. That night he\u2019d rushed her into the shower, he\u2019d seen footage of someone looking through one of her books.</p> <p>Caleb went to his duffel, took out his own laptop, and puled up the surveilance footage. He saw Grant\u2019s shadow hovering over his shoulder as they watched the intruder come in, replace a bug and pick a single book off the shelf.</p><p>\u201cCan you tel which one it was?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>Caleb squinted at the screen. \u201cNo.\u201d He zoomed in on the area, but the image was stil fuzzy. The only thing he could make out was that the book had a spiral binding.</p><p>Grant had seen it too and went to the same shelf, running his fingers over the spines, puling out three of the books on the shelf. \u201cThey\u2019re al sketchbooks,\u201d he said, handing one to Caleb.</p><p>\u201cWhy would someone be interested in her sketchbooks? I already checked for hidden compartments.\u201d</p><p>There was no obvious answer, and Caleb leafed through the book, looking at sketch after sketch. Lana\u2019s skil was impressive. Whether she drew people or animals or landscapes, they were al detailed and lifelike.</p> <p>\u201cIs your book ful?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>Caleb flipped to the end. \u201cYeah. Yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first one is, but check this out,\u201d said Grant. \u201cThe second one is only half ful, and the last sketch is dated December before last.\u201d</p><p>Right before she\u2019d left for Armenia.</p><p>Caleb tried to compare the book to the one in the surveilance footage, but he couldn\u2019t tel if it was the same one or not.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she kept something hidden in the book?\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt a cold feeling of dread rol around in his gut. Lana\u2019s hand had shaken when she\u2019d tried to draw a puppy. She hadn\u2019t put a new sketch in that book since before her kidnapping. Al the cameras in her apartment were aimed in such a way that they\u2019d catch the image of anything she drew, whether sitting at her desk or on her couch or on her bed.</p><p>Whoever was watching her wanted to know what she drew, and he could only think of one reason why. \u201cWhoever is doing this thinks Lana saw something in Armenia, and they want to know if she puts it down on paper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? She was hooded. What could she possibly have seen? And if she did see something, why haven\u2019t they just kiled her?\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure how much Grant had been told. They\u2019d been briefed on the op separately, and Grant hadn\u2019t been there in Armenia. Caleb had been working alone until the very end. \u201cWhat do you know about Lana\u2019s background?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that she was the only surviving member of a group of hostages taken by a group of loonies trying to get into the Swarm. Her file says she was banged up pretty bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanged up\u201d didn\u2019t even come close to what Lana had endured, and Caleb had to bite back a hostile criticism of Grant\u2019s casual attitude. Grant had no way of knowing what she\u2019d gone through.</p><p>Grant continued, \u201cA team went in and extracted her, taking down a smal group of Swarm wannabes in the process.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hands tightened into fists. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s golden eyes widened with understanding. \u201cYou were there.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded, unable to speak past the clump of bitterness lodged in his throat.</p><p>\u201cThat was the op you did solo, wasn\u2019t it? The one you came back from al fucked up?\u201d</p><p>Caleb stood and turned his back. No way was he going to talk about this with Grant. He couldn\u2019t stand to even think about it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help if you don\u2019t tel me what happened. If she did see something, then it\u2019s going to take more than two of us to keep her safe. You know anyone wiling to take innocent civilians as hostages and kil them won\u2019t stop until she\u2019s dead, too.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt like pounding a hole in the wal, like tearing the couch apart with his bare hands. He needed to vent some of this frustration before he did something stupid. \u201cI can\u2019t tel you what I don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t trust me, and I don\u2019t blame her. She was an easy target before I showed up, but they didn\u2019t kil her. They must want something from her\u2014something she can\u2019t give them if she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it be a rival terrorist group\u2014an enemy of the Swarm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as we know, the Swarm is gone. At least, they haven\u2019t claimed credit for anything since that op we went on six months ago.\u201d</p><p>Grant gave Caleb a feral grin. \u201cThat was fun, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Satisfying maybe, but not fun. \u201cLet\u2019s assume the Swarm isn\u2019t gone and they could have something to do with this. She was hooded and kept in a separate cave from those running the show. What could she possibly have seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the hood slipped off and she got a peek at plans or blueprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr people?\u201d added Caleb. \u201cShe could have seen one of them before they managed to get the hood on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t even know she saw them. She could have had breakfast in the hotel before she was taken. Could have been sitting next to one of them and never known it.\u201d</p><p>Caleb shook his head. \u201cWe thought we got them al, but those caves were extensive. Someone could have slipped through one of the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t someone who was actualy there, but someone associated with them. They could think she knows something even if she doesn\u2019t, which would match her story.\u201d</p><p>Except for the fact that Caleb knew she was hiding something. \u201cThe bottom line is that it realy doesn\u2019t matter who is after her, or whether or not the Swarm is stil operating quietly. What matters is stopping them\u2014keeping her safe until she trusts us enough to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny clues when that wil be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a lot of reason to be trusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be as patient as God, but Monroe isn\u2019t. He\u2019s going to want results so we can move on. We have a lot of men tied up on this thing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Monroe wants. I nearly got her kiled once already. I can\u2019t let anything happen to her this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot her kiled? I thought you were the one who brought her out alive,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right after I watched them beat her.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s body stiled. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s stomach knotted at the memory. He didn\u2019t want to tel Grant what he\u2019d done, but if there was even a slim chance that the knowledge could help Lana, he owed it to her to suck it up and tel Grant his shame.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s voice was low, and he couldn\u2019t look Grant in the eye as he told him. \u201cI watched a man beat her. I stood there and let it happen. I heard every one of her screams.</p><p>Every one of her bones break. I was right there the whole time and I couldn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Caleb. Why?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d asked himself the same thing a thousand times, and al he could come up with was the same pitiful answer. \u201cI was undercover. The Swarm had bombed a school bus the week before, kiling three kids and wounding ten more. Their next target was a school. We had to find out which one, so I went in posing as a demolitions expert for hire.</p><p>One of our teams had taken out the real Miles Gentry, and I took his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the real Miles Gentry wouldn\u2019t have given a shit if they\u2019d beaten a woman to death, since he was wiling to blow up a whole fucking school,\u201d guessed Grant. His mouth flattened, and Caleb saw something like pity pass through his expression. He hid it quickly, but Caleb saw it anyway, and it made him want to crawl in a dark hole and never come out.</p><p>\u201cI should have done something. Kiled them al before they hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have taken you down before you\u2019d had time, and then what would have happened to al those kids? Where would they be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I try to remind myself about that part, but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you saved her. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d saved her, but I didn\u2019t. These nightmares she has, Grant . . .\u201d He swalowed past the anger that burned his throat. \u201cShe relives it every night. I kept her from being kiled, but I didn\u2019t save her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can now. We can find these bastards and take them down. Make sure she knows she\u2019s safe. Maybe then her nightmares wil go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever I do now it wil never make up for what I had to do then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know why you couldn\u2019t act?\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded. \u201cMonroe told Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonroe told me what?\u201d Lana asked as she walked out of the bedroom. She was wearing that giant, droopy robe over her short pajamas. Surgical scars crisscrossed her legs, reminding Caleb of just how much she\u2019d suffered in her struggle to walk again. Her hair was a mess, her eyes were stil puffy from sleep, and she had the imprint of her wrinkled sheet on one cheek, but she gave him a warm smile.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s heart clenched at the sight of her. Al this talk had brought back vivid memories of her broken body and battered face. Seeing her whole and alive made him ache to pul her into his arms and beg for forgiveness.</p><p>Instead, he waved toward the box of donuts. \u201cGrant brought breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s blue eyes narrowed at the distraction, but she let it drop. \u201cSave me a couple. I\u2019l be out in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom door closed behind her, and Caleb heard the water run. His body tightened at the thought of her naked and wet in there, and he wished he could join her.</p><p>The muscles in his legs were jerking as if they were trying to convince his brain to let him folow her into the shower. He ignored them.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like she hates you to me,\u201d observed Grant.</p><p>\u201cShe should. For a while, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d agreed Caleb.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a start,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. If I can\u2019t make her feel safe, she\u2019l suffer for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make anyone feel safe. Al you can do is give her the tools to take care of herself. If this was one of your brothers or your sister, what would you do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuy them a gun and show them how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me. What about teaching her how to fight? It might make her feel better to be able to defend herself, and al that exercise might wear her out enough to keep her from dreaming.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt a flare of hope at the idea, which he immediately squashed. \u201cShe\u2019s too fragile for that.\u201d</p><p>Grant snorted. \u201cShe may look that way, but I have a file ful of evidence that proves otherwise.

Wouldn\u2019t dream of it. I swear, you and David get al ugly where your women are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShows just how much of a fool you are.

The best you could hope for is runner-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t funny, Grant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not from where you\u2019re standing, but from here, it\u2019s pretty fucking hilarious to watch you, oh master of self-control, flounder around like this.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s chest rumbled with a warning growl, and Grant just grinned.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve overstayed my welcome. I\u2019l be outside if you need me,\u201d said Grant, and he left, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Caleb stood in the little living room for a long time, just concentrating on breathing, controling his temper, controling his lust. It was an exercise in futility while that shower was running\u2014at least the lust part. There was nothing he could do to stop himself from wanting Lana. Not even his guilt could cool that fire. Al he could do was tough it out and hope she didn\u2019t notice how he walked around with a constant hard-on.</p> <p>Lana had managed to avoid another crisis until the unusualy late hour of noon. The little bels on her office door chimed, and a walking rainbow stormed through the door.</p><p>Celia Summers was a young woman dressed in a homemade tie-dyed T-shirt and jeans that looked like they\u2019d been used as a paint palette. Her hair was a vibrant shade of green this week, streaked with pale lavender. Three mismatched hoops dangled from each ear, and the pink crystal stud in her nose glittered in the bright afternoon sun. She was a tiny thing, barely reaching Lana\u2019s shoulder, but what she lacked in height she made up for in talent. Forget Armand. Though Celia wasn\u2019t wel known, she was one of the best landscape painters Lana had ever seen, and that had been when Celia was stil in high school. Since then, her talent had only grown.</p><p>Celia went straight to Lana\u2019s desk and kicked it. \u201cYou said he was going to be here!\u201d</p><p>Caleb and Grant had been on the phone al morning trying to bring in some of their buddies to help with the carnival. Grant had gone to the back room to make some copies, and Caleb was stil chatting quietly on the phone. When he heard the angry young woman shout at Lana, he hung up and started to stand.</p><p>Lana gave him a smal shake of her head and hoped he\u2019d stay put rather than make things worse by getting involved. Celia was . . . temperamental, but she was the best artist they had left in the dwindling lineup. Lana couldn\u2019t afford to lose her, too.</p><p>\u201cWho was going to be where?\u201d asked Lana in the calmest voice she had.</p><p>\u201cArmand! You said he\u2019d be here, but he\u2019s in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe canceled a few days ago, but I did send out an e-mail about it. I thought you knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI accidentaly kiled my computer with a chain saw.\u201d Celia waved a hand with five different colors of nail polish on it. \u201cIt was a whole thing. I haven\u2019t had e-mail in weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t know. If I\u2019d known your computer was broken, I\u2019d have caled you. I know how much you were looking forward to meeting him.\u201d</p><p>Celia pouted, making the ring in her bottom lip jiggle. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want to come now.\u201d</p><p>Rather than throw the contract Celia had signed in her face, Lana tried a more diplomatic approach. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. We need you. The kids need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about al the other artists? You stil have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not as good as you, Celia. And this is a great way to bring in work. Get your name out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve already got more work than I can do.\u201d Her gaze went past Lana, and something she saw back there made her smile.</p><p>Caleb. Celia was staring at Caleb as if she\u2019d just found a new color. Lana didn\u2019t even turn around to see if he was looking back at her the same way. She didn\u2019t want to know. Celia was cute and fiery and talented, and Lana was no match for her feminine appeal.</p><p>\u201cPlease tel me you won\u2019t back out,\u201d begged Lana, trying to ignore the rush of jealousy she felt.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the stud?\u201d asked Celia, not bothering to lower her voice.</p><p>Lana pushed out a sigh of frustration. \u201cMy friend, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Caleb,\u201d said Grant from behind her. \u201cI\u2019m Grant, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Lana turned her head to see the focus of Celia\u2019s attentions, and they were most certainly targeted on Grant. She felt herself smiling with relief.</p><p>Grant held out his hand, and Celia took it and didn\u2019t let go. \u201cEver had anyone paint you naked?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure have. The brush tickles and the red paint stains,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>Celia laughed and stepped closer. \u201cAh, an art critic.\u201d</p><p>Lana felt Caleb\u2019s fingers curve around her arm and gently pul her back. He leaned down and whispered into her ear, \u201cJust sit back and watch.\u201d</p><p>Lana had no idea what he meant, but she decided to take his advice.</p><p>\u201cNever your critic. I\u2019d love to see some of your work,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I should go back to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a private showing?\u201d asked Celia.</p><p>\u201cYou show me yours, I\u2019l show you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bet you would, too,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m a slave to my curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlave? Mmm,\u201d she purred. \u201cThat has potential, but what is it exactly that you\u2019re curious about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether green or purple is your natural hair color.\u201d</p><p>Celia laughed again and turned to ask Lana, \u201cCan I keep him? Just for a couple hours?\u201d</p><p>Grant lifted Celia\u2019s chin with his finger and made her look up at him. \u201cI\u2019l give you three hours if you promise not to pul out of the auction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d agreed Celia and grabbed Grant by the front of his shirt, tugging him along behind her.</p><p>\u201cThe things I sacrifice in the name of art,\u201d said Grant with a smile. \u201cSee you al . . . later.\u201d</p><p>Lana just shook her head, staring in awe. \u201cHow did he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the panty-dropping smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d asked Lana, totaly confused.</p><p>Caleb studied her face as if looking for the joke. \u201cYou realy don\u2019t see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>His smile was al male satisfaction and flashing white teeth. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>For the second time that day, Lana\u2019s office bels gave a merry tinkle as another problem walked into the door. This time, there wasn\u2019t anything that Grant was going to be able to do to fix it.</p><p>Oran flashed her a white smile as if he hadn\u2019t personaly tried to bring down her fundraiser.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cTo talk, darling. I figured you\u2019d be about ready to listen by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean now that you\u2019ve done your best to stop my fundraiser from happening.\u201d</p><p>Oran shrugged his athletic shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m desperate to get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tel by the way you\u2019re sparing no expense for your engagement party to another woman. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just looking for the right time to let her down easy,\u201d said Oran.</p><p>\u201cLike you did me?\u201d she asked with false sweetness.</p><p>Caleb came out of the back room, where he\u2019d been making copies for her. He looked from Oran to Lana. \u201cEverything okay here, Lana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOran was just leaving,\u201d said Lana.</p><p>Oran\u2019s gaze slid to Caleb, and something he saw there startled him enough that he dropped his smile. \u201cI guess I misjudged,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured you\u2019d be happy to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you tried to destroy my careful planning? Not likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to destroy your anything, darling. I just wanted to open your eyes to a better way of doing business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWel, yes,\u201d he said, sounding shocked that she had dared ask.</p><p>Lana felt rage swel inside her, threatening to spil over. She realy wanted to punch Oran in the eye and leave him one hel of a shiner for the media. Knowing him, though, he\u2019d press charges and Lana would end up in jail for assault. \u201cI\u2019m only going to ask you to leave one time. After that, I\u2019m going to go in the bathroom and let Caleb deal with you as he sees fit. With no witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealy?\u201d asked Caleb with almost childlike glee.</p><p>Oran frowned at her as if she\u2019d done something naughty. That look used to be able to make her blush with humiliation, but now it just pissed her off. \u201cLeave, Oran.\u201d</p><p>Technicaly, it wasn\u2019t a request, but Lana was done giving Oran even another second of her time.</p><p>Caleb stepped up beside her, doing nothing more than merely standing there. It was enough that Oran straightened his tie with a nervous gesture. \u201cIf I leave now, I\u2019m never coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she asked in a sickly sweet voice.</p><p>Oran turned on his heel and left, the little bels chiming in his wake.</p><p>Lana looked up at Caleb. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used you to intimidate him like that. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Caleb slid a slippery strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t ever be sorry for needing a little backup. I want to help you, even if that means scaring off slime like Oran.\u201d</p><p>Lana shook her head, sending the hair Caleb had tucked away flying again. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed that I used to love that man.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s voice dipped to a deeply serious tone. \u201cWe can\u2019t help who we love. You should try to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time does the youth center close?\u201d asked Caleb as he fired off the last of the e-mails he needed to send.</p><p>\u201cSeven. Why?\u201d asked Lana.</p><p>Caleb looked at his watch. It was nearly nine, and he could see Lana was struggling to keep herself going. She\u2019d worked nonstop al day, not even pausing while she ate the Chinese food he\u2019d had delivered. Grant stil hadn\u2019t come back yet, but Caleb had seen the black sedan pul into the lot about an hour ago. The night guard for the office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb hadn\u2019t recognized the man, but if Grant had brought him in, that was good enough. Grant might appear casual and careless, but he never fooled around with the important things.</p><p>\u201cThey have floor mats over there, right?\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded, but her brows drew together in a curious line. \u201cA few we use when I can get one of the local gymnastic coaches to donate some lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have a key.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Caleb, what are you getting at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about something Grant said to me today he thought I should try with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb saw her eyes darken and a pretty blush spread up her throat. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, not sure that we should be doing anything Grant suggests at the youth center.\u201d</p><p>It took Caleb a minute to realize that she thought he meant sex. Possibly kinky sex. Which, of course, made Caleb\u2019s mind go there, too. What a lovely place that was.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said no to the idea, just no to doing it at the youth center, and if that wasn\u2019t enough to make a man\u2019s blood boil, Caleb didn\u2019t know what was. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I just wanted to show you a few self-defense moves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case those secrets you\u2019re keeping come back to haunt you. I don\u2019t want you to be completely defenseless.\u201d</p><p>Any sign of sexual interest he thought he\u2019d seen vanished. \u201cI\u2019ve taken self-defense classes,\u201d she said, her voice even.</p><p>\u201cNot from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what makes your teaching special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause in my class, the best defense is a good offense.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>An hour later, Lana was sweating and breathing hard, and only partly from the strenuous moves Caleb had her practicing. He\u2019d stripped out of his shirt, leaving that glorious expanse of muscled chest and abs on display. And she got to touch him, too. Not just little passing touches, but hard holds that taught her just what the man would feel like if she ever got him in her arms for real. It was more than any red-blooded woman should have to take, and yet it wasn\u2019t nearly enough.</p><p>\u201cThat was good,\u201d he said as he pushed himself back to his feet. He\u2019d let her knock him onto the ground to show her how it felt to folow through the motion. Of course, once she\u2019d knocked him flat on his back, she wanted to climb aboard and stay there for a good long while, but that wasn\u2019t in the cards.</p><p>\u201cThis time when you get me on the ground, I want you to folow through with that stomp kick I showed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d she said, her voice light with breathlessness.</p><p>His black eyes were glittering in the bright lights of the gym, and his skin glowed as if it had been oiled. \u201cAim just to the side of my head, but don\u2019t hold back on the force of the kick. If you get too close, I\u2019l just dodge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re not fast enough?\u201d she asked, taunting him. She knew ful wel he was. She\u2019d seen him move tonight and was astonished that a man his size could be so quick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be fast enough if you\u2019re not trying to hurt me. Come on,\u201d he said, motioning her toward him with his fingertips. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Lana took a deep breath as she waited for Caleb to come toward her. She went through a series of moves he caled \u201cnothing fancy,\u201d using his own momentum and a kick to the back of his knees to bring him down. Something went wrong, and a second later she found herself on top of him with her nose in his crisp chest hair.</p><p>Lana\u2019s laboring lungs puled in the scent of his skin, felt the firm bed of man beneath her, and she felt the liquid flow of desire pooling low in her bely. She tried to hold in a low groan of need, but her breathing was too ragged to control it.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, sounding a little winded himself for the first time tonight.</p><p>Lana nodded and tried to push herself up. Her arms shook with effort as her mind tried to take control of her wayward body, which wanted to stay right here and taste the salt of his skin.</p><p>Her weight shifted as she worked to move off Caleb\u2019s body, and pressed against her stomach she felt the unmistakable length of his arousal. Lana went stil, trying to make sense of what she felt, trying to figure out if it was al in her head or if he realy was hard and hot against her bely.</p><p>\u201cOne of us should move,\u201d he told her in a thick voice. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s me, I swear to God I\u2019m going to slide you under me and do something that would make even Grant blush.\u201d</p><p>The words went into her brain and roled around in an indecipherable pile. Blood raced along her skin, making the gymnasium air feel cold. Something deep inside her melted, and her muscles went weak. She wanted to stay right here\u2014to force him to do whatever it was he had in mind. She wanted it. Needed it. She\u2019d been too long without pleasure in her life, and she knew on an instinctive level that Caleb had what it would take to make her body sing.</p><p>She must have stayed stil too long, fighting for the right decision, because she felt Caleb shudder beneath her. His powerful muscles clenched and shifted, and when they stopped, she was lying on the cold vinyl mat and Caleb was gone.</p><p>She looked up and saw him with his back to her a few feet away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lana. I shouldn\u2019t have said that, shouldn\u2019t have put that pressure on you.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tel him it was okay, but words lodged tight in her throat. She wanted to tel him to come back and bring back the warmth he\u2019d given her, but al that came out was a choking sound of unsated lust.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l, uh, be back in a sec,\u201d he said and headed toward the men\u2019s room.</p><p>Lana flopped onto her back and looked up at the steel beams and bright lights overhead. It was better this way. No ties between them, nothing to rip her apart when he was gone. Some things weren\u2019t worth a night of pleasure, and watching Caleb walk away with her heart was one of them. And there was no doubt that he could walk away with her heart. No matter whom he\u2019d pretended to be in the past, she saw him for who he was. Noble. Honorable. Dependable. A freaking Boy Scout\u2019s pledge ful of things that Oran had never been. He was the kind of man a woman wanted to keep, and that was the problem. His days with her were numbered. She didn\u2019t know how many, but eventualy, Monroe would find some better use of Caleb\u2019s time and talents, and when that happened, Caleb would leave.</p><p>The world needed its few remaining heroes, and Lana needed to keep any more people from getting tangled up in her mess of a life. She had nothing to offer him but secrets and lies and night after night of being woken by her screams.</p><p>He deserved more than that.</p><p>\u201cDid you do as I asked?\u201d said the metalic voice on the other end of the phone.</p><p>Denny felt himself start to sweat\u2014a cold, sour sweat that made his stomach turn with the stench. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. There was some guy watching her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne man and you couldn\u2019t handle it?\u201d asked the voice, mocking his ability.</p><p>Something about that man had made Denny think twice about taking him on. There was nothing particularly special about him, just this air of confidence that made Denny hesitate. The guy was no amateur. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right time. That\u2019s al. I\u2019l try again tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother. She\u2019s got a guard dog now, and there\u2019s no way you\u2019l get in while she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Silence reigned on the other end of the phone long enough to make Denny shake. He was sure he wasn\u2019t going to like whatever his boss was going to have to say. He never did.</p><p>Denny had puled al the blinds shut, hoping that the nagging sense of being watched would go away. It hadn\u2019t. He stil felt the silent gaze of his boss heavy on the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI want you to obtain a set of blueprints for the First Light youth center. The file number is listed along with the location of the file in a letter in your mailbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want those for?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself. He\u2019d drunk too much tonight. His wits were slow, and now it was going to cost him. He braced himself for the reaming, but it didn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cShame on you, you naughty boy.\u201d The words were almost singsong, grating discordantly against one another in the robot\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy. Now get some coffee to clear your head, and have the prints sitting on your kitchen table by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want me to take them, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere. I\u2019l come get them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my house?\u201d Oh, man. The thought of having this guy come into his home made him sick. There was something off about him\u2014something that was more fucked up than even Bruce\u2019s love for breaking guys\u2019 legs.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even know I was there. You never have.\u201d</p><p>The phone went dead, and Denny started shaking, and not from the booze. His boss had been here before and he hadn\u2019t even known it? What else didn\u2019t he know?</p><p>Before the thought could scare him stupid, he got up and made a pot of coffee, feeling his boss\u2019s eyes on the back of his neck the whole time.</p><p>Lana showered the sweat from her body, letting the hot water run over her tired muscles. Even through the physical weariness, she felt a new kind of strength flowing through her. Despite the embarrassing episode on the mat, Lana realized that she\u2019d learned more in the hour of training from Caleb than she had in weeks worth of self-defense classes in colege. There was something about the brutaly effective moves he\u2019d taught her that gave her a thin strand of confidence to grab on to. It made her feel powerful, safer somehow. She just hoped that the end of their lesson tonight didn\u2019t mean the end of lessons altogether. If she could keep her libido in check, she might actualy manage to fight back some of the fear she\u2019d been living with for so long.</p><p>The notion made her giddy with hope.</p><p>Now if she could only convince Caleb to continue the lessons without the two of them ending up naked, she\u2019d be set.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Caleb had frozen up and stayed frozen from the moment he\u2019d walked out of the men\u2019s room. He was the picture of walking regret, and she knew that her lessons were over.</p><p>Lana puled on her pajamas\u2014a knit T-shirt and matching shorts set that was cool and comfortable. She came out of the bathroom and Caleb\u2019s black gaze slid up and down her body, making her nipples tighten to hard points against her shirt. Lana licked her lips and tried not to read anything into his stare.</p><p>\u201cThose hurt?\u201d he asked, nodding toward her legs.</p><p>Lana looked down the surgical scars and saw a few shadowy patches of skin where their mock combat had bruised her. She wasn\u2019t sure which he\u2019d referred to, but the answer was the same. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You sore?\u201d</p><p>She would be tomorrow, but for now, she was just pleasantly tired. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He ran a wide hand over his face and puled in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m staying here tonight,\u201d he told her in a tone that gave away his displeasure with the notion.</p><p>Lana felt a zing of excitement race through her but tried to hide it. \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m stil staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward until he was close enough she could reach out and touch him.</p><p>Lana clenched her hands to keep from doing just that. He was so solid and safe. Real and warm. For some reason he could anchor her to reality when the nightmares came, ward away al that darkness.</p> <p>She was so tired. Worn down.</p><p>He reached out and slipped a thick finger over her ear to tuck back damp tendrils of her hair. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t stand the thought of leaving you alone.\u201d</p><p>Lana looked up at him, losing herself in the warmth of his concerned gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re al woman. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t noticed. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He closed the remaining distance between them, making Lana back up against the wal.</p><p>She felt the heat of his body, the unyielding slabs of muscle over his chest pressing against hers. His cheeks darkened, and his nostrils flared as if drinking in her scent. She was caged against the wal by his body, unable to tel if she was more worried by his odd behavior or excited by it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. Her voice wavered and her lungs sucked in air, pressing her breasts more fuly against him.</p><p>He leaned down until she could feel his lips move against her neck. \u201cTel me you want me to stop,\u201d he dared her.</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t. Her hands pressed against his chest, but she couldn\u2019t find the strength to push. Instead, her fingers curled against his hot skin in an effort to drag him closer.</p><p>He opened his mouth and flicked his tongue just below her ear. A jolt of heat shot through her, making her body clench hard. She sucked in a shocked breath, and it came out as a hiss of pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one watching us this time. No one listening.\u201d He slid his fingers into her hair until his big hand covered the back of her head. \u201cNothing to stop us.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s lips parted in an effort to find something to say to that. Nothing came out, and Caleb took advantage of her speechlessness by kissing her.</p><p>Just the touch of his lips on hers was enough to make her sway. Caleb kept a light hold on her body with one arm while his fingers were firm and warm against her scalp, giving her no means of retreat.</p><p>Not that she wanted any.</p><p>When he held her like this, kissed her, there was no room for fear between them. He drove everything from her thoughts but excitement and pleasure.</p><p>Lana kissed him back, sliding her tongue along his bottom lip. His breathing sped, and she could feel the air around them heat.</p><p>He puled his mouth free of hers and kissed his way over her cheek, down her jaw, until he reached her neck.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lana,\u201d he breathed, \u201cI can\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d she told him and clung to his wide shoulders to steady herself.</p><p>\u201cJust tel me.\u201d His teeth nipped her skin, sending a zing of pleasure to her core. \u201cI don\u2019t want secrets between us. Or lies.\u201d</p><p>The words buzzed around in her brain until they finaly made sense. He was seducing her for information.</p><p>\u201cTel me what you\u2019re hiding and al this wil be over. I\u2019l keep you safe. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>Lana froze in outrage. Humiliation. Once again she\u2019d been swept away by his touch, his kiss. But it was al an act. Part of his job.</p><p>Caleb must have felt her go stiff. He stopped kissing her and straightened his body so he could look at her. Concern and lust tightened his features Tears burned Lana\u2019s eyes, and she knew if she so much as blinked, they\u2019d spil over. She was so sick of crying, so angry that he could hurt her like this.</p><p>It was the anger that saved her, burning away her tears.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d use me this way.\u201d Her clenched teeth made the words come out tight and bitter.</p><p>\u201cI have to keep you safe. Whatever you\u2019re hiding might get you kiled. I won\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you thought you\u2019d try fucking the information out of me?\u201d</p><p>She shoved him, but he didn\u2019t budge. His body was hard and immobile under her hands.</p><p>The glow of lust that had lit his eyes brightened to angry determination. \u201cWhatever it takes. I played by the rules last time and you nearly died. I don\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re that good? That a few minutes with your cock inside me is going to make me throw al my deep, dark secrets at your feet?\u201d Sarcasm made her voice ugly and hard.</p><p>Something hot flared in his features and he shifted closer, crowding her with his big body. His voice was low and velvet soft. \u201cA few minutes, a few hours, a few days.</p><p>Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Yes! shouted a feral voice inside Lana, but she held her ground. \u201cSo you admit that it would be manipulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather see you live by manipulation than die by honesty. Besides, there\u2019s not a whole lot of that between us, anyway. Is there?\u201d</p><p>Lana looked away from him, ashamed of al the lying she\u2019d been forced to do. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true and you know it. You and I are tied together by the past. There\u2019s no escaping that and no escaping me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless I tel you whatever secret you think I\u2019m keeping. If I did that, you\u2019d be gone within the hour.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated for a moment and some faint hint of indecision glided over his features. He slid a blunt finger along her cheekbone, down to her jaw, along the line of her throat. Lana bit back a rough gasp of pleasure.</p><p>His pupils expanded, making the golden chips in his eyes dilate. \u201cYou think you know me. You think you know what I want. But you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly why you\u2019re here,\u201d she argued without much heat.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tel me.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just bent his head over her hair and puled in a deep breath. His body shuddered, and his arms tightened around her. \u201cI want to believe in second chances, Lana. In miracles.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he meant, but something desperate inside her wanted to give him whatever he wanted. Second chances, miracles, secrets, the truth. Everything.</p><p>It was at that moment that she realized just how close she was to breaking, to spiling out al the lies and secrets and half-truths she\u2019d been keeping inside. Maybe he could keep her and her family safe. But maybe not. Lana couldn\u2019t take the risk\u2014not with the people she loved.</p><p>With an effort of wil that left her exhausted, Lana puled herself away from Caleb, both physicaly and emotionaly. She slipped away from him and crammed her expression into a hard mask. \u201cSorry. Can\u2019t help you. There\u2019s no such thing as miracles. Or second chances.\u201d</p><p>Caleb woke fuly from a dead sleep in the space of a heartbeat. He kept his eyes shut, listening to his surroundings. Something had woken him, and he strained his ears to figure out what it was.</p><p>The sound came again, a slight sigh of shifting fabric, the faint squeak of Lana\u2019s bed frame.</p><p>She was having another nightmare.</p><p>Caleb shoved up off the couch and went into her room without knocking. Sure enough, she was thrashing on the bed, her body bowed into a tight arc, her skin glowing with sweat.</p><p>He had to make this stop. He couldn\u2019t leave her knowing that she\u2019d go through this alone every night. And eventualy, whether she remained silent or not, he\u2019d have to leave. There was no future for them, not with the past they shared. She\u2019d said herself there were no second chances. At least not for him.</p><p>Caleb lay down and puled her up against him, giving her soft, soothing words of comfort. He didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d taken sleeping pils again tonight, but he tried to wake her anyway.</p><p>Ragged sounds of pain gurgled in her throat, and Caleb\u2019s hold on her tightened to the point where he had to focus on relaxing so he wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Lana. Come back to me, honey.\u201d</p><p>She let out a stuttering sob and lashed out at him with her fists. Caleb caught her hands and tucked them under the blankets so she wouldn\u2019t hurt herself. He rocked her and urged her to wake up, suffering right along with her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d he told her. \u201cI won\u2019t let them hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>He felt it when the nightmare released her, slowly, painfuly. Her sobs deepened, and he felt the hot wetness of tears against his bare chest.</p><p>He would have given anything right now to take her pain away, to free her of this torment. He would have given his honor, his career, his life, anything to make this stop.</p><p>Her struggles slowed and weakened until she was clinging to him, her body shaking with the aftereffects of the nightmare.</p><p>Caleb murmured soft words into her hair and rocked her in a steady motion until he felt her pul away. Her eyes were red and shadowed with fatigue. They pleaded to him to help her, and Caleb wanted to howl at the unfairness of her life. She didn\u2019t deserve this. No one did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay now,\u201d he told her, hearing his rioting emotions thicken his voice.</p><p>She wiped her eyes and sniffed. There was stil a wildness in her expression\u2014a sort of frantic panic he\u2019d seen on the faces of men who knew they were cornered.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>He wanted to soothe her, protect her, but he had so little to offer. He smoothed the cobweb of dark hair away from her face, trying to tel her without words how he felt, that he would do anything to make the bad parts of her life go away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand this,\u201d she whispered to him, as if saying the words too loud would hurt. She rested her forehead on his bare chest, and her breath fanned out over his skin, making his body tighten. He gritted his teeth and ignored it. He stroked her hair, down her delicate spine, pushing away the covers as he passed. She should have been pushing him away instead. He should have been walking away from the temptation she posed, but he wasn\u2019t man enough to leave her. Not yet.</p><p>Not until she calmed down and could rest again.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked into his eyes. He could see the fear from the nightmare lingering in those blue depths, begging him to help. \u201cMake me forget. Just for a little while. Please.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knew it was a mistake\u2014one more on a giant pile\u2014but he didn\u2019t care. She\u2019d given him something he could do, and he was damn wel going to do it.</p><p>He took her mouth in a soft kiss, a mere brushing of lips. Such an innocent thing, but it nearly turned his body inside out with a wave of raw lust. He felt himself harden in a painfuly swift rush and couldn\u2019t keep from grinding his hips against her to show her just how much he wanted her. Warning her just how he planned to make her forget.</p><p>Lana\u2019s arms freed themselves of tangled sheets and looped around his neck, holding him in place with a fierce grip. She wasn\u2019t letting him get away.</p><p>Her lips parted under his, opening herself up to him. He couldn\u2019t wait another second to taste her. He licked just inside her upper lip, teasing her, trying to hold back in case she changed her mind. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t. He no longer cared whether loving her was right. It was necessary.</p><p>Lana made a low sound of relief and sucked his tongue into her mouth. Caleb felt the kiss al the way down to the soles of his bare feet. Her fingers speared through his hair, holding his head stil while she gave him deep, devouring kisses. He gave her leave to show him what she needed, show him what she liked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His hands slid under the hem of her shirt, finding skin as soft and warm as sunlight. Her supple spine arched in response, pushing her hips against him in a maddening gyration. Caleb\u2019s restraint broke and there was no more holding back. He was going to love her tonight, no matter how much of a mistake it might be.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth puled away from hers, and he rained hot, open-mouthed kisses along her neck, sucking and biting as he went. He was sure he was leaving marks behind for anyone to see, and part of him cheered a primitive response. He wanted everyone to know she was his. Only his.</p><p>His teeth bit gently along the joint of neck and shoulder, and Lana hissed and her nails scored his back. \u201cLike that?\u201d he asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p>She gave an incoherent noise of appreciation, and Caleb swirled his tongue to soothe the sting his teeth had left behind. His hands slid around to her front, splaying over her pale tummy and ribs, brushing away the barrier of her soft knit shirt. Caleb\u2019s stomach did a slow, lazy rol as he watched his hands moving over smooth, perfect skin. Lana\u2019s skin.</p> <p>\u201cI want to see you,\u201d he told her, his voice rough and demanding. \u201cSee your naked breasts al puckered and eager for my mouth. Like they were in the shower.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s fingers tangled with his as she tried to rid herself of the shirt. They managed to get it off, and it flew somewhere across the room, lost and forgotten.</p><p>Caleb found her hands and held them away from her body so he could look his fil. She was so beautiful with her skin flushed and her nipples tight and begging for his mouth. He\u2019d seen a lot of naked women, but no woman before Lana had made his hands shake. None had made him wish he was a better man, more deserving of her.</p><p>No longer able to resist, Caleb released her hands and drew a finger over the lower curve of her breasts. She jerked and wiggled, trying to coax him to touch her more fuly, but he held back. Lana was a once-in-a-lifetime woman, one who had to be savored, and he was going to do just that.</p><p>She grabbed his wrist, trying to move his hand to cover her breast, showing him how she wanted to be touched, but she was no match for his strength. She couldn\u2019t make him budge from the slow, lazy path he drew over her smooth skin.</p> <p>Lana quit fighting him and started to wage her own war. Her clever little hands slid down between them until she found the rigid length of his penis. Slim fingers wormed their way under the stretchy waistband of his sweats and wrapped around him in a bold caress.</p><p>It was Caleb\u2019s turn to hiss out his pleasure, and he closed his eyes, enjoying the feel of her hand on him, the feel of her fingers stroking and teasing. He wasn\u2019t going to last two minutes if she kept that up, and he had more in mind than a hand job. \u201cNone of that yet,\u201d he told her, puling her wayward hand out of his pants. \u201cWhen I come, I want it to be deep inside you, right where I belong.\u201d</p><p>She shivered and her eyes darkened, driving the deep blue to a thin ring of color. Her tongue slid out over her bottom lip, and Caleb couldn\u2019t stop himself from tasting her mouth again. She tasted like home, sweet and warm and his.</p><p>How was he ever going to let her go?</p><p>Caleb shoved the thought away before it could taint the time they had now. She was half-naked and wiling, in his arms, and that was enough. It had to be enough.</p><p>He spread his hand wide, covering her breast so that her tight little nipple speared up into his palm. Lana whimpered into his mouth and he felt her slim hands clench his shoulders. She fit perfectly in his hand, the soft, womanly curve of her breast making his mouth water.</p> <p>He slid his fingers over her skin, tugging at her nipple, feeling it lengthen and tighten against the caluses of his fingertips. Lana let out a ragged moan of approval that made Caleb\u2019s head spin. He loved her responsiveness, al the little noises she made and the way her body quivered and strained to get closer to his.</p><p>He puled his mouth from hers, needing to feel her nipples against his tongue. He cupped her breast in his hand while his lips closed over her nipple. She let out a strangled cry, and Caleb felt her flesh vibrating with his possessive growl. She was his. Too far gone to stop. Too wild. And he loved it.</p><p>Maybe he should have pressed the advantage and tried to question her again, but he couldn\u2019t bear the thought of her puling away from him. Not now. Maybe not ever.</p><p>He suckled her breasts, loving them evenly, using lips and tongue and teeth to drive her into a frenzy. She didn\u2019t even notice when he slipped those flimsy shorts off her legs and spread them wide. The scent of her arousal sent streamers of need shooting through him, but he held himself back, just a little longer. He knew she was turned on, but he wanted her desperate, unable to think of anything but getting him inside her.</p><p>His mouth moved down her body while his fingers tugged and roled her nipples. He kissed her ribs and lingered on the sweet curve of her stomach, running his tongue around the rim of her bely button. That had her arching her hips off the bed, and he fit his hands under her, gripping the firm cheeks of her ass in his palms.</p><p>She knew what he was going to do now. He could feel it in the way she went stil, in the way her legs vibrated against his shoulders. He wasn\u2019t sure if it was something she wanted, but he wasn\u2019t going to give her a chance to protest, not before he got to taste her.</p><p>His tongue flicked out, barely grazing her flesh. Her thighs tightened, but his shoulders held them open wide. The second touch was more firm, more direct. Her fingers raked through his hair, holding him, not pushing him away. It was al the encouragement Caleb needed.</p><p>He slid one finger along her folds, parting the delicate skin, feeling the slick heat of her arousal. It was nearly enough to make him come, knowing she wanted him like that, feeling the proof of her want for him against the tip of his finger.</p> <p>He pressed into her just a little, just enough to let her feel the invasion. Her body clamped down on his finger as if trying to pul him deeper inside.</p><p>Caleb choked on a raw groan of need that bubbled up out of him, giving away his own desperation. He wasn\u2019t going to last much longer, and he wanted to make it as good for her as possible.</p><p>He opened her folds so that he could see the little pink button hidden inside. Lana stiffened at his intimate inspection and she started to sit up, so he pushed his finger deeper, giving her what her body had begged for only moments ago. Lana\u2019s hands fisted in the blankets, and she flopped back down onto the bed with a soft sound of pleasure.</p><p>Caleb grinned as he flicked his tongue lightly over her clitoris. Lana puled in a shocked breath, but he didn\u2019t give her time to let it out before he licked her again. He felt the flesh around his finger pulse and become slicker. She was tight, maybe too tight to take him easily, and as much as that tightness thriled him, it also made preparing her that much more important.</p><p>He wrapped his lips around the sensitive flesh, being careful to gauge her reaction, not wanting to do anything that would hurt her. But whatever she was feeling wasn\u2019t pain. She was panting, and the skin on her chest had deepened to a pretty pink blush that spread up her throat.</p><p>Caleb slid his finger out and back while he licked and nibbled. Her breathing was growing more ragged, and her head was thrown back. She was getting close to coming, and he forced her forward with eager determination. With each passing second her back arched higher, until he felt her climax take over her body. She let out a sweet cry of pleasure as the lower half of her body trembled against the orgasm. He locked his lips around her clitoris and suckled her as he had her nipples, driving her right through her release. He felt the liquid response of her body and the rhythmic pulsing of her muscles. Caleb waited until the waves of her orgasm had started to fade and then pressed a second finger inside her slick body, stretching her.</p><p>The pressure drove her back up and over the crest of a second climax and made Caleb moan into the sensitive flesh between her legs. He felt her orgasm rock him to the marrow of his bones, making him feel like a freaking superhero. Making her come was the world\u2019s greatest high, and he wasn\u2019t sure how long he\u2019d be able to go without doing it again.</p><p>She came back down, breathing hard and limp on the bed. Her legs were splayed wide, and in the bright lights of the room, he could see the shiny proof of her release slick on his hand and her thighs.</p><p>A wave of lust hit him so hard he couldn\u2019t breathe. His fingers were stil buried inside her, feeling the tiny quivering twitches that remained of her orgasm. He puled them from her body and heard her answering whimper of loss.</p><p>He should have just walked away from her, leaving her sated. He\u2019d made her forget, which had been his goal, but now that he was here, with her body laid out before him like an offering, there was nothing he could do to resist. He needed her. Needed the soft strength of her body to enfold him, ease him. He\u2019d never needed anything more.</p><p>Caleb shucked his sweats and lowered his body over hers. As the weight of him pressed against her, her eyes snapped open, revealing more than just the aftermath of passion. She was afraid.</p><p>Caleb bit back a violent word and eased himself away. No way was he going to take her with that look on her face. He\u2019d sooner blow his own head off.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>Lana saw Caleb\u2019s face, the desperate set of his jaw, the way it bulged as he gritted his teeth and backed away from her. He\u2019d seen her fear. He\u2019d been about to make love to her, and he\u2019d seen that momentary flash of panic she\u2019d gotten in her eyes.</p><p>Lana wanted to kick herself for letting him see it, but she hadn\u2019t been able to predict how panicked she\u2019d get with his bulk holding her down. She hadn\u2019t been with a man since Oran\u2014before her abduction\u2014and this reaction slammed into her from out of the blue, completely unexpected.</p><p>Her body was humming with satisfaction, her limbs languid and slow, but she was fast enough to stop his retreat. She grabbed his wrist and forced him to look at her. \u201cI want you, but I can\u2019t be on the bottom,\u201d she explained, her voice hoarse. \u201cIt makes me feel . . . trapped.\u201d Bound, helpless, out of control. She couldn\u2019t think straight with those memories of being held captive stil too near her waking thoughts, so she shoved them away, focusing on Caleb\u2019s beautiful body.</p><p>He looked unconvinced, and she saw the muscles in his jaw bunch.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI need you.\u201d She didn\u2019t want him leaving yet, not until she\u2019d felt what it was like to hold him inside her body, to be as close to him as a woman could be.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten seconds.\u201d He raced out of the bedroom and returned in less than that, ripping a condom package open with his teeth. She watched as he roled it over his erection, wishing she\u2019d had the fun of doing that herself.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d she urged him, tugging at his arm and moving aside so there was an empty swath of bed to hold him.</p><p>Caleb lay down, and his body swalowed up al the space on the double bed. Lana gave him what she hoped was a seductive smile and straddled his naked body, sitting over his stomach with the heavy length of his penis just behind her. He was glorious. There was no other word for it. His limbs were thick with muscle, the veins standing out under the strain of his racing heart. The dark hair on his chest tempted her to touch, to explore the springy texture with her fingers and breasts. His eyes were black with desire, and a dark stain of lust highlighted his cheekbones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lana pressed her palms to his bare chest and leaned down to kiss him. He didn\u2019t move. Didn\u2019t reach for her, didn\u2019t urge her on in any way. His lips were firm and hot beneath hers, and she ran her tongue along the seam, asking him wordlessly to open for her. When he finaly did, Lana sucked his lower lip into her mouth.</p><p>Caleb finaly responded. He took hold of her head, angled it slightly, and swept his tongue into her mouth. Lana\u2019s recently sated body flared back to life and returned the kiss with open abandon.</p><p>This was what she wanted, what she needed\u2014this human connection that drove away everything but the quest for pleasure. He drove away the darkness and set her body ablaze, leaving no room for worry or doubt or fear. Her whole world colapsed down to the space between them, the brush of his hair over her nipples, the slick warmth of his mouth, the rough caress of his calused fingers over her skin. Nothing else mattered.</p><p>Her fingers grazed his shoulders, moving down, kneading the thick slabs of muscle over his chest. Caleb made deep, rough sounds that could only be taken as masculine satisfaction, but Lana wasn\u2019t done with him yet. Not even close.</p> <p>She lifted her body and wrapped her fingers around his erection, just like she had before. And just like before, Caleb let out a slow hiss of pleasure that made her feel like a goddess. Her touch had done that. She\u2019d made him feel good. And she was about to make him feel much better.</p><p>Lana positioned him and pressed her body down against the tip of his erection. The blunt thickness sent zingers of electricity racing along her nerves until they ended right where they\u2019d begun. He was big, but she was wet and ready for him. Man, was she ready.</p><p>His hands wrapped around her hips, and his fingers opened and closed almost involuntarily, pressing into her flesh. She managed to sink down a couple inches, feeling her body stretching to take him. It didn\u2019t hurt, but it was . . . intense. He took her breath away.</p><p>She moved back up, descended again, this time farther than before. Caleb\u2019s hands tightened, and Lana felt her body spiraling upward toward another climax. He wasn\u2019t even fuly inside her yet and she was already fighting off the need to come.</p><p>A few more slow, torturous movements of her hips and she had taken as much of him as she could. She was filed up, stretched, her body vibrating with pleasure.</p> <p>Caleb gave her a fierce smile. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d fit inside that tight little body of yours,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect fit.\u201d</p><p>Caleb did something that made his erection twitch inside her and Lana felt her world tilt.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t move, I\u2019m going to have to move you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lana braced her hands on his ribs and lifted her body, then slid right back down. Moving was nearly more than she could stand, and it left her feeling weak and boneless.</p><p>Caleb came to her rescue and lifted her up with a strong grip of his hands on her hips.</p> <p>He slid out of her only to fil her again. Lana was dying. The pressure inside her was too much so soon after he\u2019d given her the best orgasms of her life. But Caleb didn\u2019t relent. He lifted and lowered her over and over while his strong hips worked beneath her. She heard his breathing speed, felt the way his skin heated and his hands were hot against her hips. Lana steadied herself, kept her balance, but that was al she could manage. He\u2019d driven the strength right out of her, and she was just along for the ride. And ride she did, until her head was spinning and her body was vibrating so hard she thought she\u2019d shatter.</p><p>She leaned forward, and the angle caused his penis to press against something magical inside her. Raw feeling expanded through her body, radiating out from where his erection filed her. Her mind shut down, and she let the pleasure wash over her, giving in to the need to cry out. She didn\u2019t care if anyone heard\u2014al she cared about was living inside that shimmering pleasure as long as she could, surrendering to it with shameless abandon.</p><p>The jolts of feeling subsided after endless moments, and just outside her orgasmic haze, she heard Caleb let loose a raw cry of his own. She felt him swel and throb inside her, stretching her farther as he came. It was perfection, feeling his pleasure inside her. Sweet, potent perfection.</p><p>Lana toppled down onto his chest, enjoying the remnants of her orgasm, the faint buzz of her limbs, and the internal spasms that lingered. Caleb\u2019s arms wrapped around her and his wide hands stroked down her back. His hands were shaking.</p><p>She pressed her cheek over his heart and let his deep breathing lul and calm her. He didn\u2019t bother with pilow talk, and she was grateful for the silence. Words would only make reality intrude and ruin what had been the best sex of her life. His hands kept stroking and his heartbeat evened out. Lana closed her eyes and let herself drift.</p><p>For the first time in eighteen months, she slept without dreams.</p><p>Caleb smiled up at the ceiling. He could have ripped apart mountains with his bare hands if she\u2019d asked him to. He felt like some sort of ancient god, powerful and immortal.</p><p>Lana had done that to him. He held her, reveling in the feeling. It had been more than just sex, at least for him. It was proof of her forgiveness, proof of her trust.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t going to let her down.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t above using sex as a tool to pry her secrets from her, but not because he was under orders. He didn\u2019t give a damn about his orders compared to Lana. But he knew that as long as she held back, as long as she kept her problems secret from him, she\u2019d be in danger. He couldn\u2019t stand to let that continue. He\u2019d find a way to get her to trust him enough to share her burden. And then he\u2019d kil it. Whatever it was.</p><p>He stroked his fingers lightly over her back, just barely touching her. He stil couldn\u2019t get over the way it felt like he was stroking sunshine. He figured he\u2019d never get over it.</p><p>Caleb puled in a deep breath and let it out. Lana\u2019s weight lifted atop him, but she didn\u2019t move, and he wasn\u2019t going to encourage her to. He liked her right there, al soft and replete, warm and satisfied. She was perfect just where she was.</p><p>Denny waited as long as he could for the older couple to leave. Didn\u2019t they have jobs to go to? Grandkids to see? Something\u2014anything\u2014to make them leave before it was too late?</p><p>He checked his watch again. He only had fifteen minutes left before the job had to be done. The stench of gasoline was making him sick, not to mention the thought of roasting Grandma and Grandpa alive.</p><p>Why the hel didn\u2019t they leave?</p><p>The air in the garage was suffocating him. Not that there was much of it. The place was packed floor to ceiling with junk, which was why he\u2019d chosen it to start the fire.</p><p>A pile of lumber. An old couch. Too many cans of paint. This place was going to go up like a torch.</p><p>Denny eyed the exit again, ten feet away. Al he had to do was light a match, drop it, and run. His car was a couple of blocks away\u2014a short dash through overgrown back yards. No one would see him.</p><p>It would al be over soon.</p><p>Sour sweat slid into his eyes. He wiped it away with a shaking hand.</p><p>They were stil in the house, puttering around. He could hear the TV. The morning news was blaring.</p><p>Denny checked his watch again. Time was up. For al of them.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath that burned his lungs, lit the match, and let it fal into the gasoline-soaked lumber. Flames roared up as they burned off the fumes in the air, then settled down to a nice hot glow.</p><p>Denny watched from the door just long enough to see he\u2019d done his job, then took off at a dead run.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>By the time Caleb and Lana puled into the First Light Foundation office, the four men Caleb had caled in to help were already waiting for them. He was glad to have the distraction from the thoughtful silence Lana had been giving him al morning.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been cold toward him, but neither had she thrown herself at him this morning when she\u2019d woken up to find him stil in her bed. She\u2019d blushed and headed for the shower, leaving him wishing he\u2019d offered to soap her up and see where it took them. Like he didn\u2019t know just what would happen if he got her back under that hot spray of water. He\u2019d give a repeat performance of the first time, only this time he\u2019d keep going until they were both too tired to stand.</p><p>Instead, he shoved his morning erection into an uncomfortable pair of jeans and pretended like she hadn\u2019t spun his world off its axis last night. He\u2019d give her time to digest what had passed between them and pray she didn\u2019t think it had al been a mistake. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d survive knowing he\u2019d never get the chance to make her come again while he was so deep inside her he could feel her heartbeat.</p><p>With that thought in mind, he got out of the car and gave the man who had guarded Lana\u2019s office last night the signal to go get some rest.</p><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Lana.</p><p>\u201cFriends. Guys I\u2019ve worked with before and know I can trust. Let\u2019s go inside and I\u2019l introduce you.\u201d</p><p>Lana slung her backpack over one shoulder and eyed the men warily while Caleb clasped hands and gave his thanks to each man for coming.</p><p>They filed inside with the cheerful chime of bels tinkling in their wake. Al four of these men had worked with Caleb at one time or another, and besides being good in a bad situation, they had volunteered to take some time and help out with the carnival. He couldn\u2019t have asked for a better group.</p><p>\u201cLana, I\u2019d like you to meet my friends,\u201d he told her, motioning to the first man. \u201cThis is Brent Colins.\u201d</p><p>Brent was the youngest of the group and had a baby face that had fooled more than one bad guy. He looked like someone\u2019s kid brother, with messy brown hair and a few freckles. He had a slim build that was a hel of a lot stronger than it looked, but it was his almost unnatural technical ability that had earned him a place in Delta Force.</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you, Lana.\u201d Brent shook her hand, giving her that boyish smile that Caleb knew would put her at ease.</p><p>\u201cThis is Jack Langston,\u201d said Caleb, introducing the next in line. Jack was the kind of man you wouldn\u2019t look at twice. He blended in wherever he went, as long as he was wearing dark glasses or contacts. He had the palest blue eyes Caleb had ever seen\u2014almost silver\u2014which caused him to keep his eyelids down as if to hide them. The effect was that he looked sleepy, which was a dangerous assumption to have about a man as deadly as Jack.</p><p>Jack said nothing, just nodded in acknowledgment, keeping his hands in his pockets and leaned against the wal.</p><p>Next in line was Riley. He stuck out his hand and gave Lana\u2019s hand a warm shake\u2014the kind presidential candidates use to win votes, with both hands\u2014and a wide smile ful of straight white teeth. \u201cRiley Seaton, ma\u2019am. So glad we could come help you and the kids.\u201d</p><p>Riley could have been a professional model had the urge struck him. He was drop-dead handsome, and Caleb felt himself tense as he waited for Lana to swoon or fal al over him like the women Riley met usualy did. Instead she just smiled, released his hand, and took a step back to Caleb\u2019s side.</p><p>He felt a thril of satisfaction and pride at the simple action. He loved how she could do that\u2014make him feel like he was invincible, the luckiest man on earth.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Madison Parker,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cWe cal him Mad for short, \u2019cause it makes him so happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brent and Riley laughed.</p><p>\u201cMad?\u201d she asked, looking at Caleb.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d answered Mad in that steady, even voice that Caleb had never once heard raised in anger or joy.</p><p>Mad was a bit shorter than Caleb, but with plenty of muscle. They al teased him about his tendency toward emotionless stoicism, but when someone needed the impossible done in a hurry, Mad was the man to cal. Which made him perfect for this job. Caleb stil wasn\u2019t sure how they were going to pul it off.</p> <p>The carnival was in a few days, and there were a milion details to cover. Good thing these were some of the most detail-oriented men on the face of the planet. Doing the impossible with whatever resources were available was what they did best.</p><p>Caleb puled Lana aside and lowered his voice. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need me, I\u2019m going to brief the men on the situation, and we\u2019l get started puling the carnival together.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him like she wanted to say something different but changed her mind a moment before the words came out. \u201cAre you sure about this? About . . . them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re kind of intimidating, don\u2019t you think? Won\u2019t they scare the kids?\u201d</p> <p>Caleb couldn\u2019t stop himself from tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. He needed to touch her again, to feel her skin heat under his hands, but he settled for what he could get away with in public until he could get her alone again. \u201cTrust me, honey. We know what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve done things like this for the kids on base, and none of them have run screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? This fundraiser is important to me. If it fails . . .\u201d She trailed off, and he saw something frightening flash through her eyes\u2014something dark and powerful\u2014a desperation so intense he could almost feel it rushing through her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you down,\u201d he promised. \u201cThis is going to work. You\u2019l see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only have a few days.\u201d That hopeless look she wore nearly brought him to his knees. He didn\u2019t care who was watching or what his men thought. He puled her into his arms and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cTwice as many as we need. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>He felt her nod under his lips, but he could tel that she didn\u2019t quite believe him. Didn\u2019t quite trust him.</p> <p>The knowledge made his chest ache, but he knew he couldn\u2019t force something like that. She trusted him with her body, but it wasn\u2019t enough. He wanted her to trust him with her life, her future. He wanted to prove to her that no matter what had happened in the past, he\u2019d never let her down again. He wasn\u2019t sure why this fundraiser was so important to her, but he didn\u2019t realy care. It was important to her, and that was al he needed to know.</p><p>Caleb released Lana before he did something that would embarrass them both in front of the room ful of men. He gave her a quick kiss on the forehead and a reassuring smile. \u201cJust trust me.\u201d</p><p>While the men were having their powwow, Lana ducked out of the office, intent on going to visit Stacie. She\u2019d been sent home yesterday, and Lana wanted to make sure she and her sister were settling in okay.</p><p>Lana had just reached her car when Caleb caught her. The sun blazed down, casting his face into a deep shadow. That jolt of feeling coursed through her as she was thrown back in time to the day he\u2019d carried her out of that cave. Lana closed her eyes and braced her weight against her car door.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked while his hands wrapped around her upper arms to steady her.</p><p>Lana felt the heat of his touch warm her more thoroughly than the hot sun overhead. She stifled a little shiver, remembering just how his hands had felt as he\u2019d touched her last night, how much pleasure he\u2019d given her with just the stroke of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Just feeling a little crowded in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of people to cram into such a tiny office. Why don\u2019t we go for a drive?\u201d</p> <p>Lana stared at his big feet rather than risk getting hit by the force of the memories that lurked in his silhouette. \u201cI\u2019d rather be alone for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me come with you,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you to be alone. Not after what happened to Stacie.\u201d</p><p>She needed some time to herself\u2014some space away from Caleb so she could think. Regroup. \u201cI need this, Caleb. Just let me go. Please.\u201d</p><p>He stood quietly for a moment, and she wasn\u2019t sure if he was trying to think of another argument or trying to convince himself he didn\u2019t need one. \u201cWould you prefer one of the other men go with you instead?\u201d There was a quality in his voice that she hadn\u2019t heard before. If she hadn\u2019t known better, she would have thought it was insecurity, but that didn\u2019t make any sense. No one was stronger or more courageous than Caleb.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t know those men. I just need some time alone. I need to go see Stacie. I need to visit the kids.\u201d She hid the spike of anxiety she felt at the thought of going back to the youth center. Kara seemed to always be there.</p><p>His hand cupped her cheek, and he fought the urge to lean into his touch. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let you go, but I guess it\u2019s not my choice.\u201d</p><p>There was a deeper meaning to his words, she could hear it in his tone, but she didn\u2019t dare try to figure it out. As it was, she was using every bit of wilpower she had to keep from begging him to make her life go away again. He\u2019d given her a precious gift of solace in a world that had revolved around fear for so long she\u2019d forgotten what it was like not to be afraid.</p><p>He\u2019d shown her what it was like to be normal again, and waking up to her real life had felt like a crushing blow. Nothing had changed. She stil had to stay silent. It was the only way to protect those she loved\u2014a group that was wel on its way to including Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l be fine,\u201d she told him. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t thrown his own words back at him, he might have forced the issue and pressured her to let him come, but instead, she\u2019d asked him to trust her. How could he expect her to trust him if he didn\u2019t do the same?</p><p>Damn, he wished he just had something to blow up rather than having to deal with al this psychological shit.</p><p>He watched her drive away and caled Grant on his cel phone. He answered with a sleepy, \u201c\u2019lo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTel me you planted a tracking device on her car when you swept it for bugs and fixed the brakes.\u201d</p><p>Al sleepiness vanished, and Grant sounded wide-awake. \u201cOf course. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needed some time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. I\u2019m already on the way to the car. I\u2019l have her in sight in less than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Caleb pushed out a relieved breath. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you trust me not to seduce her away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you like your smile on the front side of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I get it. You\u2019re big and mean, and you\u2019l beat the shit out of me if I so much as touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were a smart man.\u201d Caleb hung up and went back inside to finish nailing down the final plans for the carnival. They weren\u2019t going to try for anything fancy, but there was plenty they could do without spending much money. A lot of that hinged on the men being wiling to humiliate themselves, but that was al part of the fun.</p><p>Three hours later, Caleb rubbed his ear, which was sore from too much exposure to the telephone. He\u2019d made some progress, but not nearly enough to suit him. He didn\u2019t want anything else to go wrong with Lana\u2019s fundraiser. He\u2019d told her to trust him, and he was determined that when al was said and done, she would know she could.</p><p>He\u2019d just set the phone back in its cradle when it rang. Lana stil wasn\u2019t back, so he answered it in her stead. Sixty seconds later he was nearly in a panic, rushing out the door to find Lana. He was done playing games now. The stakes had just gone up, and he didn\u2019t want to let her out of his sight again.</p><p>Lana was sitting on the edge of Stacie\u2019s bed, chatting quietly with her about her sister when Caleb came into the room. The look on his face nearly stopped her heart. His jaw was set at a grim angle, and his black eyes had darkened with anger to the point they reflected no light.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, knowing something was wrong.</p><p>He took her hands, and she could feel rage vibrating though his limbs. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded, fear uncurling inside her until it was a nearly living thing.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s fine. You need to know that first, but there was a fire at your parents\u2019 house. It was totaly destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . . fire?\u201d She couldn\u2019t digest the information. It was too surreal.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and dad are safe. A little shaken up, but fine otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lana,\u201d said Stacie, starting to rise from the bed.</p><p>Lana held out her hand to stop her friend from getting up. She stil wasn\u2019t strong enough yet to be moving around much.</p><p>Caleb puled her against him, hugging her, but Lana was a statue in his arms. She couldn\u2019t let him comfort her. If she weakened even a little, she would lose control. Mom and Dad were going to need her. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cPolice and firemen are there now. It wil be a while before they know anything.\u201d</p><p>Lana pushed away from him and took a step toward the door\u2014away from Caleb, away from Stacie, too. She had to get away from both of them and their soft words of comfort. \u201cAnd you\u2019re sure they\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I spoke with your mother briefly. She says they\u2019re both fine.\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. A fire. Was this what was next on Kara\u2019s list to destroy her life? First her peace and any sense of security were destroyed, then Stacie was shot, and now a fire? What was next? Who was next? Which of the people she loved was going to be the next target of violence?</p><p>Caleb reached for her, but Lana jerked away. She couldn\u2019t let him get near her again. It wasn\u2019t safe. She had to break things off with Stacie, too. Fire her. Shove Stacie out of her life. It was the only way.</p><p>Lana turned around, ignoring the worried voices behind her. She couldn\u2019t stay here. She had to go see if her parents were realy okay, see it with her own eyes. Only then would she believe it was true.</p><p>She had already puled out of Stacie\u2019s driveway by the time Caleb came running out of the door. She had to get away from him. What if he was the next target?</p><p>The streets blurred by her as she took the familiar path to the home where she\u2019d grown up. It was nestled back on a little plot of land her father had worked two jobs to buy. She remembered her dad helping erect the frame of the house when she was five, remembered her mom poring over carpet samples and paint chips. She\u2019d had sleepovers with friends and birthday parties there. She\u2019d woken up many Christmas mornings to a festive tree and a pile of presents, her fat stocking hanging from the fireplace. She\u2019d had her first kiss on the back porch and cried after her first breakup at the kitchen table.</p><p>It was home.</p><p>And now it was gone. Lana cleared the corner and the road was stil clogged with rescue vehicles. Dribbles of black smoke wafted into the clear summer sky, and the smel of that smoke choked her lungs. She got out of the car, not even sure if she\u2019d left it running, and walked like a zombie up the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything was gone. There was just a big black pile of charred concrete and brick where her home used to be.</p><p>She knew it was her fault.</p><p>Her mother ran over to her, wrapped in a dirty blanket. She had smudges of soot on her cheeks and a lost look in her blue eyes. Her mom\u2019s arms wrapped around her, covering them both with the blanket, and it was al Lana could do not to shove her away. It wasn\u2019t safe to show her love like this in public. She was probably being watched.</p><p>Lana wondered if the tears roling down her mother\u2019s face brought Kara as much sick pleasure as her screams had.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d asked Lana. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with the fire chief right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>Madeline Hancock led Lana over puddles and through a crowd of neighbors. Carter Hancock was standing near the front of the fire truck, staring over the ruins of his house.</p><p>Lana hesitated for only a moment before going to him.</p> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d whispered Lana, choking back her tears. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from hugging him. He looked so shaken, so devastated.</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d he said, as if he was surprised to see her.</p><p>Lana checked him over for visible signs of injury but found none. He was pale and shaking but looked unhurt. She knew that didn\u2019t mean a damn thing, though. For al she knew he was screaming on the inside, rough, ragged screams of pain and loss. She knew what that was like al too wel.</p><p>\u201cI think the roses may survive,\u201d he told her as if it was the only thing holding him together. \u201cThey were far enough away from the house that the fire didn\u2019t get them. If the water didn\u2019t rip them apart, they may be okay.\u201d</p><p>Lana wiped away a soot stain from his wrinkled cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019l survive.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an absent nod.</p> <p>Madeline took her husband\u2019s hand, and together they stared at the charred remains of their home.</p><p>Lana turned away, unable to stand witnessing the suffering she\u2019d caused for even one more second. Standing behind her a few feet away was Caleb. He was watching her, looking invincible and strong, and she struggled against the urge to go to him and let him take away this nightmare, too. But unlike last night, this was real, and she had to face it.</p><p>Lana ripped her eyes from him and just looked at the soggy ground. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked her mom. \u201cDo you want to come stay at my place?\u201d She regretted the words the moment she said them. No way could her parents stay at her place. That would make them even more of a target than they already were.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019l go stay with Jenny and Todd. They have more room, and little Taylor wil take our mind off this mess like no one else could.\u201d Taylor was their one and only grandchild, and they doted and fussed over him as if he were the only child on earth.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need? Anything I can do?\u201d asked Lana.</p><p>\u201cNo. Jenny\u2019s on her way, and I know you\u2019ve got your fundraiser coming up. You concentrate on that and don\u2019t worry about us.\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. Her parents held each other. She turned away.</p><p>Lana puled herself together as tight as she was going to get and marched over to Caleb. \u201cI want you to put a guard on my sister\u2019s house. And Stacie\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re ready to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWil you do it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I have nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know that\u2019s not true,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cAnswer my question. Wil you do this or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019l do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo strings attached?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d he asked her, and she knew he was talking about more than just her request for help. He was talking about them\u2014about what they\u2019d shared last night.</p><p>Lana shoved the thought away before it could take root. One night of kiler sex did not equal a relationship. She couldn\u2019t let herself think otherwise, no matter how much she wanted to. \u201cYes. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s expression hardened, closed up. He puled out his cel phone and pressed a button. \u201cAssign guards at the Cramer residence as wel as her sister\u2019s house.\u201d He paused. \u201cYes, twenty-four/seven. Don\u2019t let them know you\u2019re there.\u201d He hung up, looking at her with that same cold expression. \u201cIt\u2019s done. No strings attached.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s eyes closed in relief. At least she\u2019d managed to get her family and her friend that much help. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was something. More than she could have done alone. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to end here,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhatever is causing this is only going to get worse.\u201d</p><p>Not if she cut everyone out of her life. Kara only wanted to hurt the people Lana loved, so al she had to do was pretend she didn\u2019t love anyone. She was good at pretending, and she was going to start with Caleb. \u201cI don\u2019t want you folowing me around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I\u2019m tired of having you trail after me like a puppy dog. Go home. Send someone else if you have to, but stay out of my way.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, and she had to tilt her head back to look into his eyes. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing, and it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she told him, using the bitchiest voice she could muster.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>There was no way she could fool him with a lie about that. He\u2019d been right by her side through the nightmares\u2014both the real thing and now the ghostly remnants of it. He would see right through her lies.</p><p>She turned and walked away because there was nothing else she could do. The farther away from Caleb she got, the safer he\u2019d be.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Caleb let her go, knowing Jack was on her trail like a shadow to watch her back. He\u2019d seen Jack\u2019s dark sedan slip out behind her, unnoticed. She\u2019d never see him, but he\u2019d keep tabs on her and make sure she stayed safe.</p><p>For now, that\u2019s al Caleb wanted. Or at least that\u2019s what he tried to tel himself. The lie didn\u2019t work any better than Lana\u2019s had.</p><p>He surveyed the damage to her parents\u2019 home. Whatever she was hiding was getting bigger every day.</p><p>Maybe something here would clue him in to what Lana was hiding. He scanned the crowd for the person in charge and found Detective Hart looking right at him. He was as good a place to start as any.</p><p>\u201cWe meet again,\u201d said Detective Hart as Caleb approached him.</p><p>\u201cYou investigate arson as wel as robbery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said it was arson?\u201d asked Hart, his hazel eyes glittering with inteligence.</p><p>Caleb shook his head. He must not be thinking straight to be trapped as quickly as that. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Detective Hart glanced over at the house and gave a shrug. \u201cI think it\u2019s more than just a coincidence that two properties connected to Lana Hancock have been singled out in the same week in a very dangerous way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got a theory?\u201d</p><p>Hart laughed. \u201cNot one that wil beat yours, I\u2019l bet. Care to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Can\u2019t help you.\u201d Caleb almost wished he could. There was something about Hart\u2019s quiet competence that reminded him of David. Man, what he wouldn\u2019t give to have David at his back right now. Not that he begrudged his friend time with his new wife. Caleb would be doing exactly the same thing that David was\u2014doting on his bride</p><p>\u2014if he\u2019d been given half a chance.</p><p>As if.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor next to Lana\u2019s office keeps reporting a suspicious man sitting outside. When our patrol car shows up, no one\u2019s there. I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s one of yours?\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t confirm it but said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about him if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t want to waste precious resources,\u201d said Hart with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. \u201cI realize that you\u2019ve got a job to do, but so do I. I won\u2019t step on your toes. I just want to know what we\u2019re up against. These events aren\u2019t just some punky kids on a crime spree. It\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that secretive shit. I know that you\u2019re military, and based on the limited information available, you\u2019re probably Special Forces. You wouldn\u2019t be here if this wasn\u2019t big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ilegal for me to operate inside the United States. I\u2019m just a guy on leave protecting my girlfriend from some pranksters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m the fucking tooth fairy. Drop the crap and tel me what I can do, even if you don\u2019t want to tel me why. Miss Hancock\u2019s been through hel enough already.\u201d</p><p>Caleb hadn\u2019t expected the detective to know about her past, though he guessed he should have. She was something of a local celebrity. Thanks to the press, everyone knew she was the girl who was taken hostage and lived to tel, the girl who came back and devoted her life to helping kids.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s also why I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t want to see a sweet girl come to a bad end. Let me do my job.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t want to bring anyone else into this mess. He had enough men already, and no matter how much Hart reminded him of David, he wasn\u2019t David. Didn\u2019t have David\u2019s training or history. \u201cSorry. Wish I could help.\u201d</p><p>Hart uttered a caustic string of curses, stomped off a few feet, ran a hand over his face and came back. He was like a freaking buldog, refusing to let it drop. \u201cI hear there\u2019s a big shindig going down at the youth center,\u201d said Hart calmly as if his little fit had vented off al that frustration.</p><p>\u201cIn a few days,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cGonna be lots of kids there, from what I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard right. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me. In fact, plenty of us on the force think what Lana\u2019s doing is great. We\u2019d love to come out and lend a hand.\u201d</p><p>Caleb finaly puled his head out of his ass far enough to figure out what Hart was offering. Police protection. \u201cI suppose we can always use the help,\u201d he told the detective.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I like a cooperative man,\u201d he said with no lack of sarcasm.</p><p>Caleb just grinned, liking Hart more by the second.</p><p>\u201cWho should I contact?\u201d asked Hart.</p><p>\u201cMe. Lana\u2019s got enough on her plate with the art auction, so some of my buddies and I are helping run the carnival side of the fundraiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuddies. You mean coworkers.\u201d</p><p>Caleb confirmed nothing. He didn\u2019t want to draw any attention to the fact that there was a team of former and active Delta Force operators hanging out in the middle of Missouri.</p><p>\u201cWhoever they are, I\u2019d love to meet them. When\u2019s our first meeting?\u201d</p><p>There was a little more than a week until the carnival, and Caleb figured Hart would need some time to organize things on his end. \u201cHow about right now?\u201d</p><p>Hart raised his dark eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t you need to folow Lana home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s covered,\u201d said Caleb with more disgust in his voice than he would have liked.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see. Trouble in paradise.\u201d</p><p>Caleb felt his fists clench. \u201cYou wanna be part of this or not?\u201d</p><p>Hart held up his hands. \u201cPoint taken. Don\u2019t talk about your love life. Or lack thereof.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb shot Hart a glare. \u201cI\u2019m going to regret working with you on this, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Hart just grinned. \u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>Kara kept a close eye on Caleb as he spoke to the police. She couldn\u2019t make out what they were saying from this distance, but Caleb\u2019s manner was not that of a man with an immediate sense of urgency. Whatever they were talking about, it had nothing to do with her or the fire.</p><p>Good. She didn\u2019t need any more of Caleb\u2019s interference.</p><p>The stench of smoke in the area was stifling, but Kara ignored it as she snapped photos of the scene. Lana\u2019s parents sat huddled together under blankets, like refugees.</p> <p>Their fingers were laced together as they stared at the smoldering remains of their home. The sun sparkled off the tears streaming down the woman\u2019s soot-smudged face.</p><p>How touching.</p><p>Kara froze the image on her digital camera so she could save it with al the rest. She knew it was risky to have this kind of evidence on her, but she couldn\u2019t help that. She had to show Marcus what she\u2019d done. He was going to be so proud of her.</p><p>After snapping a few more pictures with her zoom lens, Kara moved her car several blocks down the street so it wouldn\u2019t be spotted. She puled over and got out to retrieve her laptop from the trunk so she could download the images and e-mail them to Marcus.</p><p>She opened the trunk and her laptop wasn\u2019t there. The trunk was empty.</p><p>Kara had put her computer in her trunk only a few hours ago. She\u2019d been out of her car for no more than five minutes when she went in to get a cup of coffee.</p> <p>Apparently, that five minutes had been enough for it to be stolen.</p><p>A sickening suspicion rose up inside her. Kara scanned the area as she made her way back behind the wheel. She saw nothing. Whoever had taken it was gone, but she was pretty sure she knew who had done it\u2014or at least who had ordered the laptop to be stolen.</p><p>Marcus hadn\u2019t been pleased about that video of him. He would have been livid if he\u2019d known she had a backup of the video hanging from her keychain. She should have kept the whole thing to herself, but when it came to Marcus, she had so little self-control. She wanted to please him too much.</p><p>Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe she was trying too hard.</p><p>Maybe she wasn\u2019t trying hard enough.</p><p>Yes. That was it. He\u2019d taken her in, fed her and clothed her, and protected her when no one else cared. And now she had to show him just how grateful she was. She had to try harder.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t take care of Lana with Caleb guarding her, then she\u2019d have to take care of him, too. Get rid of al of her guard dogs at the same time in one nice, neat bundle.</p><p>The bigger the explosion, the better.</p> <p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Lana sat on her living room couch waiting for Caleb to show up. Her fingers had a mind of their own as they doodled over the paper. It wasn\u2019t until they stopped that she realized what she\u2019d drawn. The face of the man who had beaten her. The man Caleb had kiled.</p><p>With a jolt of panic, Lana tore the sketch up into tiny pieces and flushed it down the toilet. She was going to have to be more careful. If that mindless drawing had taken place where someone could see, she might be dead before she had time to flush the evidence.</p><p>Lana set the paper out of reach and curled up on the couch, hoping Caleb would hurry. She wanted this over with.</p><p>It was nearly midnight, but she knew he would come here. What she hadn\u2019t expected was for him to let himself in as if he lived here. He stepped through the door, pocketing a key. How he got it she had no idea, but he wasn\u2019t leaving here with it.</p><p>His dark eyes slid over her, taking in her floppy robe and the bare feet sticking out beneath it. \u201cYou\u2019re stil awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>A relieved smile curved his mouth, and Lana\u2019s heart sped at the memory of just how good that mouth could make her feel. \u201cI was hoping I\u2019d given you enough time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I was waiting. I wanted to make sure you understand that what happened between us last night was a onetime thing. You\u2019re a great guy, but I\u2019m just too busy for any kind of relationship right now. Even just sex.\u201d</p><p>She saw his abdomen tighten abruptly as if she\u2019d hit him. The smile faded from his face, and he gave her a hard, black stare. \u201cIs that what it was to you? Just sex?\u201d</p><p>Make it a clean break. It\u2019s better that way. \u201cGreat sex, but yeah. Just sex.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer, as if stalking her. He towered over her, and Lana had to stand up from the couch to help even the playing field. Ending things with him was hard enough as it was without the added disadvantage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou came apart in my arms last night. You can\u2019t tel me that something that good is a one-shot deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed that kind of release last night, but not anymore. I appreciate that you think you have to protect me, but I think we\u2019d both be better off if you just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot against orders I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen convince Monroe that I don\u2019t know anything. Tel him you believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to lie for you?\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s mouth clamped down tight before she could say something she\u2019d regret. She knew better than to think that a man as noble as Caleb would ever lie to his commanding officer. No matter how desperate she was, she couldn\u2019t ask that of him. \u201cFine. Then tel him it\u2019s hopeless. You even seduced me and I stil couldn\u2019t tel you anything. Tel him whatever you want, just leave. Please.\u201d</p><p>He settled one big hand at the base of her throat, stroking over her colarbone with his thumb. Shivers of remembered pleasure flooded her, making her bones go soft. She tried not to make any noise, but she failed; a soft sigh escaped her lips before she could stop it. Her eyes fluttered shut, and she tried to regain control over her hormones. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Caleb,\u201d was al she could manage to say before her voice broke. She swalowed hard against the tears that clogged her throat but didn\u2019t fal.</p><p>His finger glided along her skin, warm and slightly rough. \u201cIf I leave, who wil hold you when the nightmares come?\u201d</p><p>Lana had been trying not to think about that al day. Caleb had given her peace, and now that she had to push him away, that peace would go with him. \u201cI don\u2019t need you or anyone else to hold me. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone should be there for you. You shouldn\u2019t have to do this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier that way.\u201d</p><p>She heard anger sharpen his words, but his hand remained gentle. \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to suffer? Push everyone out of your life so that you won\u2019t care if one of them gets hurt because you\u2019re too stubborn to see you need help?\u201d</p><p>It was her turn to get angry. How dare he accuse her of not caring? \u201cYou have no idea how I felt when I saw Stacie was shot, when I saw my parents\u2019 home burned to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I? How do you know? How do you know I haven\u2019t been through exactly what you have? You\u2019ve never asked about my life, my family, my friends. Not once. Was it because you didn\u2019t care or because you didn\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d nailed her motives so completely that Lana was stunned silent. She backed away, stumbling against the couch. She had to put some distance between them before she was stripped bare of every one of her secrets.</p><p>Caleb folowed her, backing her into the little kitchen. She realized her mistake in choosing the kitchen when she realized there was no place left to run.</p><p>His skin had darkened with anger, and his nostrils flared as he folowed her, backing her against the counter. \u201cYou can\u2019t run from me. You may not give a shit about me, but I don\u2019t feel the same about you. Push al you want, I\u2019m not going away until I know you\u2019re safe. I nearly got you kiled once, and I don\u2019t make the same mistake twice.\u201d</p><p>This was a side of Caleb she\u2019d never seen. She\u2019d seen him angry. She\u2019d seen him furious when he\u2019d kiled the man that had hurt her, but she\u2019d never seen that anger turned on her. \u201cYou may not want me in your life, but I\u2019m staying until the job is done. You don\u2019t have to let me in your bed, but that\u2019s the only choice I\u2019m giving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your choice to give. It\u2019s my life. You\u2019re not welcome in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here I am, sticking around. Get used to it. As stubborn as you are, I may be here for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, please don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to get rid of me so badly, then tel me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can tel you.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long time, his mouth pressed into a hard line. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be next, Lana? Your sister? Her son? When are you going to learn that we aren\u2019t meant to do the big things alone?\u201d</p><p>She almost believed him. She almost caved under the weight of her secret. What if he was right? What if her silence was causing the people she loved to be hurt?</p><p>Then again, what if he was wrong? She knew what would happen if she ever let on what she knew. For now, Kara could only guess. If Lana pretended long enough, Kara would believe she knew nothing and go away. If she told the truth, Kara would know she was a threat. Even if Lana went into protective custody, Kara or one of her goons would rip through her family, kiling every one of them until they found a way to destroy her. Or maybe just to torture her for hiding from them for so long.</p><p>Her choices were limited, but the possibility of violence was better than the guarantee of violence. She had to stay quiet, but she also knew now that she had to leave. The fundraiser was in a few days, and after that, she\u2019d disappear. If she wasn\u2019t around to watch her family suffer, it would no longer amuse Kara to do it. She\u2019d have to focus on finding Lana instead. She hated the idea of leaving her home and family, but she had no choice. Not anymore.</p><p>Lana looked up at Caleb, knowing he was one of those people she\u2019d have to leave behind. Part of her wanted to open her arms and let him give her what little bit of joy she could squeeze out of life, but the smarter part of her knew that would be a mistake. She\u2019d never asked any personal questions, because she knew that if he became a real person in her eyes, she\u2019d have no defenses left. Right now, he was just a hero that had saved her life and made her body sing. He was larger than life\u2014not truly human\u2014and she needed him to stay that way. If he became human to her, she knew she\u2019d fal in love with him, and walking away would be only that much harder.</p><p>\u201cGive me back my key,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Caleb puled in a deep breath that made his shirt stretch over his chest. What she wouldn\u2019t have done to possess half his physical strength. Too bad she wouldn\u2019t be able to continue the self-defense lessons he\u2019d given her. That would have gone a long way toward making her feel safe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m keeping the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yours to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but when you start screaming tonight, I\u2019l be able to get in without breaking your door down again.\u201d</p><p>The idea of him holding her, making her forget her dreams, was potent. Blood surged through her body, making her tremble at the memory. \u201cIf I start screaming tonight, I don\u2019t want you anywhere near me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTough shit. I can\u2019t just stand by and let you suffer. Not ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing fine without you for a long time. I don\u2019t need or want your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Eventualy you\u2019l figure that out, but until then, I\u2019m not going to let you suffer.\u201d</p><p>Too late, she thought. Her suffering was just getting started. Once she was on her own, that\u2019s al she\u2019d have left.</p><p>Denny\u2019s head was pounding. There wasn\u2019t enough beer in Germany to make it stop. He knew because he figured he\u2019d been through half that much today without relief.</p> <p>He could stil smel the gasoline clinging to his hands no matter how many times he washed them. He could stil feel the heat of the flames on his face. This was one job he\u2019d never forget. Or repeat.</p><p>His phone rang, and it took his shaking hands three tries to hit the talk button. \u201cWhat?\u201d he barked into the phone, then instantly regretted it when the loud noise spiked through his head.</p><p>\u201cI have another job for you.\u201d</p><p>Denny had come to hate that robot voice. \u201cNo. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I say you are. Unless you\u2019d like me to have a chat with Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got enough money to make him back off for a few days. I\u2019l get the rest some other way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow?\u201d asked the metalic voice. \u201cWith your keen inteligence and charming personality? I\u2019m sure there is a line of employers at your door waiting for the privilege of hiring you.\u201d</p><p>He was right. God knew Denny didn\u2019t have a lot going for him, but he\u2019d find a way to make money that didn\u2019t hurt so many people.</p><p>He\u2019d watched the news and seen Madeline Hancock sobbing, clinging to her husband. She didn\u2019t look anything like Denny\u2019s mother, but there was something about Madeline that reminded him of her al the same\u2014some mannerism, or maybe that deep, sorrowful look he\u2019d seen his mother wear every day until the day she died.</p><p>Denny wasn\u2019t sure he was ever going to get that image out of his head. Not enough beer in Germany.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d he insisted, though his voice wavered.</p><p>Silence filed the line for a moment. \u201cYou know, Dennis, Bruce is not the only one who knows how to use his hands. If you don\u2019t want my money, I\u2019m sure I can find someone who does.\u201d</p><p>Denny got the underlying threat. His boss would use that money to tutor Denny in the most basic way\u2014by beating the shit out of him.</p><p>Denny\u2019s head pounded harder, and he struggled to clear it. He didn\u2019t want anything more to do with this nut job, but he\u2019d backed himself into a corner. He could either play nice or take his punishment. Just like old times with Dad.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d he asked, knowing he had no choice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a package on your front porch. Open it. Take everything out and lay it on your kitchen table.\u201d</p><p>Denny waited for more instructions, but none came. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d confirmed the voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do what you\u2019re told and be a good boy.\u201d</p><p>Denny hung up and got the box off his front porch. He shoved everything off his kitchen table into the trash, making beer bottles clang and pummel his aching head. He slit the tape open with a steak knife and puled out everything inside, placing it al carefuly on the table.</p><p>Denny had never been the brightest lightbulb in the box, but he was smart enough to know the makings of a bomb when he saw them.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>Caleb wanted to break something out of sheer frustration. For nearly a week, Lana did little more than acknowledge his existence. She\u2019d even wedged a chair under the door to her apartment to keep him out. Caleb could have blasted through it, but that wouldn\u2019t have helped his efforts toward getting her to trust him. Besides, he knew that part of him only wanted to get in hoping that she\u2019d beg him to make her forget her nightmares again. Just the thought of a repeat of that night was enough to have him sweating and shaking with unsated lust.</p><p>She\u2019d been polite to his men, thanking them for helping with the fundraiser, but other than that, she\u2019d kept her distance from everyone.</p><p>Except Grant.</p><p>Every evening after the youth center closed, Grant had been training with Lana, teaching her the brutal, deadly moves they\u2019d al learned in unarmed-combat training. From the bruises on Grant\u2019s body, Caleb was pretty sure she was learning quickly. If it hadn\u2019t been for that raw gnawing of jealousy in his gut, Caleb would have been comforted to know she was learning how to protect herself.</p><p>Grant spun a chair around backward and straddled it. They\u2019d turned Lana\u2019s office into a war room of sorts so that they could have a place to coordinate their efforts. Lana had taken to using the tiny storage room at the back of the office for her own work space, likely to keep from having to see Caleb more than necessary.</p><p>The thought pissed him off, and his mood wasn\u2019t improved by Grant\u2019s smug smile.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u2019 asked Caleb. His only source of information about Lana was Grant, and as jealous as he was of the time they were spending together, he knew better than to cut the man off.</p><p>\u201cSame as yesterday and the day before. Working herself ragged al day making the auction happen, and working out the frustration of doing that on my poor abused body.</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it must suck to have a beautiful woman roling around on the floor with you like that. You poor bastard.\u201d</p><p>Grant gave a laughing grunt. \u201cShe\u2019s got one hel of a punch. Check this out.\u201d Grant puled up the front of his shirt and showed Caleb a new bruise along his ribs.</p><p>The purple mark made Caleb smile.</p><p>\u201cI told her not to hold back, but damn. She\u2019s stronger than she looks.\u201d</p><p>Thank God for that. Caleb wasn\u2019t sure how wel she was holding up, but he knew she wasn\u2019t a wimp or a quitter. Once this fundraiser was over, she wouldn\u2019t have anything to distract her from him, and he\u2019d move in for the kil, so to speak.</p><p>Assuming Grant didn\u2019t beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with her last night?\u201d asked Caleb. He hadn\u2019t been able to stick around after Grant had been invited inside. Instead, he\u2019d gone to an al-night gym and beat his frustration out on the heavy bag. His knuckles were sore today, but that\u2019s al he\u2019d managed to accomplish.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t sleep with her last night. Or any other night. Relax. She may be giving you the ice-queen treatment, but under al that frost, the woman\u2019s stil got the hots for you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb tried not to get too excited by Grant\u2019s statement, even though he wanted to lurch out and grab on to that hope with both hands. \u201cIs that so? Guess it\u2019s that way she has of looking right through me like I\u2019m the Invisible Man that had me fooled.\u201d</p><p>Grant ran a hand through his blond hair in frustration. \u201cGod damn, you can be an idiot. I swear, you act like you\u2019ve never been around a woman before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019re a jackass if you just sit there and let her do this. You think she and I are al buddy-buddy, but you\u2019re wrong. She\u2019s a freaking zombie. No emotion. Not even when she\u2019s fighting. She\u2019s holding al of that in for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel if I know. Al I know is that every time I bring up your name, I see a little crack in the ice. She\u2019s got it bad for you, man, and if you don\u2019t do whatever you can to fight for her, you don\u2019t deserve her.\u201d</p><p>Grant walked off leaving Caleb reeling. Was he right? Had Caleb done the wrong thing when he\u2019d given her space? He\u2019d done it out of respect. He\u2019d been raised to respect a lady\u2019s wishes, and it was just second nature to him. Maybe that was where he\u2019d gone wrong. Maybe this was one of those rare times when the rules had to be bent if not completely broken in order to obtain the goal. And Caleb definitely had a goal. He wanted Lana untangled from whatever mess she was in so that she\u2019d be able to take back her life. He wanted more than just casual sex with her, and she wasn\u2019t going to be in a position to make those kinds of decisions if she was stil constantly looking over her shoulder, praying her life wouldn\u2019t spiral out of control.</p><p>He had to find a way to give her back control. He wasn\u2019t sure how, but he had to try. He loved her too much not to.</p><p>Caleb knew it was bad news when he saw the private number on his caler ID. That was the way it always showed up when Monroe caled.</p><p>He stepped away from the other men before answering the cal. \u201cHelo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is taking entirely too long,\u201d said Monroe without preamble.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t ask him what he meant. He already knew he\u2019d been here too long. \u201cIt takes as long as it takes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, you aren\u2019t even trying anymore. I didn\u2019t send you out there to lounge about and play with kids al day.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure just how Monroe knew he\u2019d been spending most of his time at the youth center, teaching the kids general safety precautions, but he had a good idea.</p><p>He was going to have to kick Grant\u2019s ass for this prank. \u201cShe\u2019s too worried about her fundraiser to focus on anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got enough men to pul off ten fundraisers and you know it. This is child\u2019s play\u2014literaly\u2014and I\u2019m not letting you use it as an excuse. Finish the job, or I\u2019l send someone who can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought there wasn\u2019t anyone else, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can piss me off without even trying, but you can\u2019t gain the confidence of one woman with an entire team to back you up while you do? What the hel are we paying you for?\u201d</p><p>Caleb focused on breathing and not saying how he realy felt about Monroe\u2019s opinion. \u201cI need more time, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got three days. Get it done or move aside for someone who can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fundraiser is in two days,\u201d explained Caleb.</p><p>\u201cThen that gives you a whole day after the damn thing to get the girl to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d grated out Caleb. Had he tried to say anything else, it would have been the end to his career. Then again, maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.</p><p>\u201cGood. Check back in every twenty-four and give me a progress report.\u201d With that, Monroe hung up.</p><p>Caleb stood there for several minutes, trying to get his frustration under control. It wasn\u2019t going to help anyone if he couldn\u2019t pul himself together and focus.</p><p>Three days. It might not be enough, but there was only one way to find out. Caleb was done being nice. Lady or not, Lana was about to meet the side of Caleb that had earned him his career in Special Forces. He didn\u2019t like playing dirty, but it was for her own good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kara rushed into the motel room and locked the door behind her. Her heart was pounding, her breath coming in ragged gasps.</p><p>Someone was folowing her, and in her line of work, that was a death sentence.</p><p>She\u2019d slipped her tail about an hour ago and stolen a car before holing up here for the night. It was as safe as she was going to get for now.</p><p>Marcus was angry. She didn\u2019t blame him for that. She\u2019d failed him and deserved to be punished. But kiled? Kara thought he loved her more than that.</p> <p>Maybe she\u2019d been wrong al along. Maybe he didn\u2019t love her at al. He wouldn\u2019t kil someone he loved, would he?</p><p>This was al Lana\u2019s fault. If she hadn\u2019t survived, none of this would have happened. And she wouldn\u2019t have survived if it hadn\u2019t been for Caleb Stone.</p><p>The two of them had ruined Kara\u2019s life, and she wanted them dead\u2014blown into so many pieces there would be nothing left to bury. No one would question her presence at the youth center. She could plant the bomb herself\u2014make sure it was done right.</p><p>Once Lana and her guards were dead, Marcus would no longer be angry. He\u2019d forgive her for her failure and she\u2019d finaly be able to go home and be with him again.</p><p>Lana entered the gym at the same time she had the past three nights, only this time, Grant wasn\u2019t waiting for her. Caleb was. He stood with his feet braced apart, looking like he was ready to come sprinting after her if she tried to run.</p> <p>She let out a weary sigh and tossed her backpack along the wal. Running away wasn\u2019t an option, but neither was alowing Caleb to take over her lessons. \u201cIs Grant sick?\u201d</p><p>she asked, striding forward. The sight of Caleb in that snug T-shirt and shorts made her stomach tighten. His thick legs were layered with muscle, and the dark hair dusting them made every ridge stand out in stark definition.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was al he said.</p><p>Lana stepped onto the mat, puling together her strength to face him. \u201cI\u2019l wait for him, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019l cal one of the other men. Jack has been folowing me everywhere I go. Maybe he\u2019s sitting outside.\u201d She turned to go check, but Caleb\u2019s hand stopped her. His fingers wrapped around her arm, and the contact of his skin on hers drove the breath from her body. She dangled there at the end of his arm, unable to free herself, too stupid to even try.</p> <p>His thumb slid over her arm as if he couldn\u2019t help himself. Little skittering bundles of nerves scampered through her system until they settled low in her bely in a writhing pile. Six days without his touch had been too much. And not nearly long enough.</p><p>He puled her toward him, and she had no choice but to go. She didn\u2019t have the wil to fight him, knowing it was a losing battle.</p><p>She looked up into his face expecting him to be angry for shutting him out, or at least gloating that she hadn\u2019t been able to walk away. Instead he gave her a solemn, steady look\u2014the same one he\u2019d worn when she\u2019d first woken up in the hospital. It wasn\u2019t exactly pity on his face, because that she could have resisted. It was something more\u2014a kind of yearning that went beyond sorrow. She could see that he wanted something, but not for himself. For her. He wanted to save her. Protect her.</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t breathe. It was too much, seeing him like this, knowing that he\u2019d stop at nothing to keep her safe even though he had no idea what he was up against. It didn\u2019t matter to him what he had to fight or even if it kiled him. This was what he did. He saved people.</p><p>A second later, that devastating look was gone as if he hadn\u2019t just turned her world upside down. His hand slid down her arm, leaving a wake of goose bumps behind.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you shut me out. I\u2019m done playing nice.\u201d</p><p>Nice? His ruthless determination to stick by her side until he wore her down was playing nice? Even when he wasn\u2019t with her, he was nearby, watching her.</p><p>She must have had one hel of a look on her face, because Caleb let out a rough laugh. \u201cI can see you finaly believe me. Wel, that\u2019s something, at least.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He stopped laughing, but his eyes were stil glittering with amusement. \u201cYes, you do. We\u2019re done playing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t playing any games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? You weren\u2019t just pretending you didn\u2019t want me around? You realy can\u2019t stand me?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the word, so she just nodded.</p><p>It was a mistake to taunt him like that.</p><p>Caleb leaned closer, and Lana was frozen in place. Her heart was racing like a rabbit\u2019s, knowing she was caught. He reached out and swept a lock of hair behind her ear with a single finger. His voice dropped low, stroking against her nerve endings like velvet. \u201cDo you realy hate it when I touch you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even nod. She was too busy wishing he\u2019d touch her again.</p><p>He bent his head to her neck, his warm breath fanning out over her throat. \u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want me to kiss you?\u201d He pressed his mouth at the joint of her neck and shoulder, swirling his tongue over her skin.</p><p>Lana grasped his arms to keep her balance and sucked in a breath.</p><p>His teeth grazed her neck while his hands slid around to her back. His fingers spread wide, holding her in place. \u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t want to feel me inside you again, filing you up over and over until you come?\u201d</p><p>Her knees gave out, and Caleb was the only thing holding her up. Ribbons of sensation shot through her body, and she felt herself growing wet and ready for him to do just what he\u2019d said. She couldn\u2019t remember ever wanting anything more than to feel the hard length of him slide inside her.</p><p>His lips worked up to nibble along the line of her jaw. She tried to turn her mouth to kiss him, but he evaded every attempt. \u201cNo answers for me, Lana?\u201d</p><p>She managed to shake her head just a little, hoping he\u2019d felt it against his mouth.</p><p>Caleb puled back enough to look into her face. His eyes were black, and the signs of his own lust stained his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m done playing. I just wanted you to know that I meant what I said. No more pushing me away. I won\u2019t alow it.\u201d</p><p>Lana swalowed and nodded. She would have agreed to almost anything right now without argument, just as long as he kissed her mouth. But he didn\u2019t. He held her up by her arms, hovering just out of reach.</p><p>Lana blinked in confusion and tried to close the distance, but he held her back.</p><p>\u201cNot now. Not here,\u201d he said. His thumbs stroked the skin under the edge of her sleeve, making her shiver. His voice dipped until it was deep and so quiet she had to strain to hear. \u201cWhen I take you home, you\u2019re going to let me in. I\u2019m going to make love to you until you\u2019re too tired to think. Too tired to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a negotiation. I\u2019l make you want it. We both know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make me do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour silence has given me no choice. I have to keep you safe, and I\u2019l do whatever it takes. Even if you can\u2019t stand me when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me tel you something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can make you forget to keep lying. But first, we have some work to do.\u201d He toed off his shoes and kicked them off the mat. \u201cCome on, Lana. Show me what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d</p><p>The abrupt shift from sex to combat left Lana grasping for a foothold in reality. It was a strategy to keep her from arguing with him, she knew, but she couldn\u2019t get her blood-deprived brain to function wel enough to figure out how to outsmart him.</p><p>Before she could step back and take the time to figure out what to do, he rushed her in a mock attack.</p><p>Lana reacted on instinct, using every bit of frustration to give her strength. Her body went through a series of short, brutal moves Grant had taught her, and when she was stil, Caleb was on his back, grinning up at her, rubbing his chest.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he told her. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it done?\u201d Marcus asked his second-best hit man, John. His first choice was already occupied, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>\u201cI got the computer,\u201d came the quiet reply over the secure phone line. \u201cMelted it into a pile of slag, just like you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being careful. Staying hidden.\u201d</p><p>Meaning John hadn\u2019t managed to kil her yet.</p><p>Marcus ground his teeth together and barely managed to not throw his phone against the wal. \u201cThis needs to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both trained her. She\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I know where she\u2019l show up. When she does, I\u2019l be there, waiting.\u201d</p><p>There was only one place Kara was sure to appear. Near Lana, where she\u2019d have a front-row seat to the girl\u2019s torment. It was the only thing about Kara that was predictable.</p><p>John would stalk Lana, knowing Kara wouldn\u2019t be able to stay away for long. It would work. In fact, he could kil Lana, as wel, while he was there and tie up al the loose ends.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take care of both of them,\u201d said Marcus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019l cost you double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it in twenty-four hours and I\u2019l pay you triple.\u201d</p><p>Marcus could almost hear the greed thicken the hit man\u2019s voice. \u201cDeal. I\u2019l cal you when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you she was stronger than she looks,\u201d said Grant out his car window. He\u2019d taken his shift keeping an eye on Lana\u2019s apartment to prevent anyone from planting more bugs. Or worse. With twenty-four/seven guards on her home, car, and apartment, and the occasional sweep, Caleb was fairly certain Lana\u2019s infestation had been stopped.</p><p>Caleb rubbed the sweling under one eye. \u201cShe caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you got distracted by that sweet little ass of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go looking at her ass,\u201d warned Caleb.</p><p>Grant just smiled wider. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s a sickness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Enough with the macho crap. What did you think? She\u2019s not bad, eh?\u201d</p><p>Caleb was actualy impressed. He\u2019d expected her to hold back, to pul her punches, but she didn\u2019t. Lana fought with a kind of desperate determination that he\u2019d rarely seen before. \u201cNot bad at al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad she\u2019s scared shitless. Poor girl needs a break.\u201d</p><p>And Caleb was just the man to give it to her. He could hardly wait to see how she was going to react when she found out that he\u2019d meant every word he\u2019d said. He was staying the night with her, and although he\u2019d never force her to have sex, he wasn\u2019t above using every bit of seductive skil he had to make her want it as bad as he did. He wasn\u2019t going to let her freeze him out. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou can go get some rest. I\u2019ve got her covered tonight.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s golden eyes twinkled. \u201cI just bet you do. Have fun.\u201d He handed Caleb a stack of paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurveilance report on Kara McIntire.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnything odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe likes to go slumming once in a while, but that\u2019s al.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlumming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a boyfriend who lives in a crappy part of town. He\u2019s much younger, and she only goes there long enough to get a quickie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Grant grimaced. \u201cShe slipped our tail last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got lucky with a freight train. Brent didn\u2019t think it was intentional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re stil watching her, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but with the additional duties on Lana\u2019s family, we\u2019re getting spread a little thin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what you can,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cLana\u2019s family takes first priority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it. See you in the morning. Sleep wel. Or not.\u201d Grant was grinning when he drove out of the lot, no doubt to find his own female companion. Or three.</p><p>Caleb was already planning on just how he was going to enjoy Lana first when he tried to open her door. His key had unlocked it easily enough, but it didn\u2019t budge more than a couple of inches. The chair was wedged under the handle again.</p><p>Like that was going to stop him.</p><p>\u201cBack away from the door,\u201d he said, giving her a minute to comply. He used a burst of strength and a jerk of his shoulder to crumble the flimsy wooden chair. The door swung open, but Lana was nowhere in sight. Caleb closed and locked the door behind him, pushing the remains of the chair out of the way with his boot.</p> <p>That\u2019s when he heard the shower running.</p><p>A wide grin stretched his face, making the skin under his eye twinge where she\u2019d hit him. He briefly wondered if she\u2019d try to knock him on his ass when he stepped into the shower with her. And whether or not she\u2019d succeed.</p><p>Of course, sitting in the bottom of the tub had as many possibilities as standing up, al of which were fine with him.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Lana heard the bathroom door open, which should have startled her but didn\u2019t. Part of her had expected him not to be stopped by the chair\u2014that hopeful part of her that she kept scolding for its idiocy.</p><p>She\u2019d just finished washing her hair, grateful that she didn\u2019t have soap in her eyes when he stepped into the smal, steamy room and shut the door. The clear plastic shower curtain blurred his image, but didn\u2019t protect her from his view. She saw his gaze fix on her naked body, and he started stripping out of his clothes. Her body heated as more and more of him was revealed. For the first time in her life, she realized what men saw in the whole striptease thing.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in here,\u201d she told him. Her arms were wrapped around her to shield her body, even though she knew he\u2019d seen it al before.</p><p>\u201cOf course I should. I know how much you like the shower. I figured I\u2019d finish what I started the other night.\u201d</p> <p>The image of his body pressing hers against the wal flared in Lana\u2019s mind. A lethal rush of desire nearly drove her to her knees.</p><p>He was naked when he puled the curtain back. Naked and hugely erect, already wearing a condom.</p><p>Lana\u2019s mouth went dry, and she couldn\u2019t stop staring at him, couldn\u2019t move. Water sprayed out of the tub as it bounced off her.</p><p>Caleb stepped into the tub, forcing her to step back and give him room. He puled the plastic shut behind him, closing them in.</p><p>\u201cThis time I won\u2019t stop until you come. I promise.\u201d He bent down and took her mouth in a kiss.</p><p>His lips were gentle and hot. His hands pressed against the tile, caging her inside his arms. She could smel the sweat from their workout and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo. Every stream of water seemed to make her skin more sensitive.</p><p>He teased her mouth open until she could feel the stroke of his tongue against hers. She clung to his shoulders for support and went up on tiptoe to deepen the kiss. She no longer cared whether or not sex with Caleb was smart. It was necessary.</p><p>Caleb puled his mouth away and picked her up, sliding her up the slippery tile wal until her breasts were on level with his face. He made a low, rumbling sound of need and closed his mouth over one nipple.</p><p>Lana gasped and shoved her fingers through his wet hair to hold him in place. With every rhythmic tug on her breast, sweet fingers of fire stroked inside her bely, making her ache to get him inside her. She wrapped her dangling legs around Caleb\u2019s torso to help hold on to her spinning world.</p><p>He shifted his attention to her other breast while his arm wrapped around under her bottom to support her weight. He let her slide slowly down the cool tile while his free hand guided his erection unerringly into her body, just a little. The first feelings of being stretched made her cry out, her voice echoing off the wals.</p><p>Her progress down stopped, and Caleb leaned his head so his forehead met hers. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked in a strained voice.</p><p>She nodded and held his head while she kissed him, showing him without words how frantic she was for this. How much she needed it.</p><p>Caleb eased her weight down farther until she could think of nothing else but the length of him inside her, pressing against nerve endings she\u2019d never known she had. He used his weight to hold her against the wal while his hips rocked away from her, then back.</p><p>Another slow thrust made her skin tingle both inside and out, and she leaned her head back on the wal, letting the feeling wash over her. She knew she was getting close, and by the steadily increasing pace of Caleb\u2019s breathing, so was he.</p><p>Lana puled herself back up, letting her nipples rub against his chest. A quiver started deep inside her where Caleb slid in and out, and she heard him groan as her muscles clamped down on him. She tried to speed things up, wanting to find that shimmering completion she knew lay just ahead, but Caleb held her to a steady pace, not alowing her to rush things.</p><p>His lips brushed her ear, and she felt his tongue swirl on a sensitive patch of skin just below her earlobe. \u201cYou\u2019re close,\u201d he whispered to her. \u201cI can feel it. Let go, Lana.</p><p>Give me what I want.\u201d</p><p>Any part of her mind not directly responsible for pleasure was shut down. She sensed that he\u2019d meant more than he\u2019d said, but she couldn\u2019t figure it out, nor did she bother trying. That shimmering heat that pooled inside her was building to a vibrating flame that leapt through her in a merciless wave. Her arms locked around Caleb, and she held on to him while her world exploded and colapsed down to pure sensation. Her orgasm tore through her, ripping a loud cry from her lungs and making her body contract around him.</p><p>He pushed her hips down, sealing them together as his own deep shout added to hers. She felt him jerk as he came in time with her own release.</p><p>Caleb eased her to the floor, where he sprawled in a boneless heap with her. Water sprayed over their heads, but every little drop was like a caress over her sensitized skin. She shivered and Caleb shifted her so that his erection puled from her body.</p><p>He cradled her while their breathing calmed, then reached for the soap. By the time he was done washing her, there wasn\u2019t a bone left in her body.</p><p>When her nightmare started, Caleb woke her with his hands and mouth, gently easing her from the dark mist of her dreams into the solid, tangible pleasure of his touch. When he was sure she was fuly awake, he covered himself with a condom, curved his body behind hers, and pushed into her warmth. She arched against him, urging him on. He took her slowly, letting her set the languid pace. His hands were free to caress her, and he stroked her from her scalp to her knees and back again.</p><p>Lana sighed when he slid his hands down her arms and sucked in her breath when he rubbed her nipples against the palm of his hand. Her noises taught him what she liked best, and by the time he\u2019d driven her to her first release, he knew her body better than he ever had any other woman\u2019s. By the time he surged inside her, joining her in her third climax, he knew her body better than his own.</p><p>John waited until the men guarding the youth center changed shifts before he made his move. The sun was a blinding glare on the horizon when he crept up onto the roof, ensuring that he was less likely to be seen.</p><p>He watched the ladder leading up to the roof long enough to be sure he wasn\u2019t going to have any visitors before he went to set up for the job.</p><p>A few minutes later, his rifle was ready, and he was barely visible behind the giant air handler. His view of the front parking lot wasn\u2019t great, but he had a clear shot of the lawn where the carnival was going to be held\u2014where al the action would be happening today.</p><p>Al he had to do now was wait for the women to arrive. He\u2019d have only a few seconds to take them both out before he was spotted, so his best bet was to take them both out at once\u2014line up the shot.</p><p>Neither one of them was big enough to stop a round\u2014at least not the firepower he\u2019d be sending their way. And if he couldn\u2019t get both of them, he\u2019d take whichever one he could get and leave the second one for later.</p><p>John stil had ten of those twenty-four hours Marcus had given him to eliminate both women. There would be plenty of time left to get the job done and earn his triple pay.</p><p>The youth center was crawling with volunteers by the time Caleb and Lana arrived. Grant was directing the troops as they assembled game booths and tents to shade tomorrow\u2019s carnivalgoers from the worst of the hot sun.</p><p>Out of the corner of Caleb\u2019s eye, he saw Lana\u2019s reaction to the busy scene. She was staring in open-mouthed shock. \u201cHow did you manage al this?\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s chest sweled with pride that he\u2019d impressed her. \u201cI puled in a few favors and got permission to borrow some gear. Grant and the guys did the same thing, and between al of us, we managed to get everything we needed to throw one heck of a party.\u201d</p><p>Lana fumbled in her backpack and shoved on a battered pair of sunglasses, but not before Caleb could see the sheen of tears wavering in her eyes.</p><p>He leaned over and smoothed a swath of dark, glossy hair behind her ear. \u201cTeamwork, Lana. No one of us could have puled this off alone, but together, we\u2019re al but invincible. You should give it a try.\u201d</p><p>He felt her freeze up, going rigid. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019ve done here, Caleb, but not every problem is the kind of thing you share.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a finger down her cheek and along her jaw, urging her to turn and look at him. He couldn\u2019t see much behind those dark glasses, but he\u2019d come to know that tense, fearful quality in her voice. There wasn\u2019t much he wouldn\u2019t have done to free her of that, if only she\u2019d given him the chance. \u201cDon\u2019t know until you try,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t help you, I\u2019l be the first to admit it. I swear.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a moment before she puled away and reached for the door handle. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to do today. I need to get to it.\u201d</p><p>Caleb grabbed her arm, forcing himself to be gentle when he realy just wanted to shake some sense into her. He had until tomorrow to pry out her secrets. It wasn\u2019t nearly enough time. Then again, a lifetime with her wouldn\u2019t have been enough to suit him. \u201cDon\u2019t run away from me. Let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are helping me.\u201d She waved a hand out at the men working. \u201cYou\u2019ve helped me more than I ever thought possible. Let that be enough, Caleb. Please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He feared that nothing would ever be enough when it came to Lana. The longer he was with her, the longer he wanted to be with her, like some sort of sick joke. How the hel was he going to walk away from her, leaving her to whatever interrogation measures Monroe would subject her to next? Monroe wouldn\u2019t stop until he\u2019d gotten what he wanted out of her.</p><p>Maybe that was the safest thing for her. As long as Lana was silent, she\u2019d be in danger.</p><p>Caleb released her and watched her get out of the car. Her easy glide over the pavement stil amazed him. She\u2019d gone through so much, and al he wanted for her was to be happy. With him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure where that thought had come from, but there it was, glowing brightly in his brain, blocking out al other thoughts. He wanted to stay with her\u2014to be with her\u2014and not just because he had a job to do or because she was in trouble. He wanted her al for himself, al that courage and strength, al that stubborn sweetness.</p> <p>He knew a lost cause when he saw one, and that\u2019s exactly what this was. No way would Lana even consider being with him on anything more than a temporary basis.</p><p>Sure, they had chemistry and the sex was great, but that was al just a trick of hormones. Relationships were based on trust, and Lana didn\u2019t have enough for him.</p><p>Caleb unfolded himself from the car, shoving the unwanted thoughts away. A few hours of hard labor would help him refocus on what was important\u2014keeping Lana safe.</p><p>As long as she was safe, there was hope that one day she\u2019d come to trust him.</p><p>Yeah, right, because trusting the man who watched as you were beaten was such an easy thing to do. Happened every day.</p> <p>He\u2019d never known what false hope felt like until this very moment, and he decided it sucked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cheerful this morning,\u201d greeted Grant. Sweat darkened his shirt and made his blond hair look almost brown.</p><p>\u201cNothing a good swift kick in the ass wouldn\u2019t cure,\u201d muttered Caleb.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m your man,\u201d he said, handing Caleb a set of tent spikes. \u201cGet to work.\u201d</p><p>Caleb did. He lifted and hammered and hauled until his muscles were burning and sweat roled off his body. The bright sun sank into his black hair, making him hotter.</p><p>Across the field where they were erecting tents and booths, Caleb spotted Lana talking with a few people, and something about her posture set off warning bels in his head.</p> <p>He broke into a jog, crossing the hard ground quickly, trying to figure out what was wrong. There wasn\u2019t any one thing that alarmed him, just this impression that she was terrified. Her spine was rigid, her chin up, and though everyone else in the group shifted from one foot to another, or gestured with their hands as they spoke, Lana was eerily stil.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t even stop to think what he was doing\u2014he just came up behind her, said, \u201cExcuse us,\u201d to the group and puled her away by her hand.</p><p>When they were far enough away not to be overheard, he bent his head over her, wishing he could see her eyes behind her sunglasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She swalowed visibly. \u201cDon\u2019t look, but there\u2019s a man with a gun on the roof.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Caleb resisted the urge to glance up. Instead, he stepped to the left to shield Lana\u2019s body with his own. \u201cWhere\u2019s the roof access?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack of the building. By the employee door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to get the women and Phil inside. I\u2019l take care of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about your men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal them on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve got plenty of backup. I won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019l deal with this our way. Sirens might scare him away.\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. She puled in a breath, and just like that, al the terror melted from her features. She turned to the group standing a few feet away, and in a calm, steady voice she announced, \u201cIt\u2019s too hot out here. Let\u2019s move this inside.\u201d</p><p>Caleb dialed Grant, even though he was only fifty feet away. Grant, being the smart guy he was, didn\u2019t even bat an eye or let on how odd it was that Caleb was phoning him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d answered Grant.</p><p>\u201cSniper. Rooftop,\u201d whispered Caleb. \u201cI\u2019m going up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou armed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as wel as I\u2019d like to be, but wel enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take him out from down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce he knows we\u2019ve seen him, do you think he\u2019s going to wait while you set up your rifle?\u201d asked Caleb. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this quietly. I want him alive for questioning. I need you to scan for more men. He may not be alone, and you know al the best sniper tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it. I\u2019l get the others to back you up.\u201d</p><p>Lana and the civilians disappeared behind the doors, and Caleb ignored the wave of relief he felt. His adrenaline was pumping hard, putting his senses on high alert. The phone was suddenly too loud, the scent of the grass and asphalt too strong as he made his way to the building.</p><p>\u201cMake sure no one tips him off. And get the men behind some concealment,\u201d ordered Caleb. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to start picking us off because he can\u2019t get to his real target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it covered. Stay on the line. I\u2019l be right behind you with my eyes open.\u201d</p><p>Caleb left the phone on and clipped it to his belt. The knife he carried wasn\u2019t designed for combat, but it would do in a pinch.</p><p>He climbed the scalding metal ladder and peered over the edge. At first he saw nothing, but then he heard a faint scraping sound and smeled hot male sweat.</p><p>Someone was definitely up here.</p><p>Caleb eased over the ledge. It was hot up here, the sun searing his skin from above and waves of heat bouncing off the roof below. There were only a couple of places a man could hide, and Caleb headed for the first\u2014the one that had the best view of the carnival area.</p><p>The sniper was there, tucked against a humming HVAC unit. His body was tight with anger and frustration, likely because his target was now hidden inside, out of reach.</p><p>He peered through his scope at the field below.</p><p>Something feral inside Caleb reared its head. He didn\u2019t normaly enjoy kiling\u2014it was just something necessary that had to be done. But this time was different. Fuck questioning. This man had intended to hurt Lana, and now Caleb was going to kil him.</p><p>He crept forward on silent feet, mindful of his shadow and the scent of his body on the slow breeze. When he was three feet away, the sniper sensed him somehow and turned. He swung the rifle around, knocking the tripod over. Caleb rushed him, closing the distance so that the rifle was no longer effective. He batted the weapon up and out of the way and swiped at the man\u2019s bely with his little knife. Fabric gave way under his blade, and the man gave a satisfying grunt of pain.</p><p>The sniper slammed the butt of his rifle into Caleb\u2019s shoulder so hard it made his arm tingle. The knife fel to the roof with a muffled thump. Caleb baled his fist and hammered the man in the stomach with the ful power of his body.</p><p>The sniper let out a whoosh of air but didn\u2019t go down. Instead, his foot lashed out and caught Caleb just below the knee. Caleb sagged but caught his weight and forced his knee to hold him up.</p><p>Whoever this man was, he was professionaly trained. Lana would have no chance against him if Caleb failed.</p><p>Rage fired through his veins in hard pulses. He was not going to give this asshole another chance to strike.</p><p>The sniper tried to pound Caleb with his rifle again, but Caleb ripped it from his hands and flung it away.</p><p>Knuckle to knuckle, Caleb was better than nearly any man out there, and something in his gaze must have warned the other man it was true. The sniper reached for a pistol at the smal of his back, and Caleb charged. He knocked the man to the hot roof, pinning his weapon and one arm under him. A sickening crunch and a high-pitched scream from his enemy told Caleb he\u2019d damaged something under the force of their fal.</p><p>A vicious smile stretched Caleb\u2019s mouth. He could feel his skin tighten, see the man\u2019s eyes grow wide with fear.</p><p>His legs flailed, trying to kick Caleb away, but he was too massive a target to budge. Caleb pinned his free arm and shoved his chin high and to the side, yearning to hear the sound of breaking bone.</p><p>\u201cStop, Caleb,\u201d came Grant\u2019s voice. He was on the rooftop, only a few feet away. \u201cWe need him for questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them question him in hel.\u201d Caleb kept pushing. The man made gurgling sounds.</p><p>\u201cLana won\u2019t talk. We need him to.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s strong hand landed on Caleb\u2019s shoulder, and he nearly shrugged it off. He didn\u2019t want to stop. \u201cHe was going to kil Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but what if he\u2019s not alone? What if he knows something that can help Lana?\u201d The voice of reason, calm and sure.</p><p>And right.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d growled Caleb, and he eased off the pressure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best for Lana this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d said Caleb. Then he punched the man in the side of the head so hard his knuckles split open.</p><p>The sniper\u2019s lights went out, and he sagged awkwardly around his damaged shoulder. Caleb found the man\u2019s pistol and handed it to Grant so he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to finish the job.</p><p>\u201cHave Mad take him in,\u201d ordered Caleb. \u201cMonroe wil want to question him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l deal with it. You go clean up.\u201d</p><p>To hel with that. He was going to find Lana\u2014make sure she was okay and hold her for about a year just to convince himself it was true.</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone else?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cNo. The men are checking the area again, just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know if he\u2019s alone,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cAnd why he was trying to kil her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur guys wil find out what he knows.\u201d</p><p>Caleb waited until Mad appeared on the rooftop before he left Grant. His knee was throbbing, but he ignored it. Nothing a little ice wouldn\u2019t fix.</p><p>Then again, if he was injured, he could take some time off with Lana and heal. A month or two of R &amp; R with her sounded good. Too good. He\u2019d take her home, where he knew he could keep her safe. Not her home. His\u2014that big sprawling ranch house in Texas where he\u2019d grown up, where his brothers could help him guard her and where he knew the land so wel he could hide her for days if he needed to.</p><p>He found her and the others near the finger-painting station. She was tense, but a sniper would tend to do that to any sane woman.</p><p>Her eyes caught his as he came through the doors. She sagged a little and clenched her hands at her sides as if trying not to reach out for him.</p><p>When he crossed the space and was standing in front of her, he couldn\u2019t help but touch her. He laced his fingers through hers.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d asked Kara.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re limping.\u201d</p><p>He thought of a quick lie, not wanting to scare the other women. \u201cOne of the folding tables fel on my foot. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hand is bleeding, too,\u201d said Lana. \u201cCome on and I\u2019l get the first-aid kit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He folowed her down the hal. She grabbed a plastic box out of the break room and led him to an office.</p><p>The smal room was mostly empty, with just a few boxes of files stacked to one side and a broken office chair in the corner. \u201cThis wil be my office when the lease on the other one runs out,\u201d she told him. \u201cNo one wil bother us here.\u201d</p><p>The fluorescent lights flickered on with a low buzz, and Lana shut and locked the door behind her. They were al alone.</p><p>Caleb felt that consuming need to touch her again. His fingers slid up over one bare arm. She gave a delicate shiver but didn\u2019t try to stop him. No matter what lies were standing between them, in this, she was honest. Her reaction to his touch was without guile or secrecy.</p> <p>\u201cAre you realy okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone else get hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know who he is?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw his face for a second. I didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d</p><p>Caleb sensed she was teling the truth. \u201cHe\u2019s unconscious. Do you want to get a better look? A second isn\u2019t very long to identify someone, especialy when they\u2019re armed.\u201d</p><p>Her body tensed, and she nearly dropped the bottle of disinfectant she was holding. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to see him. My memory for faces is good, and I don\u2019t want to start seeing his when I close my eyes at night.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t push. He\u2019d be able to get photos for her to look at if she changed her mind. It would be easier on her than looking at the man himself. \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to hurt you now.\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded but said nothing. She swabbed disinfectant over his cut knuckles. Caleb ignored the sting and watched her tend him in silence. Her fingers shook, but she didn\u2019t falter.</p> <p>\u201cI think you can stop. I\u2019m not even bleeding anymore.\u201d</p><p>She swalowed and nodded again. \u201cAnyplace else hurt?\u201d</p><p>His blood was stil hot with adrenaline, his body ready for a fight. Or sex. That would work, too. In fact, it sounded like a great idea. \u201cDepends. Are you going to kiss it and make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s joking? I want you. Right here. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes darkened, and she swayed toward him. \u201cYou could have been kiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re both safe.\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped closer, puling her body against his, heedless of the dirt and sweat of combat on his torso. Lana wasn\u2019t complaining, either. Her skin was warm from the sun, making the honeysuckle and woman scent of her rise up to his nose. Caleb breathed in, holding her essence inside him for as long as he could before letting it out.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be turned on right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival instinct. Perfectly normal.\u201d He couldn\u2019t even form a complete sentence anymore, and he had to kiss her. He pinned her against the door and lowered his mouth to hers. Lana\u2019s lips parted without hesitation, and his tongue swept inside her mouth to taste her. Home. She tasted like coming home felt. Sweet and warm and inviting.</p><p>He told her with his lips and tongue how much he wanted this. Wanted her. His kiss was hard and demanding, giving her no room to back away.</p><p>Lana melted inside his hold and returned his kiss with a sense of desperation, though whether she was desperate for more of him, or desperate to forget the kiler on the roof, he couldn\u2019t tel.</p><p>Lana\u2019s hands slid up under his shirt over his abdomen. Slender fingers twined through the hair on his chest, pressing into the muscle beneath. \u201cI love the way you feel,\u201d she told him in a rough whisper against his mouth.</p><p>The L-word left him reeling, making his hopes soar. He wanted her to love him, needed it. Needed it so bad he thought his skin would ignite.</p><p>Caleb kissed his way over her jaw and down her neck, swirling his tongue as he went. He\u2019d used every one of his powers of observation to gauge her reactions to his touch so that he could learn her most sensitive spots. He wanted to please her like no other man ever had, and he put his monumental force of wil behind the task of learning her body. It hadn\u2019t taken long, because Lana was such a responsive woman. She didn\u2019t hold back teling him with her sighs and moans and shivers what she liked best, and right now, Caleb wanted to show her just what he\u2019d learned.</p><p>His lips teased the joint of her neck and shoulder\u2014the exact spot he knew drove her crazy. He let her anticipation build, let her know with the light scraping of his teeth what he was going to do, let her want it. Then, when she was panting and clutching at him, Caleb pressed his teeth against her skin, reveling in the hiss of pleasure she gave him.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI love that.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. The L-word that he wanted to hear with a longing so deep it left him aching.</p><p>Caleb smiled and licked away the sting of his teeth. He puled back enough to look into her eyes. They were the rich blue of deep ocean water, heavy-lidded with desire.</p><p>Lana tugged at his shirt, unable to get it off without his help. He swept it off over his head and tossed it onto the broken chair. \u201cYour turn,\u201d he told her as he reached for the hem of her shirt.</p><p>hem of her shirt.</p><p>She let him strip it off of her and reached behind her to unhook her bra. Caleb\u2019s jeans tightened as he watched the guileless striptease. Finaly, her perfectly shaped breasts were bare to him, and he lowered his mouth to one tight pink nipple, unable to resist.</p><p>Lana\u2019s body arched toward him, and her hands wrapped around his dark head to hold him in place while he loved her with his mouth. He suckled gently, then harder, figuring out what she wanted, what would give her the most pleasure.</p><p>He thrust one thick thigh between her legs and lifted her up so that her center was pressed hard against him, her feet barely reaching the ground. His knee complained, but he didn\u2019t listen. Lana\u2019s hips shifted, grinding herself against his hard muscles as he moved his mouth to her other breast. The sight of her nipple, red and wet and distended from his attention, made him groan aloud, and he cupped her bottom to pul her more firmly against his leg.</p><p>Lana\u2019s fingernails bit into his scalp, and a dark flush rose up over her breasts and throat. She was making soft little mewling noises that drove Caleb crazy. He had to get inside her, had to feel the wet heat of her body surround him and drive away his insanity.</p><p>Caleb attacked the button of her jeans and tugged the zipper down with a jerk. His hands slid inside her clothing, caressing sunlight-soft skin.</p><p>Lana breathed out a jagged sigh and puled his head up for an open-mouthed, devouring kiss. Caleb moved his leg from between hers so he could get the offending jeans off her body. His hands cupped her ass for a moment before moving down, taking jeans and panties with them. Her shoes were a nuisance he quickly rid himself of, and in seconds, she was standing in front of him gloriously naked.</p><p>Caleb let himself stare, enjoying the chance to see her in the bright office lighting. Her slim body was scarred, especialy her legs, but that didn\u2019t detract from how beautiful she was to him. The scars only emphasized her strength, her resilience. He loved her soft, pale skin and the gentle curves of her hips and stomach. He loved the feminine strength that flowed through her limbs and the way she couldn\u2019t hide the blush of arousal that spread up her torso. He loved the way her breathing sped as he watched her and the way she had to clench her fists to keep from reaching for him. She was perfect\u2014everything he could have ever wanted in a woman, and right now, she was al his.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her, unable to hold it in any longer.</p><p>He watched as that sensual smile fel from her face, as that deep blush of arousal faded and she went pale. He watched as she covered herself with her arms, trying to shield her naked body from his sight. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered in horror.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the kind of reaction a man wanted to see in a woman when he confessed love, and Caleb felt her rejection like a physical blow.</p><p>Lana scrambled for her clothes, her hands shaking as she slid her jeans up over her hips, not bothering to zip them so she could look for her shirt.</p><p>\u201cLana,\u201d he said, trying to figure out what she was thinking, what he\u2019d done wrong. He reached for her arm, but she jerked away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d she snapped, and then calmer: \u201cPlease don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>Anger glowed in Caleb\u2019s gut. He\u2019d told her he loved her, and she acted like he\u2019d just said he was a child molester. \u201cWhat the hel is wrong with you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she told him in a clipped voice. She puled her shirt on over her head, not taking time to put her bra back on. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know how I feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do. It\u2019s your hormones talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hel. I\u2019ve had hormones for a long time, had plenty of sex, too, but you\u2019re the first woman I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>She flinched as if he\u2019d hit her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cDo what? I can\u2019t help that I love you. Most women would be happy to hear those words.\u201d And then he belatedly realized, \u201cAt least they would if they cared anything about the guy saying them.\u201d</p><p>Lana looked up at him with her blue eyes ful of guilt, and Caleb knew the truth. Suddenly, he felt every ache in his battered body, every stinging cut. \u201cThat\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m just a convenience for you, aren\u2019t I? Just a casual fuck to help you sleep at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hel it isn\u2019t. If you gave a shit about me, then it wouldn\u2019t be like that, but you don\u2019t. You don\u2019t want me to love you, because you know you can never love me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaleb, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? Please leave? Please don\u2019t stop fucking you? Please what, Lana? Spel it out for me.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head in defeat, making him ache to take her into his arms. He loved her, wanted to soothe her, but it was his love that had made her need comfort in the first place.</p><p>What a joke that was. A fucking riot.</p><p>\u201cI just want to . . . forget about this,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust let it drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tel you I love you and you want to forget about it?\u201d That made him feel like the world\u2019s biggest loser.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to hurt you, Caleb. But I can\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA future. Hope.\u201d She let out a heavy sigh of regret that vibrated with a restrained sob. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hope to spare. You deserve a woman who does.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want another woman. He wanted Lana, and knowing she didn\u2019t want him was tearing him apart. His heart was in shreds, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it. Lana didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>He should have known better than to hope that she would. He\u2019d warned himself about this very thing happening. Don\u2019t get too close, don\u2019t care, she can\u2019t ever have feelings for the man who helped ruin her life. The man who let her be brutalized.</p><p>Caleb wanted to blame her for her rejection. He wanted to be furious at her and tie her down until she gave in and professed her undying love for him. He wanted to go back in time and relive the past\u2014find some way to prevent her torture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he couldn\u2019t do any of those things. Al he could do was let her walk away and pray that someday she\u2019d find a man she could love\u2014a man she could trust.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t love her. Lana kept teling herself that over and over as she hid in the bathroom stal, trying not to cry.</p><p>He was just infatuated. It was just the sex talking. Or the adrenaline rush. It was just pilow talk that al men gave women to keep them interested in sex.</p><p>It had to be, because the possibility of anything else was just too frightening.</p> <p>Caleb didn\u2019t love her. He felt guilty over being powerless to protect her in Armenia. He felt protective of her now because it was his job. He was just confused.</p><p>It would pass. He\u2019d realize he was wrong, and things would be fine again. No harm, no foul.</p><p>Yeah, right.</p><p>Lana knew the damage was already done. He\u2019d said the words, and they couldn\u2019t be taken back. He couldn\u2019t unring the bel.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d she cursed at the stainless-steel door. This couldn\u2019t be happening. How was she going to protect herself from al the feelings his confession of love gave her?</p> <p>How was she going to resist letting herself daydream about happily ever after when reality was so freaking bleak?</p><p>As long as he didn\u2019t love her, there was no way she\u2019d let herself love him back. She\u2019d protect her heart, keeping it safely locked up in the cage that pain of loss and rejection had constructed. Nothing could get to her as long as she protected her heart. She wouldn\u2019t be vulnerable. She\u2019d be safe. She\u2019d be in control.</p><p>She had to keep hold of what little control she had left in her life, protect it ferociously. She couldn\u2019t let Caleb, or any man, barge into her life and force her to feel things she wasn\u2019t strong enough to feel. Like love.</p><p>As long as he didn\u2019t love her, she didn\u2019t have to fear loving him back. At least, that\u2019s what she kept teling herself.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>D id you do what I told you?\u201d asked the modulated voice of Denny\u2019s boss.</p> <p>Denny wiped the acid taste from his mouth and prayed he wouldn\u2019t puke again. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said in a voice made rough from retching into the toilet for the past twenty minutes. The combination of too much alcohol and his boss\u2019s bizarre instructions had turned his stomach inside out.</p><p>He stil couldn\u2019t get the sloppy crayon drawings out of his head. Flowers and dogs and race cars, al scribbled in with garish colors. The building he\u2019d broken into\u2014First Light Foundation\u2014was plastered with them, along with gloppy paintings that made no sense and crooked clay sculptures formed by clumsy little hands.</p><p>\u201cGood boy. Now there\u2019s only one more thing I need you to do.\u201d</p><p>A sickening wave roled over him, and he swalowed hard to keep from throwing up again. He was sweating and shaking and could barely hold the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The voice gave a metalic laugh. \u201cNothing so dramatic as you\u2019re thinking. I just need you to go pick up your last payment.\u201d</p><p>Denny sat silent, waiting to hear the catch. The money his boss offered him was enough to pay off Bruce, which meant he\u2019d have no hold on Denny any longer. With the threat of broken legs gone, there was nothing that freaky robot could do to convince Denny to keep working for him. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeg\u2019s Diner. Be there in five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that\u2019s a fifteen-minute drive!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you get moving, then. If you\u2019re late, the money wil no doubt be found by someone else.\u201d</p><p>Shit! Denny ignored his twisting stomach, grabbed his keys and flew out the door. He ran six stoplights getting there, but he made it in time. The money was sitting in a little paper sack behind the toilet. Denny opened it with trembling hands and counted the money. It was al there. His nightmare was over. Bruce would be paid off, he\u2019d never work for Mr. Robot again, and he was going to pick up and move the hel out of this place\u2014so far away no one could find him.</p><p>Caleb sat down on the grass next to Grant. The evening air was stil hot, but at least the sun was no longer overhead.</p><p>\u201cAny word on the sniper?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>Grant swalowed a bite of one of the sandwiches that the foundation\u2019s cook, Sharon, had provided to al the workers who had stayed to finish setting up for tomorrow.</p><p>There was stil plenty to be done before nightfal, but they were on schedule. \u201cCIA\u2019s working on him. They either haven\u2019t gotten him to talk yet or they\u2019re not sharing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee. That\u2019s helpful.\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201cThe job is the same either way. Keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice and simple,\u201d said Caleb with more sarcasm than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside. Avoiding me. Jack\u2019s with her. Everyone is on high alert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not at her side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make her cry again.\u201d God, he sounded pitiful.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Caleb hesitated. He wasn\u2019t one to talk about things like this, but if anyone knew what was going through a woman\u2019s head, it would be Grant.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean when you tel a woman you love her and she acts like you just threatened to murder her kitten?\u201d Caleb asked Grant, trying to sound more casual than he felt. Inside, he was twisting with a mixture of anger and regret that he couldn\u2019t shake.</p><p>Grant raised an amused brow. \u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t accidentaly say you have herpes?\u201d</p><p>Caleb roled his eyes at the lame joke. \u201cPretty sure.\u201d</p><p>This time Grant was completely serious, not even a glimmer of amusement in his golden eyes. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready for that kind of pressure, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat pressure? It\u2019s supposed to be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to a woman who hasn\u2019t had her life turned upside down, but not for Lana. The woman\u2019s been through hel, and she\u2019s not out yet. She\u2019s too scared to even tel you what she\u2019s scared of, she\u2019s got this fundraiser riding her ass, her friend was shot, her parents\u2019 house burned down, a sniper on the roof, and you go dumping confessions of love on top of that pile. How do you expect her to react?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething other than that look of horror would have been nice,\u201d said Caleb. Truth was, he hadn\u2019t realy thought about it like that. He felt it, so he said it. Simple. Stupid, but simple.</p><p>He should have kept his feelings to himself, but it was a little late for that.</p><p>Caleb fisted his hand, watching the broken flesh over his knuckles stretch.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019l come around. Back off on the Romeo routine and let her get through this thing tomorrow. Once that\u2019s over, maybe she\u2019l have the space to process what you said.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019l even say the words back.\u201d</p><p>Caleb grunted his skepticism. \u201cNot in this lifetime. Besides, my time here is almost up. Monroe is reassigning someone else to the case if I can\u2019t get her to talk by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Grant\u2019s face wrinkled in a pained expression. \u201cThat\u2019s harsh. Any idea who he\u2019s going to replace you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You looking for a broken face?\u201d</p><p>Grant laughed and held up his hands. \u201cNo warning needed, man. I just thought that you might appreciate knowing that the next man won\u2019t be putting the moves on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t. When have you ever been able to keep your dick in your pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave patience. I\u2019m learning a new skil. Besides, Celia is rough on a man. Woman made me sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want to know how that happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d ever kiss and tel.\u201d</p><p>Caleb laughed, considering how Grant loved to awe the team with the stories of his female conquests. \u201cYou stil seeing her?\u201d</p><p>Grant shrugged. \u201cWhile I\u2019m here. When there\u2019s time. It\u2019s nothing serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make that sound like it\u2019s a bad thing. I thought you were al about no serious relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Grant, waving it off. \u201cJust hurry up and get this thing with Lana straightened out, wil you? A man can only wait so long for his turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn at what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove, my friend,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>Caleb scoffed. \u201cYou get more action than any man I know\u2014hel, more than any three men I know put together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and look where it\u2019s gotten me. I\u2019ve got paint stains on my ass and a sore dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. Maybe you should try teling Celia you love her. That\u2019l scare her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I wish,\u201d said Grant with a sigh. \u201cKnowing her, it would probably turn her on. Everything turns that woman on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven watching paint dry?\u201d teased Caleb.</p><p>Grant winced as if a memory stung. \u201cEspecialy that.\u201d</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t hide any longer. She\u2019d spent the day avoiding Caleb, but they\u2019d shared a ride here, and as much as she wanted to continue to avoid him, she knew it was the coward\u2019s way out. He deserved better. He deserved an explanation about why she\u2019d reacted the way she did to those three little words. She knew her reaction had to hurt him, and it kiled her inside to know that she\u2019d given him pain in exchange for such a precious gift.</p><p>Lana locked up the building and found Caleb lying on the hood of the car, waiting for her. Everyone had left an hour ago when the final prep work was done. It was nearly ten, and the sky was dark, the air stil hot as it blew over the sun-heated ground. She could hear crickets singing in the bushes nearby and the hum of traffic along the street.</p><p>Swarms of bugs hovered in a cloud around the light overhead.</p><p>Caleb was leaning back against the windshield with his hands stacked behind his head. Muscles in his thick arms bulged beneath the sleeves of his shirt, which was stretched tight over the ridges of his chest and abdomen.</p><p>Lana\u2019s chest tightened at the sight of him lounging there so casualy in an elegant male sprawl. Part of her wished she was a normal woman with a normal life so she could just give in to the fantasy life his love could create for her. He would be an easy man to love, so caring and gentle. A true hero.</p><p>He deserved better than Lana, and she deserved better than pretending she was a normal woman when she was anything but.</p><p>\u201cYou waited,\u201d she said as she approached the car. Her pace was slow as she tried to gauge his mood.</p><p>\u201cI stil have a job to do,\u201d he told her in an even voice. No accusations.</p><p>Lana felt herself relax a little. She should have known he wouldn\u2019t throw a fit. He was better than that. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about . . . today,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem inclined to get up, just stayed where he was, staring up at the stars. \u201cWhat part are you sorry about? The part where I said what I did, or the part where you ran away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t take it back, Lana. I would if I could, but I can\u2019t. We can either get past it or not. Your cal.\u201d</p><p>For a second, she resented him putting that burden on her, until she realized that he didn\u2019t see it as a burden as much as he did a choice. One he was letting her make. No pressure. No pushing. She didn\u2019t deserve to be treated so gently after what she\u2019d done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lana lifted herself up onto the hood, being careful not to touch him. \u201cI can\u2019t be the kind of woman you want. I don\u2019t have room in my life for romantic complications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I am? A complication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I just meant that there\u2019s too much going on right now, and I don\u2019t have the energy left to put effort into a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of energy left for sex.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s selfish, I know, but so far that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve found that lets me . . . forget.\u201d A wave of grim memories threatened to crash into her, and she stuffed them down before they could. Just talking about forgetting made it impossible to do so. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with you I don\u2019t have to think. I just get to feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you make me feel, yeah.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a twitch of a smile.</p><p>She had to make him understand that her inadequacy had nothing to do with him. She was the one who was broken inside. She was the one who was warped. \u201cIt\u2019s hard being afraid al the time.\u201d</p> <p>He turned his head and she could see him watch her out of the corner of her eye, compassion flattening his mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be. You could let me help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou realy want to help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s al I\u2019ve wanted since the moment I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>That statement made her stomach knot. How hard must it have been for him to watch al that brutality and not be able to do anything about it? She often wondered if he didn\u2019t carry as many emotional scars from that ordeal as she did. Maybe more. \u201cPromise me that whatever happens between us, you\u2019l protect my family, Stacie, and the kids at the foundation. Promise me you\u2019l keep yourself safe.\u201d</p><p>He turned, propping himself up on his elbow, his black eyes searching her face. \u201cYou make it sound like you expect something to happen to you. What aren\u2019t you teling me now?\u201d</p><p>Panic fluttered, but she controled it with a force of wil. She didn\u2019t want him to see her plans to run away in her eyes. \u201cNothing, I just don\u2019t want your anger toward me to make them suffer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m not angry at you. Second, even if I was, I\u2019d never let that stop me from doing the right thing and protecting the innocent.\u201d</p><p>Lana was quiet for a while, listening to the crickets. \u201cYou should be angry, Caleb. What I did today was inexcusable. I shouldn\u2019t have walked away from you like that after what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an honest reaction\u2014probably more honesty than I\u2019ve gotten from you since I showed up.\u201d</p><p>That stung, but she tried not to let it show. She\u2019d told him plenty of lies, but she\u2019d had no choice\u2014no more than he\u2019d had a choice about letting her abductors beat her.</p><p>She\u2019d forgiven him for that and could only hope that if the truth ever came out, he\u2019d do the same for her.</p><p>Lana puled at the strands of her resolve, needing to explain why she\u2019d shunned him. It wasn\u2019t going to be easy to admit al her shortcomings. \u201cYou deserve a lot more than I can give, Caleb. You deserve a woman who can love you back. One without so much baggage.\u201d She swalowed a lump of regret. \u201cOne who can give you children.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her but let his hand fal before he touched her, as if fearing she\u2019d reject that, as wel. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to tel me you\u2019re not good enough for me, then we have some things to straighten out. I\u2019ve never met a stronger woman than you. We al have our own baggage, and you\u2019ve handled yours fine, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And if you\u2019re holding back on me because you can\u2019t have kids, don\u2019t. The same could be true of any woman out there. I don\u2019t love you because you\u2019l be a good brood mare. I love you because of who you are, not what you can give me.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned her eyes, and she had to turn away. So much for being strong. She couldn\u2019t go one damn day without crying. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to love me at al. It\u2019s too hard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrant said I should just back off and give you time to let things soak in. That\u2019s not going to help, is it? Not even if I wait a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Lana shook her head, feeling the silky sway of her hair over her shoulders. She couldn\u2019t give him any hope, because it would only be another lie. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you like that. I\u2019m sorry, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to give him what he wanted, but she couldn\u2019t. She wasn\u2019t nearly as strong as he thought she was. Not nearly as strong as she wished she could be for him.</p><p>\u201cThen how can you be with me? Because I\u2019m not giving up on you. I won\u2019t let you just walk away.\u201d</p><p>Did he know her intentions? She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d given anything away, but Caleb was smart. \u201cI know. You have your orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hel with my orders. They have nothing to do with this.\u201d He motioned between them. \u201cI want to be with you\u2014take whatever you\u2019re wiling to give.\u201d</p><p>Lana knew tonight would be her last night with him. She didn\u2019t want to spend it alone. As he said, there were no second chances. This was the last night she\u2019d ever have in his arms. She couldn\u2019t deny herself one final moment to forget her troubles, even though she knew the risk it posed. \u201cI\u2019m wiling to share my bed, my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not your heart,\u201d he said, his jaw bunching.</p><p>Lana was dying inside, crumbling under the weight of his stare and the desperate need within it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as sorry as I am, but I\u2019l take what I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it wil be enough?\u201d</p><p>Finaly, he touched her, running the tip of his finger over her cheek. \u201cI guess it wil have to be.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>Lana woke long before dawn, too anxious to sleep. Caleb had made love to her with a relentless, driving obsession that had nearly frightened her with its intensity. He\u2019d told her that if al he could have was her body, then he was going to take everything she had to give, and he did, leaving her reeling.</p><p>She\u2019d falen into an exhausted sleep and enjoyed another dreamless night. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to go back to living through those nightmares without him.</p><p>He\u2019d done so much for her and the foundation, and in return for his kindness, she would repay him with betrayal\u2014sneaking off without even saying good-bye.</p><p>Under her bed she\u2019d stowed a suitcase ful of a few things she knew she\u2019d need. She wanted to bring the sketches she\u2019d done of her family, or even a few photos, but she didn\u2019t want anything with her that could connect her to them. She forced herself to stick to the necessities, and she scoured those for anything that might link her to her home.</p><p>She\u2019d even ripped the prescription label off her sleeping pils, just in case.</p><p>After the fundraiser, while the chaos of cleanup was going on, Lana would slip away. She\u2019d written notes to her parents, her sister, Stacie, and Caleb, begging them not to look for her. She\u2019d been harsh in those letters, saying that she needed time alone without her family to interfere. She\u2019d thanked Caleb for his help but had worded his letter so that there would be no question about the fact that she\u2019d ended things between them. It was over. Period.</p><p>That one had hurt the most, had forced her to lie in the most heinous way of al. She pretended she didn\u2019t care about him, that what they\u2019d had was just a way for her to get some sleep, blow off some steam. She\u2019d used him. That was al it had been.</p><p>Lana blinked back hot tears. She would not cry. She couldn\u2019t give Caleb even the slightest hint that she was planning on leaving. He\u2019d find a way to folow her, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could leave him twice.</p><p>He shifted in his sleep, and the muscled weight of his arm crossed over her stomach, pinning her in place.</p><p>There had been a time not so long ago when that weight would have made her panic. Even the slightest hint of being restrained had swamped her with memories of her abduction. But that time was gone. Caleb had healed her somehow, driving away her nightmares with the quiet strength of his presence.</p><p>God, she was going to miss that.</p><p>Lana stroked his arm with her fingertips, trying to soak up every last bit of him she could. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was strong enough to learn to live without him again, but she knew she had no choice.</p><p>Caleb made a sleepy sound of contentment and puled her beneath him, parting her legs with expert ease. A spear of longing stabbed right through Lana at the feel of his weight atop her, the tip of his erection nudging at her opening.</p><p>She was ready for him, wet and relaxed, her body aching to feel him slide inside her just one more time. Lana arched her hips toward him, taking him into her body in a long, slick thrust.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s groan mixed with a sound of surprise, as if he hadn\u2019t quite intended this to happen. His eyes were half-open, slumberous and sexy as hel. \u201cLana.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist, alowing him to sink deeper. The feeling of being filed and stretched tumbled through her, and she let out a soft sound of delight.</p><p>Bright little spots danced in her vision, and she wrapped her arms tight around Caleb, trying to steady herself.</p><p>His powerful body moved over hers, sliding in and out with the kind of strength that made her feel weak and protected al at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m on top,\u201d he whispered into her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed out as he thrust deep once again. He hit that magical spot high inside her that made her world shrink down to a pinpoint of feeling between her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou okay with that?\u201d</p><p>She could hear the concern in his voice but couldn\u2019t respond. The sweet friction of his body inside hers, the grinding pressure against her clitoris, was too much. She gave herself up to the explosion of pleasure, let it become her whole world, where nothing could scare her or hurt her or take her away from Caleb.</p><p>It was perfect. She had one perfect moment to take with her into her bleak future, and she was grateful for the precious gift he\u2019d given her.</p><p>As she came down, she heard Caleb\u2019s deep chuckle, felt it inside her. \u201cGuess you are okay with it,\u201d he said, grinning at her.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, her eyes, her cheeks\u2014little gentle, soft kisses over her sensitized skin that made her feel cherished.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told her, his face once again solemn.</p><p>He was stil thick and hard inside her but remained stil. \u201cFor trusting me. At least enough for this.\u201d</p><p>She did trust him. More than she\u2019d ever thought possible.</p><p>He moved, and Lana\u2019s eyes fel closed. She was no longer able to concentrate on anything but the feel of his body riding hers, and she no longer cared that she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Caleb set the pace, a steady, deep rhythm that had Lana climbing toward climax once again. She had no idea how he did it. Sex had never been like this with Oran. It was like Caleb had an owner\u2019s manual for her body and knew just what to do to drive her higher with every stroke.</p><p>Lana clung to him, her fingernails biting into his muscled back. He growled his approval at her rough treatment and eased a hand down between them, so he could toy with her nipples. It took no more than a slight pinch to have her arching off the bed into his thrusts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to last much longer, honey. And I\u2019m taking you with me.\u201d Caleb\u2019s mouth found that spot on her neck that drove her wild and swirled his tongue over her hot skin. His hips sped, and he changed his angle so that he was hitting that magic spot with every powerful motion.</p><p>Lana felt her orgasm coming and reached for it, wanting to feel that perfect pleasure one more time. Caleb moaned as if trying to hold back, and his teeth tightened over that place where her neck and shoulder met. Wild sparks spread out from that bite, cascading down through Lana\u2019s body until they lit a fire inside her womb. She crashed headlong into pleasure, giving out a ragged cry of completion just as she felt Caleb\u2019s erection thrust deep and pulsed hot and hard inside her.</p><p>His jagged shout vibrated her spine, lengthening her release until her whole body was trembling with effort of sustaining it. Slowly, the intensity faded, and she stroked her hands over Caleb\u2019s back.</p><p>He relaxed al those hard muscles and his weight pressed limply onto her, but she reveled in the feeling rather than fearing it.</p> <p>He said something that was muffled by the pilows.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and looked down at her. Into her. He was stil lodged inside her, jerking every time one of the after-spasms of her orgasm made her quiver around him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t worn a condom, and she could feel the slick heat of his semen inside her. The intimacy of eye contact combined with the presence of his body so deep inside hers made Lana tremble. She\u2019d never been this close to anyone before, and it was almost too much to take.</p><p>His eyes slid over her features, studying them. \u201cIt was nothing,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>But it was something. He\u2019d said he loved her again. She could see it glowing in his eyes. He loved her but wouldn\u2019t say it, because she had told him not to.</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t do this any longer. She couldn\u2019t keep him at arm\u2019s length. Couldn\u2019t keep lying to him. Not after everything he\u2019d done for her. He deserved better.</p><p>And Lana was tired of feeling alone, tired of carrying her burdens by herself.</p><p>She puled in a deep breath, praying she was doing the right thing. Like his confession of love, once she said the words, they could never be taken back. She lowered her voice, stil uncertain whether the words she\u2019d kept so tightly caged inside her would even come out.</p><p>\u201cKara was there,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn Armenia. She was the one who had my friends tortured. The one who had them kiled. She was the one who ordered my death.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p> <p>Caleb was stunned silent, but his arms tightened around Lana as she spoke in a voice so low it was hard to hear.</p><p>Kara? That elegantly dressed, seemingly normal woman had ordered Lana\u2019s death? He knew something about her was off, but he\u2019d never expected this. It didn\u2019t seem possible, but it explained everything. It explained why Lana was so jumpy every time she went to the youth center. It also explained why Kara\u2019s perfume had tugged at his memory when they first met.</p><p>Caleb had been in that cave not long after she\u2019d been there. He\u2019d smeled her perfume lingering in the air, along with the stench of blood and death. He\u2019d never seen her</p><p>\u2014she\u2019d been one of the terrorists who had carefuly concealed their identities and never let a peon like him meet them face to face\u2014but he\u2019d smeled her.</p><p>Lana shuddered in his arms. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tel you because I thought if I pretended not to know her long enough, she would just go away. I thought if she had no reason to suspect I could identify her, she\u2019d leave me in peace. It was the only thing I could think of to protect my family.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure if her plan was more brave or ignorant. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tel anyone? Not even your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one. When you found al those bugs, I thought she\u2019d go away\u2014that she\u2019d know I hadn\u2019t told you or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t already kiled you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would she want to kil me if I couldn\u2019t identify her? It would just draw more attention, which I doubt she wants. Besides, she liked the torture best. She made them film it so she could watch over and over.\u201d Her voice trembled over the words.</p><p>Caleb wanted to be gentle, but there was no easy way to tel her. \u201cYour death was part of Kara\u2019s initiation into the Swarm. She can\u2019t let you live, even if you hadn\u2019t seen her.\u201d</p><p>He felt her stiffen in his arms. \u201cMonroe said the Swarm was gone. Wiped out.\u201d</p><p>Caleb pressed a kiss against her slippery hair. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Even if she\u2019s not working for them, she\u2019l have a reputation to uphold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she wants to hurt me, but if she kils me, her fun wil be over.\u201d</p><p>When he thought of al the times that woman had the chance to hurt Lana . . . it made his blood run cold.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re stil alive,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s enjoying watching you suffer. But eventualy, she\u2019l get bored. In fact, she probably already is, which is why there was a sniper on the roof yesterday, waiting for a shot at you.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, gripping the sheet over her breasts. Panic had drained the color from her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019l never be safe, wil I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hel you won\u2019t. I\u2019m going to have Kara taken into custody, for starters. Then, if al goes wel, she\u2019l die in prison. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t go wel? If Kara has some way of puling in help from outside prison? Then what? You can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t let her know I told you who she is\u2014that I\u2019m a witness to what she did. She\u2019l hire someone to go after my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t have the chance, Lana. I\u2019l make sure she has no outside contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How are you going to make sure? I won\u2019t let you put my family at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop her. You trusted me enough to tel me who she was, now I\u2019m asking you to trust me enough to get rid of the threat she poses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you can\u2019t be there when they capture her. If you are, she\u2019l know it was me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb squirmed under Lana\u2019s desperate gaze. She looked so vulnerable right now, so afraid. He wanted to do whatever it took to wipe away every trace of fear from her life. If that meant giving the pleasure of capturing and questioning Kara to someone else, then that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I won\u2019t go. I\u2019l have Monroe send in a clean team to bring her in\u2014men she\u2019s never seen before.\u201d</p><p>Some of the tension eased from her rigid posture. \u201cPromise me she won\u2019t have any reason to think I\u2019m behind this,\u201d demanded Lana.</p><p>Caleb smoothed a hand over her mussed hair. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me my family wil be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re al being carefuly guarded by men I trust. Stacie, too.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for so long, he wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard him. Finaly, she puled her guilty gaze away from his and said, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to hear it, but he knew he had to. \u201cTel me, Lana. I need to know everything so I can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but he could see how hard this was for her\u2014how fear was making her limbs shake. \u201cKara wasn\u2019t alone. I saw others, too.\u201d</p><p>Caleb bit back a curse, keeping his expression neutral. He didn\u2019t want her to stop opening up to him now, even though he wanted to scream at her for holding onto this information so long. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man you kiled. Kara. Three more who may or may not stil be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you identify them?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, she reached into her nightstand drawer and took out a sketchbook. Her hands moved slowly as if compeled, opening the sketchbook to an empty page. Her knuckles turned white under the strain of gripping the pencil so hard. Lines flowed onto the page as if she\u2019d drawn them a thousand times before. One by one, three faces appeared on the page, each one sketched with photographic detail.</p><p>Lana ripped them carefuly out of the book and handed them to Caleb. \u201cWil this help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Lana covered his hand with hers. She was trembling. \u201cI need this to be over, Caleb. I\u2019m not sure how much more I can take.\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave her the most confident look he could muster. \u201cLet me make a phone cal. I\u2019l be right back.\u201d</p><p>Caleb closed himself in the bathroom to make the cal. The less Lana heard about the details the better. Monroe answered before the second ring. \u201cThis had better be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Is this line secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs secure as any can be in this day and age. There\u2019s always some snot-nosed punk out there cracking the latest security.\u201d</p><p>It would have to be good enough. \u201cKara McIntire was the woman who headed up that whole mess in Armenia.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief, shocked pause before Colonel Monroe said, \u201cI\u2019l have her in custody within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knew it was ilegal for Monroe to have men operating inside the U.S., so he didn\u2019t bother asking any questions about why he had someone so nearby. He realy didn\u2019t want to know, even if Monroe would have told him. \u201cMake sure you use a clean team so Kara won\u2019t connect her capture back to Lana. Also, there are three more people you need to locate. Lana drew sketches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l send a man for the sketches right away. We\u2019l find them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l cal you back and confirm when it\u2019s done. Until then, stay on guard.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead, and Caleb let out a relieved sigh. It was almost over. She\u2019d trusted him, and now he could keep her safe.</p><p>Marcus got off the plane, already regretting his decision to come here, no matter how necessary. He hated the Midwest. Al the smiling people and their intrusive questions grated on him. The stifling heat and humidity ate at his patience until there was none left. Not that he\u2019d had much left since finding out just how badly Kara had messed things up.</p><p>She\u2019d been captured like some kind of amateur. So had John, which was a shame. John had always been useful. Kara had her uses, too, but she was a serious liability. If she talked, Marcus\u2019s days of blissful, profitable anonymity were over.</p><p>John would keep his mouth shut. Not that he knew anything of value about Marcus\u2019s operation. Kara, on the other hand . . . if she held true to form, al it would take was a little kindness to get her to open up. One gentle interrogator could ruin al his hard work.</p><p>Marcus had to get to her first. Good thing he had an inside source who knew where the CIA was holding her and when she\u2019d be moved to a more secure facility.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t fond of wetwork himself, but if he wanted a job done right, he had to be wiling to get his hands a little dirty now and then.</p><p>The sooner he got out of this helhole and back to the coast, the better.</p><p>The sun was just coming up over the horizon when Lana heard Caleb\u2019s phone vibrate. He ducked into the bathroom to answer it, and Lana gripped her coffee mug harder as she stared out the window.</p><p>She prayed she hadn\u2019t made a mistake. Caleb promised her that her family was safe, but so many things could go wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then again, so many things already had.</p><p>Caleb came out of the bathroom a minute later. He was smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s over. She\u2019s in custody.\u201d</p><p>Lana crumpled to the floor in a boneless pile. Coffee sloshed over the rim, staining the carpet, but she didn\u2019t care. It was over. Her nightmare was over.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s arms wrapped around her and he puled her into his lap. She leaned into him and saw her tears make dark spots on his shirt. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to see it for yourself? I can arrange for you to make a positive ID.\u201d</p><p>The thought of facing Kara again sickened her. \u201cNo. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb kissed the top of her head. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we get over to the youth center and pretend like nothing\u2019s happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m good at that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a solemn look. \u201cYou need to know that Monroe told me I have to leave tomorrow. I\u2019ve got another assignment waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s throat tightened, but she managed a nod. \u201cYou\u2019ve done your job here. Of course you have to move on.\u201d</p><p>He was watching her carefuly. \u201cI\u2019m going to tel Monroe you\u2019re not ready for me to leave. I\u2019l take some personal time.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to be able to watch him walk away, but she knew she had to. \u201cNo, Caleb. You have a job to do. People need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d</p> <p>Lana couldn\u2019t deny it. She was done lying to him. \u201cI\u2019l be fine.\u201d Which was the truth. She was always fine.</p><p>\u201cWil you?\u201d He tilted her chin up so she was looking into his eyes. \u201cWhat about your nightmares?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l go back to counseling. Maybe it wil work this time now that I know for sure Kara isn\u2019t out there anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may stil have to face her. Testify against her.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. She wasn\u2019t sure she could do that. She wasn\u2019t sure she could be in the same room with that woman ever again. Not even to put her behind bars. \u201cI wil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. There are only two of us who know you are a witness\u2014me and Monroe\u2014and for now, I\u2019d like to keep it that way. You\u2019l be safer if you\u2019re not listed as an official witness.\u201d</p><p>Safer, but not safe. Even with Kara in custody, she wasn\u2019t safe.</p><p>But maybe her family would be.</p> <p>\u201cI could stay,\u201d offered Caleb, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t want me to stay, then you should go into protective custody or the witness relocation program.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to beg him to stay with her, but she couldn\u2019t do that to him. She knew it would hurt his career. She wasn\u2019t wiling to let him make that sacrifice. \u201cI don\u2019t like either of those options, but I promise I\u2019l think about it. For now, I just want to get through today, okay?\u201d</p><p>A disappointed look darkened his face, but he nodded. \u201cOkay, but once the carnival is over, we\u2019re going to talk about your options. Deal?\u201d</p><p>Lana nodded. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t believe the turnout at the fundraiser. Hundreds of families showed up, and she wondered how they al fit. The basebal field outside the youth center was packed with kids playing carnival games, trying to knock over bottles or shoot rubber ducks with water guns, but the biggest attraction by far was the dunk tank, where kids and adults alike lined up for a shot to soak one of Caleb\u2019s friends.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen much of Caleb al morning, but every once in a while, she\u2019d catch a glimpse of his head towering over the crowd and her heart would speed. She forced herself to focus on the fact that Kara was behind bars and not think about how she\u2019d feel when he left.</p><p>Lana ducked into the next tent and stopped short in shock. Grant was on one side of the tent, alowing six young girls to play dress-up with him. A local theater had loaned them bits of old costumes, and right now Grant was wearing donkey ears and a tutu over his jeans. In his right hand was a stuffed carrot, and his left held a magic wand coated in glitter. Another volunteer snapped Polaroids for the girls who had dressed them.</p><p>Standing on the other side of the tent was Caleb, surrounded by a flock of giggling girls. Each one had some sort of garish makeup in hand\u2014lipstick, eye shadow, blush</p><p>\u2014and they each took turns painting Caleb\u2019s face. She expected him to wear the same long-suffering look Grant wore, but instead he was smiling into a mirror. \u201cYou missed a spot,\u201d he told a girl who couldn\u2019t have been more than six.</p><p>She giggled, and he leaned down so she could add a bright blue splash of glittery eye shadow to Caleb\u2019s face. It realy brought out the purple in the bruise under his eye.</p><p>Lana watched as the girls finished with Caleb and went after Grant with their cosmetics. She walked up to Caleb and puled his head down to her for a hard, quick kiss.</p><p>Caleb gave her a warm smile as he wiped lipstick from her mouth with his thumb. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this picture,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the one leaving lipstick on me.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s smile widened. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I would have preferred dunk-tank duty, but I wouldn\u2019t be much of a leader if I ordered my men into situations where I wouldn\u2019t go myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover Girl country is dangerous territory,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Caleb grabbed a box of wet wipes and went to work removing the makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s for a good cause.\u201d</p><p>Lana had to kiss him again. She couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cThank you for this,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He discarded the now rainbow-colored wet wipe and puled her against his body. He was just leaning down to take a serious kiss when a new group of girls filed into the tent, announcing themselves with a series of gagging noises and high-pitched screeches. \u201cEeew!\u201d shouted one of the younger girls, and the others broke into uncontrolable giggles.</p><p>Caleb sighed and let her go with a wink instead of a kiss. \u201cBack to work. I\u2019l come find you before the auction starts. We\u2019re closing most of the tents so you\u2019l have more people attend the auction.\u201d</p><p>Lana left him to the girls, unable to quit smiling. The auction was scheduled to start in an hour and would be held inside the gymnasium. If only half the people attending showed up, she was sure they\u2019d do wel.</p><p>Lana entered the youth center, letting the cold rush of air-conditioning wash over her. Sweat cooled on her skin and she lifted her dark hair off her neck to help the process along. She could smel popcorn and freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. People lined the cafeteria tables, having snacks or just taking a few minutes to cool off. Most of the gym was partitioned off and set up with chairs for the auction. Al of the paintings were hung on display above the height of sticky little fingers, and dozens of people stroled around, looking at them.</p><p>\u201cLana!\u201d</p><p>She turned at the sound of her name and saw Stacie sitting at the registration table. Her long graying hair was in a loose bun and her crisp white shirt was perfectly pressed.</p><p>Her cheeks were pink with excitement, and she gave Lana a warm, happy smile.</p><p>It hit Lana then that Stacie realy was going to be okay. Intelectualy, Lana had known it, but until now, she hadn\u2019t felt it. Now that she did, the weight on Lana\u2019s shoulders seemed to lighten.</p><p>Lana took the opportunity to give Stacie a gentle hug. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked Stacie.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay away today. I had to come help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be pushing yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m supposed to be getting exercise, not that sitting here counts as that. I want to start back to work next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your doctor say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should decide what I can and can\u2019t handle for myself. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d That last was delivered with the maternal frown Stacie was so good at.</p><p>Lana shook her head, grinning. \u201cPoint taken. You know I\u2019d love to have you back as soon as you\u2019re able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could come back now, but my sister isn\u2019t leaving for another couple days and I want to spend that time with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake al the time you need.\u201d</p><p>Stacie looked at her watch. \u201cSpeaking of time, have you seen Kara today? She was supposed to be taking my place about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s face was a carefuly neutral mask. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s odd. She\u2019s usualy very punctual.\u201d</p><p>Kara wasn\u2019t sure where the authorities were taking her, but she doubted she was going to like it. She eyed the armed guard in the back of the van with her. He was young, or maybe she was just getting old. Either way, her time was nearly over, and somehow, that was okay.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed loyal to Marcus and protected his identity even when they\u2019d offered her her freedom if she gave him up. Thankfuly, she\u2019d seen the men coming for her in time to drop the thumb drive containing the video out her car window. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d seen her do it, but even if they had, it would probably be a useless mess of crushed plastic, thanks to the heavy traffic on I-70. She could die proud of herself knowing she\u2019d saved the man she loved from harm. And she was going to die. After they finished using her, they\u2019d get rid of her. No records. No paperwork. No trace she\u2019d ever existed.</p><p>At least Marcus would remember her. She took comfort in that.</p><p>The van lurched hard to the right. Tires squealed. The van tilted and finaly tipped onto its side. Kara\u2019s head slammed into the metal wal several times, and she shook it to clear her vision. The guard caught himself before he could fal into her. The chains shackling her to the van rattled, and outside, she could hear short, sharp bursts of gunfire.</p><p>The van slowed to a screaming halt as the side slid over asphalt.</p><p>The guard recovered and drew his weapon just as the back doors of the van opened. Another armed guard was there. \u201cWe gotta get her into one of the cars. I\u2019l cover you.\u201d</p><p>The too-young guard fumbled for the key. Gunfire slowed but didn\u2019t stop. It seemed to take forever, but he finaly managed to unlock her cuffs.</p><p>Kara scurried out of the van. The guard covering them staggered backward, taking a hit.</p><p>She was momentarily stunned and looked up in shock to where the shot came from. Marcus was there, crouched behind a thick tree not thirty feet from the isolated road.</p><p>He\u2019d come to rescue her! He was going to take her home.</p><p>A broad smile stretched her face. Marcus smiled back and raised his weapon, pointing it right at her.</p><p>Disbelief froze her in place. Marcus wasn\u2019t here to save her or bring her back home. He was here to silence her. To kil her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tel them anything,\u201d she yeled, betrayal making her voice weak and holow.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you never wil.\u201d</p><p>Kara saw the tendons in his arm shift, saw his finger move on the trigger.</p><p>The too-young guard saw it, too. He shoved her hard, pushing her to the side.</p><p>A gun went off, then another. Two more shots.</p><p>Kara expected to feel a bulet slice through her, but the pain never came. She didn\u2019t wait around to see what happened. She raced for the closest car\u2014one of her armed escorts\u2019 cars. The keys were in the ignition and the motor was stil running. She slid into the driver\u2019s seat and gunned the engine. The tires shrieked, but she didn\u2019t relent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes shot to the rearview mirror every two seconds, but no one else was there. Not the CIA. Not Marcus.</p><p>A shard of grief stabbed through her at the thought. If she hadn\u2019t failed him, he wouldn\u2019t have had to come after her. Everything had gone terribly wrong.</p><p>This was al Lana\u2019s fault. Kara could torture her for lifetimes and it would never be enough to make up for what Marcus had done. Never.</p><p>No more playing. It was time for Lana to die.</p> <p>The art auction was at two. The youth center would be packed. Lana would be there. So would her doting, supportive family. One cal to the cel phone attached to the bomb Kara had planted and Lana would be shredded into so many bits they\u2019d never find them al.</p><p>It was better than she deserved.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s phone vibrated against his hip, and he had to dig through the grassy layers of a hula skirt to find it. When he saw the caler ID list a private number, he excused himself from the girls who were using him as a mannequin and stepped out of the tent.</p><p>\u201cStone here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe searched the place where Kara was living. I think we\u2019ve got a situation,\u201d said Monroe.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>Monroe was silent for so long Caleb thought he wasn\u2019t going to respond. Finaly, he said, \u201cThe kind Miles Gentry might cause.\u201d</p><p>A bomb. Miles Gentry was an expert in explosives, which was why Caleb had taken the man\u2019s place\u2014he knew his way around a detonator.</p><p>The sun beat down on Caleb\u2019s black hair, but al he felt was cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cNot much. Tools. But the place was so clean otherwise, they stood out. We\u2019ve got men and dogs on the way to help you sniff out any problems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Caleb\u2019s mind whirled through what he needed to do to deal with the threat. He wanted to find Lana, but there wasn\u2019t time, and everyone here was in as much danger as she was. Al these kids were in danger. \u201cBut on the way isn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m not waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d said Monroe.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Caleb hung up the phone and ducked back into the tent, where Grant was being painted by a group of little girls.</p><p>\u201cGotta go, Kent,\u201d he told Grant.</p><p>Grant looked up, and Caleb could see that he knew this was business. He didn\u2019t ask any questions, just extracted himself from the girls, grabbing a handful of wet wipes to clean his face.</p><p>\u201cWe need to clear the entire area. Round up the men. Set up a perimeter. Have everyone spread out, and disperse the crowd as quickly and quietly as possible. I\u2019l clear the youth center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it,\u201d responded Grant, and he took off at a jog.</p> <p>Caleb ran for the youth center and Lana.</p><p>He entered the building and spotted her standing near the podium. His heart started a heavy, hot pounding. God, he loved her. He didn\u2019t want to leave her even for a day.</p><p>How the hel was he going to live a lifetime without her?</p><p>There was time to worry about that later, if he was lucky. Now he needed to get everyone out of the building.</p><p>As if sensing his gaze, she looked up, and al the color drained from her face. She came toward him, meeting him along the center aisle of chairs that had been blocked off for the auction. A crowd circled the outer edge of the seating, but they were separated from that crowd, as alone as they were going to get.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked him, her voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cWe need to clear the building. There may be an explosive device in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bomb? Oh, God, no! The kids! We\u2019ve got to get them out of here. It\u2019s not saf\u2014\u201d</p><p>Caleb clamped a hand over her mouth as people began to turn and stare. \u201cListen to me. I\u2019m going to deal with this. I need you to stay calm and do exactly what I say. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Lana gave a shaky nod.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, I need a microphone.\u201d</p><p>Lana ran to the podium, where the auctioneer\u2019s microphone was ready and waiting. Caleb was right on her heels.</p><p>Lana flipped the microphone on with a shaking finger and handed it over to Caleb. \u201cCan I please have your attention?\u201d His voice was even and calm, without a hint of the panicky fear that was racing through him.</p><p>\u201cThe kids have been working hard with me on something for the past few days, and I thought al of you would like a little demonstration. Kids, are you with me?\u201d</p><p>A scattering of young cheers went up, and parents smiled in anticipation.</p><p>Caleb pressed a button on his watch. \u201cOkay, kids, your record is sixty-eight seconds. Let\u2019s see how much your folks slow you down. Go!\u201d</p><p>Immediately, kids started making blaring noises like car horns or alarm clocks and headed for the door, puling their parents behind them.</p><p>Lana gave Caleb a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cFire dril,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe kids added the noise on their own. I just taught them to get out of the building in an orderly manner. After what happened at your parents\u2019</p><p>house, I thought it might come in handy if there was ever a fire here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re such a Boy Scout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you out of here, too. Get behind the perimeter the men set and stay there. I can\u2019t afford to split my attention right now.\u201d</p><p>Lana didn\u2019t argue, but before she went, she puled him down and gave him a brief kiss. She handed him a set of keys that opened al the doors in the building. \u201cStay safe.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a feral warrior\u2019s smile. \u201cPromise me more of that sweet mouth and there\u2019s nothing that wil take me down.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>Disarming the bomb wasn\u2019t going to be the hard part for someone who was as good with explosives as Caleb. Finding it was another story.</p><p>Caleb would have given his right arm for a dog trained at sniffing out explosives right now. His sense of smel was good, but not that good, and the bomb squad hadn\u2019t arrived yet.</p><p>The only consolation he had was that he was alone in the building and the crowd was clear and out of danger. Grant and the other men had seen to that. If Caleb messed up, he would be the only one paying the price, which was about as good as a situation like this could get.</p><p>He started at the rear door, figuring the private office area was a more likely location to leave something someone didn\u2019t want noticed. There was no way to know if opening a door would trigger the device, but he sure as hel couldn\u2019t see through them. Slowly, one by one, he opened each office with the keys Lana had given him. He started sweating on the first door. By the third, he was drenched.</p><p>But his hands remained steady, and that was the important part.</p><p>The offices were smal and most were empty, making them easy to search. One of the rooms had been converted into an employee lounge, though it was hardly bigger than the offices. The faint scent of coffee clung to the wals. He opened each of the three cabinets over the counter, as wel as the one under the sink, and found nothing but coffee, filters, dishes, and cleaning supplies. There was a large metal supply cabinet next to the refrigerator that he didn\u2019t remember seeing before, but he\u2019d been in here only once, to get some ice for one of the kids who twisted his ankle.</p><p>Caleb approached the cabinet cautiously. He could see gouges in the vinyl flooring where the cabinet had been scraped across it. The gouges hadn\u2019t had time to colect any dirt. It definitely had been moved recently.</p><p>He picked up a chair and used the metal leg to push the lever that opened the door. Nothing happened. The door inched open, but nothing exploded. Which was a good thing.</p><p>Caleb definitely wanted al his fingers intact when this mess was over. He liked the way Lana\u2019s skin felt under his hands too much to give up even a little of that tactile sensation.</p><p>He leaned close and peered inside the cabinet. He could see only one side, but it looked empty. Again, using the chair, Caleb nudged the cabinet door open. Again, nothing exploded.</p><p>He could see inside the cabinet easily now, and it was, indeed, empty.</p><p>He turned to go to the next office when the refrigerator kicked on and the stench of urine and fear was pushed up to his nose. He paused, sniffing the air to figure out where the smel was coming from.</p><p>He moved to where the scent was stronger. It was coming from behind the cabinet.</p><p>Caleb leaned over until he could see behind the cabinet and found a door. The handle had been removed so the cabinet wouldn\u2019t stick out from the wal\u2014so that the cabinet would completely obscure the door.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>He checked for any triggering devices connected to the cabinet, and when he found none, he carefuly picked it up and moved it out of the way. The door behind it was painted the same plain white as the wals. An empty buletin board hung crookedly from a nail in the door.</p><p>The hole where the door handle should have been had been taped over with a strip of duct tape. Caleb puled out his smal multi-tool and used the knife to poke a tiny hole in the tape so he could see inside. The storage room, or whatever it was, was dark inside. Of course.</p><p>With a deep breath to steady his nerves, Caleb slowly puled the tape away from the hole. The sticky sound was too loud in his ears, and he realized he\u2019d slid into adrenaline-induced hyper-awareness. Everything slowed down and stretched out, giving him more time to react. He prayed he wouldn\u2019t need it.</p><p>A muffled, frantic noise came from the other side of the door. Someone was in there.</p><p>Caleb forced himself to stay steady and keep his movements controled. Now was not the time to get hasty. \u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d he told whoever was in there in a calm voice.</p><p>\u201cJust hold on.\u201d</p><p>The person didn\u2019t quiet. Instead he grew more frantic, and Caleb could tel now that it was a man from the deep, panicked grunts.</p><p>\u201cIs there a bomb in there with you?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>A broken sob from the man confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I can deal with that. No problem.\u201d His voice was as steady as his hands. His pulse, on the other hand, was fast and hard. He didn\u2019t want to die here, not when there was stil a chance he could have a life with Lana. She wasn\u2019t convinced they should be together yet, but she\u2019d trusted him enough to tel him about Kara. That had to count for something. He wanted to stick around long enough to find out what that something was.</p><p>Caleb slid a finger through the hole and felt around for any sort of triggering device. His movements were necessarily slow, but he wanted nothing more than to blast through this door and get this guy out of harm\u2019s way. When he felt nothing, he poked the leg of a chair through the hole and used it to pul the door open.</p><p>Stil no explosion. Thank God.</p><p>The room was dark, but the light spiling in from the employee lounge was bright enough to see by. The bomb was hidden near the gas line going into the kitchen, where the explosion would result in a nice, big fire. It was attached to a cel phone, which wasn\u2019t good. Caleb had seen setups like this before, and unless the phone was a decoy, one cal would set the thing off.</p><p>Opposite the bomb sat Oran, bound and gagged, and living proof that karma existed. Tears streamed down his face, and his pants were dark where he\u2019d wet himself.</p><p>Caleb was man enough to pretend not to notice.</p><p>He crouched beside Oran, checking him for any connection to the bomb.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were supposed to be at your engagement party today,\u201d said Caleb conversationaly, as if they had al the time in the world. The last thing he needed was for Oran to panic and blow them both to hel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oran gave him a furious grunt.</p><p>\u201cBet you\u2019d like that tape off your mouth,\u201d guessed Caleb. \u201cI\u2019l get to it in a minute. Just want to make sure you\u2019re not wired to set that thing off if you move too much.\u201d</p><p>Oran went completely stil.</p><p>Caleb saw nothing that led him to think Oran could trigger the explosion with a shift of his body weight, so he eased a corner of the tape up and ripped it off the man\u2019s face.</p> <p>Caleb wasn\u2019t a petty man, but the gasp of pain Oran gave him made him smile al the same.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How did I get here?\u201d Oran asked.</p><p>He cut the tape around Oran\u2019s arms and legs. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I remember was coming here this morning to talk to Lana. My head\u2019s kiling me. Someone must have knocked me out.\u201d</p><p>Caleb did not ask him what he was going to talk to Lana about. He was pretty sure that whatever it was would only piss him off, and he didn\u2019t need the distraction right now.</p> <p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>Oran nodded. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Get the hel out so I can disarm this bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d asked Oran, horrified.</p><p>\u201cYou see anyone else standing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should wait for the bomb squad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd risk it going off in the meantime? I don\u2019t think so. When they get here, I\u2019m happy to share the fun. Now, unless you want to help, get out. I don\u2019t have time to carry you out.\u201d</p><p>Oran was gone before the echo of Caleb\u2019s voice in the empty storage room settled.</p><p>Caleb puled in a deep breath and went to work.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>The press arrived at the youth center within minutes of the evacuation, their cameras trained on the building. Lana was inundated with questions, and microphones were thrust into her face.</p><p>\u201cIs it true there\u2019s a bomb inside?\u201d asked one reporter.</p><p>\u201cWe have reports of a release of nerve toxin. Can you confirm that?\u201d asked another.</p><p>\u201cHave you received any threats before today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you think of any reason why your foundation would be targeted?\u201d</p><p>They kept coming at her with questions, some of the same ones over and over. Lana spent what seemed like forever answering questions when al she wanted to do was find Caleb and make sure he was safe.</p><p>The only break she got from the reporters was when Oran stumbled out of the building, looking like he\u2019d wet his pants. Reporters swarmed him. Cameras flashed, capturing Oran\u2019s appearance in embarrassing detail. Those pictures were going to be popping up for the rest of Oran\u2019s career, she was sure of it.</p><p>The bomb squad arrived in a blast of sirens. A team had gone into the building, but minutes crawled by, and no one had come out yet.</p><p>Some of the reporters left Oran to come back and attack Lana with more repetitive questions. Lana finaly had to resort to \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>Detective Hart came to her rescue, fending off the reporters. He puled her beyond a line of police tape where the reporters couldn\u2019t get to her. \u201cI got word from a man inside that Caleb disarmed the bomb. They\u2019re checking the place for more, but with any luck the threat is over.\u201d</p><p>Lana kept her knees locked to prevent herself from crumpling to the ground.</p><p>The detective\u2019s hand gripped her arm and steadied her. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wil be if everyone gets out of this alive.\u201d Worry crushed her, making it hard to breathe. She\u2019d brought this danger here. She\u2019d put the lives of so many people at risk.</p><p>Whatever it took, she could never let this happen again. If she had to go into protective custody, that\u2019s what she\u2019d do. Her freedom was nothing compared to the lives of the kids at the youth center and their families.</p><p>It was nothing compared to Caleb\u2019s safety.</p><p>He had put himself in so much danger by going in there alone. She knew his job was dangerous, but knowing and witnessing it were two different things. And this danger she\u2019d brought down upon him herself. If only she\u2019d told him about Kara earlier, maybe they could have avoided this. Maybe he would have been able to stop Kara, take her into custody before she could have planted the bomb.</p><p>It was too late for that. The mistakes she\u2019d made were set in stone, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to make more. She was going to take responsibility for her role in this disaster. Publicly. She didn\u2019t know how she would find the strength to do it, but she would. Somehow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re clear,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cTel them to do another sweep with the dogs, just to be sure,\u201d ordered Caleb.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve done two. They\u2019re sure. Bomb squad\u2019s moved outside to start checking cars. No one\u2019s going home until they\u2019re sure the exterior is clear, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You and I can folow a lead, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat lead?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>There were stil way too many ears around for Caleb\u2019s peace of mind. \u201cNot here. Outside.\u201d</p><p>Caleb and Grant slipped out through the crowd without tipping off the press.</p><p>When they were out of earshot, Caleb said, \u201cMonroe traced the cel phone used to trigger the bomb to a man named Dennis Nelson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Kara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got his address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Kara\u2019s boyfriend, or so we thought. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t argue. He was too glad Grant was here to lend a hand and make the job safer so he could get back to Lana in one piece.</p><p>They geared up on the drive over, donning vests and headsets to keep them in constant communication. They were both revved up, tense, and on edge as they neared the Nelson residence.</p><p>The man\u2019s house was a run-down little place that matched al the others on the block. The cracker box had been built right after World War II and looked like it hadn\u2019t been painted since. A flower box ful of weeds graced the single front window.</p><p>Grant circled around back while Caleb let himself in through the front door. The place was a wreck, with newspapers and beer bottles and pizza boxes thrown everywhere. The smel of stale sweat and old beer filed the air, forcing Caleb to breathe through his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe back is clear\u2014I\u2019m coming in,\u201d said Grant over the headset Caleb wore.</p><p>Grant was at his side an instant later.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t much to the house, just a smal kitchen, a living room, and two bedrooms with a bathroom between. Caleb motioned for Grant to take the bedroom on the right.</p><p>Weapon in hand, Caleb went to the bedroom on the left. He nudged the door open and saw a man lying facedown on the bed. A soft snore gave away that the man was alive, and Caleb felt his mouth pul back in a fierce smile.</p><p>\u201cClear,\u201d whispered Grant over the headset.</p><p>Caleb felt Grant\u2019s shadow beside him, covering him while he entered the room. Caleb woke the sleeping man up by pressing a knee against his back to hold his body immobile against the mattress.</p><p>The man came awake with a frightened shriek and thrashed under Caleb\u2019s knee. Caleb pressed more of his weight into the man\u2019s spine until he stopped fighting. \u201cHow do you know Kara McIntire?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hel? I don\u2019t know any fucking Kara. If your old lady is sleeping around on you, that\u2019s not my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong answer. Try again. We found your cel phone on the bomb.\u201d</p><p>The man tensed beneath Caleb\u2019s knee. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been mine. Mine is on the dresser.\u201d</p><p>Caleb heard Grant take a step toward the dresser, but he kept his eyes on Dennis.</p><p>\u201cNo phone here,\u201d said Grant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only going to ask you one more time, Mr. Nelson. How did your phone end up on the bomb at the youth center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I swear it. My boss must have come in and taken it last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boss?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know his name. I swear to God. He contacted me by phone, using this freaky thing that fucked up his voice so I couldn\u2019t recognize it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it was a man?\u201d</p><p>Dennis hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cSounded like a man, but like I said, it was al fucked up, like a robot or something.\u201d</p><p>It could have been Kara using a voice-modulation device. He\u2019d have Monroe add that to the list of questions to ask her. \u201cWhat did you do for your boss?\u201d demanded Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plant the bomb. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fingerprints were at the youth center,\u201d lied Caleb. It would take a while for the results of the fingerprints they\u2019d lifted to come back, but it was a good guess\u2014one designed to get Dennis to talk.</p><p>\u201cI picked up some stuff for my boss. He wanted me to bring back a bunch of photographs of the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat photos?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cThey were on a buletin board in the break room. It was just a bunch of kids at some swim party or something. He came here and got them when I was sleeping. My boss is the pervert, not me. I don\u2019t go for kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about the bomb?\u201d</p><p>Dennis swalowed hard. \u201cI saw the parts. My boss had me take everything out and lay it on the kitchen table. I have no fucking idea why. The guy\u2019s a psycho. You should be looking for him.\u201d</p><p>Caleb knew exactly why Dennis had been ordered to do that. Whoever had realy made the bomb\u2014probably Kara\u2014wanted to make sure that there were nice, clear fingerprints on al the components. No doubt Dennis Nelson had a police record and his prints were on file. The police would track him right back here and find trace evidence that there had been explosives in his kitchen. They\u2019d probably also find photographs from the youth center hidden around his house, with his prints al over them. Dennis would be blamed for the bomb, and the real culprit would walk away.</p><p>It was a good plan. Too bad for Kara they already had her in custody.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever meet your boss in person?\u201d asked Caleb.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a woman named Kara? Know her?\u201d asked Grant.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came here several times. Let herself in with a key.\u201d</p><p>Dennis went pale. \u201cMy boss was a woman? That\u2019s fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you were told to do? Anything at al?\u201d Caleb let al his anger come though in his voice. He used it as a weapon to scare Dennis, to make the bastard talk.</p><p>\u201cI broke into a couple places. He, or she, I guess, wanted me to find some drawings or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrawings?\u201d A chil flooded Caleb\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cYeah, like sketches. She wanted to see every new drawing this one chick did, but I never found any.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s sketchbooks.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the woman\u2019s name?\u201d asked Caleb in a lethaly quiet voice. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Grant move closer to the bed, as if preparing to pul Caleb off if he did something stupid, like beat Dennis to a pulp.</p><p>The thought had crossed Caleb\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dennis.</p><p>\u201cTel me.\u201d Caleb grabbed a fistful of hair and puled the man\u2019s head back at an awkward angle.</p><p>\u201cLaura something. That\u2019s al I know.\u201d Dennis\u2019s voice gurgled from the extreme angle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it. Lana. Please let me go. You\u2019re breaking my neck.\u201d</p><p>Caleb only wished. He loosened the pressure just a bit. \u201cDid you break into Lana\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shot her coworker.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Caleb knew the man had.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d Dennis started crying, his voice ramping up to a high-pitched whine. \u201cIt was an accident. The gun just went off, and then there was al this blood . . .\u201d</p><p>Caleb let go of the man\u2019s hair, shoving his face toward the mattress in disgust. He took some plastic flex-cuffs from Grant and bound Dennis\u2019s wrists behind him, then did the same with the man\u2019s ankles.</p><p>\u201cCal Hart,\u201d he told Grant. \u201cTel him we\u2019ve found Stacie\u2019s shooter, and have him hurry the hel up. I want to get back to Lana.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p> <p>It took only a few minutes for Detective Hart to arrive. Trailing behind him were half a dozen cops who immediately began to secure the scene, though they were carefuly staying away from Nelson\u2019s private property until the search warrant arrived.</p><p>Caleb sat Dennis at the curb so Hart would be free to arrest him without stepping foot on his property. He didn\u2019t want anything messing up this arrest.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this is the guy who shot Stacie?\u201d asked Hart, his hazel eyes sharp as he looked at the man.</p><p>\u201cHe confessed,\u201d said Caleb. \u201cThe gun is in the top drawer of his dresser, so you can do the balistics match. Arrest him or detain him or whatever you\u2019re going to do, but I need to get back to Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want protection,\u201d pleaded Dennis.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you admit to shooting Stacie Cramer?\u201d asked Hart in an even voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Just get me the hel out of here. My boss is probably watching right now.\u201d</p><p>Hart gave Caleb a questioning look. \u201cIs he sane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar as I know. I suggest you do as he says and get him somewhere less out in the open. He may have more information about the bombing attempt at the youth center.\u201d</p><p>Hart read Dennis his rights and hustled Dennis to the nearest patrol car. \u201cThanks. Lana and Stacie wil be thriled to know we found the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019l find his prints al over the bomb, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the one who built it.\u201d</p><p>Hart helped Dennis ease into the backseat without hitting his head. \u201cOn the way here, I had his record checked. He was photographed running several red lights last night.</p><p>Al on the street leading away from the youth center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss said I had to hurry or my money would be gone,\u201d wailed Dennis.</p> <p>Caleb waited until Hart shut the car door and lowered his voice so it couldn\u2019t be heard inside the patrol car. \u201cHe\u2019s being set up for the bombing. I think the real bomber is already in custody.\u201d</p><p>Hart gave Caleb a skeptical frown. \u201cHow the hel do you know al that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust putting two and two together. Finaly came up with four, though it took long enough. How\u2019s Lana holding up?\u201d</p><p>Hart shrugged. \u201cShe took off as soon as she knew you were safe. I made sure she got out of the danger zone. Told her to go home and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s phone vibrated. When he answered it, Monroe was on the other end. Without preamble, he said, \u201cKara escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d belowed Caleb.</p><p>Lana was alone. Unprotected. Caleb felt his skin ice over with fear.</p><p>\u201cWe were transporting her to a more secure location. Her transport was attacked. Two guards were kiled. Three more injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere and when did this happen?\u201d Caleb was already heading for the car.</p><p>\u201cShe took one of the guard\u2019s cars. The authorities are looking for it, but most of them are stil at the First Light Foundation. Kara\u2019s had plenty of time to make it back to town, and she\u2019l want to eliminate her as a witness, so don\u2019t let her out of your sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d said Caleb as he hung up the phone.</p><p>Caleb tried not to panic, but it was a close thing. Lana was alone, and Kara was free to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d asked Grant, hot on his heels as Caleb reached the car.</p><p>\u201cNo. Kara escaped. She\u2019s going after Lana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me drive,\u201d offered Grant. \u201cI\u2019ve got gear in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>By \u201cgear\u201d he meant weapons. Knowing Grant, lots of them.</p><p>Caleb dialed Lana\u2019s house and got her voice mail.</p><p>He prayed to God she\u2019d stopped for groceries or got caught in traffic or something\u2014anything\u2014to keep her from getting home before he did.</p><p>Lana unlocked her apartment door and went inside. It took her eyes a second to adjust from the brightness outside, and when they did, she saw Phil slumped on her couch with a ragged bulet hole in his temple. Blood and pulpy chunks of brain were splattered across the framed sketches of Lana\u2019s family.</p><p>Her mind ground to a halt as she tried to make sense of what she saw. Lana turned her head toward a blinking light that caught her attention. A smal video camera sat on a tripod, angled so that it could capture the smal living area. A red light flashed on and off, indicating it was recording.</p><p>Kara leveled a gun at Lana and gave her a cold smile. \u201cI think this has gone on long enough, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Marcus knew exactly where to find Kara. She was nothing if not doggedly determined to finish what she started.</p><p>It took a bit of time to find Lana Hancock\u2019s address. The woman protected her privacy and had an unlisted number. His wel-paid computer genius hacked into her medical records and solved the problem with only a short delay.</p><p>Marcus abandoned the car he\u2019d used while disrupting Kara\u2019s transportation, just in case one of the guards lived long enough to ID it. He was now behind the wheel of a distressingly average four-door sedan, blending in with al the others.</p><p>His face was nothing special, and even though he kept his body in peak physical shape, his specialy tailored clothing helped conceal both his size and build. He could hide in plain sight. No one would look twice at him. No one would suspect he was a man headed to murder two women and anyone else who got in his way.</p><p>Fear made Lana clumsy. Slow. She reached behind her for the door, but Kara stopped her.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t. No more running. This is where you and I finish things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kil me.\u201d Her heart was pounding so hard she was sure Kara could hear it.</p><p>\u201cOf course. That\u2019s the way it has to be. You should be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d She wished she had a cel phone. Maybe she would have been able to cal 911 or Caleb.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a year and a half longer than you were meant to have. That\u2019s got to count for something.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s eyes darted around, looking for a weapon. Al she found nearby were bits of wood that had once been a chair\u2014the one Caleb crushed when he forced his way in.</p><p>She was going to miss him so much.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to tel anyone who you are. Just leave. Disappear.\u201d</p><p>Kara laughed. It was a rich, elegant sound that made Lana\u2019s skin crawl. She steadied the gun with her left hand. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tel me why,\u201d pleaded Lana, staling. She needed more time to figure out what to do. How to get out of this. She didn\u2019t want to die.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me? Why did you want to kil me in Armenia?\u201d</p><p>Kara frowned as if truly puzzled. \u201cWhat makes you think I need a reason to kil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you like to watch people\u2019s torment too much to end it without a reason. If they\u2019re dead, you can\u2019t enjoy their suffering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound like some sort of lunatic. Torture is an art. Do you think that any of your friends would have suffered nearly as much if they hadn\u2019t known they were going to die? Hadn\u2019t had proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, each death was only for the purpose of making the next person more afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to isolate them.\u201d Kara cocked her head to the side and dropped her voice as if trying to seduce a lover. \u201cTel me, how did it feel to be the last one alive? To know you were al alone? In the dark. No one was coming to save you. No one was there to hear you cry. You were the last. Destined to suffer and die al alone.\u201d</p><p>Lana found herself speeding back to that place against her wil. She could smel the stench of decaying bodies, feel the rough cloth over her face.</p><p>Black, suffocating terror sweled up inside her, spiling out until she could feel it crawling along her skin, inching up her nose, leaking into her mouth.</p><p>Kara let out a low, pleased moan. \u201cYes. That\u2019s right. You were the best work I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d</p><p>Lana\u2019s body tensed up. She struggled to pul herself back to the here and now.</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d said Kara, \u201cI think there wil never be another like you. So helpless in your fear. So consumed by it. Maybe it\u2019s genetic. Maybe your sister has the same trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJenny.\u201d The word slipped out in a nearly desperate plea.</p><p>Kara shuddered in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAnd she has a son. A husband. So many people to lose. So much pain to bear.\u201d</p><p>No! Lana couldn\u2019t let that happen. She couldn\u2019t let her family endure the torture she had. She loved them too much not to fight. This evil had to end, and Lana was the only one here to do it. That thought gave her the strength to crawl back to reality, shrug off the terror of her past, and face Kara without fear for the first time.</p><p>She was just a woman. Sure, she was a woman holding a gun, and Lana stil hadn\u2019t found a weapon, but she couldn\u2019t let that stop her.</p><p>It was going to end here. Now. She had not fought her way back from the grave and lived a life of fear and torment, struggling to survive, just so she could die now. As long as she was alive, there was a chance she could keep her family, Stacie, and Caleb safe. As long as she was alive, there was hope.</p><p>Kara had tried to steal her life in Armenia. She\u2019d tried to ruin it by moving here to torment Lana. It was not going to end like this. She was not going to end up like Phil, lying on the couch with a bulet in her head. She was not.</p><p>Lana lashed out using one of the brutal moves Caleb and Grant had taught her. It was no graceful motion of limbs like some accomplished martial artist\u2014it was violent and ugly and effective. She went for Kara\u2019s eyes, sweeping the gun out of her way as she moved inside her reach.</p><p>Kara didn\u2019t expect her fearless attack, and she was thrown back on the floor. Lana came down hard on top of her and pressed a forearm against Kara\u2019s neck, bearing down with al her weight and fury. Kara gurgled and slammed the gun into the side of Lana\u2019s head.</p><p>Bright spots flared in Lana\u2019s sight, but she didn\u2019t stop fighting. Adrenaline made her stronger, faster. Eighteen months of anger made her ferocious. She screamed as she pummeled Kara\u2019s face with her fist, stil choking off her air.</p><p>Kara\u2019s body heaved in a desperate attempt to dislodge her, and Lana was roled to the side, her back slamming hard into the bookcase. Air rushed from her lungs, and she couldn\u2019t pul any back in, but she didn\u2019t care. Her rage was burning too bright to be put out by something so seemingly trivial as oxygen. She tried to push to her feet but only made it to her knees. Her hand found something heavy and hard on one of the lower shelves, and she bashed it against Kara\u2019s head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kara let out a pained yelp and instinctively curled her arms over her head. The gun went flying, but Lana didn\u2019t bother wasting precious seconds to look for it. Instead, she forced herself to her feet and gathered every scrap of anger and pain and terror Kara had forced on her. She saw the face of every friend she\u2019d lost, heard their pain-filed cries for help. She couldn\u2019t do anything then, but she could now.</p><p>Lana shoved al that emotion into a tight bal and let it explode inside her in a frightening rush of strength. The giant bookcase moved easily as she ripped it away from the wal and pushed it over.</p><p>The tal furniture toppled and books slid out, landing in a heavy pile over Kara\u2019s torso. Kara let out a high-pitched scream, but Lana could not find even a sliver of pity for the trapped woman. Kara deserved whatever she got.</p><p>Al Lana felt was a giddy wave of victory and a terrifying need to finish the job. She wanted to kil Kara\u2014to watch the light of life flicker and die behind her eyes.</p> <p>The door slammed open and Caleb appeared, his big body outlined in sunlight. He had a gun in his hand, which he carefuly lowered with slow, precise movements. He turned and shouted over his shoulder, \u201cWe need an ambulance!\u201d</p><p>Caleb stepped inside, his eyes roaming over the scene, taking it in in a split second. He puled her against him in a desperate hug that made breathing even more difficult. It lasted only a heartbeat before he released her and bent his knees, making himself short enough to look right into her face. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, his voice even.</p><p>Lana was too out of breath to answer, but she gave him an unsteady nod. Kara\u2019s gun lay on the ground at Lana\u2019s feet. She reached down, picked it up, and aimed it at Kara\u2019s head.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s voice was low and gentle. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this, Lana. You don\u2019t want her death on your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tortured and kiled my friends. She tortured me. She ordered my death. She threatened my family. She deserves to die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but you don\u2019t deserve to be the one to pul the trigger. Kiling someone is a heavy responsibility. You\u2019ve already suffered enough because of her. Don\u2019t let her cause you any more pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe would have kiled hundreds of people today, and if she lives, she\u2019l try to do it again. She already escaped once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t get away again. Look at her. She can\u2019t move. Her back is probably broken. She\u2019s finished.\u201d</p><p>Lana looked down at the woman. Realy looked at her. Her face was bleeding from various scratches Lana had gouged into her skin. Her left eye was sweling shut. Her nose looked crooked and was bleeding heavily. A thick, purple bruise was darkening over her throat where Lana had choked her. Her limbs were unnaturaly stil. She was trapped. Helpless. Broken.</p><p>Just like Lana had been in Armenia when Kara had ordered her death.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t kil me,\u201d begged Kara.</p> <p>Lana felt no pity for her. None. She would have kiled those children today if Caleb hadn\u2019t stopped her.</p><p>Al Lana had to do was move one finger a scant inch and it would be over. Sure, there were other terrorists out there, but this one would be dead. Lana would know it for a fact. No more worries that Kara would see the fear in her eyes and know. No more nightmares about the elegant voice ordering her death. Al she had to do was pul the trigger and take back a sliver of control. Al she needed was a tiny sliver. It wasn\u2019t asking for much after what she\u2019d been through.</p><p>Kara gave Lana a defiant stare burning with hatred. There was no question that Kara would try to kil her if she got the chance\u2014if Lana let her live.</p><p>Al she had to do was twitch. Just a little.</p><p>Sweat roled down Lana\u2019s temple, stinging the cut there. Her whole body was quivering from the rush of adrenaline, and her breathing seemed too loud.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it,\u201d urged Caleb.</p><p>\u201cYes, I can. Watch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a kiler. You\u2019re not like her.\u201d</p> <p>In that moment, Lana knew exactly what she had to do. She had to take back control of her life\u2014recapture it from those who had tried to steal it away from her. And there was only one true way to do that. She had to let her anger go before she turned into one of them.</p><p>Lana lowered the weapon, sliding it back into Caleb\u2019s big hands. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not like her.\u201d</p><p>She felt Caleb\u2019s muscled body behind her relax fractionaly. He took the weapon from her hands just as Grant came rushing into the apartment.</p><p>Kara tried to scream, but it came out as more of a wet gurgle. \u201cYou bitch! I should have kiled you a dozen times over. I should have made you watch your family die one by one.\u201d</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t stay here and hear this. She had to get out.</p><p>\u201cGrant, stay with Kara until the paramedics arrive, then contact Monroe,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d</p><p>Lana was halfway down the sidewalk when Caleb caught up to her. He shoved the disk from the video camera into his pocket and puled her to a stop. \u201cHold on a minute, honey,\u201d he said, his voice so gentle. \u201cYou\u2019re in shock,\u201d he said as he rubbed his hands up and down her arms.</p><p>Lana couldn\u2019t seem to make sense of his words. She blinked up at him. The sun was behind him, casting his face in shadows, just like it had been that day he\u2019d carried her out of the cave. He\u2019d saved her then, and with a sudden realization, she knew that he\u2019d done it again.</p><p>He\u2019d kept her from kiling Kara. Proved to her she was in control of her life. Her decisions. No one could take that away from her, no matter what Kara or anyone else did to try to tear her life apart. It was her life, and no matter how much evil she\u2019d been forced to face in the past months, she couldn\u2019t let it define her. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d He guided her to a step and lowered her to the warm concrete. \u201cGive yourself a minute to let the adrenaline wear off. I can hear an ambulance now, and they can take a look at your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head?\u201d Somewhere in the dim haze of crazy signals her body was giving out, she realized that her head hurt. She reached her hand up to that spot, and it came away red with blood. \u201cShe hit me with her gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stil took her down.\u201d She heard the pride in Caleb\u2019s deep voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kil her,\u201d stated Lana, as if he hadn\u2019t been right there.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His faith in her was humbling.</p><p>The ambulance puled into the parking lot, the siren making Lana\u2019s head feel like it was going to split open. A young EMT hurried to her side and started poking at her, flashing a light in her eyes, pressing a bandage over the wound. She wanted to leave, but Caleb held her in place while they patched her up.</p><p>\u201cWe should take her to the hospital,\u201d said the EMT.</p><p>\u201cNo hospital!\u201d said Lana, feeling panic rise up inside her. She couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being confined in a stark room that reeked of death and hopelessness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l look out for her,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>The EMT gave Caleb a strange look she couldn\u2019t understand\u2014some sort of silent male communication. \u201cKeep an eye on her, and if she gets worse, bring her in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman inside needs your attention more than Lana,\u201d Caleb told the man.</p><p>The EMT left to go inside, and Lana needed to get away before he came back and changed his mind. If he tried to take her to a hospital, she might just find a use for a gun.</p><p>She tried to get to her feet, but her legs were too weak.</p><p>\u201cJust sit. I won\u2019t let them take you to the hospital. You\u2019l feel better once you give yourself a few minutes to let the shock wear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l feel better when this is over. Realy over.\u201d</p><p>Marcus shoved the limp, nearly naked body of the paramedic into the ambulance. The man\u2019s clothes were a little snug, but they would have to do. Cleaning up this mess wouldn\u2019t take long if he hurried. Doubtlessly, police would be arriving soon, but they were a bit occupied with the recent bomb scare at First Light Foundation.</p><p>Thank you, Kara.</p><p>He grabbed what looked like a tackle box to complete his disguise and headed toward the apartment building.</p><p>Caleb held Lana close, thanking God she was stil alive.</p><p>Grant was on the far side of the parking lot, where Lana couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying to Monroe. It was probably best that she had as little involvement with Kara as possible. Until the trial.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t going to be any fun, but Caleb was going to be right there by her side the whole time, supporting her. No matter what it took.</p><p>The second paramedic came up the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cYour partner\u2019s inside,\u201d Caleb told him, motioning toward Lana\u2019s apartment.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He veered around them. Sunlight bounced off his highly polished shoes, revealing a few drops of blood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some blood on your shoe,\u201d said Caleb.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t even slow down enough to look. \u201cLast cal was messy. Hazard of the job.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t want to know. He puled Lana closer, ready to interrupt him if he decided to share any stories.</p><p>Lana clung to him, and it felt good. He wasn\u2019t sure how he was ever going to let her go.</p><p>She looked up at him, her eyes a bright, sorrowful blue. \u201cCan we go?\u201d</p><p>The apartment door clicked shut behind them.</p><p>Why would they have done that? Her apartment was dark. Wouldn\u2019t they want the extra light?</p><p>Caleb turned around and looked at the closed door, and a feeling of dread started to swel. Something was wrong here.</p><p>The shoes.</p><p>Since when did EMTs wear expensive dress shoes on the job?</p><p>They didn\u2019t. That man wasn\u2019t an EMT.</p><p>Caleb prayed he was a reporter hunting for the inside scoop, but he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get that lucky.</p><p>Two muffled pops sounded from the apartment, folowed by one more. Silenced shots.</p><p>No luck today.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d Caleb told Lana.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t have time to explain. \u201cGrant!\u201d he belowed as he charged up the sidewalk, drawing his weapon.</p><p>Grant looked up from his conversation, saw there was a problem, and started toward them.</p><p>Caleb couldn\u2019t wait for him to catch up. Lana was stil too close.</p><p>The apartment door flew open. The imposter EMT held a Sig Sauer like he knew how to use it. He fired.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s body jerked, and he spun to the left. He felt like he\u2019d been hit in the chest with a sledgehammer, and he had to struggle to stay on his feet.</p><p>The man leveled his weapon, but this time he wasn\u2019t aiming at Caleb. He was aiming for Lana. And she wasn\u2019t wearing a buletproof vest like he was.</p><p>Caleb was not going to let her get hurt again. Never again.</p><p>Rage filed him up, making him stronger, faster. He forced his body to move despite the pain in his chest. He fired his weapon, even though he knew he\u2019d have to get lucky to hit anything while at a dead run. The man flinched, distracting him for a split second. It was al the time Caleb needed.</p><p>He lunged at the man, putting the ful force of his anger into the motion. He slammed the man into the wal of the building with a satisfying thud.</p><p>Another sledgehammer drove the breath from his body. His arm went numb for a moment, and he heard his weapon clatter to the ground. In the back of his mind, he recognized he\u2019d taken another round. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Better him than Lana.</p><p>Caleb had him pinned to the wal, but the man was strong and managed to free his weapon enough to bring it up toward Caleb\u2019s head for a fatal shot.</p><p>Lana screamed. Grant shouted at her to get back. From his voice, Caleb could tel he was stil too far away to help unless Caleb could separate their bodies enough for him to get a clear shot.</p><p>Caleb hammered a fist into the man\u2019s side, rocking him, making him grunt in pain. The blow cost Caleb his precarious balance and opened him up for a solid punch to his face. As he toppled, he caught a hold of the man\u2019s weapon hand and puled him to the ground.</p> <p>The man tried to rol out of it, but Caleb outweighed him and used brute force to hold him down. He locked a strong hand around Caleb\u2019s throat and squeezed. Caleb ignored everything but the gun. He couldn\u2019t risk a stray shot hitting Lana. The man gripped Caleb\u2019s throat harder. He couldn\u2019t pul in any air.</p><p>The pistol went off again, firing past Caleb\u2019s head into the air.</p><p>Lana screamed. She was stil too close.</p><p>Caleb felt his body giving out due to lack of oxygen. Bright spots were bursting over his field of vision. He wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. He had to get that weapon away before he passed out, or he was a dead man.</p><p>Caleb squeezed the hand around the weapon. Hard. Used every bit of his strength to crush the man\u2019s hand against the unyielding metal contours of the pistol.</p> <p>The man screamed, his voice rising an octave in pain. Caleb felt bones snap.</p><p>A vicious kick landed along Caleb\u2019s back. The edges of Caleb\u2019s vision were fading to gray. He could hear Grant shouting at Lana to stay down. Hear his boots pounding nearer.</p><p>He figured he had another few seconds of consciousness at most and wiled Grant to hurry.</p><p>Weakness started to flow into him at an alarmingly fast pace. He turned the gun toward the man who had wanted to hurt Lana. Used his fury to keep him awake another second. Two.</p><p>Another bone cracked. A strangled noise rose up from the man beneath him. Caleb angled the weapon until the silencer was pressed against his enemy\u2019s flesh. He didn\u2019t know what part it was, because he was totaly blind now, but he guessed it was going to hurt, al the same.</p><p>The man gave a panicked grunt. Caleb found the trigger beneath the man\u2019s own finger. The gun gave a silenced bark and jerked in their hands.</p> <p>Hot blood sprayed up over Caleb\u2019s face, and the man beneath him went limp.</p><p>Caleb hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d blacked out until it was over and he was waking up again. It was the sound of Lana\u2019s frightened voice that got his attention. \u201cIs he hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d he heard Grant say. \u201cBoth rounds hit his vest.\u201d</p><p>Caleb opened his eyes, a little shocked he could see again, breathe again. The first thing he saw was Lana\u2019s tearstained face. She was hovering over him, holding his hand.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She laughed and new tears leaked out of her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust needed a quick nap.\u201d Talking hurt. Breathing wasn\u2019t much fun, either.</p><p>Caleb pushed himself up. That hurt, too, but he didn\u2019t think anything was broken. His shirt had been shoved up, and he could see two bruises forming over his ribs. The vest had stopped the bulets, thank God.</p> <p>\u201cAsleep on the job again,\u201d said Grant. \u201cWhat a slacker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a slacker? You\u2019re the one who took your sweet time lending a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you weren\u2019t interested in learning about friendly fire up close and personal. Besides, I didn\u2019t want to make you look bad in front of the lady.\u201d</p><p>Lana took his face between her palms. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019l survive.\u201d An ambulance puled into the lot, sirens blaring.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d said Grant. \u201cMonroe said they\u2019ve located the other men Lana saw in Armenia. A chopper wil be here to pick us up in ten minutes. If you whine, he won\u2019t let you in on the fun of hunting them down.\u201d</p><p>Like hel. Caleb was going to finish this. End Lana\u2019s nightmare. And then he was coming back for her. Whatever it took.</p><p>Caleb had been gone six days, and Lana\u2019s life felt bleak without him. Barren.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen to go into protective custody in order to keep everyone else safe\u2014at least until the men she\u2019d seen had been found and brought to justice. Once the trials were over, she would go back to her regular life.</p><p>At least they\u2019d alowed her brief contact with her family via phone, so she was able to keep tabs on them. Let them know she was okay.</p><p>She tried to be happy about al the good things in her life. Kara had been kiled and could never hurt anyone again. The money from the carnival had been more than enough to put the youth center back in the black, and with al the press from the bomb scare, al kinds of donations were coming in. Stacie was up and about. She and her sister were taking a trip to Europe in the fal. Lana\u2019s parents were already working on plans to rebuild their house. Her mom was thriled to be able to pick carpet and wal colors al over again, especialy since their insurance was paying for everything. Her dad had already started designing his new gardens and a greenhouse he could use al year round.</p><p>Brittney broke off her engagement with Oran as soon as the embarrassing photos of him started popping up in the daily paper and on the news. Rumor was he\u2019d abandoned his political aspirations.</p><p>The papers depicted Lana as some kind of hero, which bothered her a lot. No matter how many times she told them that she was a coward and that she should have come forward sooner, people seemed to wave that part off as unimportant. Especialy her family.</p><p>Caleb was the real hero. He\u2019d disarmed the bomb, saved her from being shot, and was hunting down terrorists while she sat in her wel-guarded room, praying he was safe. Hoping he\u2019d come back. Not that she\u2019d given him much reason to. She\u2019d been painfuly clear that they had no future together. Why would he bother to come back?</p><p>If only she\u2019d said something\u2014anything\u2014to let him know how much she cared about him, how much she wanted him to come back to her. But she hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d stepped onto that helicopter, and al she could think to say was, \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>She wished she\u2019d at least kissed him.</p><p>The late-night TV show she\u2019d been trying to watch was over, and she couldn\u2019t remember seeing any of it. Even though her nightmares were mostly gone, she stil didn\u2019t like going to sleep alone. She missed Caleb so much.</p><p>Loved him so much. It was easy to see that now that she was no longer consumed by fear. She finaly had room in her life to love, and she prayed it wasn\u2019t too late. As soon as it was safe, she was going to hunt him down and tel him how she felt. She only hoped he\u2019d have a better reaction than she had to the words.</p><p>A knock on the door made her jump. It was after midnight, and she wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. A kick of fear froze her in place. She knew she was safe, but al those months of terror had not yet let go of her completely.</p><p>Lana took a deep breath, forcing herself to relax. She was safe here. Only Monroe and his men knew where she was.</p><p>She opened the door, and Caleb stood there. He looked tired and dusty, like he\u2019d been dragged behind a truck for a couple of miles, but he was here. Alive.</p><p>Lana\u2019s heart squeezed, and she ran into his arms. He stumbled back under her impact, but he held on to her like he\u2019d never let go. Lana held him back just as hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re safe,\u201d she said against his shoulder.</p><p>Caleb kicked the door shut. There was an odd mix of fury and resignation in his tone. \u201cAnd so are you now. It\u2019s over. For good this time. You can go home.\u201d</p><p>Lana understood what he meant. What he hadn\u2019t said. There wouldn\u2019t be any trial. Kara was dead, and now those men were, too. She didn\u2019t let herself dwel on why that was or how it had happened. She simply accepted that each and every one of them had deserved whatever fate they\u2019d met. That was justice enough for her.</p><p>\u201cYou look worn-out,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI am. Dirty, too. But I needed to see you. I didn\u2019t want to wait to tel you, you don\u2019t have to be afraid anymore.\u201d</p><p>That was her Caleb. Always the hero, thinking of others first.</p><p>Lana offered him a smile that came straight from her heart. She had no idea how to tel him how she felt. Al she could think to do was show him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t wait.</p><p>The shower is big enough for two.\u201d</p><p>A hot glow lit his eyes and highlighted his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re kiling me, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m loving you.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s body took on an unnatural stilness. \u201cYou mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say it.\u201d His tone was hard, unyielding.</p><p>Lana went up on her tiptoes and looked right into his dark eyes. She let him see every bit of hope and love and desire she felt for him, holding nothing back. She\u2019d never hold back from him again. \u201cI. Love. You.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s big body shuddered at her words, and his arms crushed her against him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to push you. I know you stil have a lot of things to deal with. But I\u2019m not going away, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance. I\u2019m taking that job David offered me so I have more time to spend with you.\u201d</p><p>Lana pressed a light kiss to his mouth, grateful that he was choosing a safer line of work. She wasn\u2019t sure how much more worry her poor heart could take. \u201cHow much time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as you can stand. I want you in my life, Lana. Permanently. I\u2019l wait until you\u2019re ready for that kind of permanence, but you should know I\u2019l be waiting nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs close as you\u2019l let me get.\u201d</p><p>That sounded wonderful. She could think of nothing she wanted more than to be with him without the taint of violence hovering over them. \u201cI have the feeling you won\u2019t have to wait long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked, sounding hopeful.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cNow let\u2019s get you out of those clothes and into the shower.\u201d</p><p>A hungry sound rumbled from Caleb\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m too tired for the kind of loving I want to give you.\u201d</p><p>Lana gave him a sultry smile ful of promise. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. It\u2019s my turn to take care of you for a change. I guarantee you\u2019l like it.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
