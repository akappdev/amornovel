She was infiltrating my every thought, and no matter what I did to try and come back to my senses\u2014to remind myself that this could only be temporary, she slipped deeper into my life.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so quiet tonight?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when a naked woman is in your lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was giving her a chance to relax.\u201d I slid my hands underneath her thighs. \u201cWhat unnecessary bullshit do you want to talk about today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not unnecessary,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still in New York?\u201d</p> <p>I prevented myself from clenching my jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? Are you estranged from them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t have any parents.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cThen why do I remember you telling me a story about your mom the first month that we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story about Central Park and ice cream.\u201d She looked into my eyes, as if she were expecting me to say something. \u201cYou said she took you to some children\u2019s fair, I think? It was something that happened every Saturday. But the one you remembered most happened when it was raining and she still took you, and you stood in line for an hour just to get a scoop of vanilla.\u201d</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>\u201cIs that story not right? Am I mixing it up with something else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s right...But I haven\u2019t seen her since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d She looked down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d I trailed a finger across her lips. \u201cI turned out just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a few more things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a daily question quota starting today.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat do all the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d pictures in your hallway stand for?\u201d</p><p>I felt a sudden ache in my chest. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hate New York so much and you don\u2019t like talking about your past or what you lost six years ago, why do you have so many mementos hanging on your walls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, forget that question. And the Latin quote across your heart? What does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie about one thing, lie about it all.\u201d I kissed her lips before she could ask me anything else. I was starting to wonder why she hadn\u2019t wanted to be a damn journalist instead of a ballerina.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can ask me questions now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather f**k you again.\u201d I lifted her with me as I stood up and helped her out of the bath tub.</p><p>We both dried off and went into my bedroom. Just as I was pulling her against me, my doorbell rang.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cDinner\u2019s early.\u201d I slipped into a pair of lounge pants and a T-shirt and headed to the door with my credit card.</p><p>The second I opened it, I was confronted with the sight of the last person on earth I wanted to see. Ava.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare f**king slam it on me this time,\u201d she hissed. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about shit.\u201d I stepped outside and shut the door behind me. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you that you\u2019re not wanted here?\u2019</p><p>\u201cAs many times as it\u2019ll take you to actually believe it, which you don\u2019t.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cAsk me why I came to Durham to see you, Mr. Hamilton. Appease me and I\u2019ll finally go the hell away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going the hell away regardless,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI really don\u2019t give a f**k why you came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if it\u2019s to sign the divorce papers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve sent that shit in the mail.\u201d I gritted my teeth. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m sure you\u2019re running out of loopholes for contesting it, I\u2019m willing to wait until all your options run out. I\u2019m sure your lawyers will drop you as soon as they find out what type of client you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is ten thousand a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ask the man who was f**king you in our bedroom while I was at work.\u201d I glared at her, livid. \u201cOr better yet, ask the judge you only \u201cfucked for a favor,\u201d or hey, if you\u2019re up to it, f**k my former best friend. Sleeping with him always seemed to make you feel better, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t Mr. Perfect either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never f**king cheated on you, and I never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cFive thousand a month,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGo f**k yourself, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I never give up,\u201d she said, her eyes widened as I stepped back inside my apartment. \u201cI always get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d I slammed the door in her face, feeling my heart palpitating, feeling the onset of ugly memories all over again.</p><p>Rain. New York. Heartbreak.</p><p>Complete and utter heartbreak.</p><p>Seeing Ava in person again\u2014hearing her manipulative voice and feeling those familiar pangs in my chest, immediately made me realize that I couldn\u2019t make the same mistake again.</p><p>Aubrey was already asking questions, trying to dig her way into my life as much as she could\u2014thinking that if she stayed around long enough that we would work out together. But I knew that would never happen, not after seeing Ava and knowing just how far she would go to ruin me all over again.</p><p>I was officially done with this monogamous game we\u2019d been playing for the past couple weeks. It was quite fun\u2014different, but since Aubrey could never be mine and I could never be hers, it was quite f**king pointless, too.</p><p>I headed back into my bedroom and saw Aubrey smiling as she settled into the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the dinner?\u201d she asked tilting her head to the side. \u201cDid you leave it at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head and started packing up her things, stuffing them all into her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d She stood up. \u201cDid something just happen? Do you want to talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about anything else with you.\u201d I hissed. \u201cI just want to take you the hell home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looked confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure you get all of your shit out of my bathroom. You won\u2019t be coming back here again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to start f**king someone else.\u201d I picked up her headband. \u201cI think I\u2019ve spent more than enough time with you, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d Her face fell. \u201cWhere is all of this coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same place it was always coming from. You lied to me once, you\u2019ll lie again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you were, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that you need to get all of your things so I can take you home, and from here on out, you are my intern and I am your boss. You will forever be Miss Everhart to me, and to you I\u2019ll be Mr. Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fucking. Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>She rushed over to me and snatched her things, letting a few tears escape her eyes. \u201cFuck you. FUCK. YOU. This is the last time you\u2019ll ever pull this hot and cold shit on me.\u201d She stormed out of my apartment, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>I sighed and felt an immediate pang of guilt in my chest, but I knew it was the right thing to do. It was either cut this bullshit off now, or be responsible for breaking her heart later.</p><p>I stepped onto the balcony and lit a cigar\u2014looking up at the moonless sky. Even though I felt bad for ending things so abruptly, for putting her out with no explanation, I needed to get back to who the hell I was and fast before I f**ked up and put my heart on the line again...</p><p>For my BFF/ultimate beta-reader/amazing assistant/shoulder to cry on whenever I\u2019m acting crazy/ \u201cperson\u201d like they say on \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019... Tamisha Draper. ( My books would suck without you...)</p><p>To Tiffany Neal. Thank you for being the balance. You\u2019ll always be the perfect balance...</p><p>To Natasha Gentile...How did you become my friend? LOL</p><p>And for the F.L.Y. crew: I f**king love you more than you\u2019ll ever know...</p><p>Prologue</p><p>Several months ago...</p><p>Andrew</p><p>It was all there in black and white, front and center, no filler.</p><p>Although the facts were skewed and The New York Times had once again neglected to post my photo, the damage to my firm\u2014Henderson &amp; Hart, was now done. And I knew exactly what was about to occur, step by step.</p><p>I\u2019d seen it happen in this city too many times before.</p><p>First, the top clients who\u2019d sworn to always stay by my side would call and say that they \u201csuddenly\u201d found new representation. Then the employees would file letters of resignation\u2014knowing that having a tainted firm on their resumes would hinder their careers. Next, the investors would call\u2014pretending to sympathize as they publicly denounced me in the media and promptly pulled all funding.</p><p>Last, and most unfortunately, I was sure to become another hotshot lawyer who ruined his career before it could even begin.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer do you think you\u2019ll be able to get away with stalking Emma?\u201d The private investigator I hired stepped beside me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my f**king daughter. I\u2019m not stalking her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive hundred feet.\u201d He lit a cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s how far you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they treating her right during the week?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and handed me a stack of photos. \u201cPrivate preschool, early tap-dance lessons, and weekends at the park as you can clearly see. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she still cry at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she still beg to see me? Does she\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped talking once Emma\u2019s blue eyes met mine from the swings. Squealing, she jumped off her seat and ran towards me.</p><p>\u201cDaddyyyy! Dadddyyy!\u201d She shouted, but she was picked up before she made it any closer. She was taken away and put inside a car just as she started to cry.</p><p>Fuck...</p><p>I immediately sat up in bed, realizing that I wasn\u2019t in New York City\u2019s Central Park. I was in Durham, North Carolina, and I was having another nightmare.</p><p>Glancing at the clock on my wall, I saw that it was just past one o\u2019clock. The calendar hanging directly above it only confirmed that I\u2019d been living here for far too long.</p><p>All the research I\u2019d done six years ago\u2014weighing the pros and cons, checking the records of all the top firms, and scouring the make-up of women on Date-Match, was now seemingly invalid: The condo I purchased was a mere remnant of what had been advertised, there was only one firm worthy of my time, and the pool of f**k-worthy women was dwindling by the day.</p><p>Just hours ago, I\u2019d gone on a date with a woman who told me she was a kindergarten teacher with a penchant for the color red and history books. In reality, she was twice my age, color blind, and she just wanted to \u201cremember what some good c**k felt like.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frustrated, I slipped out of bed and walked down the hallway\u2014straightening the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d frames that hung on the wall while trying not to look too hard.</p><p>I was going to need more than my usual few shots to get through tonight, and I was starting to become extremely annoyed that I hadn\u2019t f**ked someone in what felt like forever.</p><p>I poured two shots of bourbon and tossed them down back to back.

Poor Thoreau. I was really hoping the thirtieth day would be the charm.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and made another drink. \u201cIs living vicariously through my sex life your newfound hobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Her light laughter drifted over the line, and I could hear the sound of papers shuffling in the background. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask you: Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, where am I from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I asked,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be from the South.

Her poetical waxing about that desolate place needed to be put to a stop.

There was no need for this room, but since the firm had more money than it knew what to do with, the space was being used for the interns\u2019 mock cases.</p><p>Today\u2019s \u201ctrial\u201d was about some idiot who defrauded his own company\u2019s employees\u2014leaving them without insurance and health care, and unfortunately, I was playing the accused.</p><p>Standing up from the defense table, Aubrey grabbed her notebook and took the floor. She and I hadn\u2019t spoken since I kicked her out of my condo two weeks ago, but from what I could tell, she seemed unfazed.</p><p>She\u2019d been smiling quite often, being extremely nice, and each time she delivered my coffee she did it with a smirk and an, \u201cI really hope you enjoy this coffee, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been stopping at the coffee shop up the street ever since...</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton,\u201d she said, smoothing her tight blue dress, \u201cis it true that you previously cheated on your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStick to the character, Andrew.\u201d Mr. Bach whispered from the judge\u2019s seat.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYes. There was a time when I cheated on my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d One of the interns shouted. \u201cYour Honor, do we really need to know the specifics about my client\u2019s love life? This mock trial is about his involvement in a conspiracy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may, Your Honor,\u201d Aubrey spoke before the \u201cjudge\u201d could say anything. \u201cI think assessing how Mr. Hamilton behaved in his previous affairs is a good assessment of his character. If we were trying a client who abandoned his company due to incompetence, it wouldn\u2019t be out of line for me to ask about his previous personal relationships\u2014especially if our mock client is a high profile one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverruled.\u201d</p><p>Aubrey smiled and looked at her notebook. \u201cDo you have commitment problems, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I have a problem with something I don\u2019t believe in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you believe in engaging in one night stands for the rest of your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor...\u201d The opposing intern stood up, but I raised my hand.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes at Aubrey. \u201cI\u2019ll entertain Miss Everhart\u2019s inappropriate line of questioning...I believe in living my life however the hell I want and dealing with women whenever I want to deal with them. I\u2019m not sure how who I sleep with has anything to do with this mock conspiracy case, but since we\u2019re discussing my sex life, you should know that I\u2019m happy and satisfied. I have a date later tonight actually. Would you like me to report the details to you and the jury tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>The interns in the jury box laughed as Aubrey\u2019s smile faded. Even as she forced it again, I could see a hint of hurt in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cRegarding the case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo happy you\u2019re finally getting on topic.\u201d</p><p>The jurors laughed again.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in morals, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you possess them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone does to a certain extent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission to approach the witness?\u201d She looked at Mr. Bach and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton, can you read the highlighted portion of this document please?\u201d She placed a sheet of paper in front of me, and I noticed a small handwritten note at the very top of the page:</p><p>I f**king hate you and I wish I\u2019d never met you.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, taking a pen out of my pocket. \u201cIt says that my company was unaware of insurance policy changes at the time.\u201d</p><p>As she handed a copy of the document to the jury panel, I wrote a response to her note:</p><p>Sorry to see that you regret meeting me, as I don\u2019t regret meeting you\u2014only that I f**ked you more than once.</p><p>She asked me to read another section to the court, and then she took the paper away\u2014glaring at me once she read my words.</p><p>I tried to look away from her, to focus on something else, but the way she looked today prevented that from happening. Her hair wasn\u2019t up in her signature bun\u2014it was falling past her shoulders in long curls that grazed her br**sts. And the dress she was wearing, a highly inappropriate one that hugged her thighs a little too tightly, rose up an inch every time she took a step.</p><p>\u201cI have three more questions for Mr. Hamilton, Your Honor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no limit, Miss Everhart.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d She stepped forward and looked into my eyes. \u201cMr. Hamilton, you and your company led your employees to believe that you cared about them, that you had their best interests at heart, and that you would literally communicate the actual changes you would make before termination. Are those promises not directly from your company\u2019s brochure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, do you believe that you deserve to be fined or punished for giving your employees false hope? For dragging them into a situation you knew you would end all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I did what was in my company\u2019s best interest,\u201d I said\u2014ignoring the fact that my heart was pounding against my chest. \u201cAnd in the future, as those employees move on like they should, they\u2019ll perhaps realize that my company wasn\u2019t the best fit for them anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you owe them a simple apology? Don\u2019t you think you should at least give them that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn apology implies that I did something wrong.\u201d I gritted my teeth. \u201cJust because they don\u2019t agree with what I did, doesn\u2019t mean that I wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you believe in reasonable doubt, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you only had three questions left. Has elementary mathematics changed recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in reasonable doubt, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d Her face reddened. \u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I clenched my jaw. \u201cYes, I believe that\u2019s a common requirement for every single lawyer in this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, given the current case that we\u2019re discussing...Do you think that someone like you, someone who treated his employees so terribly, could ever change in the future, now that you know how badly you\u2019ve hurt others\u2019 livelihood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReasonable doubt is not about feelings, Miss Everhart, and I suggest you consult the closest legal dictionary you can find because I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve had this discussion once before...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall that, Mr. Hamilton, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your own ill-fated yet correct words, didn\u2019t you once tell me\u2014post your first interview here at GBH, that certain lies have to be told and certain truths have to be withheld? And that the ultimate conviction is up to those who can discern which is which?\u201d I looked her up and down. \u201cIs that not the exact definition that you provided for reasonable doubt?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me a long time\u2014giving me that same look of hurt she had when I kicked her out of my place.</p><p>\u201cNo further questions, Your Honor.\u201d She mumbled.</p><p>Mr. Greenwood clapped loudly from the back of the room. Mr. Bach and the other interns followed suit.</p> <p>\u201cVery good job, Miss Everhart!\u201d Mr. Bach shouted. \u201cThat was a very direct yet compelling line of questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you sir.\u201d She avoided looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYou are officially the first intern to get our Andrew all riled up.\u201d He smiled, seemingly impressed. \u201cWe definitely need to keep you around. Hell, we may call you in when we need to be reminded that he\u2019s capable of showing emotion.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>\u201cGreat job today, everyone!\u201d He leaned back in the judge\u2019s chair. \u201cWe\u2019ll go over your presentations later this week and email you the scores next Thursday.\u201d He banged his gavel. \u201cCourt adjourned.\u201d</p><p>The interns filed out of the room and Aubrey looked over her shoulder one last time, shooting me an angry look.</p><p>I shot one right back, grateful that I had a date tonight so I could f**k her and her stupid questions out of my mind.</p><p>Seven o\u2019clock can\u2019t get here soon enough...</p> <p>I waited a few minutes before heading to the elevator and attempted to remember my schedule for the rest of the day. I had two consultations with small business owners this afternoon, and I needed to make a Starbucks run before Aubrey could bring me my next cup of coffee.</p><p>I unlocked the door to my office and hit the lights, prepared to call for Jessica, but Ava was standing in front of my bookshelf.</p><p>\u201cIs the homeless shelter not open today?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI came here to finally give you what you asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little too early to jump off a bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d I walked past her and sent a quick text on my phone. \u201cIf you jump before noon, the news crew won\u2019t be able to run the story during primetime.\u201d</p><p>She stepped in front of my desk and set down a manila folder. \u201cI won\u2019t drag your name through the courts anymore, I won\u2019t file anymore stays or injunctions, and I won\u2019t make any false claims about your character either...I\u2019m done lying now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I picked up the papers. \u201cIn other words, there\u2019s a new guy you\u2019re anxious to f**k over. Does he know the real you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019re getting your precious divorce. Why do you even care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I put on my reading glasses and looked over the documents. \u201cNo alimony requests, abuse claims, or demands for property? Am I missing a page?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you. I\u2019m done lying.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe her for one second, but I picked up my phone and called the notary, telling her it was an emergency.</p><p>\u201cYou know...\u201d Ava leaned against my desk. \u201cI remember the cake you bought me for our wedding anniversary. It was white and light blue, and it had all these pretty little NYC decorations on it. It had flavored layers, too. One for every year that we were together. Do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you f**king my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have one nice moment before we end things for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I ended a long time ago, Ava.\u201d I tried to keep my voice flat, monotonous. \u201cWhen something is over, the final words\u2014good or bad, don\u2019t make much of a f**king difference.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and I noticed how terrible she looked today. Her eyes were bloodshot, her hair was frizzy and tied into a loose ponytail, and even though the blue dress she was wearing fit perfectly, she hadn\u2019t made an attempt to iron it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this so called emergency you have, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d The notary walked into the room, smiling. \u201cAre you requesting that we purchase another thousand dollar coffee maker?\u201d She stopped talking once she saw Ava.</p><p>\u201cMiss Kannan, this is Ava Sanchez, my soon to be ex-wife. I need you to witness the signing of the divorce papers and make three copies\u2014sealing one of them for mailing purposes.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pulled a stamper out of her pocket.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice that I willingly gave up our condo on the West End to you?\u201d Ava asked.</p><p>\u201cThe condo that I bought?\u201d I signed my name. \u201cHow generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made a lot of memories in that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSigning papers doesn\u2019t require conversation,\u201d I said.</p><p>She snatched the pen away from me and placed her signature above mine\u2014taking extra time to add a double swirl to the last letter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back with your copies.\u201d Miss Kannan avoided looking at either of us as she shuffled out of the room.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s it, I guess,\u201d Ava said. \u201cI\u2019m officially out of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re still in my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it kill you to wish me the best? To at least tell me good luck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing as though you\u2019re going back to prison, I guess that would be appropriate.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cGood luck. The authorities are outside waiting for you, so take all the time you need. There\u2019s even a vending machine down the hall if you want to taste freedom one last time...Although, since you\u2019ll be locked up with plenty of women, I\u2019m sure eating pu**y after the lights go out will taste just as good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou f**king snitched on me?\u201d Her face went white as I held up my phone, showing her the text I sent the second I saw her in my office. \u201cHow could you do that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I really hurt you that badly, Liam? Did I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever f**king call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you that badly?\u201d She repeated, shaking her head.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cThis is...This is about Emma isn\u2019t it?\u201d She hissed. \u201cIs that what this is? You\u2019re still holding that shit over my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k out. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been six years, Liam. Six. Fucking. Years. You need to let that go.\u201d She opened the door and a sly smile spread across her face. \u201cThings like that happen all the time...As unfortunate as it was, it helped make you the man you are today, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>It took everything in me to stay seated, to not lunge after her.</p><p>Seething, I waited for her to leave and walked over to my window\u2014watching as she stepped into the parking lot, as she raised her hands in the air as the officers shouted at her.</p><p>Then, just like six years ago, she smiled through the handcuffing process, and laughed when they tossed her into the back of the car.</p><p>The black fleet slowly drove away, and a familiar pang hit my chest.</p><p>Grabbing my keys, I rushed to the parking lot and slipped into my car\u2014subconsciously telling myself to go home, consciously driving toward the nearest beach.</p><p>I put my phone on silent as I hit the highway, and as the seconds dissolved into hours, the city disappeared in the rearview mirror. The buildings appeared farther and farther apart, and eventually the only thing outside my window were trees and sand.</p><p>When I finally reached a secluded bay, I parked my car in front of a rock. I opened my glove compartment and took out the red folder Aubrey once tried to open. Then I stepped out and sat on the closest bench.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I pulled out the photos and promised myself that this would be the last time I looked at them: Me and my daughter walking along the shore of New Jersey\u2019s beach as the sun set. Her smiling as I picked up a seashell and held it against her ear. Me carrying her on my shoulders and pointing to a starry night sky.</p><p>Even though I knew doing this would lead to cold sweats and an inevitable nightmare later, I continued flipping through the photos.</p><p>Even the ones without me: The ones of her looking sad and lonely at the park, the ones of her looking off into the distance for something\u2014or someone, that wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Emma...</p><p>My heart clenched at the final frame in the set. It was a shot of her fiddling with her umbrella, crying. She was upset because they were forcing her to go inside, because they didn\u2019t understand that although she liked being at the park in broad sunlight, she preferred to play outside in the rain.</p><p>Emotional Distress (n.):</p><p>A negative emotional reaction\u2014which may include fear, anger, anxiety, and suffering for which monetary damages may be awarded.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>I looked terrible. Absolutely terrible.</p><p>Today was the first full costume rehearsal for Swan Lake and I didn\u2019t look fit for the part at all. My eyes were swollen and puffy\u2014ruined from randomly crying about Andrew, my lips were dry and cracked, and my skin was so pale that Mr. Petrova walked by and asked, \u201cAre you playing a white swan or are you playing a white ghost?\u201d</p><p>As much as I tried to force myself to smile through my heartache, I was crying every moment I was alone, eating an exorbitant amount of ice cream and chocolate each night, and I couldn\u2019t sleep for shit.</p><p>I still couldn\u2019t believe Andrew kicked me out of his condo so cruelly. One minute he was holding me against his chest and kissing me, and the next he was telling me that he and I had f**ked enough\u2014that he didn\u2019t want me anymore, and that he was going to f**k someone else.</p><p>What was worse, was that when we returned to work that following Monday, he\u2019d been twice as rude to me. He reassigned me to a case that would take me months to sort, scolded me in front of everyone for being ten seconds late, and then he had the audacity to complain about me smiling as I brought him his daily coffee.</p><p>At least I spit in it...</p><p>\u201cAre you crying right now?\u201d The make-up assistant tilted my chin up. \u201cDo you know how expensive this stage mascara is?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I froze my eyeballs to their sockets and held back tears.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see your parents\u2019 names on the guest list for today. Are they coming to the second run through on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess they just want to see the full on show with no stops then, huh?\u201d She laughed. \u201cMy parents are the same way. I told them about the number of run-throughs we have to do and they said they\u2019ll see it when it\u2019s finished. They\u2019re all about perfection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I can relate...\u201d</p><p>She laughed and blabbered on and on, making me silently count the seconds until she was done.</p><p>When she pressed my face with the last puff of powder, she spun me around to face the mirror on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cWow...\u201d I whispered. \u201cSeriously, wow...\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look like I\u2019d been crying at all. Although my eyelids were covered in dark eye shadow, and she\u2019d dabbed a fake tear trail past my right eye, I looked as if I was the happiest woman on earth.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Everhart?\u201d Mr. Petrova asked, stepping behind me. \u201cMay I borrow you for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I followed him through the backstage doors and outside to the empty stretching area.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat on the bench, Miss Everhart.\u201d He took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it.</p><p>The smoke unfurled in spirals between us and he looked me up and down. For some odd reason, he looked more upset than usual, like he was about to yell at me.</p><p>\u201cMr. Petrova...\u201d I said softly. \u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI brought you out here alone because I want you to know that you looked fat during practice yesterday. Too fat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you danced the part of the black swan beautifully, capturing the right degree of anger and sadness, you failed\u2014fucking failed, with the white swan.\u201d He coughed. \u201cYou looked like your mind was elsewhere. Like it was killing you to be happy for five minutes, and to top it off, you\u2019ve gotten fat.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and tuned him out, focusing on the cars whirring down the street. I wasn\u2019t disturbed by his insults anymore. Him calling me fat was nothing compared to the things he said to me last week.</p><p>\u201cMiss Everhart?\u201d His voice snapped me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to open that later,\u201d he said, patting me on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not see the envelope I just placed on your lap?\u201d He put out his cigarette. \u201cDo I need to tell your understudy that she needs to get ready to dance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d I picked up the envelope, running my fingers along the crease. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He walked toward the building and held the door open. \u201cNow, make me believe that I picked the right girl to be my swan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Walters will be over for dinner next Sunday at six and we need you to make an appearance,\u201d my mother said to me over the phone that night. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to write us a very nice check for the campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow exciting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is exciting, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She practically squealed. \u201cEverything is happening so fast and falling into place quite perfectly. We\u2019re gathering funding, planning the advertising, and...\u201d</p><p>I set my phone on the table and made myself a bucket of ice water, wincing with every step I took. I was sure that I would have a new set of blisters at the end of this week, but after the way I danced at today\u2019s run-through, they would be well-worth it.</p><p>I completed every jump with ease, matched my peers step for step, and at the end\u2014when the final number called for ten pirouettes, I did fifteen. Everyone in the audience gave me a standing ovation, but Mr. Petrova sat silently rubbing his chin.</p><p>He stared at me, tilted his head to the side, and simply said, \u201cToday\u2019s practice is over.\u201d That was the biggest compliment he\u2019d ever given.</p><p>Smiling at the memory, I carried the ice bucket over to the couch and set it down. I slipped my feet inside and held the phone up to my ear again.</p><p>\u201cOh, and the Yarboroughs...\u201d My mother was still talking. \u201cThey\u2019re considering throwing a small benefit in your father\u2019s honor next month at the country club. You\u2019ll need to be present for that and it won\u2019t be casual, so I\u2019d really prefer if you wore your hair in curls please. There will be a photographer from the local paper there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to ask how my day went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute. Did you receive the dress I sent yesterday?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the plastic bag draped over my door. \u201cThere was a rough run through of Swan Lake today. It was for the costume designers, to see if everything looked right under the new lights. It was the best run through we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried on that dress yet? Do you think you\u2019ll be able to do it tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to have it tailored for Sunday\u2019s dinner ASAP if it doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you just say, I honestly don\u2019t give a f**k about your life, Aubrey?\u201d I groaned as my toes finally felt the effect of the ice. \u201cThat would make me feel ten times better right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey Nicole Everhart...\u201d She enunciated every syllable of my name. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m starting to lose my tolerance for talking to you on the phone. Why bother calling if you only want to hear yourself talk?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t get a chance to answer.</p><p>There was a call on my other line, so I clicked over without mentioning it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cIs this Aubrey Everhart?\u201d It was a male\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYes. This is she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat! This is Greg Houston. I\u2019m the student enrollment chair, and I was just calling to let you know that your withdrawal from the university has been approved! It\u2019ll be official once you come in and personally sign off on the forms. I personally think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking time off to help out with your father\u2019s campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very selfless thing of you to do, Miss Everhart,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure whenever you decide to come back, the academic committee will offer you credit for your real world experience. Anyway, I noticed you filled out the electronic forms, but since you live within a fifty mile radius of the school, its policy that you have to sign them manually as well. Also, regarding the credits you\u2019ve earned at the university thus far...\u201d</p><p>Everything around me went black.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe this shit.</p><p>I wanted to click over and shout at my mother, to ask how dare she and my father pull me out of college without even telling me, but I couldn\u2019t. I simply hung up and sat still\u2014stone-faced and lost.</p><p>There were tears falling down my face, but I couldn\u2019t feel them. I couldn\u2019t feel a damn thing.</p><p>I pressed the power button on my phone to prevent anyone else from calling me and pulled out the envelope Mr. Petrova gave me earlier. I assumed it was a long list of insults, or a new diet, but it was a letter:</p><p>Miss Everhart,</p><p>I just received notice that you were leaving the university at the end of this term. While I am disappointed in your failure to alert me to this news in advance, I am impressed with the growth you have shown while being in my program.</p><p>You are still an average dancer, but considering the fact that your peers are all terrible dancers, I guess you can be somewhat proud of that status.</p><p>Behind this letter is a recommendation for the New York City Ballet Company. Due to a few unfortunate circumstances, several spots have opened for their current class. This does not happen often, and you would be quite stupid not to audition.</p><p>However, if you do audition and are not accepted, it will only mean that you didn\u2019t dance your best. (Or that you gained another unfortunate pound.)</p><p>\u2014Petrova.</p><p>I flipped to the attached page and noticed that the deadline to audition was in three weeks, that if I auditioned and was accepted, I would be leaving my current leading role behind and would have to start all over again.</p><p>Dancing for the NYC Ballet Company had once been a dream of mine, but after I broke my foot at sixteen, I readjusted my version of a dream career; the competition at such a place would be far too fierce for someone who sat out a complete year, full recovery or not.</p><p>Nonetheless, I couldn\u2019t fathom going away to New York City, not alone anyway. And I didn\u2019t think I could leave Andrew without at least getting a much deserved apology.</p><p>Sighing, I turned on my laptop and logged into my email, shocked to see his name at the very top of my inbox.</p><p>Subject: Mock Trials.</p><p>Miss Everhart,</p><p>For the third time this week, you\u2019ve alluded to our former affairs in the court room. Although I am not surprised by this, I am quite disappointed.</p><p>You may regret the aftermath of f**king me, but I know damn well that you loved every single second that my c**k was inside of you. (And before you lie and say that you didn\u2019t, think about the numerous times you screamed my name as my mouth devoured your pu**y.)</p><p>Maybe if you thought about those things instead of your uncontrollable and erratic \u201cfeelings,\u201d your defenses in court wouldn\u2019t be so laughable.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>I deleted his email and read Petrova\u2019s letter again.</p><p>I needed to research the New York City Ballet auditions tonight.</p><p>Malfeasance (n.):</p><p>Intentionally doing something either legally or morally wrong which one had no right to do.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>I opened my left drawer, searching for a bottle of aspirin. I hadn\u2019t slept well in over a week, and I was certain that most of that had to do with the half-assed reports the interns were giving me. That, or Aubrey was poisoning my lunch.</p><p>I flipped through her most recent report and groaned as I read her handwritten remarks: \u201cI find it very ironic that you can give us an assignment on the importance of trust and relationships, when you have no idea what either of those words mean. PS\u2014You did not \u201cdevour\u201d my pu**y.\u201d</p><p>I tore off her note and tossed it into the trash, reading the next one: \u201cA case that deals with a boss f**king his employee? At least this boss had the balls to come clean and admit that he actually liked her, instead of tossing her away like trash. PS\u2014Yesterday\u2019s extra ingredient in your coffee was flakes of melted super glue. I hope you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d Jessica stepped into my office.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to send your Armani suit to another dry cleaning company?\u201d she asked. \u201cThis is the third time you\u2019ve sent them those pants. I don\u2019t think that brown stain is coming out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cJust order me some new ones please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do!\u201d She batted her eyes at me as she left, and I immediately emailed Aubrey.</p><p>Subject: Super Glue.</p><p>I no longer drink your f**king coffee, but since you\u2019ve once again proven how much of a novice you are when it comes to the law, I\u2019ll be saving your handwritten note so my friends will know who to charge with my murder.</p><p>Grow up.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>Subject: Re: Super Glue.</p><p>You don\u2019t have any friends. I was your only one. And I don\u2019t care if you save my handwritten note because I\u2019ve saved all of your EMAILS\u2014especially the ones that say, \u201cCome to my office so I can eat your pu**y on my lunch break,\u201d or \u201cI love the way your mouth looks when you wrap it around my cock.\u201d</p><p>You first.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey.</p><p>I started typing my response\u2014not willing to give her the last word, but I heard Jessica clearing her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomething else I can help you with today?\u201d I looked up. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn you just left my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord around the firm is that today is your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday is not my birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what HR said.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHR is full of shit.\u201d I looked at the coffee mug on the edge of my desk, noticing that the coffee wasn\u2019t even brown. It was orange. \u201cBut speaking of HR, could you have them ban Miss Everhart from touching the coffee machines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cBetween you and me, we\u2019re throwing you a surprise party in the break room. Like, right now. We\u2019ve been waiting for you to take a break but you haven\u2019t, so...Can you step in for a second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just tell me no about my coffee machine request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it after you come to your party.\u201d She smiled and reached for my hand, but I stood on my own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told your grandfather on multiple occasions that I don\u2019t appreciate his employee birthday parties.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and led me down the hall. \u201cMake sure you look surprised. I put a lot of work into this...I always go the extra mile for you.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the way she was licking her lips.</p><p>She pushed the door open, and all of the staff tossed confetti into the air and shouted, \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. Hamilton!\u201d Then they began to sing the birthday song\u2014out of tune and terribly off key.</p><p>I walked over to the windows where they\u2019d placed a small white cake with blue candles, and blew them out before the song ended.</p><p>\u201cHappy Birthday, Andrew!\u201d Mr. Greenwood handed me a blue envelope. \u201cHow old are you today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing as though today is not my birthday, I\u2019m the same age as I was yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, still incapable of catching when I was being short with him. Holding his stomach in jest, he motioned for one of the interns to take our photo.</p><p>As the camera flashed, I spotted Aubrey standing in a corner with her arms crossed. She was shaking her head at everyone, and when her eyes finally met mine, she scowled.</p><p>\u201cI got you something...\u201d Jessica pressed a small black box into my hand. \u201cBut I think you need to open it behind closed doors, when you\u2019re alone and thinking about me.\u201d She blushed and walked away.</p><p>I made a mental note to toss whatever it was into the trash. And instead of immediately leaving the party, I walked around the room and said thank you to everyone\u2014reminding each intern that \u201cbirthday\u201d or not, the assignments were still due at the end of the day.</p><p>I approached Aubrey with my hand outstretched, but she recoiled and walked into the adjoining ante-room.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously this immature, Miss Everhart?\u201d I followed her, spinning her around to face me as the door shut.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously this cruel?\u201d She glared at me. \u201cYou gave me more work than anyone else this morning just so you could berate me in front of them later, just because you think I embarrassed you in court again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d actually have to know what the f**k you were doing if you wanted to embarrass me in court.\u201d I unintentionally grabbed her hands, rubbing my fingers against her skin. \u201cAnd I gave you more work so you wouldn\u2019t have time to make my coffee, which up until this morning, I only assumed you were poisoning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when is \u2018spit\u2019 poison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me another f**king suit...\u201d I lowered my voice. \u201cDo you have any idea how much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She cut me off. \u201cDo you have any idea how much you\u2019ve changed? I actually miss when I was Alyssa and you were Thoreau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack when you were a f**king liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack when you treated me better...\u201d She stared into my eyes\u2014giving a look of longing, and my hands went around her waist, pulling her against me.</p><p>My mouth was on hers in seconds and we were kissing like we hadn\u2019t seen each other in years\u2014fighting each other for control. I trailed my fingers against the zipper at the back of her dress, feeling my c**k hardening against her thigh.</p><p>She pressed herself against my chest and let me slip my tongue deeper into her mouth, but she eventually tore away and pushed me.</p><p>Looking absolutely disgusted, she turned away and stormed out of the room.</p><p>I straightened my tie before following her into the party room, but she was no longer there.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to cut the cake, Andrew?\u201d Mr. Bach called out. \u201cOr do you want Jessica to do it for another year in a row?\u201d</p><p>Jessica held up the knife and winked at me.</p><p>\u201cJessica can cut it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I stepped out and headed for the interns\u2019 offices\u2014walking straight toward Aubrey\u2019s cubicle.</p><p>Her face was beet red and she was stuffing folders into her bag.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to leave early.\u201d I stepped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you permission to treat me like shit, but you\u2019ve done one hell of a job, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said that I wasn\u2019t treating you like shit when I thought your name was Alyssa, when I thought you were a f**king lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes your current treatment of me acceptable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes it justifiable.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore, Andrew...\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll stop acting like a child in court? Does it mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She cut me off and pressed a silver box against my chest. \u201cI bought this for you a few weeks ago, back when Jessica was planning your birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you spit in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have.\u201d She picked up her bag and rushed past me, heading for the exit.</p><p>A part of me actually wanted to go after her and make her explain what the hell she meant about \u201cnot doing this anymore,\u201d but I knew doing so would be pointless. Talking to her for less than three minutes aroused me, and I needed to remember why I ended \u201cus\u201d in the first place.</p><p>I returned to the break-room and said thank you to the last of the interns, glancing at the photo HR had pinned on the wall. It was a collage of my professional photos with a birthday hat sticker attached to my head. And they\u2019d written \u201cHappy Birthday, Andrew! GBH Loves You!\u201d in bright blue.</p><p>In all actuality, my birthday was months from now\u2014in December, a day I hadn\u2019t celebrated in a very long time. And even though I\u2019d never publicly admit it, I somewhat liked the fact that the people at GBH were willing to celebrate my birthday\u2014real or not.</p><p>\u201cHow many slices of cake would you like me to wrap up for you, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d Jessica tapped my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take a cup of lemonade, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stay for the \u201cWho Knows Mr. Hamilton the Best\u201d game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of you know me.\u201d I returned to my office and locked the door, setting the new birthday gifts on top of my bookshelf.</p><p>The envelope from Mr. Greenwood contained a note that said he appreciated my hard work and dedication to the firm. Beneath his written words was a gift card to his family\u2019s other multimillion dollar entity: A golf course.</p><p>The gifts from the interns were all \u201cI.O.U.\u201d letters that begged for extra time on their assignments. I held all of those over my shredder.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s black box was next, and as much as I wanted to throw it away and never think of it again, I couldn\u2019t resist knowing what she bought me. I took the top off and removed the paper, pulling out a soft piece of silk and a note:</p><p>I overheard that you like to keep these in your pocket... Here are mine. PS\u2014I took them off in the bathroom five minutes ago</p><p>:-)</p><p>Jesus...</p><p>I buried her panties at the bottom of my trashcan and crumpled that note.</p><p>I stared at Aubrey\u2019s silver box for a while, wondering if I should wait until later to unwrap it, but I couldn\u2019t help peeling off the paper.</p><p>Inside of the box was a small black photo frame. It was handcrafted\u2014bordered with iron pressed images of pointe slippers, law scales, and the words \u201cAlyssa\u201d and \u201cThoreau\u201d in smooth white letters.</p><p>The picture in it was one of us, one of her laying against my chest in my bed and smiling at the camera. Her cheeks were flushed red\u2014like they always were after sex, and she was dressed in one of my T-shirts.</p><p>I remembered her forcing me to take that photo\u2014insisting that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t share it with anyone\u201d and only wanted it for herself. She even forced me to smile...</p><p>I set the frame down and took out the other object in the box\u2014a sparkling silver watch with an inscription etched across its back:</p><p>Subject: You.</p><p>I liked you as \u201cThoreau,\u201d but I love you as Andrew.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey (Alyssa)</p><p>My glass of wine sat untouched at Arbors Restaurant, and the candles in the centerpiece were shedding sheets of their wax onto the table.</p><p>I was expecting a date any moment now, but I couldn\u2019t stop staring at the watch Aubrey gave me. She\u2019d clearly thought about each and every part of the design; no element was by mistake.</p><p>I noticed two interlocking A\u2019s in the corner of its screen, and earlier, in the sunlight, I\u2019d noticed that my name was etched on the edge of its frame.</p><p>\u201cAre you Thoreau?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice interrupted my thoughts, making me look up.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and took the seat across from me. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019m a regular here and the waitress asked if I\u2019d be having my usual when I arrived. I told her you would have the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind at all.\u201d A small feeling of guilt welled inside my chest, but it wasn\u2019t enough to distract me from pursuing what I needed tonight: Pussy. ASAP.</p><p>The waitress placed two steamed dishes in front of us, and I checked the time. I was only giving this woman one hour.</p><p>\u201cSo, what type of cases do you normally handle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCorporate for the most part, but I\u2019ve done government and tax as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. Have you lived in Durham long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is this your normal M.O.?\u201d She leaned back in her chair, dragging her nails against her see-through top. \u201cOne night stands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never is.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrow and looked her over. She was actually quite appealing\u2014long blond hair, curvy figure, and perky br**sts.</p><p>Physical attributes aside, we seemed to have a lot in common. She was a real lawyer in the next county over, she read most of the same books, and from what she\u2019d told me over the phone, we shared a comparable sexual appetite.</p><p>Our entrees came and went, the conversation plodded along, but Aubrey\u2019s watch still had a part of my attention.</p><p>\u201cIs something bothering you?\u201d My date waved her hand in front of my face. \u201cI remember you being a lot more talkative over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I waved the waiter over for the check. \u201cJust tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo tired to f**k?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never too tired to f**k.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, she crossed her legs and leaned over the table. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. I simply signed the check and stood up, holding out my hand for her.</p><p>We walked through the hotel lobby and straight for the elevators.</p><p>The second the doors closed, she pressed her lips against mine and threaded her fingers through my hair.</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d I groaned as one of her hands slid down to my belt.</p><p>She moved her mouth down my neck as we ascended to the top floor, grazing her teeth against my skin. Moaning, she gasped as I gripped her waist and kissed her back\u2014controlling her tongue with mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled the band away from her ponytail and tossed it to the floor. I closed my eyes and deepened our kiss\u2014torturously biting her lip as she tried to pull away.</p><p>Sliding her knee between my legs, she unfastened my belt and tugged at my zipper. \u201cHow long are we going to f**k tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you want.\u201d I palmed her br**sts through her shirt, slipping a hand underneath her bra.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh...\u201d She murmured as I caressed her nipple.</p> <p>The elevator doors slid open quickly, but our bodies remained entwined as we found our way to the suite. Her lips latched onto mine again as we stumbled into the room\u2014bumping into the lamps and the dressers.</p><p>She was moaning louder now, barely controlling herself as I unzipped her dress and unclasped her bra.</p><p>I felt her hands at my waist\u2014pushing my pants to the floor, and when my back hit the wall, I realized she was on her knees in front of me.</p><p>Leaning forward, she rubbed her hands up and down my cock, asking me to tell her how badly I wanted her mouth on me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d I shook my head as I realized I had been fantasizing about Aubrey the entire time.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even going to beg for it?\u201d She smiled, bringing her head closer.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d I grabbed her by her hair and gently pushed her away.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong, Thoreau? Did you want to do me first instead? Should I get on the bed or the chair?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t make out the rest of her questions; images of Aubrey were clouding my brain, invading all my senses. And the more I stared at this woman, a woman who was nowhere near as beautiful as Aubrey, the more I felt my c**k softening.</p><p>Fuck...</p><p>I pulled my pants up and zipped the fly. \u201cI no longer feel like f**king you. You can leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d She sucked in a breath and crossed her arms. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said that I don\u2019t feel like f**king you.\u201d I spoke slowly. \u201cAnd that you can leave. Enjoy the rest of your night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to put me out? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to reserve another room for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the man I met online?\u201d She stood up. \u201cWas that all a front? Is this some type of game where you take out women, say sexy things you\u2019ve probably read off the internet, and then make them get naked knowing damn well that you don\u2019t know how to f**k?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI definitely know how to f**k.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at her. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like f**king you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...I can\u2019t believe...\u201d Her jaw dropped. \u201cYou\u2019re a f**king ass**le!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole? Yes. Fucking? Unfortunately not. Can you make sure that the door is completely closed on your way out?\u201d</p> <p>She pulled her dress over her body and picked up her purse. \u201cI\u2019m putting a flag next to your profile on Date-Match. And you know what else? I\u2019m going to leave a review of our encounter, too. I\u2019m going to make sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you normally talk as you get dressed?\u201d I cut her off and took a seat on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t require conversation.\u201d</p><p>Fuming, she slipped into her shoes and rushed out of the room\u2014slamming the door behind her.</p><p>I waited until I heard the ping of the elevator and lay across the mattress. I tried my best to think of something or someone other than Aubrey, but she was all that came to mind.</p><p>What the f**k is happening?</p><p>I stared at the ceiling for another hour, unable to take my mind off of how her mouth felt against mine at the office earlier today. Even if it was only for a few seconds.</p><p>Needing to get to the bottom of this, I pulled my phone out of my pocket and called her.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d She answered on the second ring. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you buy me that watch, Aubrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, but I read the inscription on the back.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I can ask you a few things first...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly be so adamant about honesty when you haven\u2019t been completely honest with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been completely honest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to believe that your name isn\u2019t really Andrew Hamilton...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re still stalking me and my past online? Do you not have any other hobbies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is EH?\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cWhy are those two letters hanging on all your walls? Why are they engraved in all of your cufflinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you and Ava? I saw her walk out of your office last week, and she smirked at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She was breathing hard. \u201cThis is a very bad time. Why don\u2019t you just hang up and go to the Marriott so you can f**k someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am at the Marriott, and I was actually about to f**k someone else.\u201d</p><p>She was silent for several seconds. \u201cI don\u2019t... I don\u2019t want to hear from you anymore, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I don\u2019t want to hear from you anymore. Don\u2019t you ever f**king call me again.\u201d She hung up.</p><p>Impasse (n.):</p><p>The inability of two parties to reach a negotiated settlement.</p><p>A few days later...</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>My heart was still aching\u2014reeling, and although I\u2019d told Andrew never to call me again, and that I didn\u2019t want to hear from him, I couldn\u2019t move on until I received an apology.</p><p>I needed it...</p><p>I felt sick to my stomach after giving him that watch, and I\u2019d foolishly expected for him to call and say, \u201cI love you, too,\u201d but he acted as if it meant nothing.</p><p>Without knocking, I opened the door to his office and shut it behind me.</p><p>He raised his eyebrow as I stepped over to his desk, but he didn\u2019t hang up his phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, that will be fine,\u201d he spoke into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d I blurted out. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for me to take a seat, but he continued talking. \u201cYes. That will work as well.\u201d</p><p>I sat and crossed my arms, trying not to stare at him too hard. He was utter perfection today\u2014looking more f**k-able than usual with a fresh hair-cut and a brand new grey suit. His eyes regarded me intensely as usual, and I noticed he was actually wearing the watch I gave him. He\u2019d even paired it with matching cufflinks.</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m overreacting after all...</p><p>\u201cRight...\u201d He leaned back in his chair and typed a few things onto his keyboard. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at eight o\u2019clock tonight, Sandra. Room 225.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cSomething I can help you with, Miss Everhart?\u201d He hung up the phone. \u201cIs there any reason why you barged into my office without knocking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve f**ked someone else already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a serious question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you f**k someone else already? Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would f**king matter...\u201d My blood boiled as I stood up. \u201cDid you sleep with someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me and stood up too, walking over to me. \u201cHowever, I really don\u2019t see how that\u2019s any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his wrist. \u201cWhy are you wearing that watch if you don\u2019t feel the same way I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only watch that matches my new cufflinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously this blind?\u201d There were tears welling in my eyes. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you a long time ago that I don\u2019t do feelings\u2014that if we ever did f**k, that would be the end of us.\u201d He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cHowever, I do realize that by crossing the line with you, personally and professionally, that a percentage of the blame is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA percentage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to bring in the firm\u2019s accountant? I\u2019m sure he can work out the exact figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d I was on the verge of losing it.</p><p>\u201cSince we did break the boundaries, and we were in fact friends before, I\u2019m willing to revert to that arrangement.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head as he tilted my chin up and looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe can still talk on the phone at night,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can tell me about your ballet, your parents, your life...And, to be sensitive to your feelings, I\u2019ll tell you about my life but I\u2019ll leave out my one night stands until you\u2019re completely over whatever the hell you think we had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that I loved you...\u201d The words rushed out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really be this callous and cold of a person, Andrew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say, Aubrey?\u201d His tone changed. \u201cYour pu**y was so magical that it opened my eyes and made me want to change all my ways for you? That I can\u2019t live or breathe without knowing that you\u2019re by my side? Is that what you\u2019re expecting me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I tried not to cry. \u201cA simple apology for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKicking your inquisitive ass out of my apartment?\u201d He was glaring at me. \u201cFor trying to prevent you from feeling like you do right now? Fine. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it sooner.\u201d</p><p>I resisted the urge to spit in his face and stepped back. I officially despised him. \u201cYou are so not the man I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m sure that man is quite pathetic.\u201d He briefly shut his eyes and sighed. \u201cLook, Aubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Everhart.\u201d I hissed as I walked toward the door. \u201cMiss. Fucking. Everhart. But not to worry, you\u2019ll never have to worry about using it because you won\u2019t be seeing me again.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door so hard it rattled the windows on the other side of the hall. I ignored the suspicious look from Jessica as I stormed to the parking lot, and sped all the way to the bank.</p><p>I withdrew every dollar out of my savings account, and called the bus depot downtown\u2014asking what the fare was for a one-way ticket to New York City.</p><p>\u201cThat would be seventy nine eighty six,\u201d the operator said. \u201cIt\u2019s ten dollars cheaper if you buy a roundtrip ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be needing a round trip ticket.\u201d I steered my car into my apartment\u2019s lot. \u201cCan you tell me when the next bus leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. Would you like me to book that for you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I recited my credit card info from memory, and listened as she told me about how I needed to take a walk on the Brooklyn Bridge whenever I had the chance.</p><p>The second I hung up, I arranged for a cab and sent a quick text to my roommate:</p><p>Something has come up and I have to move out ASAP...I\u2019ll be wiring my half of the remaining rent to our landlord, and I\u2019ll find a way to have my belongings shipped to me. I\u2019m leaving my keys under that rose plant in the laundry room\u2014Aubrey.</p><p>Grabbing two large suitcases from my closet, I stuffed them with whatever I could find, and placed Mr. Petrova\u2019s recommendation letter into my purse.</p><p>As I was writing myself a reminder (\u201cThat ass**le still has my panties...Need to shop for more.\u201d), my mother called.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Aubrey?\u201d she said.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better.\u201d There was a smile in her voice. \u201cWhat time should I expect you at The Grove tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever.

Did you not hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to hold back for the past few weeks, but you know what? I am sick and tired of you being so damn thoughtless and selfish about your father\u2019s aspirations. Neither of us personally give a damn about your thoughts on the election, but since you\u2019re a member of this family, I demand that you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d I hung up and continued packing, even faster now.</p><p>Subject: Cab.</p><p>Miss Aubrey Everhart,</p><p>Your cab has arrived at the address you specified. It will wait for exactly five minutes.</p><p>\u2014Durham Cab Co.</p> <p>I rushed into the bathroom and filled a plastic bag with toiletries, and then I placed them into my suitcase and headed outside.</p><p>\u201cBus station, right?\u201d The cab driver, a woman, smiled as I approached.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>She took my bags and placed them into the trunk as I slid into the backseat. I felt my heart hurting with every second that passed, and as much as I tried to block out the thoughts about Andrew, images of his face infiltrated my brain anyway.</p><p>I was picturing the last full night we spent together, the night before he kicked me out of his condo, and no matter how hard I tried to make sense of what happened the very next night, I couldn\u2019t. All I could do was cry.</p><p>My phone vibrated against my knee and I flipped it over, hoping to see Mr. Petrova\u2019s name, but it was Andrew.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have ballet practice on Wednesdays...Shouldn\u2019t you know that by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were actually in ballet practice you wouldn\u2019t be picking up your phone.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d He sounded concerned. \u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I lied, turning up the volume on my car radio.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop f**king lying to me, Aubrey,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got sent home from practice today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no \u2018And\u2019 about this...\u201d Tears welled in my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been sent home before. He made me feel like shit today. He even told the understudy to be prepared to take my place right in front of me, and then he told me not to come back until next week...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you the reason why he does that. Why don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I really was bad today,\u201d I admitted. \u201cMy feet are swollen and I didn\u2019t bandage them properly, so I was off by an eighth of a count for most of the day...\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were still ten times better than everyone else. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come over tonight?\u201d I cut him off, hoping for a yes, but all I heard was silence. I knew I\u2019d pushed my luck the first couple nights we spent together, but I didn\u2019t want it to be a rare thing. I wanted more.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to give me an answer, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can come over. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside your door.\u201d</p><p>He opened it seconds later and looked me up and down, raising his eyebrow. \u201cI would\u2019ve picked you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost asked you to...\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand and pulled me inside, keeping his eyes locked on mine. As the door shut, he pulled me into his arms and shook his head at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Aubrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep insisting on breaking every rule I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep letting me?\u201d</p><p>Without saying another word, his lips were on mine and his hands were sliding around my waist\u2014deftly unbuttoning my skirt, quickly pushing it down to the floor.</p><p>His hands grazed my backside, searching for my panties, but there were none.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to return your collection.\u201d He laughed softly and led me over to the couch.</p><p>He dropped my hand and then he sat on the floor, looking up at me. Unzipping his pants, he pulled out a condom and slowly rolled it over his cock.</p><p>I started to bend low so I could sit next to him, but he grabbed my thighs.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to sit on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked over my shoulder. \u201cDo you want me to sit on the coffee table?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d He trailed his fingers up my legs. \u201cOn my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit your pu**y on my face.\u201d</p><p>I stood still, speechless\u2014unable to process what he\u2019d just asked me to do.</p><p>Smirking, he pulled me close and tapped my left leg. \u201cLift that onto the pillow behind me.\u201d He commanded me with his eyes and I slowly lifted my foot and pressed it into the cushion.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He rubbed his hands along the inside of my thighs, blowing kisses against my skin. \u201cGrab onto my hair...\u201d</p><p>My hands found their way onto his head as he slipped two fingers inside of me, as he slowly moved them in and out.</p><p>He darted his tongue against my clit and groaned. \u201cAre you actually going to follow my directions today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to be as still as possible.\u201d One of his hands cupped my ass, palming it as he continued to stretch my pu**y with his fingers. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, letting a low moan escape my mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d He didn\u2019t give me chance to answer. He drew my swollen clit into his mouth, instantly making my knees buckle beneath me.</p><p>Shutting my eyes, I screamed as he gripped my hips and slightly rocked me against his mouth\u2014licking every part of me with his tongue, lapping up every drop.</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d I could barely hear my own voice. \u201cAndrew...\u201d</p><p>My right leg lost its hold on the floor and I nearly fell forward, but he grabbed me and held me still\u2014not moving his mouth away.</p><p>I pulled his hair hard, begging him to slow down, to let me attempt to control the pace, but it was no use.</p><p>He continued to f**k me with his mouth, ignoring my every scream.</p><p>As my hips jerked and quivers began to race through my body, he wrapped his arms around my legs and slowly pulled me down, lowering me onto his cock.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh....\u201d I breathed as he buried himself inch by inch. \u201cI...I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, what?\u201d He kissed my forehead once he was entirely inside of me. \u201cDo you not want to ride me this way? Would you prefer if I bent you over?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, and he covered one of my ni**les with his mouth, swirling his tongue around it until it hardened.</p><p>Without him telling me to, I wrapped my arms around his neck and moved myself up and down his cock.</p><p>\u201cHarder...\u201d He bit my neck. \u201cI want you to f**k me as hard as I f**k you...\u201d</p><p>I grinded my hips into him again and again, as forceful as I could, but he grabbed me and began thrusting his own hips up from the floor.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, I\u2019m going to cum...\u201d I cried out as he completely took over. \u201cI\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slapped my ass as my body finally gave in, as his gave in, too.</p><p>Breathless, I leaned against his chest, but he didn\u2019t let me rest long. He eased me out of his lap and stood up\u2014walking off to toss away the condom.</p><p>Heading back over to me, he scooped me into his arms and carried me into his bedroom, gently lowering me onto his sheets.</p><p>I rolled over to the side of the bed I preferred\u2014the side by the window, and waited for him to lay next to me, but he didn\u2019t. He took a seat near the edge of the bed and lifted my feet into his lap.</p><p>I was too tired to ask him what he was doing, and the next thing I felt was a warm, soothing liquid dripping onto my skin. Then I felt his hands slowly spreading it around the places where the swelling hurt the most.</p><p>I moaned as his fingers massaged my soles, said his name as his fingers caressed every tender spot.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he whispered, rendering me speechless as he continued to soothe me.</p><p>Every few minutes, he looked back at me and asked, \u201cWould you like me to stop?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and kept my eyes shut, relishing every moment of this.</p><p>After what felt like hours of bliss, after he\u2019d given me the best foot massage I\u2019d ever had, he climbed in bed next to me and pulled me against his chest.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Aubrey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI hope you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Elated, I threaded my fingers through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to insist on taking me home tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless you keep talking.\u201d He growled. \u201cGo to sleep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for the foot massage...That was really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking, Aubrey.\u201d He rolled me on top of him. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just saying thank you. I can\u2019t say thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pressed his lips against mine and kissed me until I couldn\u2019t breathe, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t make me f**k you to sleep,\u201d in between breaths.</p><p>I attempted to roll over, but his grip was too strong.</p><p>Smiling, I positioned my head against his heartbeat and whispered, \u201cCan you hear me? Are you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Just deep, sleeping breaths.</p><p>I hesitated a few seconds. \u201cI love you...\u201d</p><p>Foreseeable Risk (n.):</p><p>A danger which a reasonable person should anticipate as the result from his/her actions.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cJessica!\u201d I glanced at the slightly normal looking cup of coffee on my desk.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you ask Miss Everhart to come in here, please?\u201d I needed to see her face.</p><p>She\u2019d been avoiding me all week, and if all I had to say was \u201csorry\u201d\u2014whether I actually meant it or not, it was worth it. I missed seeing her seductive mouth in the mornings, remembering how it felt when she pressed it against mine.</p><p>\u201cI would do that,\u201d Jessica said, \u201cbut seeing as though she put in her resignation letter last week, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe quit?\u201d</p><p>Without telling me?</p><p>Jessica raised her eyebrow. \u201cShe did. I gave you the letter she left, too. It was quite interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never got a letter.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to my desk and sifted through the clutter.</p><p>\u201cHere it is,\u201d she said. \u201cShe left you two letters...Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side and tapped her lip, looking as if she wanted to say something, but she smiled and left the room.</p><p>Locking the door, I tore the first letter open and read it.</p><p>Dear GBH,</p><p>Thank you very much for hiring me as your undergraduate intern. I\u2019ve had quite the experience working for you and am honored by all I\u2019ve learned.

There was no conversation outside of tempo counts, no questions were allowed either. On top of that, the company\u2019s pianist only elected to play the accompanying music at full speed, never slowing down to make the learning process easier.</p><p>There were hundreds of girls vying for a place in the company, and from what I gathered from conversations here or there, most of them were already professionals.</p><p>I didn\u2019t let that deter me, though.</p><p>When the grueling practices came to an end, I took that chance to find a new place in the city to dance on my own: A rooftop in view of Times Square, an abandoned historical store on the Upper East Side, or in front of bookstore windows in the West End.</p><p>Despite my immediate love for this city, it wasn\u2019t enough to distract me from my heartbreak. Nor was it enough to distract me from the fact that today, official audition day, I was late.</p> <p>Sweating, I jumped off the subway and ran down Sixty Sixth Street\u2014paying no mind to my burning lungs.</p><p>Keep going...Keep going...</p><p>A man to my left stepped out of a cab and I immediately jumped in.</p><p>\u201cLincoln Center, please!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right up the street.\u201d The driver looked at me through the rearview mirror, confused.</p><p>\u201cPlease?

I took out my makeup and applied it the best I could, and as we approached the curb, I tossed a ten dollar bill at the driver and jumped out of the car.</p><p>Rushing into the building, I headed straight for the theater, relieved that one of the directors was still standing outside the doors.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She looked me up and down as I approached. \u201cMay I help you with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the auditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the nine o\u2019clock auditions?\u201d She looked at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s nine fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry...I called an hour ago and said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first cab broke down? That was you?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded.</p><p>She studied me for a few more seconds\u2014pursing her lips. Then she opened the door. \u201cYou can change into your whites in the dressing room. Hurry up.\u201d</p><p>The door shut behind me before I could ask what she meant by \u201c[my] whites,\u201d but as my eyes scanned the stage, I realized that every dancer was dressed in a white leotard and matching tutu.</p><p>Shit...</p><p>My cheeks heated as I looked over my outfit. I didn\u2019t have my whites in my bag. They were at home.</p><p>Nearing the stage, I set my bag in a chair and tried to ignore that dread that was building inside my chest. I just needed to focus on giving it my all during this routine. That was it.</p><p>I found an open spot onstage and stretched my arms\u2014noticing the smirks and whispers that were being thrown in my direction.</p><p>Undaunted, I smiled at anyone who made eye contact and continued my routine.</p><p>\u201cMay I have your attention, please?\u201d A man\u2019s voice came over the speaker. \u201cCan everyone stop stretching and make your way to the edge of the stage, please?\u201d</p><p>I set my leg down and followed the crowd, finding a spot on the end.</p><p>The man addressing us was a tall grey haired man with wiry glasses, and he was the definition of the word \u201clegend\u201d: His name was Arnold G. Ashcroft, and I\u2019d followed him and his choreography for years. He was once the most sought after specialist in the world, but when he dropped in the rankings, it was only to his Russian rival: Paul Petrova.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to see such a huge turnout for this session of auditions,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know, due to a series of unfortunate events, we are overhauling our entire staff. That said, we are keeping our current production schedule as is, which means we will be filling in the roles of principle dancers, soloists, and corps members within the next fourteen days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRehearsals will be long and hard\u2014four to ten, midnight if need be, and there will be no room for excuses or...\u201d He looked me up and down, frowning at my attire. \u201cMistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first round of six. You will be told of your status once the music stops, and if you are sent home, please don\u2019t hesitate to try again next year. I see a lot of failures from last summer, so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ve learned something between then and now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this round, we\u2019ll do a portion of the Balanchine routine in groups of eight. You may stretch for a few minutes and then we will begin.\u201d</p><p>He waved at the man who was taking his seat at the piano, and then he turned around and gave a thumbs up to three people who were sitting in the judge\u2019s seats. Smiling, he ascended the stage\u2019s steps, and greeted a few familiar faces.</p><p>I made my way over and tapped his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d He turned around.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I withered under his intense glare.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Ashcroft. My name is Aubrey Everhart and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate.\u201d He cut me off. \u201cYou\u2019re also the only performer who isn\u2019t wearing the mandatory white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d I stammered. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know if you would allow me to go home and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would I allow that, Miss Everhart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can audition with the group this afternoon and be judged fairly. I just think that I\u2019ve already\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d He pressed a pen against my lips. \u201cLadies, may I please have your attention?\u201d</p><p>An immediate silence fell over the theater.</p><p>\u201cI want you all to meet Aubrey Everhart.\u201d He smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s just informed me that due to the fact that she was late and decided to wear improper attire to her audition today, that there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll be judged unfairly.\u201d</p><p>The ballerina across from me folded her arms.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the world of ballet is fair and has always been about catering to the needs of the unprepared, is there anyone who would have a problem if I allowed Miss Everhart to go home, change, and return for the auditions at six?\u201d</p><p>Every dancer on stage raised her hand into the air.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d His tone was cold. \u201cIf you think a wrongly colored tutu is going to affect how well you perform, you should leave right now.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, wishing I could disappear.</p><p>\u201cYou can dance in the first group.\u201d He shook his head at me and walked away.</p><p>Disregarding the soft snickering from the other girls, I returned to my former spot on stage and stretched once more. I tried to block out everything that had gone wrong this morning and pretended that I was in Durham again\u2014dancing for one of the best directors in the world.</p><p>\u201cMiss Everhart?\u201d A woman said my name, snapping me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take your place at center stage with everyone else, or do you need more time to find it?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the judge\u2019s table and stepped into the line.</p><p>The woman signaled to the pianist and he played the B-flat scale before starting the piece. As his fingers forced the notes, my arms went high above my head and I slowly spun around on my toes\u2014wincing as my right pointe slipper cracked.</p><p>I ignored the pain and continued the routine. Terribly.</p><p>Each time I attempted a jump, I landed off balance and slipped an eighth of a count behind everyone else. My turns were awkward\u2014frantically paced, and my pointe work was so choppy that I bumped into the girl next to me.</p><p>Embarrassed, I murmured sorry and spun around, but I lost my balance and fell onto the stage. Headfirst.</p><p>I ignored the loud outburst of laughter from the dancers in the audience and stood up, attempting to fall back into the routine.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Mr. Ashcroft bellowed from the side of the stage, making the notes come to an end.</p><p>He walked in front of our line and stepped directly in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI just looked through your file, Miss Everhart.\u201d He looked unimpressed. \u201cYou recently studied under Mr. Petrova?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cUse your words, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wrote an actual recommendation letter on your behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in utter disbelief. Shock. \u201cYou expect me to believe that when you dance so stiffly? When you\u2019re a count behind each and every step?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d My voice was a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWell...At least you can always say that you studied under one of the greatest choreographers of all time. You can leave my theater now.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good fit for our company. We\u2019ll email you this evening with a link to purchase discounted tickets for the season\u2019s shows.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down my face, and as if he could see that he\u2019d just broken my heart, he patted my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can tell that you\u2019ve had training,\u201d he said. \u201cVery good training. And I can see that you have potential, but we\u2019re not interested in potential here. For the rest of you, congratulations! You\u2019ve earned yourselves a spot in the next round of auditions. Now, please clear the stage so the next group of dancers may perform.\u201d</p><p>A loud applause arose from the hopefuls in the audience, and I felt as if I was watching my life fall apart in front of me. Hurt, I followed the dancers to the side steps\u2014unsure of what to do next.</p><p>Grabbing my bag, I avoided the pathetic glances of the hopefuls and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cThat just goes to show you,\u201d Mr. Ashcroft said to the other panelists, laughing, \u201ceven Petrova picks duds sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I turned around.</p><p>Enraged, I marched up the stage\u2019s steps and took a seat on the white line. I untied my right slipper and prepared another one\u2014bending it forward and backward until it felt right.</p><p>\u201cYou can change your shoes in the restroom, Miss Everhart.\u201d Mr. Ashcroft chided. \u201cThe stage is for actual performers. Or did Petrova not teach you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need another chance,\u201d I said. \u201cJust because I didn\u2019t nail the Balanchine piece that doesn\u2019t make me a bad dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t, honey.\u201d He mocked me. \u201cIt makes you a failed dancer, who is currently using my stage and sucking up precious audition time for those who might actually make the cut in my company.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to the pianist. \u201cTchaikovsky, Swan Lake. Act two, scene fourteen. Do you know that piece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d He looked confused.</p><p>\u201cDo you know it or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d He pointed to another judge who was now standing and crossing her arms.</p><p>\u201cCould you please play it?\u201d I pleaded with my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s only three minutes long.\u201d</p><p>He let out a sigh and straightened his back, strumming the keys of the piano. With no count off, he played the first few notes of the concerto and the softs sounds echoed off the theater\u2019s walls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMiss Everhart, you\u2019re wasting everyone\u2019s time...\u201d Mr. Ashcroft\u2019s face turned red as I slipped into fifth position.</p><p>I could hear him sighing and tsk-ing, could hear the other hopefuls murmuring, but as I twirled around the stage and transitioned from an arabesque to a grand jete, their talking stopped.</p><p>The notes lingered longer\u2014darker, as the song progressed and I made sure each motion of my hands was smooth and graceful. As I leapt across the stage and completed a series of perfect pirouettes, I could see Mr. Ashcroft rubbing his chin.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was in a trance and I was dancing in the middle of Times Square, underneath flashing lights and a star-filled sky.</p> <p>I continued dancing long after the last note, humming the additional refrain that most pianists ignored, and I ended by leaning forward on my left leg\u2014holding my right one in the air behind me.</p><p>The panelists stared back at me. Their faces expressionless.</p><p>\u201cAre you done, Miss Everhart?\u201d Mr. Ashcroft asked.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, get the hell off my stage.\u201d</p> <p>I stood upright and bit my lip to prevent myself from breaking down in front of them.</p><p>\u201cThank you very much for the opportunity...\u201d I grabbed my bag and rushed off stage\u2014running down the hallway and outside the building.</p><p>I stopped in front of a trashcan and bent over, waiting for the inevitable vomit.</p><p>Deep down I knew that I was a good dancer\u2014that I\u2019d just danced my heart out, and I honestly felt like I deserved a second chance.</p><p>The thought of failing had never crossed my mind when I signed up for this audition, and the option of returning to Durham was too painful to bear.</p><p>Heaving, I tearfully weighed my options: 1) Go home and rejoin Mr. Petrova\u2019s dance program. 2) Go back inside and tell the panel they\u2019re all f**king idiots, or\u2014</p> <p>\u201cMiss Everhart?\u201d Someone tapped my shoulder.</p><p>I spun around, finding myself face to face with a stoic Mr. Ashcroft.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I wiped my face on my sleeve and forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat you just did on stage was rude, unprofessional, and horrible. It was the worst thing I have ever seen a prospective dancer do and I didn\u2019t appreciate it all...That said, be here on time for the second round next week.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped and I didn\u2019t get a chance to scream or say thank you.</p><p>He was already gone.</p><p>I pulled out my phone, anxious to tell someone that I\u2019d made it to the next round, but I had no one to call.</p><p>All I had were angry texts from my parents, tons of their missed calls, and I knew better than to reach out to them right now. They didn\u2019t really give a damn.</p> <p>I searched for Mr. Petrova\u2019s number\u2014hoping I\u2019d saved it, but an email from Andrew appeared on my screen.</p><p>Subject: Your Resignation.</p><p>I was tempted to open it, but my heart wouldn\u2019t let me do it. He was the main reason why I fled here, and I didn\u2019t need him intruding on my new life.</p><p>I deleted his message and decided that I wasn\u2019t going to think about him anymore. All that mattered now was ballet.</p><p>Months later...</p><p>Rebuttal (n.):</p><p>Evidence introduced to counter, disprove or contradict the opposition's evidence or a presumption, or responsive legal argument.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>The fall season came and went, taking the changing leaves and amber sunsets with it. New interns filled the positions at GBH, new cases and clients packed the calendars, and as winter enveloped the city, one thing remained clear: Durham was only one step above the shit ladder when compared to New York City.</p><p>At least when it came to the winter, anyway.</p><p>This was the coldest winter the city had experienced, and since it was a Southern town, they were ill-prepared. The courtroom I was currently sitting in featured blankets lined against the windows instead of proper insulation, and there were space heaters jutting from every outlet.</p><p>There were few salt trucks available to control the icy streets, even fewer people who actually knew how to drive in such weather, and for whatever reason, there were no more suitable women available.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d Mr. Bach tapped my shoulder. \u201cThe prosecution is done with the witness...Are you going to redirect? That last line might have influenced the jury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermission to redirect, Your Honor.\u201d I stood up from the table.</p><p>The judge nodded and I stared at the woman on the stand. She\u2019d been lying through her teeth since this trial began and I\u2019d had enough.</p><p>\u201cMiss Everhart\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cI mean, Miss Everly, do you believe that leaving your husband in his time of need was what was best for your company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI told you that during our first meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou told me that you loved him and that your sole reasoning for leaving him was because you thought he didn\u2019t love you back. Is that not true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, because he didn\u2019t say that he loved you on your terms, because he told you he was actually incapable of loving you that way, you decided to leave him. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I left him because he was spending the company\u2019s money on unnecessary things and cheating on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever think about his feelings?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you think to simply ask if your leaving would affect him\u2014whether you were on good terms or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was...\u201d She was breaking down. \u201cHe was cheating on me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he? Or did you just want more than what he was willing to give you emotionally, Miss Everly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that you could be making all of this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, never. I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that you\u2019re a f**king liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrder! Order!\u201d The judge banged her gavel and the jury gasped.</p><p>\u201cCounsel, my chambers. NOW!\u201d</p><p>I stared at the fake tears falling down Miss Everly\u2019s face. This case was a wrap.</p><p>I walked into the judge\u2019s chambers and shut the door. \u201cYes, Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your goddamn mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just called your own witness a f**king liar.\u201d</p><p>I looked through the window, seeing that the bailiff was handing her a box of Kleenex.</p><p>\u201cAre you on a new prescription?\u201d she asked. \u201cDrinking? Smoking something other than Cubans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m having one bad day in court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve had several bad days in court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall calling any of my other witnesses f**king liars...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called for an objection during the reading of a verdict.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t like the sound of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you never mess up in my court.\u201d She paused. \u201cEver...Please go get yourself checked out, Mr. Hamilton. I\u2019d really hate to be the judge presiding over your very first loss.\u201d</p><p>She motioned for me to follow her out of her chambers. She took a seat in her chair and announced that the current trial was being postponed due to a rare rule brought up by the defense, and that we would reconvene two weeks from now.</p><p>Relieved, I closed my briefcase and ignored a red-faced Miss Everly.</p><p>\u201cMr. Bach,\u201d she said, glaring at me, \u201cI would really like for us to win this case, so could you please\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already taken care of,\u201d he said, cutting her off. \u201cNo worries.\u201d He gave her a reassuring smile and asked Mr. Greenwood to walk her out to her car. Then he turned and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, Andrew, Andrew...\u201d He sighed. \u201cI think you need some time off. I\u2019ll take over this case, alright? And Mr. Greenwood and I will be in contact with any of your clients who have cases within the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s one f**king case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne f**king case that you\u2019re on the verge of losing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He patted me on the shoulder. \u201cGo home, Andrew. You\u2019ve actually never taken a vacation anyway. Maybe it\u2019s what you need right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I grabbed my briefcase. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the Reber consultation tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>He called after me, but I ignored him. I sped back to GBH, prepared to immerse myself in more work. I was avoiding my condo as much as possible lately; I could hardly stand to be there.</p><p>Unopened condoms lined my wet bar\u2014a reminder of how long it\u2019d been since I had pu**y, empty liquor bottles lined all of my window sills, and my Cuban cigar selection was long gone.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d the main secretary asked as I walked through the firm\u2019s doors.</p><p>I ignored her. Too many people were asking me that question lately and I was tired of hearing it.</p><p>I shut myself inside my office and pulled my phone\u2019s chord out of the wall. I didn\u2019t need any distractions.</p><p>For the rest of the morning, I read over my files in utter silence\u2014not even answering emails from my own clients.</p><p>\u201cJessica!\u201d I called her once the clock struck noon. \u201cJessica!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d She walked in right away.</p><p>\u201cIs there any reason why you suddenly decided to stop organizing my case files by date?\u201d I slid a folder across the desk. \u201cAny reason why you\u2019ve decided to stop doing your goddamn job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I actually have time to organize all your case files by date? Do you know how long that takes?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cThat was Miss Everhart\u2019s idea. I told her it was a waste of time, but I guess not. If I have some free hours in between the Doherty case next week I\u2019ll try to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I ignored the fact that my heart skipped a beat when she said Miss Everhart. \u201cYou can get out of my office now.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the papers from the file and began reorganizing them. As I clipped all of the witness testimonies together, Jessica cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cYou miss her, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d My head shot up.</p><p>\u201cAubrey,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cYou miss her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I said nothing. I just watched as she sauntered over to me, slowly raising the sides of her skirt to show that she wasn\u2019t wearing anything underneath.</p><p>Smiling, she picked up my coffee cup and took a long, dramatic sip.</p><p>\u201cJessica...\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to admit to it.\u201d She plopped her bare ass atop my desk. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that you haven\u2019t been yourself for quite a while...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your ass cheeks touching my desk right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even insult me the normal way that you used to,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually miss that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out a box of Clorox wipes.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t stay in her old apartment anymore, you know. I think she moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I care about where an ex-employee lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the address you gave me for that envelope and red box delivery belonged to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was for an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well...\u201d She slid off my desk. \u201cYour old friend must share an address with Aubrey Everhart because I pulled up her records from HR and she definitely stayed there.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI thought so.\u201d She smirked. \u201cSo, since you and I are so close\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are not close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my duty as a friend to let you know that you\u2019re really letting yourself go...\u201d She actually looked saddened. \u201cYou\u2019re not shaving, you\u2019re coming to work every morning reeking of alcohol, and you\u2019re barely yelling at the interns...I haven\u2019t had a wet dream about you in a very long time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rolled my eyes and stood up, wiping the part of my desk where her ass had been.</p><p>\u201cBut, since I know your secret about Aubrey now, you can know one of mine,\u201d she said, lowering her voice. \u201cSometimes, in the mornings, when she would bring you your coffee and shut the door, I would stand outside and listen...\u201d Her eyes lit up. \u201cAnd I would just pretend that it was me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend what was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey,\u201d she said. \u201cClearly she was good enough for you to break the \u2018I don\u2019t f**k my employees\u2019 rule.\u201d She stepped toward the door. \u201cI knew the second she started here that you liked her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cBut I do know that the second she quit, you\u2019ve been a shell of yourself. You have yet to realize that you\u2019ve been wearing the same blue suit for two weeks straight.\u201d</p><p>I took a long swig of scotch from the bottle, numbly staring at the images that were playing on my television screen. A little blond girl playing in the rain\u2014stomping her red boots in every puddle she could find.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go, Emma...\u201d</p><p>I winced at hearing the sound of my old voice, but I continued watching the scene.</p> <p>\u201cFive more minutes!\u201d She begged with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what that means. You\u2019ve just heard me say it...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive more minutes!\u201d She jumped into another puddle, laughing. \u201cFive more minutes, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain all week. Don\u2019t you want to go home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She stomped her feet in a puddle again, splashing me. And then she smiled innocently into the camera before running away\u2014begging me to chase her.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t bear to watch anymore. I turned off the TV and knocked the DVD player to the floor.</p> <p>Fuck...</p><p>Walking down the hallway, I straightened the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d frames that hung on the wall\u2014trying my best not to look too hard.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to make myself another drink tonight. I needed someone to talk to.</p><p>I grabbed my phone from the night-stand, scrolling down my contacts for the one person who\u2019d once kept the nightmares at bay. Aubrey.</p><p>It rang four times and went to voicemail.</p><p>\u201cHi. You\u2019ve reached Aubrey Everhart,\u201d it said. \u201cI\u2019m unable to take your call right now, but if you leave your name and number I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>The second the beep sounded I hung up. Then I called again, just to listen to that small snippet of her voice. I told myself that I wasn\u2019t being pathetic by calling her five times\u2014knowing damn well that she wasn\u2019t there, but when I called the sixth time, she picked up.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she answered. \u201cAndrew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, Aubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Her voice was cold.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Andrew?\u201d she asked, even colder. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you pick up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d She ended the call.</p><p>I drew in a sharp breath, shocked that she hung up on me. I started to type up an email, chastising her for being so rude, but I noticed that she hadn\u2019t responded to my last three in months:</p><p>Subject: Your Resignation.</p><p>Even though the last two words of your resignation letter were ridiculous and unprofessional, I\u2019d like to take you up on your offer to f**k you.</p><p>Name the time.</p><p>\u2014Andrew.</p><p>Subject: My Suit.</p><p>Since you have yet to pick up your final check, should I assume that\u2019s your way of letting me keep it to replace the suit you ruined?</p><p>\u2014Andrew.</p><p>Subject: BALLET.</p><p>I stopped by your dance hall earlier. You weren\u2019t there.</p><p>Did you quit that, too?</p><p>\u2014Andrew.</p><p>I decided that I needed to replace her. Fast.</p><p>I grabbed my laptop from my nightstand and logged into LawyerChat, looking for another Alyssa-type.</p><p>I spent all night roaming the chat rooms, answering questions left and right\u2014gauging the personalities of the askers, but none of them grabbed me. Still, one woman who was listed as a high profile lawyer with ten years of experience seemed promising, so I clicked on her chat box.</p><p>\u201cIf you have ten years of experience, what could you possibly need help with on this site?\u201d I typed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never too old to learn new things...Why are you on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a replacement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trolling for an employee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just someone I can talk to and make cum occasionally.\u201d</p><p>She blocked me.</p><p>I tried talking to a few other women\u2014keeping my true words to myself, but ultimately they just wanted to use me for information. They weren\u2019t open to talking about anything else, and since LawyerChat had expanded its site recently, there seemed to be an influx of law students using it as a complaint board about their professors.</p><p>I shut the laptop and took another swig from my bottle\u2014immediately realizing that there was only one \u201cAlyssa-type\u201d: Aubrey...</p><p>Maybe I made a mistake...</p><p>Out the corner of my eye I spotted an envelope under the slit of my door. It hadn\u2019t been there when I first arrived home, and it hadn\u2019t been there a few hours ago when I ordered my dinner.</p><p>Confused, I walked over and picked it up.</p><p>It was an official court summons to testify in a New York hearing, but it wasn\u2019t addressed to my new name. It was addressed to Liam Henderson.</p><p>Remedy (n.):</p><p>The means to achieve justice in any matter in which legal rights are involved.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>The Firebird.</p><p>Jewels.</p><p>Swan Lake.</p><p>I wrote down the roles I wanted to audition for in my planner, smiling as I ran my hands across my acceptance letter for the umpteenth time. I had ten copies of it\u2014two of them were framed, seven were for inspiration whenever I was feeling down, and one was for my parents. (I just hadn\u2019t had the time or energy to draft an \u201cI f**king told you so\u201d letter to mail with it.)</p><p>I looked at the clock on my wall and checked my phone, trying to suppress the butterflies that were fluttering around my stomach.</p><p>The guy I was now dating, Brian\u2014a fellow dancer in the company, was supposed to call me with something important he wanted to talk about.</p><p>Ever since I met him, he\u2019d been trying his hardest to woo me\u2014taking me on dates in between rehearsals, joining me as I danced on rooftops and icy park benches. He was kind, sweet, funny, and the perfect example of what it meant to be a gentleman.</p><p>He was like the nice guy in the Old Hollywood movies, the type that held your hand for no reason at all, the type that walked you to your door and waited until you were completely inside before stepping away. He was the type that kissed you\u2014softly and tenderly, whispering that he liked your lips, but never taking things any further.</p><p>In other words, he was nothing like Andrew.</p><p>Nothing like.</p><p>Even though his kisses never left me panting and wet, and his touches never set my nerves on fire, he never made me feel like shit.</p><p>My phone vibrated and I looked at the screen. Brian.</p><p>\u201cDid you receive the roses I sent you today?\u201d</p><p>I grinned, looking over at the red and white blooms on my fireplace.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I texted back. \u201cThank you very much. I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI placed something else in the vase for you, too...You should use it to relax tonight. I\u2019ll be calling you after I get out of rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking forward to it.\u201d I added a smiley face at the end of my text and walked over to the vase, lifting the flowers up by their stems. There was a huge packet of pink bath beads and rose petals with a handwritten note across the front:</p><p>\u201cThe next time you take a bath...Think about me...</p><p>\u2014Brian\u201d</p><p>My heart fluttered and I couldn\u2019t help but want to immediately take him up on the idea. I slipped out of my clothes and headed into the bathroom, tossing the beads under rushing water.</p><p>As I let down my hair, I turned the volume on my ringer to the highest setting, and before I could set it down, I noticed a new email. Andrew.</p><p>My heart nearly jumped out of my chest, as it always did when one of his sporadic emails or calls graced my screen.</p><p>Everything in me told me not to open it, to continue ignoring him, and to let him feel just how alone and underappreciated I felt months ago, but I couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Subject: Thoreau &amp; Alyssa.</p><p>You once said that you missed when we were Thoreau and Alyssa because I supposedly treated you better. I don\u2019t think I treated you any differently. I just really wanted to f**k you. But when we did meet in person, I unfortunately wanted to f**k you even more.</p><p>I personally prefer us as \u201cAndrew &amp; Aubrey\u201d because on a night like tonight, when there\u2019s nothing I would rather do than f**k you against my balcony until you cum, at least I can actually picture what your pu**y feels like and no longer have to imagine.</p><p>Pick up the phone...</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>I shook my head and set the phone down, mentally erasing that message and stepping into the tub.</p><p>I lay back and let the hot water rise to my chest, exhaling as it warmed my skin.</p><p>It was becoming easier to avoid thinking about Andrew now that I was talking to Brian, but it was harder trying to force myself to forget. I still thought about him late at night when I was in my bed, often wishing he was inside of me.</p><p>Nonetheless, I wasn't running back to him and his ass**le-ish ways, and I would never allow him to come back to me.</p><p>Never.</p><p>I scrubbed myself clean with a soft loofah, trying my best to ignore the intense throbbing between my legs that always came when thinking about Andrew. I filled a ladle with water and poured it over my head\u2014unable to push away the thought of Andrew washing my hair in the tub, of him telling me to stand underneath the streams and hold the wall as he grabbed my waist and f**ked me from behind.</p><p>My fingers found their way to my clit as I remembered him bending me over the vanity in his bathroom, saying \u201cI need you to f**king take it...All of it...\u201d as he palmed my br**sts and kissed his way down my spine.</p><p>I rubbed my clit in circles\u2014shutting my eyes as I pictured his lips on mine, moaning as it swelled with every caress.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh....\u201d I felt my ni**les hardening as the water cooled, and I was close\u2014so close, to coming, but my phone rang.</p><p>Andrew?</p><p>I immediately stood up and wrapped myself in a robe, rushing to answer it\u2014telling myself that I could pick up his call \u201cjust this once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I held the phone up to my ear without looking at the screen.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d It was Brian.</p><p>\u201cHi...\u201d I sighed, trying to mask my discontent. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a bad time? You sound kind of upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset. I was just getting out of the bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well good,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you use the relaxation kit I bought you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you also think about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I lied, feeling slightly guilty. \u201cHow was rehearsal?\u201d</p><p>I walked to my dresser and slipped into a T-shirt, listening to him recount the many ways that Mr. Ashcroft was the devil reincarnate.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worse than Mr. Petrova.\u201d I pulled my hair into a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cWorse than Paul Petrova?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I\u2019ve seen that man\u2019s documentary, seen him make grown men cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe years ago. Don\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s still rude and overbearing, but he has a layer of softness that Mr. Ashcroft lacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cHow tired are you right now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot too tired, shockingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...I wanted to talk to you tonight because I needed to know if you wanted to try something new in our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I climbed into bed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone sex...\u201d His voice became deeper. \u201cHave you ever done that before?\u201d</p> <p>I held back a laugh and quickly took off my shirt, tossing it to the floor. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you want to do it with me? Like, right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I grabbed my vibrator from a box and slipped under the covers, happy that I wouldn\u2019t need to think about Andrew to have an orgasm anymore. \u201cYes, I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>\u201cWell, what? Are you there, Brian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was taking off my shorts.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cSo, what are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...I\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naked, Aubrey?\u201d He sounded as if he didn\u2019t believe me. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve had phone sex before? This is the part where you\u2019re supposed to tell me that you have on lingerie. Work with me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...I\u2019m wearing a black thong and a black\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not black. I don\u2019t like black. Try blue, navy blue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a navy blue thong and a blue bra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s more like it. Now, take off the panties with one hand.\u201d</p><p>I lay there motionless, not sure as to whether I should turn on my vibrator or not.</p><p>\u201cNow, imagine me...\u201d He groaned. \u201cImagine me impaling you with my cock\u2014so deep inside of you, so deep...\u201d</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>\u201cCan you picture it?\u201d His voice became hoarse. \u201cI need you to picture it...and touch your vagina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vagina. Touch it.\u201d</p> <p>I stood up and put on a pair of pajama pants.</p><p>\u201cAre you touching it, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh yeah...\u201d I pulled a sweater over my head. \u201cI\u2019m touching my vagina...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about me licking your folds? Running my tongue along your ass crack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrian, you\u2019re actually...\u201d I shook my head. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stroke you down real good with my tongue, babe. Then I\u2019m going to ram my c**k into you again and again\u2014never stopping even if you say no...You can\u2019t say no...\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a sheet of paper and crumpled it next to the phone. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you anymore, Brian...Reception in my bedroom is getting really bad....\u201d I hung up in the middle of his panting and scrolled through my old emails\u2014breaking down and reading the old messages from Andrew, the only man who could ever make me cum with words...</p><p>Whether I hated him or not, I needed a release and I knew this was the only way...</p><p>Stay (n.):</p><p>A court-ordered short-term delay in judicial proceedings.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d The flight attendant tapped my shoulder. \u201cAll of the other passengers have departed the plane sir. Thank you for flying first class, and I hope you enjoy New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d I stood up and grabbed my briefcase from the overhead bin.</p><p>I\u2019d tried to get out of coming here for weeks, but it was to no avail. The second I booked my ticket, I canceled all of my consultations and meetings, asked for an extension on my current case, and packed one suitcase. Just one.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to be in this city longer than a day, and I refused to even testify. I was going to submit a written testimony to the judge and immediately return to Durham.</p><p>As I walked through the airport, I noticed that a few things had changed, but not as much as I\u2019d hoped. People still walked at a breakneck pace, the air still reeked of failure, and the top newspaper was still The New York Times.</p><p>I placed a few dollars into the paper machine, twisting the key so it could spit out my copy, and then I flipped to the middle section where the justice pieces were kept.</p><p>There it was. Section C. The story that covered the entire page:</p><p>Another Hearing in the Ongoing Hart Trial:</p><p>Henderson to Testify This Week</p><p>I skimmed the article, slightly impressed that the journalist was writing facts this time and not smearing my name for the hell of it.</p><p>I also noticed there were still no pictures of me.</p><p>Figures...</p><p>\u201cOver here, Mr. Hamilton!\u201d A brunette waved as I stepped off the escalator. \u201cOver here!\u201d</p><p>I walked over and she held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rebecca Waters, lead attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d I offered her a firm shake. \u201cHow fast can we get to the judge\u2019s chambers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe judge\u2019s chambers?\u201d She raised her eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to check you into the hotel so we can discuss your testimony...You\u2019re supposed to stay here for a couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy return flight leaves in fifteen hours.\u201d</p><p>She looked shocked. \u201cYou only want to submit a written testimony? After all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find it quite impressive that you know how to listen and comprehend at the same time.\u201d I looked at my watch. \u201cWhere is the town car?\u201d</p><p>She groaned and led me down the bustling terminal, through the gates, and into the executive car lot. She was babbling about how \u201cimportant\u201d this case was, how it would finally close a chapter on my life, but I wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>My mind was literally counting the seconds I had left in this place.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sir.\u201d The driver grabbed my bag as we approached the car. \u201cI hope you enjoy your stay in New York City.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and slipped into the back seat, rolling my eyes when Rebecca sat next to me.</p><p>\u201cCould you at least stay for one night and think about this, Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cAndrew...I mean, Mr. Hamilton. Could you at least think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She pulled out her phone, and I looked out the window as the car coasted through the city.</p><p>I winced as we passed a billboard where my old firm once held an advertisement, shut my eyes when we passed Emma\u2019s favorite toy store.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton...\u201d Rebecca tapped my shoulder. \u201cAs a lawyer, I\u2019m sure you know how much more compelling an oral testimony can be over a written one. I am begging you to reconsider this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m begging you to get over it.\u201d I looked her directly in the eyes. \u201cHe and Ava ruined my life and I don\u2019t have shit to gain by sitting in a courtroom full of strangers and explaining how. You want an emotional testimony? Hire a f**king drama student to read my words to the jury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed. It\u2019s not like it was six years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why The New York Times still won\u2019t print my picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t print your picture because they think you\u2019re an ass**le.\u201d She snapped. \u201cYou also won a huge and expensive case against them years ago or have you suddenly forgotten that? Take it as a compliment that they\u2019re even mentioning you in a positive light.\u201d She tossed yesterday\u2019s paper into my lap. \u201cThey even ran that piece. Looks pretty damn good to me.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the paper and brought it close to my face, and before I could read the article, two words caught my eye: Aubrey Everhart.</p><p>Her name was at the bottom of the page, mixed in with several others, in a beautiful black ad:</p><p>The New York Ballet Company to Celebrate New Cast Members with Saturday Night Gala.</p><p>Tomorrow...</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d Rebecca was still talking. \u201cI just think you should at least stay for a night, clear your head, and really think about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I stared at Aubrey\u2019s name again. \u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>Harass (v.):</p><p>Systematic and/or continual unwanted and annoying pestering, which often includes threats and demands.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>The prosecutor shook my hand over coffee and tea the next night, batting her light brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for agreeing to stay for a few weeks, Andrew,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going to be a real help in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure...\u201d I stood up and walked over to the window, looking at the snow covered streets below.</p><p>\u201cYour old partner has definitely hired the best lawyers money can buy, and has paid fines and suffered penalties for years, but I think we can finally send him to prison with the new evidence that we have. That, and your testimony, of course.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how you would feel about this, but...\u201d Her voice trailed off, and seconds later she was by my side. \u201cWould you like to catch up on all we\u2019ve missed since you\u2019ve been gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed my shoulder. \u201cYou left New York and you never looked back. You didn\u2019t call anyone or keep in touch...We were such good friends and you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I cut her off and grabbed her hand, moving it away. \u201cFirst of all, no, I do not want to catch up on shit. I don\u2019t give a damn about what I\u2019ve missed.\u201d I looked her up and down. \u201cBut from the look of things, it hasn\u2019t been much. Second of all, yes, we were friends. Past tense. You didn\u2019t call or keep in touch with me when everyone in this city was dragging my name through the mud, did you?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks reddened.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even call to ask me if the rumors were f**king true.\u201d I pointed to the door. \u201cSo, please don\u2019t think that just because I\u2019ve agreed to help put an ass**le where he belongs, that you and I are, or will ever be friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s six years too late for that.\u201d I turned around. \u201cI\u2019ll be in court when I\u2019m needed. You can leave now.\u201d</p><p>I waited until I heard the sound of the door close and called the town-car driver. \u201cWhat time do I need to leave for the gala if I want to be there once it starts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, sir.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and slipped into my coat, taking the penthouse\u2019s private elevator to the lobby. Rushing through the hotel\u2019s exit doors, I spotted the car across the street and headed over.</p><p>\u201cWe should be there in about thirty minutes, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d He looked at me through the rearview mirror. \u201cAre you meeting a date at this event tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you were, I was going to suggest that we stop at the floral stand that\u2019s three blocks down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can stop.\u201d I looked out the window as he pulled off.</p><p>I\u2019d thought about telling Aubrey that I was in town, or \u201cgood luck\u201d for her performance tonight, but I didn\u2019t see a point. Besides, last night, in a moment of weakness, I sent her a rather vague email and her rare response didn\u2019t encourage further conversation.</p><p>Subject: Happiness.</p><p>Are you happy with your current life away from GBH? Are you pursuing your ballet dreams finally?</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>Subject: Re: Happiness.</p><p>Please stop emailing me and delete my number.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d The driver held the door open. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived...Do you plan on getting out of the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I grabbed the bouquet of roses and lilies off the seat and gave him a tip, telling him that I needed him to stay close, that I may be bringing someone else back with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The line to enter the venue was wrapped around the block, so I skipped everyone and walked straight through the front door.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d An usher immediately stepped in front of me. \u201cThere\u2019s a line outside for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us do sir,\u201d he said, crossing his arms, \u201cbut that\u2019s gala policy unless you already have a ticket. Do you have a ticket?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like those either.\u201d</p><p>He unclipped a radio from his belt buckle. \u201cSir, please don\u2019t make me call security. You have to purchase a ticket just like everyone else, and you have to stand in line just like everyone else. Now, I\u2019m going to kindly ask you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped mid-sentence once I handed him a clip of hundred dollar bills. \u201cDid you say your ticket was in the front row, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s exactly what my ticket says.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and led me down the hall, into a colossal room that featured floor to ceiling windows, glimmering chandeliers, and freshly polished marble floors. Hundreds of tables were dressed in white table cloths\u2014stamped with lavish gold and silver centerpieces, and the letters \u201cNYCB\u201d were etched onto every dinner menu and program.</p> <p>There was no formal stage in this room, only a slightly elevated platform that stood in the center\u2014in perfect view for all the dinner tables.</p><p>\u201cWill this seat be okay for you, sir?\u201d The usher waved his hand over a seat that was directly in front of the platform.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner will be served in about an hour, the sponsors of the NYCB will be honored shortly after, and then the short tributes and the dance portion of the gala will begin.\u201d</p><p>I thanked him again as I took my seat. If I had known the exact order of the program beforehand, I would\u2019ve shown up much later.</p><p>Picking up the brochure in front of me, I flipped through the pages\u2014stopping when I saw Aubrey\u2019s face.</p> <p>Her picture was taken mid-laugh, as she tossed her hair over her shoulder and looked directly into the camera. According to the picture, her hair was much shorter now\u2014it barely touched her shoulders, and her eyes looked more hopeful and happy than I\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>I stared at the picture long and hard, noting all her new changes.</p><p>The lights in the room flickered, and a soft applause arose as a woman dressed in all-white stepped onto the platform.</p><p>\u201cWe will begin now,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you ladies and gentlemen for attending the Annual New York City Ballet Company Gala. It is with great honor and pride that we present tonight\u2019s artists\u2014principle dancers, soloists, and corps members. As you know, due to quite a few unfortunate circumstances, we had to replace nearly ninety percent of our group over the past few months, but as always, the show must go on. And, I truly believe that this is the best class we\u2019ve had in a very long time.\u201d</p><p>The audience clapped.</p><p>\u201cOur company will be performing several productions this year, but the ones that will be presented this winter are The Firebird, Jewels, and our company favorite, Swan Lake.\u201d</p><p>More applause.</p><p>\u201cTonight, our corps will introduce themselves to you personally and perform small tributes as a thank you for your continued support of the arts. And as always, when it comes to the art of dance, please do not applaud until after the last note has played. Thank you.\u201d She walked away and the lights transformed from a stark white to an airy blue, then they dissolved into heavy hues of purple and pink.</p> <p>One by one, the dancers came out\u2014reciting a short monologue and dancing to a short piece of piano music. While most of the performers were entertaining, a few of them made me wonder if they\u2019d simply awoken this morning and decided try ballet for the first time.</p><p>In between the sets, I could hear a few murmurs from the crowd: \u201cAre they sure this is their best cohort?\u201d \u201cMaybe they should\u2019ve canceled the season after that accident...\u201d \u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be having nonstop rehearsals until the season actually begins...\u201d</p><p>A man next to me was whispering about how he missed \u201cthe good old days of the company\u201d when Aubrey stepped onto the floor.</p><p>She was wearing a thin black top and a pink tutu, and her lips were coated in a deep dark red.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, New York City,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Aubrey Everhart, and...\u201d</p><p>She was saying something else, something that made the audience clap loudly, but I could only focus on how good she looked. I\u2019d never admit it to anyone, but I\u2019d kept that photo frame of us on my nightstand ever since she left\u2014looking at her pretty face at night whenever I had a bad day.</p><p>Tonight she wasn\u2019t \u201cpretty,\u201d though. She was a f**king vision.</p><p>Her mouth stopped moving amidst another round of applause from the audience, and the soft sounds of a piano and harp slowly filled the room.</p><p>Aubrey shut her eyes and started her routine, dancing as if she was the only person here.</p><p>There was an immediate change in the gala\u2019s atmosphere. Everyone watching her was fully engaged\u2014captivated, by her every move.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a male dancer joined her, picking her up and holding her high above his head\u2014spinning her around as the music became harsher. After he set her down, the two of them completed steps together\u2014smiling at each other and exchanging glances that made it clear that they knew each other a little too well.</p><p>The second the music stopped, the male dancer pulled her into his arms and kissed her lips.</p><p>What the f**k...</p><p>The crowd stood to its feet and clapped for the first time all night, but I remained seated, completely taken aback by what the f**k I just saw.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t have to cancel my season tickets after all, eh?\u201d The man next to me winked. \u201cBravissimo!\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at Aubrey and her partner, seething as he wrapped an arm around her waist and strummed his fingers against her skin. He whispered into her ear and she blushed, making my blood pressure soar to an all-time high.</p><p>\u201cWell, what a response!\u201d The director took the floor. \u201cThank you, Miss Everhart and Mr. Williams. I want you all to know that those two will be headlining next month\u2019s Silver Moon Gala as well...\u201d She continued talking, saying more about the program, but her words were soundless to me.</p><p>I was confused by what I just saw\u2014not sure if Aubrey\u2019s mouth had actually been on someone else.</p><p>More dancers took the floor, more applause, more speeches, and my thoughts remained the same. It wasn\u2019t until the patrons took the floor, that I realized that the showcase part of this evening was over.</p><p>\u201cAre you interested in donating to the NYCB?\u201d A ballerina, still dressed in her white performance outfit, stepped in front of me. \u201cWould you like to make a contribution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy contribution was the ticket I bought for tonight.\u201d I stood up, leaving the flower bouquet behind, and walked off in search of Aubrey.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to find her.</p><p>Dressed in a rather revealing silver dress, she was in a corner laughing with her male dancer friend, batting her eyes as he handed her a drink.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d Someone tapped me on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I kept my eyes on Aubrey.</p><p>\u201cUm, if you stay for the after-portion of the event, you have to donate...It\u2019s part of the rules. It was written in bold so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I handed her whatever bills were left in my wallet.</p><p>She disappeared.</p><p>Aubrey\u2019s friend kissed her forehead and stepped away, giving me the perfect opportunity to approach, but she was swarmed by a group of other ballerinas.</p><p>Friends, it seemed.</p><p>I waited for their conversation to end, until she told them she\u2019d join them later, and then I made my move.</p><p>As she turned around, I placed my hand on her shoulder--feeling a jolt shoot through my veins. \u201cGood evening, Aubrey...\u201d</p><p>She dropped her glass to the floor and slowly turned around.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d She stepped back. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Neither of us said anything further, and that familiar tension that had always existed between us began to thicken with every second that passed.</p><p>She looked even more beautiful up close, and I was tempted to push her against the wall and reconnect, but I held back.</p><p>\u201cCan I speak with you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She looked me up and down.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d I looked into her eyes. \u201cCan I speak with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I raised my eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cAs in, no you may not speak with me, and you can go back to wherever the hell you came from.\u201d</p><p>She walked away and headed to the dance floor.</p><p>I sighed and went after her, clasping her hand and spinning her around. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s five more than I\u2019m willing to give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you dying?\u201d Her face turned red. \u201cIs it a life or death matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it really have to be?\u201d My hand caressed her cheek, temporarily silencing her. \u201cYou look f**king beautiful tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. My boyfriend thinks so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know, that person who doesn\u2019t treat you like shit just because he likes you and you like him back? Interesting concept, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to respond to that.</p><p>The orchestra struck a sudden loud chord that reverberated through the room, and a voice came over the speakers.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Benjamin Wright Orchestra will now play their rendition of one of Tchaikovsky\u2019s most revered pieces. The tempo of this song has a similar pacing for what some of you may know as the waltz. Please join us on the floor for this classic homage...\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hand and entwined it with mine, securing my free hand around her waist.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She hissed and tried to pull away. \u201cI\u2019m not dancing with you.\u201d</p><p>I tightened my grip around her. \u201cYes you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me scream, Andrew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I wouldn\u2019t love to hear that?\u201d</p><p>She tried to move away from me, but I held her still.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I loosened my grip and swayed her to the music. \u201cAre you aware that your boyfriend is a male ballerina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe correct term,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes, \u201cis a danseur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a f**king ballerina...\u201d I dipped her to the floor. \u201cIs this what you\u2019ve been doing for the past few months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving out my dream free from a certain ass**le?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect more from you if you\u2019re going to date someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what you expect.\u201d She hissed. \u201cHe\u2019s everything you\u2019ll never be...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he kisses you in public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that...But that\u2019s on the never-ending list of things he has on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he make you cum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t make me cry.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I felt her pulling away from me, but I held her still. \u201cAre you f**king him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I just want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a conversation in months and you think you\u2019re entitled to know who I\u2019m sleeping with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t necessarily use the term entitled.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pressed her chest against mine. \u201cNo, I am not f**king him, but you know what?

She just moved here.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a little while, tapping and touching buttons.</p><p>\u201cFound it,\u201d he said. \u201c7654 Fifth Avenue.\u201d</p><p>Five blocks away...</p><p>I thought about whether I should wait until morning to stop by, but I was already putting on my coat.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice hearing from you again, Liam...\u201d the old man\u2019s voice brought me back to the present. \u201cGood to know you\u2019re well and...getting over what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get over it.\u201d I hung up and headed outside, signaling for the town car driver to open the back door.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, Mr. Hamilton?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201c7654 Fifth Avenue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p><p>It took less than twenty minutes to get there, and when we arrived I stared at the brownstone for a while. It looked like something I would\u2019ve purchased years ago when I lived here, something far out of budget for a ballerina, so I figured her parents were paying the rent.</p><p>Stepping out of the car, I adjusted my coat and walked to her door\u2014knocking five times.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d She yelled.</p><p>The door swung open, but she wasn\u2019t standing behind it. It was her boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d He looked confused. \u201cDid you leave the pizza in your car or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a f**king pizza guy. Where is Aubrey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends. Didn\u2019t we just see you at the gala?\u201d He crossed his arms as Aubrey stepped into the doorway. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s no one, again,\u201d she said, standing on her toes to kiss his lips.</p><p>He looked at me with his eyebrow raised as he returned her kiss.</p><p>\u201cMy c**k has been in every inch of her mouth.\u201d I gritted my teeth.</p><p>Aubrey gasped, her cheeks turning bright red. \u201cI am so sorry, Brian... Can you give us a moment please?\u201d</p><p>He looked between the both of us, anger creeping onto his face, but he walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you f**king want, Andrew?\u201d She fumed. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me, about us being friends again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will never f**king happen. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to New York, huh? Did you need to come back and f**k some familiar women on Date-Match? Did Durham somehow run out of pu**y?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually starting to feel that way.\u201d</p><p>She started to close the door, but I held it still with my hand.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Aubrey...\u201d I looked directly into her eyes. \u201cI really do, and I\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry for kicking you out that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d Her voice was a whisper. \u201cAnd if you really miss me, you\u2019ll leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re bipolar. Because the second I ask one too many questions, or suggest something outside of your comfort zone, you\u2019ll treat me like trash again and I\u2019d rather cut my losses now.\u201d She wiped a tear from her eyes. \u201cI was your only friend\u2014your only f**king friend, and you treated me worse than any of the women you met online. If anything, I\u2019m sorry that I ever let you do that. Please leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey, listen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there super glue on my floor?\u201d She pushed me down a step. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re still standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie about one thing, lie about it all, right?\u201d She pushed me again. \u201cYou\u2019re still the biggest liar between the two of us. Lying by omission is still lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please calm down and let me talk about this with you inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated rhetorical questions.\u201d She slammed the door in my face.</p><p>A Priori Assumption (n.):</p><p>An assumption that is true without further proof or need to prove it.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>I woke up the next morning on edge, in utter shock.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe Andrew was in New York, couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d admitted missing me on my front steps last night.</p><p>Seeing him again brought out every emotion in me, and even though I\u2019d told Brian that Andrew and I were done, I\u2019d spent the rest of our date last night thinking about him.</p><p>Him and his perfect suit. Him and his perfect lips that nearly pressed against mine as we argued. And, shamefully, him and his perfect c**k that I felt hardening in his pants as he dipped me on the dance floor.</p><p>Ugh!</p><p>I got out of bed and sent Brian a text. \u201cToday is my one on one day with Ashcroft...Wish me luck!\u201d</p><p>His response came immediately. \u201cGood luck, babe! Get some coffee, you\u2019re going to need it...\u201d</p><p>Slipping into the shower, I scolded myself. \u201cBrian is a sweetheart and he\u2019s good for you...He may suck at phone sex, and you may have no desire to sleep with him right now, but he treats you better than you\u2019ve ever been treated before...\u201d</p><p>When I was wrinkled and prune-like, I stepped out and checked the time.</p><p>4:30 a.m.</p><p>I had twenty minutes to make it to the closest subway station and avoid the ire of Ashcroft. Throwing on some old sweatpants, I grabbed my ballet bag and snatched my coat from the bannister in the hallway. I double checked my wallet to make sure I had my metro pass, and when I opened the door, I found myself face to face with a stranger and a cup of steaming hot coffee.</p><p>\u201cGood luck at practice today,\u201d he said, handing it over. \u201cThis was made especially for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do coffee shops deliver?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThey don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the cup as he walked away, noticing that my name was etched atop the whipped cream in thin caramel, and that \u201cGood luck,\u201d was written in cursive on the label.</p><p>It was a signature, sweet Brian move, and I immediately felt guilty for not giving him my full attention last night. As I walked to the subway, sipping what was arguably the best coffee I\u2019d ever had, I vowed to give him my full attention from here on out.</p><p>I deleted all of Andrew\u2019s old texts and emails, even the ones I\u2019d fake deleted by placing them in the archive. I blocked his number, preventing his calls from ever getting through, and although I couldn\u2019t block his emails, I changed the settings of my inbox so they would go straight to my spam folder.</p><p>When I finally arrived at practice that morning, I danced better than I\u2019d ever danced before...</p><p>Later that night...</p><p>\u201cHow do you find the time to take the subway just to meet me at practice and walk me home?\u201d I looked up at Brian as we crossed the street. \u201cWhere do you find the energy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make time for all the things I really like.\u201d He kissed my forehead.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to catch a movie this weekend? My treat? I owe you one...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still feel bad about gala night and what that guy from my past said to you,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s\u2014\u201d He stopped talking as we approached my house, pointing at the man who was leaning against the door.</p><p>Andrew.</p><p>I took a deep breath as Andrew walked down the steps.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Aubrey,\u201d he said, smirking. \u201cAnd your name is danseur, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d</p><p>Brian crossed his arms. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I overheard her say that she didn\u2019t want you anymore. Why can\u2019t you take the hint?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause she says things she doesn\u2019t mean all the time.\u201d He looked at me, instantly setting my nerves on fire. \u201cAnd I know she\u2019s just angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude!\u201d Brian let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend so clearly she\u2019s moved on...She has a boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t feel threatened,\u201d he said, still looking at me. \u201cDid you get my coffee this morning?\u201d</p><p>What?! \u201cThat was from you?\u201d My eyes widened. \u201cI thought...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat coffee, Aubs?\u201d Brian looked concerned. \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d I shook my head. \u201cThank you for the coffee, but that doesn\u2019t make up for anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said it did.\u201d</p><p>A cold wind brushed by and I felt myself being drawn to him, literally drawn to him, and I took a few steps forward. But then I took a few steps back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Brian now...\u201d I grabbed Brian\u2019s hand and led him up to my door, refusing to look back at a seemingly hurt Andrew.</p> <p>I shut the door and peeped through my blinds, noticing that he was still standing there. Confused.</p><p>\u201cLook, Aubs...\u201d The sound of Brian\u2019s voice got my attention. \u201cI don\u2019t think the two of us are going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, no, no. Of course, we will. This is just a minor issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your heart and mind are elsewhere...I think they always have been, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I crossed my arms. \u201cBecause some psycho from my past shows up for one night and suddenly wants me again? That\u2019s what makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and the fact that some psycho sent me a text earlier today that said, \u201cHer pu**y belongs to me.\u201d I\u2019m just now remembering that...\u201d</p> <p>I sighed and he walked over, kissing my forehead.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a minor issue, and he doesn\u2019t mean anything to you anymore, we can try again in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat way I\u2019ll know for sure, and our phone sex will be twice as amazing since we won\u2019t have had it in so long...Then, maybe we can upgrade to actual sex.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing, and he walked out of my place.</p><p>I peeped through the blinds again, watching him disappear into the night, and then I noticed that Andrew was still standing outside.</p><p>Livid, I stomped down the steps and headed straight toward him. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I hate you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate isn\u2019t something that can be adequately measured.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just ruined the one great relationship I had in this city. You just made him dump me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI did you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this how you\u2019re planning on getting me to talk to you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work.\u201d I pressed my finger against his chest, emphasizing every syllable. \u201cI told you that you would have to f**king beg me, and since I know that\u2019s not how you operate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how I f**king operate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to walk me to the subway station every morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a f**king car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk me back from rehearsals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually treat me with some goddamn respect?\u201d</p><p>He cupped my face in his hands. \u201cIf you give me a chance to...\u201d</p><p>I stepped back, still angry. \u201cI\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d</p><p>Omission (n.):</p><p>Inadvertently leaving out a word, phrase or other language from a contract, deed, judgment or other document.</p><p>Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Brian-gate.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how many more times I\u2019ll have to apologize for making your \u201cboyfriend\u201d dump you, but I am, in fact, sorry. Then again, maybe I should have waited until after you f**ked him so you could be more appreciative.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d I tossed my phone across the room, nearly knocking over the beautiful vase of lilies he sent me yesterday.</p><p>Ever since last week\u2019s \u201cBrian-gate,\u201d I had to face him every day in some capacity. In the mornings, he personally brought me my favorite coffee, walked me to the block where my subway stop was, and apologized profusely. In his own way, of course.</p><p>I never said a word back, though. I just sipped from my cup and listened.</p><p>Taking a seat on my couch, I grabbed an ice wrap and placed it on my shoulders. I was counting down the days to opening night, wondering how much more pain my body could take.</p><p>My feet were now unrecognizable; I no longer soothed their cuts and blisters. The muscles in my arms ached relentlessly, and when I told Mr. Ashcroft that I needed a few extra minutes to stretch my right leg yesterday, he said, \u201cThen I need to replace you with a dancer who doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at the memory and heard a knock at my door.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d I walked over and opened it, tempted to slam it shut once I saw Andrew.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPractice starts in an hour. You\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not due there until the afternoon session. Thank you for the reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in until then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I really need a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk to you for a few minutes, Aubrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do that over the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou blocked my f**king number.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019ve tried that already today. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried email?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey, please...\u201d He actually looked sincere.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I held the door open. \u201cBut you have to leave in five minutes so I can take a nap.\u201d</p><p>He stepped inside and looked around, running his hands over the artwork in the halls.</p><p>Looking slightly impressed, he rubbed his chin. \u201cAre your parents paying for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t spoken to them since I left.\u201d I admitted. \u201cA retired dancer from the company rents out all her condos to the newest cohorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it expensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d I sat on the couch. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way I can afford to live in this part of town. Otherwise, I\u2019d be sleeping in a cardboard box.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me for a while, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s just been awhile since you spoke a full sentence that wasn\u2019t filled with malice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d I winced and placed another ice wrap on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make your five minutes with me somewhat memorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>He walked over and sat next to me on the couch. \u201cYou got an A on your final assignment at GBH.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give it to me out of sympathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it to you because your work was the best.\u201d He looked into my eyes. \u201cAlthough, I could have done without the \u201cFYI: Mr. Hamilton used to f**k me in his office\u201d note that was at the end.\u201d</p><p>I held back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cJessica misses you by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe claims I was much more desirable when you were around,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd apparently she used to listen to us have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point in even trying to fire her anymore...I think she grew on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo all the interns still hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled. \u201cFor some strange reason, they started to like me shortly after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insinuating that your ass**le behavior was my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled me into his lap and took the ice wrap away. \u201cI\u2019m insinuating that I no longer pretend to care about any interns when my favorite one is missing.\u201d</p><p>I blushed and he started to massage my shoulders\u2014slowly kneading his hands against my skin.</p><p>I shut my eyes and exhaled, slightly tilting my head back instead of telling him to stop.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on ever accepting my apology?\u201d he asked, pressing a kiss against my neck.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way that I could make you?\u201d His fingers gently rubbed my collarbone, alleviating the pain.</p><p>\u201cYou could tell me the real reason you\u2019re in New York...\u201d I felt him unsnapping my bra. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t come all the way here just to see me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d He pressed his palms into my back, temporarily rendering me speechless. \u201cYou\u2019re a huge part of the reason why I\u2019m still here, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other part?\u201d</p><p>He tilted my head back so I was looking directly into his eyes. \u201cThe other part doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d He looked as if he wanted to kiss me, but he held back.</p><p>Instead, he slipped his hands underneath my legs and flipped me over so I was lying in his lap. \u201cWhat time is your rehearsal again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour...\u201d I barely managed. His touches felt too good.</p><p>\u201cCan I drive you?\u201d He softly kneaded the back of my shoulders. \u201cI can do this to you for longer if you don\u2019t take the subway...\u201d</p><p>I nodded and shut my eyes, falling asleep at the mercy of his hands.</p><p>Hours later, Andrew pulled over to the curb at Lincoln Center.</p><p>I unbuckled my seatbelt and looked at him. \u201cAre you going to be standing outside the ballet hall when I get done today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith hot chocolate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer something different?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cI thought I was doing the right thing by kicking you out that night, by pushing you away...It was definitely a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming back to you just because you said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to.\u201d He trailed his finger against my lips. \u201cI would, however, like you to consider forgiving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Just because you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His lips were on mine\u2014kissing me, begging me, saying all the things he couldn\u2019t say with words. And this time I was listening, missing everything we once had before he pushed me away.</p><p>Not letting me go, he ran his fingers through my hair and caressed my neck.</p><p>\u201cGo think about that,\u201d he whispered, slowly pulling away from me.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d I struggled to catch my breath as he stepped out to open my door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d He kissed my lips before leaving me standing in the middle of the street, completely breathless again.</p><p>Shit...</p><p>I headed toward the dance hall, confident that I would dance like I was on air today. I opened the doors and felt someone grabbing my shoulder from behind.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d The voice asked. \u201cAubrey, is that you?\u201d</p><p>I turned around, shocked. \u201cMom? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you...\u201d</p><p>I noticed the pin on her suit, \u201cVote Smart. Vote Everhart,\u201d and knew that wasn\u2019t true. She was in town for something that had to do with my father\u2019s campaign; I was only a pit stop.</p><p>\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve seen me...\u201d I turned away and slipped inside the building.</p><p>\u201cWait, Aubrey.\u201d She followed me. \u201cDo you really think that moving across the country was the best way to get me and your father\u2019s attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t leave North Carolina to get your attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you certainly have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look, it only took twenty two years...\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to talk to the department chair about letting you pick up where you left off during the summer semester. We can do that since you\u2019re so upset about being a part of the campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not upset. I honestly don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d She sounded offended. \u201cBut if it makes you feel any better, we placed a picture of you and one of your ballets in our campaign brochure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do that so you could look like you actually care about college arts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we donated fifty thousand dollars to Duke\u2019s dance program to look like we actually care about college arts. The brochure picture was personal, although it would\u2019ve been even better if you wrote that essay we begged you to write. We could\u2019ve put that next to the picture. \u201d</p><p>I felt a pang in my chest. \u201cWhen does your flight leave, mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen does your flight leave?\u201d I repeated, my voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s in three hours or less so you won\u2019t have to spend a full day here, so you can go back and tell Dad that you tried to convince me to come home after you fulfilled your campaign work. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s still all that matters to you.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>\u201cI left Durham because I\u2019ll be living here for at least three years\u2014which is the length of my contract with the company, where I\u2019ll be pursuing my real dream. And I must say, it\u2019s just a bonus that I won\u2019t be anywhere near you.\u201d</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cHave a safe flight. Tell Dad I said hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave me standing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it to me my entire life.\u201d I left the building. I was too angry, too hurt, to completely focus.</p><p>I sent Ashcroft an email\u2014letting him know I was using a sick day, and headed for the street.</p><p>\u201cAubrey!\u201d My mother called from behind, but I kept walking. \u201cAubrey, wait!\u201d</p><p>She finally caught up to me and grabbed my arm. \u201cI can miss my flight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can spend time with my daughter before she forgets that I exist...\u201d</p><p>I held back tears.</p><p>\u201cI can stay here for a few days and we can catch up in between your dance schedule,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll make your dad fly up too if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be perfectly fine...\u201d I nodded, but then it hit me. \u201cNo campaign talk, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking about me going back to law school, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that, too.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd no talking shit about ballet.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but she nodded again. \u201cOkay, fine.\u201d She hugged me. \u201cCan you hail us a cab so I can book a room at the Four Seasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You can just stay at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please.\u201d She slid a pair of shades over her eyes. \u201cI looked up what professional ballerinas make. I know what type of apartment you can afford in this city, and daughter or not, I refuse.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to laugh, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I knew making up would be a long process, but I was willing to give it a try.</p><p>She walked over to a newspaper stand, and I held out my hand for a cab.</p><p>\u201cOh, The New York Times always picks the best cases to cover.\u201d She flipped through the paper. \u201cThere\u2019s one hell of a trial going on this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCriminal or corporate?\u201d I asked as a taxi flew right past me.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I actually know this guy. Well, I know of him anyway...Absolutely incredible lawyer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re never going to get a cab at this rate.\u201d I shook my head at being snubbed again.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll ever get recognition for that government case...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Henderson.\u201d She held the paper in front of me, pointing to a picture-less article. \u201cRemember? He\u2019s on me and your dad\u2019s list of lawyers who\u2019ll never be given the credit they deserve because they went against the government. This guy was your favorite, I do believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I remembered. \u201cSo, why is he in the paper now? Did he mess up because he didn\u2019t receive his due fame? Is he in trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, looks like he\u2019s just testifying in a case. Article claims he\u2019s been living down in the South and even partnered at some firm, but that can\u2019t be true. Any firm down there would be bragging if they had him, and I haven\u2019t heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they would.\u201d I finally waved down a cab. \u201cWe can go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite weird though.\u201d She tapped her lip. \u201cIn all of his career, I\u2019ve never seen a picture of him\u2014maybe one or two, but they were stock pictures from his college days. I\u2019m sure he looks different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d I said, opening the car door. \u201cThe cab charges by the minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow the article claims he\u2019s been living in North Carolina under an assumed name for the past six years. But of course, they\u2019re not revealing that name. They need to get better researchers, don\u2019t you think? How could a lawyer of that status manage to change his name, switch states, and still practice the law?\u201d She handed me the paper as she stepped into the cab. \u201cHe\u2019d have to erase his entire identity and start all over. Who would do that?\u201d</p><p>I gasped and flipped to the article as I sat in the backseat. I read it word for word, over and over, and everything around me became a blur. I could practically feel my jaw dropping as I flashed back to my first interview at GBH:</p><p>Miss Everhart, are there any lawyers that you wish to model your own career after?\u201d Mr. Bach smiled at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, actually,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired the career of Liam Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam Henderson?\u201d Andrew looked up at me with his eyebrow raised. \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>Suppression of Evidence (n.):</p><p>The improper hiding of evidence by a prosecutor who is constitutionally required to reveal to the defense all evidence.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>Former Partners to Finally Appear in Court Opposite Each Other:</p><p>Hart Case Continues This Week.</p><p>That\u2019s what the headline in the judicial section of The New York Times read this morning. To those who knew nothing about the case, I was sure that it was simply another story to pass the time, another superficial scandal to devour with their morning breakfast.</p><p>But for me, it was the end of a six year chapter that had gone on for far too many pages. It was part of the reason why I left, part of the reason why after I testified in a few days, I would leave this city for the very last time.</p><p>I looked outside the window at the Waldorf Astoria\u2019s restaurant, wondering how it could possibly be raining so heavily in the dead of winter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton?\u201d A woman in a suit stepped next to my table.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Vera Milton, the general manager,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had several calls from a Miss Ava Sanchez... She keeps telling us that it\u2019s important and that she needs to speak with you. She\u2019s on the line for you now...\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cCould you patch her call to my room in two minutes please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly sir.\u201d</p><p>I left the newspaper on the table and headed straight for the penthouse suite. As soon as I unlocked the door, the phone in the parlor room rang.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me...\u201d Ava said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. How did you find out where I was staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She scoffed. \u201cI need you to do me a favor...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait.\u201d She sounded frantic. \u201cI really am sorry for everything I did to you, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about calling me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when you visited me when I was being held in jail\u2014before all the hearings started...Remember?\u201d She paused. \u201cI know how hard seeing me must have been back then, how lonely you had to be to come and visit me of all people...You even told me you were contemplating changing your name to Andrew and leaving New York...And then I begged you to save me. Remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not in the mood for story time right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were such a softie back then...So compassionate, so caring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the f**king point, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the trial this week, I know that Kevin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI.e. my former best friend that you f**ked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHim...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the monster you think he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling about a favor that\u2019s never going to happen, or are you calling to be his f**king character witness? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still sorry for what he did...He was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one is it, Ava?\u201d I snapped. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of this vague shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to hurt him?\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI think you\u2019ve already punished us enough. I\u2019m already behind bars, so there\u2019s really no need for him to suffer at this point. \u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you will never suffer enough.\u201d I hung up and sent a text to an old contact I had at corrections, telling him that Ava had contraband in her cell.</p><p>The last thing I wanted to think about was my old partner and former best friend. The only time he needed to be thought of was during the upcoming hearing, and never again after that.</p><p>I scrolled through my text messages, noticing that Aubrey had sent me a simple \u201cOkay\u201d when I asked how today\u2019s audition went.</p><p>With the exception of the day I massaged her shoulders, she was still being short with me.</p><p>I opened my inbox to send her a longer message, but I saw that she\u2019d sent me one first.</p><p>Subject: Yes.</p><p>I just received your newest set of flowers and your note about going on a date tonight...I have a few stipulations, though.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Re: Yes.</p><p>Name them.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>She sent a new message.</p><p>Subject: Date.</p><p>I\u2019m allowed to ask you whatever I want and you have to answer truthfully.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Re: Date.</p><p>I always answer truthfully. Is the word \u201cstipulations\u201d not plural?</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Date.</p><p>You have to be a complete gentleman. I don\u2019t want to be f**ked in another bathroom...</p><p>What time are you picking me up?</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Re: Date.</p><p>I actually wasn\u2019t planning on f**king you tonight, but since you\u2019ve clearly entertained that possibility, I\u2019ll be sure to send a list of potential locations prior to the date.</p><p>Eight o\u2019 clock.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>I knocked on her door at 7:58, dressed in a black designer suit I\u2019d purchased hours ago.</p><p>There was no answer, and before I could knock again, the door swung open and she stepped out wearing a short black dress that left little to the imagination.</p><p>\u201cAre you aware that it\u2019s still winter?\u201d I trailed my finger along her exposed shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a coat.\u201d</p><p>She looked behind me. \u201cYou took the subway here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking the subway on our date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe car will come later.\u201d I smiled as confusion spread across her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grabbed her coat from inside and shut the door, looking up at me. \u201cDo you even know how to use the subway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d I said, clasping her hand. \u201cI wasn\u2019t always well-off when I lived here...\u201d</p><p>A light snow fell as we made our way to the subway tunnel, and she leaned against me\u2014pressing her body closer to mine. Holiday lights were strung about the tallest buildings\u2014sparkling against the night, and a faint sense of excitement swirled through the air.</p><p>There weren\u2019t that many people out tonight, and as we boarded a nearly empty train, Aubrey laughed at that fact.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a subway like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually have to fight for my own tiny space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d I prevented her from taking a seat, instead making her share a pole with me. \u201cHow did your audition really go today? Surely you have more to say about it than okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was crying when I sent that text. I was overwhelmed.\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI landed Odette/Odile in Swan Lake\u2014on a professional level.\u201d She looked as if she was about to burst into tears. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it...All of my dreams are actually coming true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re meant to play that role...\u201d I wiped a stray tear from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that they\u2019re giving us the next few days off...I think I\u2019ll be able to relax and keep up with the news a bit more. You know, actually have some semblance of a life outside of the dance hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could spend more time with me if you want to take a break. The news in this city is overrated and mostly false.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, looking into her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe half of the shit in any of these papers.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHave you heard anything about the huge trial that\u2019s happening this week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s more than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNot like this one...\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cWhat makes this one so special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more intriguing than special...It\u2019s about two lawyers who once shared a firm\u2014both of them were big shots, you know? One of them even won against the government in his very first case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was probably a lucky break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She looked into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve read the transcripts. He knew exactly what he was doing, and the verdict actually affected public policy.\u201d</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cBut the thing is, he never got credit for his work\u2014outside of word of mouth from people who knew the details, you know?\u201d She paused. \u201cBut anyway, from what I\u2019ve read and pieced together, it seems like he was falsely accused of a laundry list of federal charges a few years later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like everyone ran with the story\u2014all of the papers, all of the news outlets, and the truth wasn\u2019t filtered until months later, after his name was already tarnished.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her, begging her to stop, but she continued.</p><p>\u201cThe charges are still pending against his old partner to this day, that\u2019s just how many there were. But him\u2014this upstanding lawyer with one hell of a track record, he just vanished. Into thin air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was that upstanding, then I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI thought that, too...\u201d She searched my eyes for answers. \u201cBut I think the guy I\u2019m talking about is capable of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the names in this case you\u2019re speaking of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accused is Kevin Hart, and the key witness is Liam Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll google it tonight.\u201d I sighed, not wanting to continue this conversation.</p><p>A voice came over the speakers, announcing our stop, and I took her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI know you made me agree to stipulations,\u201d I said, looking at her as we stepped off, \u201cbut can you agree to one of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me the deep conversation questions after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where we\u2019re going right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I led her up the steps. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare. I don\u2019t want you accusing me of treating you like all my other dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you won\u2019t f**k me at the end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I won\u2019t leave you at the end.\u201d</p><p>She blushed, and I kissed her forehead as we walked through the streets of flashing lights and sparkling billboards.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say much of anything else as we moved from block to block, only blushing each time I looked at her.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I said, stopping her as we approached our first destination.</p><p>\u201cBroadway?\u201d She looked up at the grand marquis.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned you haven\u2019t had the chance to come here yet,\u201d I said. \u201cI used to come here all the time when I lived here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least once a week.\u201d I held the door open for her. \u201cTwice when this particular play was performed.\u201d I ran my fingers across the words, Death of a Salesman, before handing our tickets to the usher.</p><p>She smiled as he led us to the private balcony, as he offered us complimentary wine since we were so early.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve never taken you for the drama type,\u201d she said, taking a sip from her glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve never mentioned that to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually almost went to theater school instead of law school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you change your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA law degree attracts a higher percentage of pu**y.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d She rolled her eyes, laughing. \u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI received a bigger scholarship for law school.\u201d I resisted the urge to pull her into my lap. \u201cBest decision I ever made.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but the lights began to dim and she leaned closer to me, whispering, \u201cI would\u2019ve liked to see you as an actor...I think you would\u2019ve been really good at it.\u201d</p><p>I felt her placing her hand on my thigh. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve wanted to see you play anything serious though. I think I would prefer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to talk through this entire play, Aubrey?\u201d I cut her off, ignoring the tell-tale look on her face\u2014the one of severe longing, needing.</p><p>\u201cAm I not allowed to make comments?\u201d She sounded offended. \u201cAm I not allowed to do that until after dinner either? If that\u2019s the case, why even take me out? Why would you even\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen this play a million times...\u201d I pressed my finger against her lips as the lead actor stepped onto the stage. \u201cAnd although I want you to experience it too, if you would rather me entertain you in a different way, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould this balcony make it onto your list of approved places?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf I f**ked you here, would that still count as me being a gentleman?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened and she quickly moved her hand away from my lap. \u201cI was just teasing you, Andrew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d I kissed her neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve told you on numerous occasions that I don\u2019t appreciate that, whether you\u2019re mad at me or not...\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath as I slid my thumb underneath her panties.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop asking questions,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll watch the play...\u201d</p><p>As she turned her face toward the stage, I moved out of my seat and kneeled in front of her.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d She whispered harshly as I spread her thighs apart. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking sure you enjoy the show.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t give her a chance to respond. I quickly ripped off her panties, and buried my head in between her legs, running my tongue against her bare pu**y\u2014enjoying a taste I\u2019d missed for months. I sucked her clit between my lips, shutting my eyes as it swelled in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cAndrew....\u201d She moaned as she squeezed her legs around my neck, grabbing onto my hair and begging me to slow down.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t. She tasted too f**king good.</p><p>I forced my tongue deeper inside of her, claiming every part, marking what was mine.</p><p>Her hips began to rise off the seat, and I pushed them down\u2014punishing her with stronger strokes, slipping my fingers inside of her and commanding her to stay still.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d She thrust her hips up again. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>A loud applause arose from the theater below us, echoing off the walls as the first scene ended.</p><p>I sucked her clit harder, darting my tongue against it repeatedly until she couldn\u2019t help but scream my name across the theater.</p><p>Shaking, she grabbed my shoulders, gripping me harder than ever as she came into my mouth.</p><p>I held her thighs as she continued to shake, as tremor after tremor ran through her body.</p><p>As she came back down, I caressed her legs and kissed the inside of her thighs.</p><p>Grabbing her ripped panties off the floor, I wiped her clean. Then I stuffed them into my pocket before taking my seat again.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong sir?\u201d An usher stepped into our balcony. \u201cI heard a disturbance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA disturbance?\u201d I looked at Aubrey then back at him. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there was one here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked concerned. \u201cWhat about you, Miss? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d Aubrey nodded, attempting to look as normal as possible. \u201cI\u2019m more than fine.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, and within seconds, she seemingly transformed into the Aubrey I remembered from months ago, the one that was incapable of not asking questions.</p><p>Not that I minded, though.</p><p>By the first intermission she\u2019d asked all that was possible about the play and leaned against me, whispering, \u201cThis is perfect, Andrew...Thank you.\u201d And then she didn\u2019t speak again until the show ended two hours later.</p><p>\u201cThe lead was amazing,\u201d she said as the curtains closed. \u201cI really felt all of his emotions in that last scene...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I helped her into her coat. \u201cDo you have a curfew? Any time that I need to get you back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty two years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cI found that out the hard way, thank you. I meant, do you have a few more hours to spend with me or do you have to get up early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until the afternoon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I led her out of the theater and signaled to the town-car driver across the street. \u201cI want to take you somewhere else. Can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that...\u201d</p><p>I helped her into the town car and after I slid inside, she moved into my lap\u2014pressing her lips against mine, whispering thanks once again.</p><p>Holding her close, I gave her a brief tour of my past as we drove through the city\u2014grateful that the driver avoided driving by my former firm.</p><p>I showed her my favorite restaurants, my favorite places to relax, and a few places I would like to take her to before I left.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at the Waldorf Astoria, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d The driver looked at us through the rearview mirror. \u201cWill this be the final stop for the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, noticing Aubrey narrowing her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax...\u201d I kissed her forehead. \u201cThis is where I\u2019ve been living since I flew here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html

that led to the roof.</p><p>Opening the doors, I noticed everything was set up exactly as I asked: A lone white clothed table sat in front of a dancing fire, soft lights hung in waves across the trellis, and through the falling snow, the words \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d twinkled against the building directly across from us.</p><p>\u201cThis is so beautiful, Andrew...\u201d she said, looking around. \u201cWhen did you change your mind about dinner?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d I pulled out her chair and uncovered the platter of chocolate and vanilla covered strawberries. \u201cIt\u2019s dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think of all this yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d I sat next to her and put my arms around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201ctypically on a date the two people sit across from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the memo about me making sure that I wouldn\u2019t treat you like any other date?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Her mouth was on mine within seconds and my hands found their way into her hair.</p><p>Pulling her forward, I bit her lips and looked into her eyes.</p><p>She was silently telling me to take things further, rubbing her hand against my cock.</p><p>\u201cStop touching me, Aubrey,\u201d I whispered, warning her. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to be a gentleman anymore if you don\u2019t stop...\u201d I stood up and walked to the door, giving myself some space. \u201cI\u2019m trying to prove to you that I can get through a date without f**king you...\u201d</p><p>She followed me, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you already failed at that...\u201d She threaded her fingers through my hair and hastily unbuttoned my shirt.</p><p>I wedged my knee between her legs and slid a hand across her thighs, sighing as I felt how wet she was.</p> <p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d I groaned as she reached into my pocket and pulled out a condom. \u201cI can wait...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She freed my c**k from my pants and rolled the condom onto me without letting my lips go.</p><p>I secured my arms around her waist and lifting her up, carrying her over to the rooftop\u2019s railing. \u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019ve missed your pu**y.\u201d I kissed her lips. \u201cAnd your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all you miss?\u201d Her hands went around my neck.</p><p>\u201cIf it was, then we wouldn\u2019t be here right now.\u201d I slowly slid inside of her, filling her inch by inch, staring into her eyes as I remembered just how good she f**king felt.</p><p>Without saying another word, I slid my hands down to her sides and moved her up and down\u2014groaning as her pu**y gripped me tighter and tighter with every stroke.</p><p>Her lips found their way to mine, and neither of us let go\u2014grinding into each other as a second light snow fell over us.</p><p>Her nails dug into my back as she came close to coming, her teeth trapped my bottom lip to prevent herself from screaming out.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go yet, Aubrey...\u201d My c**k was throbbing inside of her. \u201cWait...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, fighting it, but she held on for a few more seconds\u2014looking into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d I whispered. \u201cSo f**king much...\u201d</p><p>Falling forward into my chest, she came with me\u2014biting my skin as her legs went limp around my waist.</p><p>Both of us were breathing heavily, staring at each other as we once did months ago, and we remained entwined.</p><p>I kissed her lips, repeating how much I missed her, and she smiled\u2014softly telling me to pull out of her.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to stay the night?\u201d I asked, picking up my jacket and holding it out for her. \u201cYou can tell me more about that case you\u2019re so intrigued with lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Henderson &amp; Hart one?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou really haven\u2019t heard anything about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but if you spend the night we can google it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Her voice was suddenly flat. \u201cI need to go.\u201d She adjusted her dress and walked over to the table, picking up her purse. \u2018</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She pulled out her phone to check the time and sighed.</p><p>\u201cAubrey, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForcing myself to see that you\u2019re still the same and you\u2019ll never change.\u201d She looked hurt. \u201cYour idea of the truth is, and will always be, duplicitous. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for a wonderful night...I\u2019ll always remember this and cherish it, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really starting to wonder if you are, indeed, bipolar...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that your name was Liam Henderson tonight?\u201d She shook her head, and I inhaled a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cI gave you every opportunity to,\u201d she said, looking hurt. \u201cI practically begged you to tell me, but you opened up about everything except for that.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated. \u201cI was going to tell you everything later tonight, in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you were.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cIs there any reason why you didn\u2019t even tell me this when I said you were once my favorite lawyer in my interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. Once. The essays I used to read by Liam all stressed complete and utter honesty. I guess that all changed once he became Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey, don\u2019t...\u201d I stepped forward and she took a step back. \u201cI was honestly going to ask you to come to the final hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I use your town car to get home or do I need to call a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCab it is.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI wish you the best of luck with your testimony. And I hope you treat the next girl you find nicely from the beginning so she won\u2019t have to love and leave you alone in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a chance to talk, Aubrey...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing more to discuss.\u201d She opened the door. \u201cPlease do not follow me, Andrew. You can\u2019t trust me and I can\u2019t trust you, so I don\u2019t want anything to do with this anymore and I need you to finally respect that.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond, but she spoke first.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye Andrew, Liam,\u201d she said, \u201cwhatever the hell your name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d</p><p>The door slammed shut and I knew it was pointless to go after her in that moment.</p><p>She was gone.</p><p>Swear (v.):</p><p>To declare under oath that one will tell the truth.</p><p>Andrew</p><p>\u201cDo you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?\u201d The judge said to me a few mornings later.</p><p>I said nothing, the sudden departure of Aubrey still fresh on my mind.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton, I asked you a question.\u201d The judge chided.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d I said. \u201cI do swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help me God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe may proceed.\u201d</p><p>The defense lawyer stood up and cleared his throat. \u201cMr. Hamilton, your legal name was formerly Liam Henderson, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you please tell the court how you know my client, Kevin Hart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were once partners at Henderson &amp; Hart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartners and best friends, correct?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at an expressionless Kevin. He was dressed in a grey suit, still incapable of wearing a matching tie.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said to the lawyer. \u201cOnce upon a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that you got into an altercation with him at a bar six and a half years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine altercation.\u201d</p><p>He picked up a sheet of paper. \u201cDid you walk into a bar and punch him? Leaving him with a broken jaw and a fractured ribcage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was f**king my wife.\u201d</p><p>The jurors gasped and the judge banged his gavel.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton...\u201d The judge spoke sternly. \u201cThat type of language is not allowed in my courtroom. Please answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, I did injure Mr. Hart...Severely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimilarly to how you injured your own wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection!\u201d The prosecutor stood up. \u201cRelevance, Your Honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSustained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d The defense lawyer held up his hands in surrender. \u201cIs it true that you blame Mr. Hart for the downfall of your former firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly the Department of Justice does since he\u2019s the one on trial today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hamilton...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I clenched my jaw. \u201cYes, I blame him for the demise of our former firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that you also blame him for the unfortunate death of your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor!\u201d The prosecutor shot me a look of sympathy. \u201cRelevance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverruled...Answer the question, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d</p><p>I looked away from Kevin and balled my fists. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter died amidst the weeks leading up to the complete collapse of your firm, and within those weeks you managed to severely beat your partner, batter your wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t batter my f**king wife. She made that shit up. Have you done any f**king research?\u201d</p><p>The judge banged his gavel, but I continued talking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what low level community college was dumb enough to issue you a law degree, but the case between me and my wife was thrown out years ago because she lied about numerous things to a grand jury. And seeing as though she was sent to prison and I was cleared of all charges, you can accept that as a f**king fact. So, before you ask me another bullshit question and try to damage my character, remember that your client\u2019s livelihood is at stake during this trial. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>The judge let out a deep sigh, but he didn\u2019t say anything further. He just motioned for the defense to continue.</p><p>\u201cDuring your partnership, is it true that your wife was in charge of all the firm\u2019s monetary dealings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEx-wife. And yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you never thought to double check where she was allocating most of the funds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a degree in law, not accounting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you never thought it was slightly suspicious that your new firm was bringing in seven figures monthly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sighed, thinking back to those days, those clients. Everyone we dealt with had far more than I would earn in my lifetime and I thought nothing about the monthly profits Ava reported; I trusted her.</p><p>\u201cIs it fair to say that the demise of your firm could be due to your wife\u2019s handling of funding?\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d He picked up a sheet of paper and asked the judge if he could approach me. \u201cCould you read this to the court please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather not?\u201d He laughed. \u201cMr. Hamilton, as a lawyer yourself, surely you know that you will be held in contempt for refusing to read requested evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead it, Mr. Hamilton.\u201d The judge demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a f**king liar, Ava.\u201d I read my old words. \u201cYou\u2019ve f**ked so many people behind my back that I\u2019ve lost count. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you deserve to rot behind bars. Maybe then your overworked pu**y will get a much needed break.\u201d</p><p>A juror covered her mouth in shock, but I continued reading.</p><p>\u201cThank you for telling me that my c**k was never up to par, that after all those years of marriage you were never satisfied...Since you and Kevin have not only managed to take away my firm, but have also ruined the one thing that made my life worth living, accept this letter as a goodbye.\u201d I looked up at the defense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould you also read what you wrote after the PS?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cSince you\u2019ll only be around women for the next fifteen years, I suggest you give pu**y a try. The taste is quite impeccable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObjection, your honor.\u201d The prosecutor stood up. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this document is relevant to the case. The defense also failed to produce that letter during discovery. I move to strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSustained.

I had nowhere to go.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to bring up your daughter. I\u2019m so sorry...\u201d The prosecutor offered me a small smile. \u201cI\u2019ll redirect once he gets done...Your partner is definitely going down, he\u2019s just trying to discredit your character a bit, to make him look a little more sympathetic to the jury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are aware that I\u2019m a lawyer as well, right?\u201d I stepped off the stand. \u201cI know exactly what he\u2019s trying to do.\u201d</p><p>I stepped out of the court and outside into a heavy snowfall, looking up at the sky. I considered leaving the courthouse and risking contempt, but a part of me wanted to help seal the deal on Kevin\u2019s fate.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time coming\u2014all the lies, the betrayal, the pain, and he deserved whatever he was going to get.</p> <p>Someone tapped my shoulder from behind.</p><p>\u201cYou got a minute?\u201d A familiar voice asked. Kevin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured...\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhatever happens at the end of this trial\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you not hear what I said?\u201d I spun around to face him, taken aback by how haggard he looked up close. Time hadn\u2019t been good to him at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything me and Ava put you through,\u201d he said with a genuine look in his eyes. \u201cThe money and clients were coming in so fast and we were all so young...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYoung?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYoung and dumb, you know? It was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumb as f**k.\u201d I clenched my jaw. \u201cBut it was more than stupidity, Kevin. It was greed. And when the newspapers started to put the pieces together, when the clients started demanding answers, you both turned on me. You blamed me...You filed for custody of Emma, knowing damn well you didn\u2019t really want her. You just wanted to hurt me since you were her biological father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did.\u201d I could honestly admit that once and for all. \u201cYou really f**king did...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I could take it back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d I cut him off. \u201cBut you can tell me one thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe night you ruined my life...Well, not the first night, the night that came months later, were you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you f**king drinking that night?\u201d I glared at him and he sighed, looking down at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for finally being honest.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep even easier at night knowing that you\u2019ll be joining Ava behind bars after this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2019s back in prison?\u201d He looked hurt, disappointed.</p><p>\u201cNine more years.\u201d I smiled, but it quickly faded. \u201cSix more than what Emma got.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t give him a chance to respond. My heart was clenching at the thought of losing Emma again, at imagining all the pain she must\u2019ve felt on her last day, so I shut my eyes\u2014trying to block another dark memory from passing by.</p><p>Reasonable Doubt (n.):</p><p>Not being sure of a criminal defendant's guilt to a moral certainty.</p><p>Six years ago...</p><p>Liam Henderson</p><p>Living in New York never felt ordinary. Every day there was something new to discover, something I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>Even though I was still running on the fumes of winning one of the biggest, yet non-reported cases in the state, I was still trying to find myself\u2014personally and professionally. I was realizing that national popularity would always elude me, but as long as I was under-rated and not over-rated, I was perfectly fine with that.</p><p>I dropped a book of essays on my coffee table once I heard a loud knock at the door. It was a familiar loud and annoying one that my best friend Kevin always used.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you can\u2019t keep coming over in the middle of the\u2014\u201d I stopped talking when I realized it wasn\u2019t Kevin. It was a woman and a man, dressed in grey suits.</p><p>\u201cAre you Liam Andrew Henderson?\u201d The woman asked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Liam Andrew Henderson?\u201d The man spoke sternly.</p><p>\u201cDepends on who wants to know.\u201d</p><p>They both blinked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m Liam Henderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been served.\u201d The woman thrust a thick blue envelope into my hand, the tenth time this had happened to me this week.</p><p>\u201cIs this some type of joke? Is the New York Times trying to get a rise out of me again?\u201d</p><p>They exchanged glances, confused.</p><p>\u201cI was just doing my job,\u201d I said. \u201cIf they want to continue their pettiness by refusing to print my picture for the rest of their paper\u2019s life, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m okay with that, really. But serving me papers as a prank every day for a week and a half\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe SEC doesn\u2019t do pranks,\u201d the woman said, before they both walked away.</p><p>I shut my door and immediately called Kevin.</p><p>\u201cThis better be an emergency,\u201d he answered. \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas our firm pissed anyone off lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we have. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got served papers by the SEC, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you actually opened any of the other ones?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo of them,\u201d I walked over to my coffee table and pulled out a drawer. \u201cSomething about a client named Ferguson who claims we haven\u2019t been putting his money in escrow? He\u2019s suing us for five million and supposedly contacting our other clients. Do we even have a client named Ferguson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have three clients named Ferguson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we pissed any of them off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d He sounded concerned. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they would\u2019ve contacted us first before filing the charges, don\u2019t you think? Are you sure it\u2019s not The New York Times playing a mean joke on you? This is like the tenth letter you\u2019ve received.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first thing I asked tonight. They said it\u2019s not them.\u201d</p><p>We were both silent for several seconds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s them.\u201d We laughed in unison.</p><p>\u201cSorry for calling at this hour.\u201d I stuffed the envelope into the drawer with all the others. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d I hung up.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Emma walked into the living room, wiping her eyes as she walked over to me. \u201cCan I go play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s three in the morning, Emma.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go play...\u201d She smiled, giving me that look that made me incapable of saying no.</p><p>I smiled back and kissed her forehead, thinking of where we could possibly go out at this hour. Central Park was out of the question, as was any park, really. There was a twenty four hour donut shop nearby that we could walk to or\u2014</p><p>I stopped mid thought. Kevin was having a special playroom built for her at the office, a room that was twice the size of his own. He\u2019d said it would prevent me from using \u201cI have to go check on Emma\u201d as an excuse when we worked on demanding cases.</p><p>\u201cI know somewhere we can go.\u201d I picked her up and carried her to her room, helping her into her favorite shoes\u2014a pair of red rain boots she wore every day, even when it wasn\u2019t raining. \u201cOkay, go sit on the couch so I can get dressed and then we\u2019ll go okay?\u201d</p><p>She rushed out of her room without saying another word. I really needed to find a way to curb her wake-up-at-three-in-the-morning routine ASAP, but a part of me liked it. It was our special time together.</p><p>I put on a sweatshirt and sent my wife a quick email.</p><p>Subject: Emma.</p><p>Taking Emma out to play. Are you still at the coffee shop?</p><p>Love you,</p><p>Liam</p><p>Subject Re: Emma.</p><p>What are you going to say when she asks you for a pony?</p><p>(Yes, I\u2019m still here...Tax season is going to be the death of me. Want me to bring you a cup back? Want to try a latte?)</p><p>I love you more,</p><p>Ava</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Emma</p><p>Nothing. I\u2019ll just buy the pony.</p><p>(No, thank you. You know I really hate coffee.)</p><p>Impossible. I love you more than you\u2019ll ever know,</p><p>Liam</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready! I\u2019m ready!\u201d Emma rushed into my room, knocking over a stack of folders. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I put my phone in my pocket and attempted to stuff the papers back in order\u2014stopping once I saw my signature. Forged.</p><p>Confused, I sifted through the other papers-noticing the same thing.</p><p>What is this?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Daddy!\u201d Emma tugged on my pants.</p><p>I tucked the folder underneath my arm and clasped her hand. \u201cYour nap today is going to have to last for at least five hours. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like naps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t...\u201d I walked her out of our apartment and to my car. As usual, Ava had slipped a note underneath the windshield wipers.</p><p>Dear Husband,</p><p>I love you\u2014so very much, and it pains me to see you, someone with as much money and status as you have, driving a car like this. I know you\u2019re modest, and the most expensive suit you own probably costs eighty dollars, but come on! You have to live, Liam!</p><p>I\u2019m taking you car shopping next week and I\u2019m not taking no for an answer,</p><p>Ava.</p><p>PS\u2014Thank you for the roses you sent me yesterday. I got you something special and placed it on your desk at the office.</p><p>I smiled and secured Emma into her car seat, giving in when she requested to listen to her favorite song on repeat while riding to the firm.</p><p>The sleek design of the building still took people\u2019s breath away when they saw it for the first time. It was the one thing I spared no expense on when constructing; I made sure the translucent gold panels were state of the art, that the law scale statues were properly erected on marble ledges, and that the stone letters above the entrance\u2014\u201cHenderson &amp; Hart\u201d were polished every week.</p><p>And, as a giant \u201cfuck you\u201d to the government for burying my first case, the case that should\u2019ve made me a household name and landed me on billboards all over this country, I had the office built right in front of their Social Security Office.</p><p>Pulling into the reserved parking spot, I looked in my rearview mirror\u2014seeing that Emma was fast asleep.</p><p>Figures...</p><p>I stepped out and carried her inside anyway. I was sure she\u2019d wake up soon.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Henderson.\u201d An intern greeted me as I walked inside.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Laura,\u201d I responded. \u201cAm I in a different time zone today? Why is everyone awake and working right now?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. \u201cIt\u2019s tax season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep hearing that...\u201d I stepped onto the elevator. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>Emma stirred in my arms, murmuring, but only soft snores followed.</p><p>When the elevator doors glided open, I walked through the massive \u201cH&amp;H\u201d glass doors headed to Emma\u2019s half-finished playroom. I gently lowered her onto the massive pink bed and tucked her under the covers, whispering \u201cI love you,\u201d before I dimmed the lights. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took a seat in the corner and pulled out the folder that was under my arm, reading over what seemed like written receipts and accounts of money exchanges. Things I didn\u2019t recall doing.</p><p>I pulled out my phone to text Ava, to see if this was just another elaborate joke\u2014something she was prone to pulling, but I heard her voice.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d She yelled.</p><p>I jumped up and headed to where the shouting had come from, pausing once I heard a familiar voice.</p> <p>\u201cYour pu**y feels so f**king good...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhhh....\u201d Ava was moaning. \u201cJust f**k me...Fuck me harder...\u201d</p><p>I completely froze, unable to take another step. I didn\u2019t want to believe another man\u2014Kevin, from the sound of things, was f**king my wife or that she was cheating on me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it. I trusted her way too much.</p><p>But, as she screamed a few more times\u2014the same screams she yelled when having sex with me, I knew it was true.</p> <p>\u201cIs this how you always conduct business, Mrs. Henderson?\u201d Kevin asked, laughter in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously going to call me that after we just f**ked?\u201d She groaned. \u201cCan we actually get back to work now? That\u2019s the third interruption tonight and I\u2019d actually like to get something done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine...\u201d</p><p>Papers shuffled, windows opened, but I remained frozen\u2014still in disbelief. It wasn\u2019t until I peered through the slit of the door that my brain actually began to process what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about this Ferguson shit?\u201d Kevin asked.</p><p>\u201cFerguson shit? That\u2019s what we\u2019re calling it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right. Here\u2019s a better name for it: Five to ten years for me. Fifteen years for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty?\u201d He slammed the table. \u201cAre you out of your f**king mind? Twenty years? Are you suggesting that we just turn ourselves in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d she said. \u201cJust Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sounded appalled. \u201cAre you joking right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hear me laughing?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cAva, look...\u201d He sighed. \u201cLiam is like a brother to me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSays the man who\u2019s currently f**king his wife...Some brother you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake would be one time,\u201d she said, lighting a cigarette. \u201cOnce a day for the past few years isn\u2019t necessarily the same thing. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank.</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake, Ava.\u201d He looked conflicted. \u201cTonight was going to be the last time anyway. I can\u2019t keep doing this to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d She walked over to the window and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give me what I need anymore...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to find a way that he can. Now actually might be a good time to start, seeing as though he might have to be your lawyer.\u201d</p><p>She turned around in tears. \u201cIs this really the last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time should\u2019ve been the last time.\u201d He walked over and massaged her shoulders. \u201cYou were only using me...You tend to forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She choked back a sob. \u201cI wasn\u2019t using you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you were.\u201d He kissed her lips. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay. I sympathized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was a horrible person?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, cupping her face in his hands. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t give you a baby and you wanted one...Naturally...That\u2019s completely understandable.\u201d</p><p>I held back a gasp.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t f**k me like you do...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Ava.\u201d He kissed her cheek. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to hear anymore.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>As the two of them kissed and held each other\u2014completely immersing themselves in their own world, I forced myself to walk away.</p><p>I hit the lights in my office and noticed a bright blue box on my desk. It read, \u201cTo: the love of my life. From: Your first and only love.\u201d</p><p>My heart ached again as I tore the wrapping and looked inside: A new set of cufflinks, a set that probably cost more than all of my suits combined. My initials were engraved in them, and she\u2019d enclosed a quote from my favorite authors:</p><p>\u201cDo not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of life much so. Aim above morality.\u201d</p><p>-Henry David Thoreau</p><p>I sighed. She\u2019d left out the last part of the quote, the \u201cBe not simply good; be good for something.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out my phone and sent her an email:</p><p>Subject: Coffee.</p><p>I think I will try some coffee...Are you still at the coffee shop?</p><p>\u2014Liam</p><p>Subject: Re: Coffee.</p><p>Yes. I think I\u2019ll be here all night.</p><p>What kind would you like?</p><p>\u2014Ava.</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Coffee.</p><p>Whatever you think is best for a first timer...</p><p>Have you talked to Kevin today?</p><p>\u2014Ava</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Re: Coffee.</p><p>Not at all. He\u2019s been weirder than usual lately. (We really need to find him a girlfriend...) Have you?</p><p>\u2014Ava.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I left my office and walked over to Emma\u2019s playroom, looking at her as she slept peacefully. I wanted to make her wake up, make her look at me, so I could study her features and pick them apart, so I could see for myself that she was indeed Kevin\u2019s, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She was mine, biological father or not.</p><p>I carried her out of the firm and rushed home. As soon as I set her down, I flipped over the coffee table and opened the envelope I\u2019d filed away hours earlier.</p><p>It was a standard summons, a demand to appear in court, but the charges listed didn\u2019t end on one page. They didn\u2019t even end on two.</p><p>It was a ten page manifesto, a laundry list of bullshit that I would never attempt: bribery, racketeering, tax fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud\u2014every f**king fraud.</p><p>What the hell is this?</p><p>I pored over the documents for hours, my mind racing a mile a minute. Still, I couldn\u2019t completely process everything\u2014my mind was still thinking about Kevin and Ava.</p><p>How she\u2019d lied to me.</p><p>How he\u2019d lied to me, too.</p><p>And now, this.</p><p>The door opened at five in the morning, and Ava set a hot cup of coffee in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said.</p><p>I said nothing. Just closed all the folders and looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI just got served by the SEC...\u201d She paced the floor. \u201cServed, like legit papers...They came to the firm and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were at the coffee shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI stopped by the firm after getting your coffee so I could pick up a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas anyone there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cLook at what time it is. Anyway...\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hear anything else she was saying. I could see her lips moving, make out some of the sounds that were coming out of her mouth, but the lies she\u2019d just told me were blocking out everything.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you cheating on me?\u201d I blurted out, suddenly annoyed by the tears falling down her face.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and looked me up and down. \u201cLiam, the SEC has just unreasonably served me papers. Are you seriously accusing me of infidelity right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. An accusation would imply that there\u2019s a chance you could be innocent. Why. Are. You. Cheating. On. Me?</p><p>She toyed with the gemstones on her necklace. Then she started to hum the refrain of a classic Sinatra song, \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me ask you again, Ava,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you\u2019ve f**ked Kevin.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes finally met mine. \u201cFine...Yes, I f**ked him. Now, what?\u201d Tears formed in her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to happen. I never thought I would cross the line with him of all people...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Emma was a surprise...\u201d I said. \u201cThat you didn\u2019t want to have kids until we were in our mid-thirties.\u201d</p><p>Her face paled. \u201cYou were at the office tonight weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said, mentally putting together the puzzle pieces. \u201cEither you\u2019re lying to him about me not being able to give you a baby\u2014because last time I checked, right before Emma was miraculously conceived, you were still making me wear condoms and we weren\u2019t even trying to have a f**king baby. Or, you\u2019re lying to me, and you just wanted to f**k my best friend for an ulterior motive you\u2019re saving for later. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still love you, Liam, It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is it?\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, she just stood there with more tears falling down her eyes.</p><p>I held up one of the folders I\u2019d been reading through. \u201cI was looking through these tonight...At first, I thought they were standard mail-outs that you\u2019d signed for me while I was gone or too busy, standard office supply orders, things like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you find those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it turns out,\u201d I said, ignoring her question, \u201cThat these are all f**king favors from judges and clerks that I don\u2019t recall asking for. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone in this city that you haven\u2019t f**ked to get something in return?\u201d</p><p>She looked as if she actually had to think about it.</p><p>\u201cI send you flowers every day\u2014every. f**king. day.\u201d I stepped forward. \u201cI tell you that I love you and that you complete me, every day and this is what I get in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand how you feel, Liam, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t f**king understand.\u201d I clenched my fists. \u201cI\u2019ve never even entertained the thought of being friends with another woman. I make sure everyone knows I\u2019m completely unavailable, that no one else stands a damn chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cheated for your benefit, Liam. I did it for you.\u201d</p><p>What the f**k?</p><p>I\u2019d heard a lot of bullshit in my life, but that line officially took the cake.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think you won the Luttrell case?\u201d She wiped away her tears and narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cYou think you did it with your award winning rhetoric and charm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a mental disorder that you failed to tell me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI f**ked the judge three days before the verdict. You were going to lose. And if you lost that case, there\u2019s no way some of our current clients would\u2019ve picked our firm to handle their account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you built it alone?\u201d She laughed. \u201cLiam Henderson, warm-hearted, loyal, and too nice for his own f**king good? Please. I had to intercept every contract you sent out and redraft half of the terms. If I\u2019d left it up to you, your firm would be nothing more than a pipe dream. You should be thanking me because you have no idea how much work I\u2019ve done to put you where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never argued a single case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve f**ked a lot of powerful people to make sure you never lost one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lost because I\u2019m a damn good lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a damn good lay.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOf course, my own husband has been so busy this year that he probably wouldn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blaming me for throwing your pu**y around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shocked you even know what the word pu**y means.\u201d She hissed. \u201cWe lay in bed together every night and you never want to f**k me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always say that you\u2019re tired.

Divorce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a serious question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She smirked and a knock came to the door.</p> <p>We both stood rooted to the floor, and the knock came again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d I warned. \u201cYou stay there.\u201d</p><p>I walked away and opened it, expecting to see Kevin so I could punch the shit out of him, but it was a different woman in a suit.</p><p>A young blonde.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve um...\u201d Her cheeks reddened. \u201cYou\u2019ve been...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cServed!\u201d Someone whispered loudly from around the corner. \u201cTell him he\u2019s been served...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an intern at The New York Times, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>She nodded, but then she added. \u201cMy boss says you can go f**k yourself, and that even though we\u2019ll never run your picture, we\u2019ll make sure everyone knows that your firm is about to be run into the ground starting tomorrow.\u201d She handed me the copy print for an article in tomorrow\u2019s paper. \u201cHe says it\u2019s your turn to feel some karma.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the door in her face.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to seriously weigh your options before you act out on your emotions.\u201d Ava was right behind me, holding a sleeping Emma.</p><p>\u201cIs this a threat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a promise...\u201d</p><p>I raised my eyebrow. \u201cAnd what exactly are the proposed terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you help me sort this thing out\u2014if you get the SEC off the firm\u2019s back, both of us can avoid serving any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not serving any f**king time. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. And if you think I won\u2019t be the first person in line to help the state put your ass away, you\u2019re sadly f**king mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww.\u201d She pouted. \u201cLook at you. Trying to sound all masculine and tough for a change, sounding like the man I wish you could\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ava.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cLet me try phrasing this another way: I know that you\u2019re Mr. Lawyer of the Year and you\u2019d never willingly lie because you have a conscience and all that. But if you don\u2019t help me, or if you refuse to tell investigators that you were partly responsible for what happened\u2014that we all played a small part, I\u2019m filing for sole custody of Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFile away. No judge in his right mind would give you sole custody.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cThis is actually why people f**k to get what they want, honey. It comes in handy for times like this. Besides, you\u2019re not even her real father.\u201d She kissed Emma\u2019s forehead. \u201cDid you overhear that part while you were watching us f**k or were you too busy taking notes?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t get a chance to answer.</p><p>\u201cDo not f**k with me, Liam.\u201d She hissed. \u201cYou have no idea how far I\u2019m willing to go to stay out of prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you deserve to be there?\u201d I snatched Emma away from her, making her stir. \u201cYou sought out clients using my name and you misappropriated the money. For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStatus. Something you\u2019ll never understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething you\u2019ll never need.\u201d I countered. \u201cEveryone behind bars shares the same level of popularity.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a few days to come to your senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know the answer to that.\u201d She walked out, slamming the door behind her\u2014waking Emma.</p><p>She looked at me with her bright blue eyes, smiling. \u201cCan I go play?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unable to even speak. Carrying her to the balcony, I didn\u2019t even bother grabbing an umbrella for myself. I set her down and helped her into a coat, trying not to think about what Ava could possibly have up her sleeve.</p><p>Emma tilted her head up to the sky and swallowed raindrops, and then she dashed away from me\u2014running in circles.</p><p>A loud thunder roared in the distance, and as if she could tell what I was about to say, she looked at me with a wide grin. \u201cFive more minutes!\u201d</p><p>The New York Times didn\u2019t waste any time printing the story. Well, stories.</p><p>Henderson &amp; Hart, Revered Law Firm, Embroiled in Scandal.</p><p>Hart Agrees to Cooperate Against Henderson, Following Brutal Bar Brawl.</p><p>Henderson Arrested, Questioned, After Wife Claims Recent Domestic Abuse.</p><p>The only story they didn\u2019t mention, out of a hanging thread of respect, was my losing custody of Emma. Of me having to hand her over to Kevin.</p><p>I was innocent of every charge I faced, but due to the fact that I\u2019d bashed Kevin\u2019s head in, and Ava had claimed I was just as violent with her, it left the judge no choice but to put her in custody with her supposed \u201cloving and biological father per the mother\u2019s request.\u201d</p><p>I thought it would only be for a week or two, a month at most, but as the charges piled up and the cases were trudged through the courts at a snail\u2019s pace, the months wore on and on.</p><p>To make matters worse, Kevin and Ava purposely took Emma to places they knew I frequented: My favorite place at Central Park, my spot on the Brooklyn Bridge, my favorite restaurants.</p><p>In between my court appearances, I followed them to the park\u2014resisting the urge to yell at them for letting her get too close to the streets, holding back the urge to take her back and flee the state.</p><p>Instead, I filed injunction after injunction\u2014fighting multiple cases at once. I searched through every loophole of custody, documenting cases after case of non-biological fathers retaining rights.</p><p>Eventually the truth about Ava and Kevin\u2019s scheme began to surface, and on the same day that Ava confessed to lying about me beating her\u2014when she admitted that she\u2019d made that all up, I won custody of Emma.</p><p>It was three days before her fourth birthday, so I arranged for a few of her neighborhood friends to come by with their parents. The theme was the rainforest, of course, and the party favors were umbrellas and rain-boots.</p><p>Kevin, still foolishly proclaiming his innocence in regards to the fraud, had grown quite attached to her over the past few months. He asked if he could still see her on the weekends once he returned her to me, but I didn\u2019t even bother answering that question.</p><p>He\u2019d seen her long enough.</p><p>Standing outside my brownstone, I called him two hours before her birthday party, making sure he was still dropping her off on time. Instead of talking to me like an adult, he made Emma repeat his every word to me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d she said, a smile in her soft voice. \u201cCan you please let us enjoy our last few hours alone? She\u2019s my daughter, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you soon, Emma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Daddy!\u201d She hung up and I rearranged the party decorations for the umpteenth time, greeting the early guests and directing them into the living room.</p><p>Half an hour passed.</p><p>A whole hour.</p><p>Two.</p><p>I called Kevin, annoyed that he was pulling this bullshit of a stunt\u2014as if it was even half as difficult as it had been for me, but there was no answer.</p><p>Upset, I dialed the police and they showed up to my door within minutes.</p><p>\u201cAre you Liam Henderson?\u201d They asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m the one that called.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the court order out of my pocket and explained what was happening, how Kevin was technically committing kidnapping, but they interrupted me.</p><p>They weren\u2019t at my house to take a report.</p><p>They were there to give one.</p><p>As they calmly explained what had happened, how she was less than a block away when the car collided with a truck, my world stopped.</p><p>I asked which hospital she was being flown to, which route was the fastest to take, but the cops simply sighed and looked past me, as if they didn\u2019t want to say anything further.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Their looks said it all.</p><p>Emma\u2019s funeral was held on a grey and wet day, another harsh blow to my chest. I sat through speeches from the few people she\u2019d crossed paths with, from her young friends who had yet to fully comprehend what her death really meant.</p><p>My next door neighbor, a four year old named Hannah, said, \u201cI hope you come back next week, Emma. You can come to my birthday party.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the tiny casket as they lowered it into the ground, half of me wanting to jump in with it and risk being buried alive. At least then I wouldn\u2019t have to feel anything anymore.</p><p>As the crowd dissipated one by one\u2014tapping my shoulder and saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d as they left, I spotted Ava walking into the cemetery.</p><p>Flanked by two prison guards, she fell to her knees and bawled once she reached the uncovered grave.</p><p>\u201cYou made me late for my child\u2019s funeral.\u201d She cursed at the guards. \u201cI f**king missed it...How cruel can you possibly be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll furloughs have the same time constraints, ma\u2019am,\u201d one of them said flatly. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have left any earlier.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and continued to cry, beating her hands against the ground. As if she needed to distance herself from the guilt, she stood up and walked towards the podium, reading the papers that were left behind.</p><p>She broke down again and I walked over.</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d She held out her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s really gone, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d I refused to console her. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all your fault, Ava. Your f**king fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d She sniffled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should be you down there in the ground right now. It should be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve to be taken away from me and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that...I was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to prove a point? To do whatever it took to hurt me because you f**ked yourself over and you wanted to bring me down with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can get through this...We can still find a way to restore your name in this city, and you\u2019re the best lawyer I know so...I know you can turn everything around and maybe help me too. Maybe forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do everything in my power to make sure you rot in prison, to make sure you never get out and that the parole board never gives you an ounce of sympathy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, Liam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever find a way to get away with murder, you and Kevin will be my first victims.\u201d</p><p>The guard across from us gave me a look.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this, Liam...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name won\u2019t be Liam for too much longer just so you know. It\u2019ll be Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving? Are you about to leave me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should be you in the ground right now...\u201d I noticed the funeral director stacking the chairs, mindlessly breaking down what was just another ceremony to him. \u201cThat should be you...\u201d</p><p>One of the guards began speaking with the funeral staff, inquiring as to whether they should leave the premises or not. Noticing her time here was limited, Ava grabbed onto me. \u201cLiam, I mean...Andrew. You clearly still love me because you\u2019re trusting me with that...We can rebuild everything we had, we can start over, you and me...We can do this if you help me...\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her hands and moved them away as one of the guards stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t belong in prison,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cThey\u2019re transferring me to a permanent location next week...Save me, Andrew...Save me...\u201d</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIf I could take everything back, I swear...I swear I would. Don\u2019t you think I love Emma, too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLoved,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s past tense now, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d I stepped back so the guards could escort her back to the van. \u201cI\u2019ll write...\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her eyes looked hopeful as she walked away. \u201cOkay, I look forward to your letters...I look forward to fixing us...\u201d</p> <p>The rain picked up its pace, transitioning from a drizzle to a downpour, but I remained standing\u2014unable to walk away from Emma. I re-read her tiny tombstone, crying as her face crossed my mind.</p><p>Emma Rose Henderson,</p><p>A Daddy\u2019s girl, through and through.</p><p>Gone too soon,</p><p>But never forgotten...</p> <p>I stared at those words for hours, letting the rain drench me to the bone. It wasn\u2019t until the director informed me that the gates were closing, that I walked away.</p><p>Lost and heartbroken, I spent the next few months in a dizzying haze. Despite the fact that Ava was the one behind bars, the paper continued spouting her lies as facts, slandering me, and I didn\u2019t even bother disputing it.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>I submitted written testimonies through lawyers I\u2019d hired\u2014knowing that eventually things would sort themselves out. I didn\u2019t even care that Ava had hired her own high profile team to block me from getting a divorce.</p><p>I no longer gave a f**k about anything.</p><p>My firm collapsed before my very eyes\u2014everything down to the sink-ware was sold off in parts, and in the legal community, the downfall became a warning, a tell-tale of what happened when status and greed consumed one of us.</p> <p>I drank every morning, letting the alcohol numb my pain. And whenever I awoke from passing out, I drank again. It was only when I started drinking coffee that I could somewhat function well enough to get anything done.</p><p>Visiting the cemetery was too painful, almost as painful as stepping inside Emma\u2019s room. So, I hired a few people to pack it away in boxes, telling them to leave out the \u201cE\u201d and \u201cH\u201d frames; I could bear to look at those since she\u2019d hand-picked them.</p><p>For months, I mourned the life she would never have\u2014attempting to make sense of it all. I knew deep down that I couldn\u2019t stay here, but I couldn\u2019t leave as the same man that I was; I knew that I\u2019d never get over Emma, but I needed a way to cope. A way to slowly re-integrate myself into the real world.</p><p>Stopping by a newspaper stand, my eyes caught an article about the newest hotshot lawyer in town\u2014Michael Weston. Dressed in one of the expensive suits that Kevin once raved about, he was the talk of the city and from the words I was reading, he was cocky\u2014only slightly cockier than I had become recently.</p><p>\u201cOh, you got the last one...\u201d A woman said as she stepped next to me.</p><p>\u201cYou want this paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She blushed. \u201cNot really the paper. I just want the ad of Michael Weston so I can show my friends my ideal dream guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you read some of the shit he\u2019s said in this interview?\u201d I raised my eyebrow. \u201cHe\u2019s an ass**le.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat just makes him more loveable, don\u2019t you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked him what he does when he gets less than favorable reviews.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe how f**king gullible this woman looked. \u201cDo you want to know what he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cWhat does he do when he gets bad reviews?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks at his bank account,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then he claims, and I quote, \u2018I don\u2019t recall learning that someone needs to be well-liked in order to be successful.\u2019 He really said that.\u201d</p><p>She practically melted into the sidewalk. \u201cI bet he really knows how to f**k...\u201d</p><p>I gave her the paper and walked away. Her bringing up sex was a reminder of how long it\u2019d been since I slept with someone.</p><p>And then it hit me: Sex.</p><p>I needed some, badly.</p><p>I signed up for an online dating site, Date-Match, and slowly shed the layers of the man I used to be. I bought expensive suits\u2014one for every day of the week. I slowly curbed my excessive drinking to make room for a new appetite, and instead of punching my walls to de-stress, I invested in Cuban cigars.</p><p>Still, the women I met online were average, and none of them seemed to be about sex. They just wanted to talk about bullshit\u2014always leaving me restless and alone at the end of the night to drink away my sorrows; forcing me back to square one with my experiment.</p><p>Like the woman who was sitting on the edge of the bed right now, a goddamn mile-a-minute talker. She was a few years older than me, a teacher of some sort, and she couldn\u2019t shut up for shit.</p><p>She was talking about her life in college, about some boy named Billy she once loved\u2014some boy who never loved her back. Before she could start elaborating about the campus bond-fire where the two of them met, I realized that I couldn\u2019t take this shit anymore.</p><p>\u201cBilly and I would\u2019ve been perfect together, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was even this one time that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to f**k or what?\u201d I cut her off.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She clutched her chest. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, are we going to f**k or what?\u201d I emphasized every syllable. \u201cI didn\u2019t reserve this hotel room so I could sit and listen to you talk all night.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cI thought that...\u201d She stuttered. \u201cI thought that you liked me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you enough to f**k you. That\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went wide and she stepped back. \u201cAll this time that we\u2019ve been dating you\u2019ve only been thinking about sleeping with me?\u201d</p><p>I mentally added \u201crhetorical questions\u201d to the list of shit I wasn\u2019t going to put up with anymore.</p><p>\u201cI was under the impression that all those dates you took me on was because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took you on all those dates so we could scratch the surface of each other\u2019s personalities. So I could know that you\u2019re not some psycho-murderer, and so you could be assured that I\u2019m not one either.\u201d I grimaced at all the time I\u2019d clearly wasted. \u201cThe purpose was so the both of us could be comfortable enough to f**k, and then after that we could go our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was only going to be once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a hearing problem?\u201d</p><p>She looked completely lost, and I wasn\u2019t in the mood to make this picture any clearer.</p><p>Before I could say another word, she looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, still in shock, \u201call the things on your profile were a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Everything on my profile is one hundred percent accurate.\u201d I pulled out my phone. \u201cI specifically wrote what I\u2019m in for, and I\u2019ve been more than lenient spending my time with you. You seem like a nice person, but after tonight\u2014whether we f**k or not, I won\u2019t be speaking to you again. So, what\u2019s it going to be?\u201d</p><p>She stood there, her jaw dropped once more, and I glanced at my profile.</p><p>Sure enough, I\u2019d forgotten to adjust the default settings when I\u2019d signed up for Date-Match, and my \u201cWhat I\u2019m Looking For\u201d box was still set to bullshit: \u201cLong conversations, a connection with someone I can truly relate to, and finding my one true love.\u201d</p><p>Ha...</p><p>I quickly erased all of the text and looked up, noticing that my date for tonight was still in the room.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue standing here,\u201d I said,\u201d I\u2019m going to assume that you do want to f**k tonight. If not, the door\u2019s right behind you.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her huffing was the last sound I heard before the door slammed so hard it rattled the mirror on the wall.</p><p>Unfazed, I contemplated what I wanted to write in my profile\u2019s box. Over the past few months, I\u2019d found disappointment after disappointment\u2014wasting too much of my time and money on women who were not on the same wavelength as me.</p><p>And now it all made perfect sense. All those unnecessary dinners, late night conversations, and utter bullshit was about to end right now.</p><p>I didn\u2019t need another relationship\u2014those days were gone forever, and I would never spend more than a week talking to the same woman on the phone.</p><p>As the sun set outside the hotel room\u2019s window, the perfect phrasing came to me, and I typed: One dinner. One night. No repeats.</p><p>Then I highlighted it and placed it in bold.</p><p>Staring at it, I realized how bare it looked, how someone might actually think I wasn\u2019t dead ass serious, so underneath, I made things completely clear:</p><p>Casual sex.

He didn\u2019t give me a chance to get undressed. His hands were all over me\u2014unbuttoning my shirt, ripping my bra, and caressing my br**sts.</p><p>I reached forward and unbuckled his pants, pushing his pants down. Then he tossed me onto the bed, climbing on top of me.</p><p>I spread my legs beneath him, lifting my hips up so he could f**k me, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he kissed my neck\u2014whispering how much he missed me, how much he needed me.</p><p>\u201cAndrew...\u201d I felt his c**k rubbing against my thigh.</p><p>He slowly moved his mouth to my chest\u2014swirling his tongue across my ni**les as he palmed my br**sts. His kisses traveled further and further, all the way down to my thighs.</p><p>I shut my eyes as he pressed his tongue against my clit, as he teasingly darted it against me in slow, sensuous circles.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh...\u201d I tried to clamp my legs shut, but he pinned them to the mattress and looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cAubrey...\u201d His voice was low.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He circled his thumb around my clit, making it swell in pleasure. \u201cTell me that I own this.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes as he increased the pressure, rubbing his thumb around and around.</p><p>\u201cTell me that I own your pu**y, Aubrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d I writhed underneath his hand. \u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d He prevented me from rolling over. \u201cI need you to say it.\u201d</p><p>Tingles traveled up and down my spine and I finally stared back at him. \u201cYes...You own it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and pressed his head between my legs again, devouring me\u2014making me scream at the top of my lungs, but he didn\u2019t let me cum.</p><p>Instead, he flipped me over. \u201cGet down on all fours.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath and slowly obliged, and the next thing I felt was him palming my ass, kissing his way down my spine.</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t claimed every inch of you...\u201d he said, squeezing my cheeks harshly. \u201cBut I\u2019ll save that for when I think you\u2019re ready...\u201d</p><p>I murmured as he slid into my pu**y inch by inch, making me lean forward. He took the elastic out of my hair and pulled me back, whispering, \u201cIt\u2019s going to feel just like this...Maybe even better...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhhh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when it happens, you\u2019re going to let me cum inside of you...\u201d His other hand skimmed my sides and squeezed my br**sts. \u201cI want you to feel every last drop...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew.\u201d I gripped the sheets.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He was slapping my ass as he pounded into me, giving it to me rough as he whispered my name.</p><p>I met him thrust for thrust, unable to let go of the sheets, and when I felt myself nearing the edge\u2014coming close to it as he tortured my clit with his fingers, he denied me once again.</p><p>He pulled out of me, making me whimper, and then he made me face him once again. Immediately burying himself inside of me, he stared into my eyes\u2014slowly sliding his c**k back and forth, suffocating my screams with his mouth.</p><p>I felt his c**k throbbing inside of me, felt my muscles clenching as he cursed against my lips and as we locked eyes again, we both came at the same time.</p><p>I fell forward against his chest, panting. \u201cAndrew, I...\u201d</p><p>He cut me off with a kiss. \u201cI love you, too...\u201d</p><p>We lay there connected for what felt like forever\u2014him threading his fingers through my hair, me rubbing my hands against his chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>He rolled out of bed and stood up to toss away the condom. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move. I was still feeling weak from my last orgasm.</p><p>He shook his head and slipped his hands underneath my thighs, picking me up and carrying me out of the room, checking each door we passed. When we reached the bathroom, he set me down on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can stand up long enough for a shower...\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He ignored me and turned on the water. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take a shower.\u201d He picked me up and gently placed me into the tub.</p><p>Climbing in behind me, he grabbed an empty bottle and filled it with warm water. Then he gently poured it over my head.</p><p>He grabbed some shampoo from the ledge and squirted a few drops into my hair, lathering it to suds.</p><p>I heard him asking me questions, something about how I was feeling or if I wanted to talk to him about whatever I had on my mind, but as his fingers continued to massage my scalp, everything went black.</p><p>I woke up in bed alone.</p><p>There was no note from Andrew, and all of his clothes were gone.</p><p>I was starting to think having sex with him was all a dream, but I spotted his wallet sitting on top of my nightstand. I pulled the covers off of me and smiled once I saw that he\u2019d dressed me in a silk slip.</p><p>I made my way out of the room and down the hallway where he was standing out on my balcony smoking a cigar.</p><p>\u201cSince when do you smoke?\u201d I stepped behind him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t often,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly when I need to think.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and looked out into the night sky, but I suddenly felt him pulling me against him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to ask what I\u2019m thinking about?\u201d He smirked. \u201cSurely you have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want...\u201d He put out his cigar and walked me over to a chair, pulling me into his lap. \u201cHow long have you known about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple weeks...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDo Bach and Greenwood know who you really are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why do you have to hide it from everyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEsteemed lawyer or not, no one wants to take on someone who has a history in the papers...It makes a high profile firm look bad.\u201d He kissed the back of my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat was Emma like?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, looking at me. \u201cShe was perfect...\u201d</p><p>I thought of a way to change the subject, but he continued talking.</p><p>\u201cShe hated when I went to work, and she would beg me to come sometimes, so I\u2019d let her...\u201d His voice was low. \u201cAnd then I wouldn\u2019t get any work done because the park was right across the street and she always wanted to play...Always.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid she follow you around at home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cShe was my shadow.

I should\u2019ve been happy and smiling\u2014overjoyed at the fact that I was about to debut in the leading role in a New York Ballet Company production, but I wasn\u2019t. Far from it.</p><p>I felt alone, and I knew no amount of applause or accolades would take those feelings away.</p><p>I was still hanging onto my last few moments with Andrew: The early morning sex in the shower, the sex against my door, the sex in the town car on the way to the airport. (And there was also the final romp in the airport\u2019s bathroom...)</p><p>He told me that he loved me each time\u2014that he didn\u2019t want to leave me, but he left anyway.</p><p>Our relationship was now relegated to talking on the phone every night\u2014recapping our days, getting off on each other\u2019s fantasies in between, but it wasn\u2019t enough.

Staring at myself, I looked over tonight\u2019s costume\u2014a glimmering white visage that looked like it\u2019d been plucked from a dream: Sparkling crystals adorned every inch of the leotard, the tutu was freshly fluffed and sprayed with glitter, and my feathered headband was far more defined and layered than the one I\u2019d worn in Durham.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d A familiar voice said from behind.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I spun around. \u201cWhat are you doing backstage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to come and tell you good luck in person.\u201d She nodded at my father.</p><p>\u201cThank you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe also want you to know that despite the fact that we still wish you\u2019d pursued law school, we\u2019re very proud of you for pursuing your own dreams.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThank you, again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we are also very, very honored to have you as our daughter because you\u2019re such an inspiration to all the college students who will be heading to the polls in this year\u2019s election\u2014students who have similar dreams and ambitions regarding careers in the arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get all that?\u201d She turned to the reporter behind us who was shutting off his device. \u201cMake sure you use that last part as a sound bite for the next commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI meant every word of that, but it\u2019s also good to get it on tape, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother with a rebuttal.</p><p>My father stepped over and hugged me, posing for an unnatural photo-op, but when the photographer walked away he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, Aubrey,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because you think me being here means I won\u2019t mess up the campaign at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know you being here means you won\u2019t mess up the campaign at home.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut I\u2019m still happy for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow reassuring...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d my mother chimed in. \u201cWe\u2019re excited for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen we are about to begin our show in exactly one hour!\u201d Mr. Ashcroft bellowed. \u201cIf you are not a ballerina, a danseur, or a stagehand please find your way off my stage. Now!\u201d</p><p>My parents embraced me\u2014holding onto me for a long time. As they pulled back, they took turns kissing my cheek before they walked away.</p><p>I adjusted my headband one last time and checked my phone. Sure enough, there was an email. Andrew.</p><p>Subject: Good luck.</p><p>I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t make it to your first opening night, but I look forward to hearing about it tonight when you call me.</p><p>I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be quite memorable to everyone in the audience.</p><p>\u2014Andrew.</p><p>PS\u2014I miss you.</p><p>Subject: Re: Good luck.</p><p>I am not calling you tonight. You should\u2019ve been here. I\u2019ll think about recapping it for you next week.</p><p>\u2014Aubrey.</p><p>PS\u2014You \u201cmissing me\u201d would be a lot more convincing if the subject of the email you sent two hours ago wasn\u2019t \u201cI miss your pu**y.\u201d</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Good luck.</p><p>I know I should\u2019ve been there. Hence the aforementioned apology.</p><p>And you will call me.</p><p>\u2014Andrew</p><p>PS\u2014I miss you both.</p><p>Subject: Re: Re: Re: Good luck.</p><p>I really wanted you to be here...</p><p>\u2014Aubrey</p><p>I turned off my phone so I wouldn\u2019t have to continue messaging him. I needed to focus.</p><p>All the rehearsals and dance lessons I\u2019d taken over the past twenty-two years had brought me to this moment. In thirty-six minutes, my every move would be on display for one of the biggest audiences in the dance world.</p><p>It would draw critiques from the staunchest critics\u2014the most advent admirers of ballet, and the papers would run early reviews that could make or break the remaining production run. But right now, in this moment, none of that mattered.</p><p>This was my dream, I was finally living it, and I could only make sure I was the best I could possibly be.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Miss Everhart?\u201d Mr. Ashcroft placed his hands on my shoulders. \u201cAre you ready to show this city that you belong here?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cVery much so, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m ready for them to see that, too.\u201d He clapped his hands above his head, signaling the rest of the dancers to circle us.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it is officially opening night,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard for months, logged every necessary hour and then some, and I do believe that tonight\u2019s execution of Swan Lake will be the best execution this audience will ever see.\u201d He paused. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t, I\u2019ll make sure you pay for it at tomorrow morning\u2019s rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>There were groans. We knew he wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sitting in the balcony at center stage, and I will not give you one clap, no inkling of applause, if the show is anything less than perfect. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d We collectively murmured, still intimidated by his power.</p><p>\u201cGood. Take your places now.\u201d He walked away from us and snapped his fingers. \u201cMake me proud.\u201d</p><p>I took my place at center stage and turned my back to the curtain\u2014raising my hands above my head. I heard the orchestra giving their instruments one final tuning, heard the pianist replaying the refrain he missed at this morning\u2019s rehearsal, and then I heard silence.</p><p>Ear deafening silence.</p><p>The lights in the gallery flickered, slow at first then faster, and everything went black.</p><p>Five...Four...Three...Two...</p><p>The pianist played the first stanza of the composition and the curtains rose, cueing the spotlight to shine against my back.</p><p>The swan corps\u2014twenty ballerinas dressed in complementing white tutus, formed a circle around me, and as they stood on their toes, tilting their heads back, I slowly turned around to face the audience\u2014pausing, taking all of the nameless faces in, and then I became lost in my own world.</p><p>I was Odette, The Swan Queen, and I was falling in love with a prince at first sight, dancing with him underneath a glittering orb of lights, telling him he needed to pledge his love for me if he wanted to break my lake\u2019s spell.</p><p>The gasps from the audience could be heard over the music, but I kept my focus.</p><p>I seamlessly transitioned from the white, sweet swan who wanted nothing more than to fall in love, into the black, evil swan\u2014Odile, who wanted nothing more than to prevent it from happening.</p><p>I illustrated love, heartbreak, and devastation over the course of two hours, never stopping to catch my breath, never missing a beat.</p><p>In the final frame, where the love of my life vows to die with me instead of honoring his mistaken promise to the black swan, I can\u2019t help but deviate from the choreography.</p><p>Instead of taking his hand and letting him lead me into the \u201cwater,\u201d I leapt into his arms\u2014letting him hold me high for all the other swans to see. And then the two of us spun into oblivion\u2014\u201cdying\u201d together.</p><p>The music began its decrescendo\u2014half-somber, half-light, and the lights shut off\u2014leaving nothing. Ending everything with blackness.</p><p>And silence.</p><p>All of a sudden, a raucous applause arose from the audience and a collection of cheers\u2014\u201cBravo!\u201d \u201cEncore!\u201d \u201cBravissimo!\u201d echoed off the walls.</p><p>The stage lights brightened and I took a bow, looking out into a sea of well-entertained faces: Mr. Petrova was front and center, nodding as he clapped, mouthing, \u201cGood job, good job.\u201d My mother was wiping a tear from her eye and looking up at my father, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s our daughter.\u201d Even Mr. Ashcroft, still stone faced, was standing and applauding, stopping once his eyes met mine.</p><p>\u201cBravo.\u201d He mouthed before turning away.</p><p>I kept a smile plastered on my face as I scanned the room, looking for the one person I wanted\u2014the one person I needed to see, but he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cThank you ladies and gentlemen for attending our opening night,\u201d one of the directors said as she took the stage. \u201cPer our opening night tradition, we will now introduce the members of our corps to you...\u201d</p><p>I tried to focus on the introductions, tried to focus on someone else other than Andrew, but as I was lifting my head up from another bow, I saw him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was there in the front row, in the last seat on the left.

I continued staring at Andrew.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Everhart?\u201d She whispered, more harshly now. \u201cTake a bow and get backstage...Now...\u201d</p><p>I walked away from her and headed straight toward Andrew\u2014taking my time down the stage\u2019s side steps. I stood in front of him, looking directly into his eyes\u2014ignoring the confused murmurs of the crowd.</p><p>The director said a few more words, Mr. Ashcroft gave his regards, and the curtains closed without me.</p><p>As the audience gave one final applause and started to file out of the room, I finally found my voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t coming...\u201d I whispered. \u201cDid you come here just to see my show or are you staying a little bit longer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m staying a little bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He wiped away my tears. \u201cIt means I\u2019ll stay here until you realize how terrible this city is\u2014until you\u2019re ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI signed a contract for three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery contract is negotiable.\u201d He smiled and pulled me into his arms. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t apologize for ruining the closing credits tonight, they just might risk breaching it and fire you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you work?\u201d I asked. \u201cAre you going to practice law? Can you practice law?\u201d</p> <p>He kissed my lips. \u201cI\u2019ll be teaching at NYU.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My heart immediately felt for the future students. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a terrible teacher, Andrew...All of the interns at GBH hated you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a f**k.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious...\u201d I was actually worried. \u201cI think you should reconsider. Teaching isn\u2019t for everyone, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all,\u201d he said, cutting me off and tightening his grip around me. \u201cI am a good f**king teacher. It just depends on the subject matter...\u201d He trailed his finger across my lips. \u201cI can recall teaching you how to do something very well...\u201d</p><p>I blushed.</p> <p>\u201cSecond of all, last time I checked, all of the interns at GBH were quite unteachable and they were dumb as stones\u2014all except one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that was a f**king liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard she broke all your rules.\u201d I brought my hand up to his face. \u201cI heard she ended your one dinner, one night, and no repeats streak... \u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cIs it still going on? Is that still your personal motto?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a certain extent,\u201d he said, pressing his lips against mine. \u201cSince I still like the sound of it, and will only be dating her from here on out, I\u2019ll just replace the word \u2018one\u2019 with \u2018more\u2019...\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Six Years later...</p><p>New York, New York</p><p>Andrew</p><p>I stood in front of a classroom at New York University\u2014counting down the seconds, asking myself why I\u2019d ever agreed to this.</p><p>\u201cAre there any questions?\u201d I looked at my watch.</p><p>Several hands flew into the air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only answering three of them.\u201d I pointed to a young woman in the front row. \u201cYes, you. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d She blushed. \u201cGood morning, Professor Hamilton. My name is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what your name is. What is your question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s been about two weeks since the semester started and you have yet to give us a syllabus...\u201d</p><p>I ignored her and pointed to a jock in the back row. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also haven\u2019t told us what books we need to buy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone in this classroom know the definition of the word, question?\u201d I picked the last student, a redhead sitting by the window. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it true that we\u2019re required to take turns bringing you coffee every day?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the coffee mug on my desk, at the sign-in sheet that listed which student had brought it today.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a requirement,\u201d I said, picking up the cup. \u201cBut if you miss your day to bring me my coffee, I\u2019ll make sure everyone in this class regrets it.\u201d</p><p>They groaned collectively and shook their heads. A few of them still had their hands raised, but I was officially done for the day.</p><p>\u201cRead pages 153 - 260 from the printout by next class. I expect you to know the ins and outs of each case. Class dismissed.\u201d I walked out, saying nothing further.</p><p>Slipping into my car, I noticed a new email on my phone.</p><p>Subject: Bathroom.</p><p>Thank you for sending me that very inappropriate note with my flowers today. Everyone in my cohort now knows that you and I have yet to f**k in our brand new bathroom.</p><p>Why are you so ridiculous?</p><p>\u2014Aubrey.</p><p>Subject: Re: Bathroom.</p><p>You\u2019re very welcome for the flowers. I\u2019m hoping that you liked them.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t a \u201cnote\u201d that I sent you. It\u2019s a demand that\u2019s about to be addressed within the next few hours.</p><p>Why do you deny that you love it?</p><p>\u2014Andrew.</p><p>I could picture her rolling her eyes at my last message, so I revved up my car and sped back toward our home.</p><p>Even though I\u2019d spent the last six years here, I was still building my tolerance for the things I once hated, things that now bothered me less and less, but I still had a long way to go.</p><p>Some memories can never be replaced...</p><p>Aubrey was completely captivated and entranced by this city, though. Whenever she wasn\u2019t incessantly touring with the ballet company, she was insisting that we try every restaurant, theater, and tourist attraction possible\u2014trying to make me fall in love with everything again.</p><p>I parked in front of our brownstone\u2014a newly purchased brick building in Brooklyn, and walked up the steps.</p><p>\u201cAubrey?\u201d I said as I opened the door. \u201cAre you in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She called from a distance. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be eventually.\u201d I walked down the hallway, stopping when I saw her hanging another frame in her office.</p><p>The walls were covered in pictures of her standing at center stage, a different picture for every night she\u2019d opened a show.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to have another room built for you and your photos?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou\u2019re running out of space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think this is the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still retiring at the end of the month?\u201d I stepped behind her and kissed her neck. \u201cOr have you changed your mind yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not changing my mind.\u201d She turned around to face me. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for me to focus on something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecoming the female version of Mr. Ashcroft when you teach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be that bad,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do need a break like you said, I think...\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I\u2019d been extremely supportive throughout her professional career\u2014traveling with her out of the country to see some of the shows, hiring a personal massage therapist who was at her beck and call, and documenting all of her achievements from the newspapers.</p><p>But I\u2019d recently noted a change\u2014a shift, in her attitude: Although she was happy when she went to rehearsals, even happier when telling me about new things the company was trying, she seemed to be more interested in a life outside of the company, so I suggested that she take a short break.</p><p>I was still trying to figure out how she\u2019d interpreted my suggested \u201cbreak\u201d as a \u201cretirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved dancing in Russia.\u201d She smiled, pointing to the picture. \u201cDo you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember that...\u201d I said, continuing my assault of her neck, slipping my hand under her shirt.</p><p>She murmured as I rubbed my thumb around her nipple, as I gently bit her skin. But then she stepped away. \u201cI actually need you to go fax my revised contract to the company...I have to let them know officially by five o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the bathroom.\u201d I clasped her hand. \u201cWe have four hours.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but she gave in, taking my lead into the bathroom.</p><p>I turned on the water and pulled her dress over her head. \u201cIf you\u2019re hell bent on retiring from performing and simply teaching, we\u2019ll have more time to spend together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore time for you to convince me to leave New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t have a reason to stay,\u201d I said, threading my fingers through her hair. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to teach, you can commute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t teach? If I decide to continue dancing instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy season tickets.\u201d I cupped her face in my hands, raising my eyebrow. \u201cI never asked you to retire, Aubrey...I just think you need a break. You haven\u2019t taken a week off in more than six years...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to take a break...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it going to last longer than two days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot longer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be at least nine months...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I backed up, shocked. We\u2019d stopped using protection once we moved in together, but she\u2019d still taken birth control. \"What are you saying, Aubrey?\"</p><p>\"I\u2019m saying you\u2019re going to be a father,\" she said, nearly whispering. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a good enough reason for us to stay...\u201d</p><p>I was silent for several seconds, pressing my palm against her flat stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs this not something that you wanted? I wanted to tell you this morning, but you were in a rush, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her off with a deep kiss and pulled her close, rubbing my hands against her bare back. \u201cI\u2019m more than okay...\u201d I looked into her eyes. \u201cIt is something I wanted...\u201d</p><p>She murmured, \u201cI love you,\u201d against my lips and I said it back.</p><p>Breathless, she leaned against the shower door. \u201cCan you go fax my letter now? It would really be nice if, for once, I wasn\u2019t late doing something because you have no self-control and were too busy f**king me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely fax your letter...\u201d I drew her lip into my mouth and squeezed her ass. \u201cAfter the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>**End of Episode 3** </p> </body></html>"]
