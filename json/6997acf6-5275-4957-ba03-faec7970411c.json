Is that you?\u201d Valerie Bloomfield\u2019s voice rose expectantly. She\u2019d been trying to reach her sister for the past hour with no success.</p><p>\u201cValerie, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a layover in Chicago.\u201d She glanced around the departure lounge and surveyed the other passengers. \u201cHow\u2019s Dad?\u201d</p> <p>Norah hesitated, and that slight pause sent Valerie\u2019s worry escalating into panic. \u201cNorah...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing as well as can be expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him I\u2019m on my way?\u201d Valerie had been in the middle of a business meeting in New York when she received the message. Her youngest sister had called the Houston office, and they\u2019d passed on the news of her father\u2019s heart attack. Valerie had left immediately, catching the first available flight. Unfortunately that meant going to Oregon via Chicago.</p><p>\u201cDad knows you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you able to get hold of Steff?\u201d</p> <p>Norah\u2019s sigh signaled her frustration. \u201cYes, but it took forever and my Italian is nonexistent. She\u2019s planning to catch whatever she can out of Rome, but she has to get there first\u2014she\u2019s in some little village right now. It might take her a couple of days. The connection was bad and I couldn\u2019t understand everything she said. Apparently there\u2019s some sort of transportation strike. But she\u2019s doing her best....\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s sympathies went out to Stephanie, the middle Bloomfield sister. She must be frantic, stuck halfway across the world and desperate to find a way home.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you get here?\u201d Norah asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cThe plane\u2019s scheduled to land at six-ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to meet you? I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Valerie interrupted. She didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for Norah to leave their father. \u201cI\u2019ve already ordered a car. It shouldn\u2019t take me more than forty minutes once I land, so don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the hospital\u2019s an hour\u2019s drive from the airport. You shouldn\u2019t even try to make it in less.\u201d</p><p>It generally did take an hour, but Valerie had every intention of getting there a lot sooner. \u201cI should be at the hospital somewhere around seven,\u201d she said evasively.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Norah sounded resigned.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, kid, everything\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be careful, will you?\u201d Norah pleaded. \u201cYou being in an accident won\u2019t help Dad any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d Valerie promised, smiling at her sister\u2019s words. Trust Norah to take the practical approach. After a brief farewell, Valerie closed her cell phone and slipped it into her purse.</p><p>Half an hour later, she boarded her plane. She\u2019d only brought a carry-on bag, unwilling to waste precious time waiting for luggage to be unloaded. Shutting her eyes, she leaned back in her seat as the plane taxied down the runway.</p><p>Her father was dying. Her dear father... His hold on life was precarious, and the burning need to get to him as quickly as possible drove her like nothing she\u2019d ever experienced.</p> <p>She was exhausted but sleep was out of the question. Valerie bent down for her purse, rummaging through it until she found the antacid tablets. She popped one in her mouth and chewed it with a vengeance.</p><p>No sooner had she swallowed the chalky tablet than she reached for a roll of the hard candies she always had with her. Four years earlier she\u2019d quit smoking, and sucking on hard candy had helped her through the worst of the nicotine withdrawal. If she\u2019d ever needed a cigarette, it was now. Her nerves were stretched to the breaking point.</p><p>Please, she prayed, not her father, too. Valerie was only beginning to come to grips with her mother\u2019s death. Grace Bloomfield had died of cancer almost four years ago, and the grief had shaken Valerie\u2019s well-ordered life. She\u2019d buried her anguish in work; the biggest strides in her career with CHIPS, a Texas-based computer software company, had come in the past few years. She\u2019d quickly climbed up the corporate ladder, until she was the youngest executive on the management team.</p><p>Her father had reacted similarly to Grace\u2019s death. Working too many hours, driving himself too hard. Norah had tried to tell her, but Valerie hadn\u2019t paid attention. She should\u2019ve done something, anything, to get their father to slow down, to relax and enjoy life. He should have retired years before; he could be traveling, seeing exotic places, meeting with old friends and making new ones. In the years since her mother\u2019s death, Valerie had convinced her father to leave Orchard Valley only once and that had been a two-week trip to Italy to visit Steffie.</p><p>And now he was fighting for his life in a hospital.</p><p>Valerie hadn\u2019t said anything to him because...well, because they were so much alike. David Bloomfield was working out his grief the same way she was. Valerie couldn\u2019t very well criticize him for something she was doing herself.</p><p>Before she knew it, she\u2019d chomped her way through two rolls of candy and another of antacid tablets.</p><p>When the plane landed, Valerie was the first one off, scurrying with her bag down the concourse to the rental car agency. Within fifteen minutes, she was on the freeway heading east toward Orchard Valley.</p><p>Heading toward home.</p><p>Norah was right; it took Valerie longer than forty minutes to reach Orchard Valley Hospital. She got there in forty-five. She took the first available parking space, unconcerned about whether the rental car would be towed. What did concern her was seeing her father.</p><p>Norah was standing in the hospital lobby when Valerie walked through the double glass doors. Her sister, looking drawn and pale, was visibly relieved by her presence. \u201cOh, Valerie,\u201d she said, covering her mouth with one hand. \u201cOh, Valerie... I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Valerie\u2019s throat closed up. If her cantankerous father had had the audacity to die before she arrived, she\u2019d never forgive him. The thought made her realize how much this ordeal had drained her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting comfortably...for now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hugged her sister. Norah looked dreadful, her stylish shoulder-length blond hair brushed away from her face as if her hands had swept it behind her ears countless times. Her blue eyes, normally so clear and bright, were red-rimmed from tears and lack of sleep.</p><p>Valerie hadn\u2019t had much rest herself, but she was still running on adrenaline. She wouldn\u2019t collapse until after she\u2019d had a chance to see her father.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d she asked as they hurried to the elevator. Their shoes made a sharp, clicking sound against the polished linoleum floor, a sound that reminded Valerie of similar visits a few years ago, when her mother was dying. She remembered similar nighttime walks down these silent corridors. She hadn\u2019t been to this hospital since. The memories overwhelmed her now, tearing at the facade of her poise.</p><p>\u201cAfter dinner last night, Dad went out onto the porch,\u201d Norah began, her voice quavering.</p><p>As far back as Valerie could remember, after the evening meal her parents had adjourned for coffee to the sweeping front porch of their large colonial home. They\u2019d sat together on the old wicker chairs, sometimes holding hands and whispering like teenagers. Valerie was never sure what they discussed, but she\u2019d learned early on not to interrupt them. In the winters, they\u2019d sat in front of the basalt fireplace in her father\u2019s den, but during spring, summer and the early part of autumn, it was the porch.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known something was wrong,\u201d Norah continued. \u201cDad hasn\u2019t sat on the porch much since Mom\u2019s been gone. After dinner he goes right into his office and does his bookkeeping.\u201d</p><p>The guilt Valerie experienced was crushing. Norah had repeatedly told her how hard their father was working. She should have listened, should have demanded he hire an assistant, take a vacation, something. As the oldest, she felt responsible.</p><p>His heart was weak and had been since a bout of rheumatic fever in his thirties. By all accounts he should\u2019ve died then, but a young nurse\u2019s devotion had pulled him through. The nurse was Grace Johnson, who became David\u2019s wife, and Valerie, Stephanie and Norah\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cI brought him a cup of coffee,\u201d Norah went on, \u201cand he looked up at me and smiled. He...he seemed to think I was Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he in terrible pain?\u201d</p><p>Norah bit her lower lip. \u201cYes, he must have been. He was so pale... Only he was too proud to admit it. I asked him what was wrong, but he wouldn\u2019t answer. He just kept saying he was ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d</p><p>Norah glanced away. \u201cReady to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Valerie cried. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous! If there was ever a man who had something to live for, it\u2019s Dad. Good grief, he\u2019s worked hard all his life! Now, it\u2019s time to reap the fruits of his labors, to enjoy his family, to travel, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to convince me,\u201d Norah said quietly as they reached the third floor and stepped out of the elevator. The Coronary Care nurses\u2019 station was directly in front of them. Norah walked to the counter.</p><p>\u201cBetty, would you tell Dr. Winston my sister\u2019s arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d the other woman replied. She appeared to be gentle, compassionate\u2014and practical. No-nonsense. Valerie recognized those traits because Betty shared them with Norah. And with their mother...</p><p>Valerie had to suppress a sudden smile at the memory of her youngest sister lining up dolls in her bed and sticking thermometers in their mouths. She\u2019d fussed over them like an anxious mother, bandaging their limbs and offering comfort and reassurance.</p><p>Norah came by this temperament naturally, Valerie supposed, since their mother had been the same. Although she\u2019d given up her hospital job when she married David Bloomfield, Grace continued to nurture those around her. It had been her gift. It was Norah\u2019s gift, too.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Dr. Winston?\u201d Valerie asked. She\u2019d never heard of him before; he must be a recent addition to the hospital staff. But the last thing their father needed at a time like this was some hayseed family practitioner. He should be in a major hospital with the best heart surgeon available!</p><p>\u201cDr. Winston\u2019s been wonderful,\u201d Norah returned, her eyes lighting up briefly. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Colby, we would\u2019ve lost Dad in the first twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby?\u201d The doctor was named after a cheese? This didn\u2019t sound promising.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without him,\u201d Norah said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what to do at first. I could tell Dad was in a lot of pain, but I knew he\u2019d object if I called for an aid car. He\u2019d argue with me and that would\u2019ve made matters even worse if it was his heart like I suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you phoned Dr. Winston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Luckily I was able to get hold of him, and he drove out, pretending to drop in out of the blue. He knew the minute he saw Dad that it was a heart attack. He immediately gave him a couple of aspirin. Then he sat down on the porch and had a cup of coffee with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe drank coffee while our father was having a heart attack?\u201d Valerie wasn\u2019t finding this doctor too impressive.</p><p>\u201cI believe it was what saved Dad\u2019s life,\u201d Norah said, her eyes flashing a protest. \u201cDr. Winston convinced Dad to go to the hospital voluntarily. It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d been admitted that he suffered the worst of the attack. If he\u2019d been at home arguing, no one could\u2019ve done anything to save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That took some of the heat out of Valerie\u2019s argument. She suspected she was looking for someone to blame\u2014in an attempt to ease her own guilt for having ignored Norah\u2019s concerns about their father.</p><p>The door Betty had walked through opened, and a tall dark-haired man came toward them, his expression serious. Valerie couldn\u2019t help noticing how attractive he was. In fact, the man had movie-star good looks, but good looks with nothing soft or insipid about them.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, his voice deep and resonant. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Winston.\u201d He held out his hand.</p><p>\u201cValerie Bloomfield,\u201d she responded briskly, placing her hand in his. She\u2019d always been taught that it was impolite to stare, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself. Her father\u2019s physician didn\u2019t look much older than her own thirty-one years. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, not glancing at Norah, who would, she suspected, immediately leap to Dr. Winston\u2019s defense. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude\u2014but how old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d Norah groaned under her breath.</p><p>\u201cI just want to know how long he\u2019s been practicing medicine. Good grief, Norah, this is our father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right,\u201d Dr. Winston said, smiling at Norah. \u201cIf David was my father I\u2019d have a few questions myself. I\u2019m thirty-six.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie found it hard to believe, but she couldn\u2019t very well insist on seeing his birth certificate. Besides, her thoughts were muddled and she was exhausted. Now wasn\u2019t the time to question his qualifications. \u201cHow\u2019s my father?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will I be able to see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t go in right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Valerie snapped. \u201cI\u2019ve flown across the country to be with my father. He needs me! Why shouldn\u2019t I be able to go to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea just now. He\u2019s sleeping for the first time in nearly twenty hours and I don\u2019t want anything to disturb him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you should wait,\u201d Norah seconded, as if she feared Valerie might be on the verge of making a scene.</p><p>Valerie sighed; her sister was right. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll wait. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m anxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Dr. Winston said. But he spoke without emotion. He led them to a room not far from the nurses\u2019 station. Two well-worn couches faced each other, and several outdated magazines littered the coffee table that stood between them. There was a coffeepot in one corner, with powdered creamer and an ample supply of disposable cups.</p><p>Norah sat first, raising both hands to her mouth in an effort to hide a yawn.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d Valerie asked, realizing even before she asked that Norah had stayed at the hospital all night. Her youngest sister was exhausted. \u201cListen, kid, you go on home and get some sleep. I\u2019ll hold down the fort for a while.\u201d</p><p>Norah grinned sheepishly. \u201cI used to hate it when you called me kid, but I don\u2019t anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Valerie asked softly, resisting the urge to brush a stray curl from her sister\u2019s forehead. She wasn\u2019t the maternal type, but she felt protective toward Norah, wanting to ease her burden.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me kid anytime you like because that\u2019s exactly the way I feel, like a child whose world\u2019s been turned upside down. I\u2019m scared, Val, really scared. We almost lost him\u2014we still could.\u201d</p> <p>Valerie nodded, hugging her briefly. Norah had suffered through the worst of the nightmare alone, not knowing from one minute to the next if their father was going to live or die.</p><p>\u201cValerie\u2019s right,\u201d Dr. Winston added. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do here. Go home and rest. I promise I\u2019ll call you if there\u2019s any change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Norah rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll take a shower and try to sleep for a couple of hours. That\u2019s all I need. Two, maybe three hours.\u201d</p><p>Valerie wondered if Norah was too tired to drive; Dr. Winston must have had the same concern.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll phone for a cab from the nurses\u2019 station. I don\u2019t want you driving like this.\u201d He placed his arm around Norah\u2019s shoulders, apparently intending to walk her to the elevator. As they left, he turned to Valerie. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>While he was away, Valerie poured herself a cup of coffee. The pot had obviously been sitting there for hours; the coffee was black and thick and strong, just the way she needed it.</p><p>The urge for a cigarette was nearly overwhelming, so when Dr. Winston returned to the room she looked up at him and automatically asked, \u201cDo you have any hard candy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMints, anything like that.\u201d She was pacing the room, holding her coffee cup in both hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. Would you like me to see if I could get you some?\u201d</p><p>Valerie dismissed his offer with a shake of her head. He was polite to a fault. The first thing she\u2019d done had been to insult him, question his competence, and he\u2019d taken it all in stride.</p><p>\u201cPlease, tell me about my father.\u201d</p><p>They sat, and for the next fifteen minutes, Dr. Winston explained what had happened to her father\u2019s heart. He did his best to describe it in layman\u2019s terms, but much of what he said was beyond Valerie\u2019s comprehension. She\u2019d never been comfortable with medical matters. Her mother and Norah had always dealt with those. For her part, Valerie hated anything to do with hospitals or doctors. She detested being sick herself, and knew her father felt the same way.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one underlying problem that needs to be dealt with, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Valerie asked, hating the way her voice betrayed her fear. Any show of weakness distressed her. If she\u2019d ever needed to be strong, it was now, for everyone\u2019s sake, including her own. She was the oldest, and the others would rely on her.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s lost his will to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she said, battling the urge to argue with him. \u201cMy father\u2019s life is brimming over, it\u2019s so full. Why, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost without your mother,\u201d Dr. Winston finished simply.</p><p>Valerie bolted to her feet and resumed pacing. What Dr. Winston said was absolutely true; she had to admit it. Her father had been crushed under the load of grief, and while Valerie and her two sisters struggled to regain their own balance, their father had been slowly destroyed by his loss.</p><p>\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d she asked, trying to swallow her fears and her guilt.</p><p>\u201cSupport him, give him your love. The only thing keeping him alive now is his desire to see all three of his daughters before he dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut... Okay, then don\u2019t let him know I\u2019m here.\u201d It was the obvious solution. And if that was what it took to keep him alive, she was willing to play a little game of hide-and-seek. Norah could make up a series of excuses. No, forget Norah, Valerie mused bleakly. Her youngest sister couldn\u2019t tell a lie without blushing.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you lie?\u201d she asked, thinking fast.</p><p>Dr. Winston blinked. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let my father know I\u2019ve arrived. And that means lying to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Bloomfield\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d he said, sounding impatient with her for the first time. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to be able to fool your father. Norah talked to him shortly after you phoned from...where was it? Chicago? He knows you caught a flight out of New York. No one\u2019s going to make him believe something more important came up that\u2019s kept you from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffie!\u201d Valerie cried. \u201cWhen Norah spoke to her, she said there was a transportation strike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but these are only stop-gap measures. Your father feels there\u2019s nothing left to live for. He talks about your mother constantly, almost as though he\u2019s waiting to join her. We need something concrete that\u2019ll give him the will to fight, to hold on to life.\u201d</p><p>Again Valerie knew the doctor was right, but her confused brain was having trouble assimilating the most basic details, let alone a situation as complex as this.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all we have,\u201d she whispered despondently. \u201cSurely he realizes that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but at the same time, he believes you have one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have nothing in common,\u201d Valerie told him. \u201cSteffie\u2019s a crazy woman who flies off to Europe to study the Italian Renaissance, and Norah\u2019s main goal in life is to become another Clara Barton. We don\u2019t even look alike.\u201d Valerie was grasping at weak excuses, and she knew it. Anything she could think of to enlist Dr. Winston\u2019s help in keeping her father alive...</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with me, Valerie,\u201d he told her gently. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ll do everything I can to see that your father regains his health and lives to a ripe old age.\u201d</p><p>Blinking away tears, Valerie nodded, reminding herself once again that she was the oldest of David Bloomfield\u2019s daughters. In a crisis everyone looked to her; she was the one who needed a cool, decisive head, who couldn\u2019t let her emotions dictate her reactions.</p><p>But it was different this time.</p><p>The man in that hospital bed, barely holding on to life, was her father, the man she idolized and loved beyond reason. Her emotions were so close to the surface that the force of them frightened her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d like to see him as soon as possible. Please.\u201d She\u2019d grovel if necessary. She had to be with her father. \u201cI won\u2019t make the least bit of noise, I promise.\u201d She certainly didn\u2019t want to disturb his rest. Somehow, though, she had to reassure herself that he was still alive. She\u2019d never been more frightened.</p><p>Dr. Winston hesitated. \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go and check on him.\u201d</p><p>He returned a few minutes later. \u201cDavid\u2019s awake and asking for you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie was so eager that she nearly vaulted out of the room, but Dr. Winston stopped her. \u201cBefore you go to your father, let me prepare you for what you\u2019re going to see.\u201d He spent the next five minutes explaining the different medical devices used to monitor his patient\u2019s heart. He explained how the small electrodes on her father\u2019s chest detected the electrical impulses that signal the heart\u2019s activity. He warned her about the tubes going in and out of his body.</p><p>But nothing he said could have prepared Valerie for what she saw. Her father was connected to a frightening number of tubes, machines and devices. His face was ashen, so pale and bloodless that his skin seemed iridescent. His eyes, which had always sparked with vitality, revealed no emotion, only a weariness that was soul-deep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Daddy,\u201d Valerie whispered, fighting tears. She locked her fingers around his hand, careful not to disturb the intravenous needle.</p><p>\u201cValerie...so pleased you\u2019re here...at last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else would I be?\u201d she asked, managing a smile. With the back of her other hand, she brushed a tear from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t she?\u201d her father said, apparently talking to Dr. Winston, who hovered in the doorway. \u201cOnly...what did you do to your hair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d Valerie asked, rallying somewhat, surprised he\u2019d even noticed that she\u2019d changed the style. \u201cI had it cut.\u201d The new look was short and tousled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got the temper to go with that red hair, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her father was speaking to Colby Winston again.</p><p>\u201cMy hair isn\u2019t even close to being red,\u201d she argued, annoyed by the doctor\u2019s effort not to grin. \u201cIt\u2019s auburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like you haven\u2019t combed it in a month,\u201d her father mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cDad, I\u2019ll have you know I paid good money for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, you should demand a refund.\u201d His voice was weak, and speaking had clearly depleted him of what little energy he possessed.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Valerie said, trying to disguise her concern. \u201cInstead of complaining about my hair, you should rest.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, merely closed his eyes and sighed audibly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to leave you for a little while,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be right outside, so if you want to tell me how much you like my hair and beg my forgiveness, then all you need to do is ring for the nurse.\u201d Dr. Winston had told her earlier that she\u2019d be allowed to visit her father five minutes out of every hour, depending on how well he was doing.</p><p>David\u2019s smile was barely discernible.</p> <p>\u201cRest now, Daddy. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Winston\u2019s hand was at her elbow directing her out of the glass-enclosed cubicle.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d Her father\u2019s voice had a sense of urgency.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one I was telling you about. You remember what I said, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now don\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer hair doesn\u2019t usually look like a rag doll\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Valerie had no idea what was taking place between the two men but she wasn\u2019t going to stand idly by and let them insult her.</p> <p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Colby Winston said, leading her from the Coronary Care Unit.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Valerie asked the instant they were out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you mean,\u201d he said without meeting her eyes.</p><p>Valerie wasn\u2019t fooled. There was definitely something going on, and she wanted to know what. She\u2019d been in business far too long to allow questionable remarks to slip past her unchallenged.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dad mean, I\u2019m \u2018the one\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Winston still refused to look at her. \u201cWhile we\u2014your father and I\u2014were talking earlier, he voiced a few concerns about his daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Valerie said. Making an effort to appear nonchalant and relaxed, she walked over to the coffeepot and lifted it to him in silent invitation.</p><p>Dr. Winston shook his head and Valerie refilled her own paper cup. \u201cSo, what did Dad have to say about us girls?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very proud of all three of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. We\u2019re his children. What I\u2019d like to know is what he meant when he said I was \u2018the one.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d He walked away from her and stood gazing out the window into the night sky.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dr. Winston, I\u2019m a mature woman and this is my father. I\u2019m sure if I insisted he\u2019d tell me.\u201d They both knew that coercing her father was out of the question; nevertheless, it was an effective ploy. Dr. Winston went to the coffeepot and filled a cup, even though he\u2019d declined one moments earlier.</p><p>\u201cIt seems he\u2019s the most worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Valerie blurted. Of the three girls, she was the most financially secure. She was established in an excellent career and living on her own. For heaven\u2019s sake, she was the only one with investments! \u201cThat makes no sense at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he worried about me? Furthermore, why didn\u2019t he talk to me instead of discussing it with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are any number of reasons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me what he said,\u201d Valerie interrupted impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYour father seems to think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat you should be married.\u201d</p><p>Valerie couldn\u2019t restrain her laughter. It shot out of her, like bubbles from a champagne bottle.</p><p>\u201cIn fact,\u201d Colby continued grimly, \u201cyour father seems to think you should be married to me.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cMarried to you?\u201d Valerie echoed, her laughter fading. Dr. Colby Winston! She\u2019d never heard anything so preposterous. She had no intention of marrying anyone within the foreseeable future. There was simply no room for a man in her life. She wasn\u2019t a romantic; even when she was younger and in college, she hadn\u2019t dated much. Her father knew all that, and he\u2019d never seemed particularly worried about it. This latest revelation shocked her nearly as much as Norah\u2019s call.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason to be too concerned,\u201d Colby said, his voice compassionate as though he understood that his announcement had unsettled her. She was usually more proficient at controlling her emotions.</p><p>\u201cThis sort of delusion isn\u2019t unheard of in heart patients,\u201d he went on. \u201cAs I said, I certainly don\u2019t think you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your patients generally try to marry you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smoothed his tie as if he needed something to do. \u201cYour father fully expects to die. It\u2019s what he wants, but he\u2019d feel better about leaving the three of you behind if at least one of you was married. Your father and I are friends, and I guess it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d attempt to match me up with one of his daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should\u2019ve been Norah. She seems more your type.\u201d</p><p>His smile was fleeting. \u201cPerhaps, but it\u2019s your name he repeatedly mentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen apparently I\u2019m the one,\u201d Valerie said, not realizing what she was saying until the words had left her mouth. \u201cI mean\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what you mean,\u201d Colby assured her. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t have to take any of this seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree. That would be foolish in the extreme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe your father feels you should marry first because you\u2019re the oldest,\u201d Colby ventured.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Valerie agreed. But something inside her suggested that wasn\u2019t the sole reason. She tucked her arms around her waist and inhaled deeply, hoping to breathe in a bit of calm and sense.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said anything,\u201d Colby said, \u201cbut I thought it was best to air this. If he mentions marriage again, my feeling is we should go along with him, at least for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo along with him? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d Valerie could hardly believe her ears.</p><p>Colby shrugged. \u201cYou know your father better than I do,\u201d he muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s as stubborn as they come. Don\u2019t lie, but if he brings up the subject of...marriage, take the route of least resistance, then try to channel the conversation in a different direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to give my father any false hope. Or you either.\u201d She added the last part coyly and was rewarded when she saw him swallow tightly. An angry spark momentarily leaped into his dark eyes, but was soon quelled.</p><p>Sitting down, Valerie rummaged through her purse for a roll of antacid tablets. Her stomach ached and she was weary to her very bones.</p><p>Colby ignored her, although he made no move to go. The preoccupied look on his face suggested that he had something else to say; he seemed to be searching for words.</p><p>Valerie considered what Colby had told her. If she ever decided to marry\u2014if\u2014she\u2019d settle down with someone who had the same drive, the same will to succeed, as she did. A man who knew where he was going, who\u2019d set his sights high. Not some well-meaning small-town doctor.</p><p>She\u2019d marry a man like Rowdy Cassidy.</p><p>The name sprang into her mind with a suddenness that shocked her.</p><p>Until that moment, Valerie didn\u2019t fully grasp how much she admired her employer. Rowdy had started his computer software business out of a friend\u2019s garage fifteen years earlier. He\u2019d built the company into one of the most successful in the country. Although he\u2019d earned more money than he could possibly spend in a lifetime, he continued to work ten-and twelve-hour days, demanding as much of his staff as he did of himself.</p><p>\u201cIt might, uh, help matters if you were involved with someone,\u201d Colby said in a casual voice. Valerie found his nonchalant tone a bit exaggerated, which for some reason made her suspect that he wasn\u2019t \u201cinvolved with someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a relationship at the moment, but I might be soon,\u201d she told him. Valerie and Rowdy\u2014a couple. Odd that she\u2019d never thought of him in romantic terms before. He\u2019d be the perfect husband for her. She liked him and respected him, as a man and a professional. Rowdy had hand-picked her for his management team because he believed in her abilities.</p><p>In retrospect, she realized Rowdy had sought out her company on several occasions. But she\u2019d been so absorbed in proving herself worthy of his faith that she hadn\u2019t guessed he might have any personal feelings for her.</p><p>For months she\u2019d been blind to what was right in front of her. Not that she was entirely to blame, though. Rowdy wasn\u2019t exactly a heartthrob kind of guy. Oh, he was handsome enough, with his rugged cowboy looks, but his brusque, outspoken manner didn\u2019t encourage romantic aspirations. As far as she knew, he\u2019d never dated anyone seriously, at least not in the years she\u2019d worked for him.</p><p>For that matter, Valerie wasn\u2019t any expert on falling in love, either. She\u2019d dismissed the possibility of romance in her own life; it was fine for her sisters and school-friends, but not for her. There\u2019d always been too much she wanted to do, too much to strive for. Too much to achieve before settling down in a permanent relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Colby said, breaking into her thoughts. At her blank look, he elaborated. \u201cYou said you weren\u2019t involved with someone yet, but you will be soon. I may be overstepping my bounds here, but I wouldn\u2019t advise you to invent a phony relationship. Your father would see through that in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I wouldn\u2019t even attempt anything so foolish. But there\u2019s a man I work with, and, well, it seems natural for the two of us to...get involved.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Winston looked so relieved that she might\u2019ve been offended if she hadn\u2019t been warmed by the newly risen hope of a romance with Rowdy Cassidy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve given your father something to help him rest,\u201d Colby went on. \u201cHe should sleep through the night without a problem, so if you want to drive home and join your sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Valerie interrupted quickly. \u201cI won\u2019t leave Dad. I understand that I can\u2019t see him yet, but I want to be here...in case anything happens. It\u2019s important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Valerie was grateful. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, then yawned, revealing for the first time his own fatigue. \u201cI\u2019ve left orders that I\u2019m to be contacted the minute there\u2019s any change in his condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks necessary. I\u2019ll talk to you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled and sat down to leaf through a six-month-old news magazine. She\u2019d just finished reading the letters to the editor when the nurse appeared, carrying a pillow and a blanket.</p><p>\u201cDr. Winston thought you might need these,\u201d she said, setting the bundle down next to Valerie.</p> <p>It was a thoughtful thing to do, she mused later as she rested her head against the pillow and tucked the thin blanket around her shoulders. She felt a twinge of guilt, especially since she\u2019d already decided to call in the country\u2019s top heart surgeon first thing in the morning.</p><p>By noon, it was unlikely that her father would still be a patient of Dr. Colby Winston\u2019s.</p><p>He liked her, Colby realized. He\u2019d been prepared not to. Valerie Bloomfield was everything her father had claimed. Professional, astute and lovely. But when it came to relationships, she was precisely the type of woman Colby made a point of avoiding.</p><p>He liked his women soft and feminine. He was looking for a wife, and David Bloomfield had somehow intuited that, or he wouldn\u2019t have dragged his eldest daughter into almost every conversation. But Colby didn\u2019t have a business executive in mind. He needed a helpmate, a woman who understood the never-ending demands of a doctor\u2019s work. A woman who\u2019d understand the long hours, the emotional stress, the intrusions into his private life.</p><p>What he didn\u2019t need was a career-obsessed executive. Perhaps he was outdated in his thinking. He certainly acknowledged that a woman had every right to pursue her own profession, to choose her own calling in life, but Colby was looking for a woman who\u2019d make that calling him. Well, not just him but them\u2014their marriage, their family, their home.</p><p>He had to admit it sounded selfish and egocentric to expect his wife to wrap her life around his. Nevertheless that was exactly what he wanted.</p> <p>His own career was all-consuming; there weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to do everything that needed to be done. When he got home at night he wanted someone there to greet him, to offer comfort, serenity.</p><p>Sherry Waterman fit the bill perfectly. They\u2019d been dating off and on for almost a year. Lately, it seemed, more off than on. Colby wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d allowed his relationship with Sherry to taper off. He hadn\u2019t talked to her in nearly two weeks now\u2014maybe longer. But he knew she\u2019d be an ideal wife for him, and for that matter so would Norah Bloomfield. Yet he couldn\u2019t picture spending the rest of his life with either of them.</p><p>If he was going to analyze his lack of interest in both Sherry and Norah, then he might as well examine what he found so attractive about Valerie. Not the briefcase she carried with her like a second purse. Certainly not the way she popped antacid tablets, or the way she dressed in a sexless gray suit that disguised every feminine curve of her slender frame.</p><p>What appealed to him most was the contrast he sensed in her. Outwardly she appeared calm and collected, asking intelligent questions with the composure of someone inquiring about commonplace statistics instead of her father\u2019s chances of survival.</p><p>Colby hadn\u2019t been fooled. He noted how she gnawed on her lower lip even while her gaze steadily met his. Valerie had been badly shaken by her father\u2019s ordeal. There were depths of emotion in this woman, a real capacity for feeling that was\u2014or so he guessed\u2014usually kept hidden.</p><p>He also noticed the love in her eyes when he took her to see her father. He\u2019d watched her struggle to keep her emotions at bay. Her fingers had trembled when they reached for her father\u2019s hand and her face had grown gentle. There was a strong bond between those two.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been necessary to repeat David\u2019s comment about their marrying, and Colby wasn\u2019t sure why he had.</p><p>He suspected he\u2019d been hoping to discover if she was involved with someone. Knowing that she was, or rather that she was about to be, should have reassured him. But it hadn\u2019t. If anything, he was more curious than ever.</p> <p>Norah\u2019s arrival stirred Valerie into wakefulness early the following morning. She hadn\u2019t slept much, too exhausted and keyed up to let herself relax. Toward dawn she\u2019d drifted into an uneasy slumber.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad?\u201d Norah asked, handing Valerie a white sack that contained breakfast.</p><p>\u201cThe same. I haven\u2019t been in to see him, but I\u2019ve talked to the CCU staff several times.\u201d She\u2019d paced the hospital corridor most of the night and as a result had received intermittent reports.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been like this from the first, as though he\u2019s balancing on the edge of a cliff. He could fall either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d Valerie said fervently, as if her determination would be enough to keep him alive.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Valerie returned, forcing her voice to remain confident.</p><p>\u201cOh, before I forget,\u201d Norah said, sitting opposite Valerie, \u201cthere were two messages on the answering machine when I got home last night. The first was from Mr. Cassidy at CHIPS. He\u2019s your boss, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, opening the bag her sister had brought. She removed a warm croissant and a cup of fresh coffee. The last time she could remember eating had been at O\u2019Hare, and although her pizza had looked decent, she\u2019d been too upset to feel very hungry.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d Rowdy have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that he\u2019d heard about Dad\u2019s heart attack. He asked if there was anything he could do.\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled to herself, pleased that Rowdy had taken a few minutes out of his busy schedule to call. It seemed to confirm her thoughts of the night before; she was increasingly convinced that his interest in her was more than business.</p><p>\u201cWho else phoned?\u201d she asked, purposely turning her mind from Rowdy. There\u2019d be plenty of time later to mull over her recent revelation.</p><p>\u201cSteff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d Valerie asked before biting into the flaky croissant.</p><p>\u201cNot very well, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Norah\u2019s shoulders slumped forward slightly. \u201cShe sounded desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it she hasn\u2019t left Italy yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t. Apparently the whole country\u2019s at a standstill. Like I told you, she\u2019s trapped in this tiny village a hundred miles outside Rome. She\u2019d gone there to spend a few days with a friend\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she rent a car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems everyone else thought of the same thing. There\u2019s not a car to be had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, the people she\u2019s with don\u2019t have a car. She and her friend got a ride there from someone else, and everyone she knows is away on spring break. She\u2019s very upset. I called her back, but she was out, so I left a message.\u201d Norah shook her head in frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d arrived. That I\u2019m on leave from my job as long as necessary. And...that Dad\u2019s condition is stable.\u201d It was a small lie, but necessary, Valerie agreed, for their sister\u2019s peace of mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to give her a call later,\u201d Valerie said, sipping the rapidly cooling coffee. She glanced at her watch and calculated the time difference between Oregon and Texas. If she phoned now she might be able to catch Rowdy. If he was in the office, she\u2019d ask him to locate the best heart surgeon in the state. No, on the West Coast.</p><p>She knew there were restrictions against using cell phones in hospitals, so she lined up at the pay phone, which didn\u2019t afford her much privacy. But that couldn\u2019t be helped. To her relief, she was immediately connected with her boss.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d he said, his big voice booming over the wire. \u201cGood to hear from you. How\u2019s your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. It could go either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d Rowdy sounded genuinely concerned and again her heart warmed toward him. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d Valerie said, lowering her voice in an effort not to be overheard. She looked around to make sure no staff members were within earshot. \u201cI need the name and phone number of the best heart surgeon on the West Coast. Dad\u2019s too ill to be transferred to another hospital just yet, but the one here in Orchard Valley is small. I can\u2019t be sure he\u2019s getting the best possible care. I want to make other arrangements as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll get right on it.\u201d</p><p>Not for the first time, Valerie felt a twinge of conscience. Colby Winston obviously cared about her father. If she hurt his professional pride by going behind his back, then she\u2019d apologize. For now, though, her primary concern had to be her father, and if that meant offending a family friend, well, too bad. It couldn\u2019t be avoided.</p><p>\u201cHow can I reach you at the hospital?\u201d Rowdy asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier if I call you back. In an hour or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this,\u201d Valerie told him.</p><p>A few minutes later, she strolled into the waiting room, where she\u2019d left Norah. Colby had joined her and it struck Valerie a second time how perfect Norah would be for him.</p><p>Valerie should\u2019ve been pleased by the idea. Excited, too. But she wasn\u2019t and she didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>Norah smiled at something Colby was saying, and Valerie realized with a small pang that her youngest sister was half in love with him already. If she could see it, then surely her father had, too. He was probably confusing the two of them in his mind, Valerie reasoned, which was certainly understandable under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s doing about the same,\u201d Norah said when she became aware that Valerie had entered the room. \u201cColby was just in to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he greeted her, smiling briefly.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Feeling guilty, she couldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou can take turns visiting your father if you\u2019d like, but you can only stay five minutes, and I\u2019d prefer that you waited an hour between visits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Valerie murmured. \u201cSince I was with him last night, do you want to go first?\u201d she asked Norah.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Valerie assumed that Dr. Winston would go with her sister, but he stayed behind, pouring himself a cup of coffee from the freshly brewed pot. His back was to Valerie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour father\u2019s going to require open-heart surgery,\u201d he said once he\u2019d turned around to face her. \u201cRight now his heart\u2019s too weak to withstand the additional stress, but we\u2019re fast approaching a crisis point, and you and your sisters need to prepare yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Valerie challenged. \u201cAnd who\u2019d perform the surgery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014 I am a qualified cardiovascular surgeon. And Orchard Valley has one of the best heart units in the state,\u201d Colby said in a reassuring voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want one of the best, I want the very best! This is my father we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Valerie knew she sounded unreasonable, even rude, but her concern about David overrode all other considerations, including her embarrassment at misjudging Dr. Winston. Why had Norah never mentioned that the man was a heart surgeon? Still, it didn\u2019t matter; her father deserved the best-equipped facility and the best-trained specialist around. She spoke in a calmer voice. \u201cIf he needs surgery, then he\u2019ll have it, but not here. Not when there\u2019s a better hospital and more experienced...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeart surgeons?\u201d Colby finished for her.</p><p>She stiffened, wanting to avoid a confrontation and knowing it was impossible. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to a second opinion, Valerie. I\u2019d be happy to review my credentials with you, as well.\u201d</p><p>Her arms cradled her middle. Her breakfast seemed to lie like a deadweight in her stomach.</p><p>Colby had begun to speak again. \u201cNorah\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already mentioned the possibility of open-heart surgery to Norah?\u201d she flared, disliking the fact that he\u2019d talked to her sister first.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cJust now. While you were out.\u201d</p><p>That hurt her pride. She, after all, was the oldest, the decision maker, the strong one.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to talk to another specialist, I can recommend several.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Valerie returned stiffly, feeling like a traitor. \u201cI\u2019m having a friend get me the names of the top heart surgeons on the West Coast.\u201d</p><p>A vacuum of silence followed her words.</p> <p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward him, surprised not to hear any resentment in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t appreciate everything you\u2019ve done,\u201d she rushed to explain. \u201cNorah\u2019s told me several times that if it weren\u2019t for you, we\u2019d have lost Dad that first night. I\u2019m grateful, more than you\u2019ll ever know, but I want to stack the odds in Dad\u2019s favor, and if that means bringing in another surgeon, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Her impassioned words were met with a cool but not unfriendly smile. \u201cIf David were my father I\u2019d do the same. Don\u2019t worry, Valerie, you haven\u2019t offended me.\u201d</p><p>She was so relieved that she nearly sagged onto the sofa.</p><p>\u201cLet me know who you want to call in and I\u2019ll be happy to confer with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDad and Norah are right,\u201d she added, almost to herself.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Colby asked on his way out the door.</p> <p>She looked up, realizing he\u2019d heard her. \u201cYou really are wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and in those few seconds an odd understanding passed between them. It wasn\u2019t a look lovers would exchange, she thought, but one close friends would.</p><p>Norah came back from the five-minute visit with their father, pale and clearly distressed. Slowly she lowered herself onto the sofa, her hands clasped tightly together.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not doing well this morning?\u201d Valerie ventured.</p><p>Norah nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s so weak...he\u2019s talking about dying and...\u201d She paused, her light blue eyes glassy with tears.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t going to die,\u201d Valerie said vehemently, clenching her fists at her sides. She refused to let him die.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d prefer if you and Steff and I were married, but that can\u2019t be helped now, he says. He told me he\u2019s sorry he won\u2019t be around to enjoy his grandchildren, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah,\u201d Valerie admonished briskly, \u201cyou didn\u2019t honestly listen to that garbage, did you? We can\u2019t allow him to talk like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to think you should marry Dr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned. \u201cSo I heard. That just goes to show you how illogical he\u2019s become. If anyone should marry Colby Winston, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Norah lowered her eyes and an attractive shade of pink flowed into her cheeks. \u201cEvery female employee in the hospital\u2019s in love with Dr. Winston. Even the married women have a crush on him. He\u2019s so strong, yet he\u2019s gentle and caring. I\u2014I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done the last couple of days without Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really care about him, don\u2019t you?\u201d Valerie asked, fighting down an unexpected sense of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with him\u2014not exactly. I admire him the way everyone else does, and if he ever asked me out, I\u2019d accept without thinking twice, but he hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Valerie was sure she would. She paced the small room, wondering what had prompted this sudden need for movement\u2014her father\u2019s apparent death wish or Norah\u2019s feelings for Colby Winston.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy this morning myself,\u201d she said, not looking at her sister. \u201cI asked Rowdy Cassidy if he\u2019d get us the name of the top heart surgeon on the West Coast. Dad has to have the finest medical\u2014\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s head shot up. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, if you\u2019re concerned about offending Colby, I\u2019ve already spoken to him and he agrees we should get a second opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Colby teaches at Portland University. He\u2019s the best there is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Orchard Valley.\u201d Of that Valerie was confident, but there was a whole world Norah knew little or nothing about. Her sister\u2019s entire universe revolved around Orchard Valley and their five-hundred-acre apple orchard ten miles outside town.</p><p>\u201cColby\u2019s one of the best cardiovascular surgeons in the state.\u201d Norah didn\u2019t bother to disguise her irritation. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019ve done?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou\u2019ve just insulted one of this country\u2019s most\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t insult him,\u201d Valerie insisted, interrupting her sister\u2019s tirade. \u201cI made sure of that. Furthermore, you never even let me know he was a heart surgeon\u2014 I thought he was just a G.P. And even if he\u2019s considered good here in Orchard Valley, Dad needs absolutely the best one available anywhere. Shouldn\u2019t you be concerning yourself with his problems and not worrying about offending your doctor boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s eyes widened with shock and hurt. She stood and without a word walked out of the room, leaving Valerie swamped in remorse. She hadn\u2019t meant to snap at her sister, nor had she wanted to sound so overbearing. Referring to Colby as Norah\u2019s boyfriend had been childish and petty, which proved how badly her nerves were frayed.</p><p>An hour passed and Valerie hurried down to the lobby to call Rowdy on her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valerie,\u201d she said breathlessly when he answered.</p><p>\u201cListen, you\u2019re in luck. There\u2019s an up-and-coming heart surgeon working out of Portland University. Apparently he\u2019s developed an innovative surgical technique. I\u2019ve talked to three of the top heart specialists in the country and they all highly recommend him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She groped through her purse until she found a pen and a notebook, which she positioned against the lobby wall. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Dr. Colby Winston.\u201d</p><p>Valerie dropped her arm. \u201cDr. Colby Winston,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got his phone number here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rowdy,\u201d she said, pride and shame clogging her throat, \u201cbut I\u2019ve already got it.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been home for twenty-four hours and she\u2019d already managed to alienate her sister, insult a family friend and at the same time disparage a highly regarded doctor.</p><p>\u201cJust great, Valerie,\u201d she muttered to herself. \u201cCan things get any worse?\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cSteffie?\u201d David Bloomfield\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he gazed up at Valerie.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here as soon as she can,\u201d Valerie reassured him. It was now early evening, and during every previous visit that day, he\u2019d been asleep, his heart\u2019s activity reported on the monitor.</p><p>How weak he sounded, she thought, as though death was only hours away. Her own heart clamored with dread and fear; she wanted to shout at him to fight, to hang on...</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that easy or straightforward\u2014as Valerie knew. In the past two days she\u2019d learned more about the functions of the heart than she\u2019d ever imagined. In more ways than one... She\u2019d learned that the symbolic heart, the center of human emotion, grew larger with the sorrows as well as the joys of love. And the physical heart was subject to its own stresses and risks.</p><p>Colby had strived to make the explanation as uncomplicated as possible. Simply put, her father was experiencing heart failure; his heart was pumping blood less efficiently than it should. The decreased strength of the muscles then resulted in distended blood vessels that leaked fluid into his lungs, which interfered with his breathing. Each hour he was growing weaker and closer to death.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t...hold out much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d Valerie insisted, railing against discouragement and defeat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to live long enough to be a problem to your children. Isn\u2019t that what you\u2019ve always said? You\u2019ve still got years and years. Good years, with a houseful of grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s smile was fleeting. \u201cGo home, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even been to the house yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there for me without you.\u201d She rubbed her thumb soothingly across the back of his hand, avoiding the IV needle. \u201cGet well, Daddy, please get well. We all need you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drifted shut, and the oppressive need to give in to the weakness of tears nearly overcame her. She blinked furiously in an effort not to cry, succeeding despite the enormous lump in her throat.</p><p>Valerie was grateful her features were outwardly composed when Colby entered the cubicle a few minutes later. He read over the clipboard that outlined her father\u2019s progress, then made a brief notation.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll sleep now,\u201d he said, guiding her out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked once they\u2019d left the Coronary Care Unit. \u201cWhy is he so much weaker than before? It\u2019s like watching his life ebb away. Surely you can do something?\u201d She heard the note of hysteria in her own voice and didn\u2019t care. Perhaps she was being selfish in wanting him to live when he so clearly wanted to be released from life. But she loved him so desperately. She needed him, and so did Steffie and Norah.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d Colby assured her.</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cValerie, trust me, I love that crotchety old man myself. I don\u2019t want to lose him, either.\u201d He led the way to the elevator. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll buy you some dinner.\u201d</p><p>When she declined, he said, \u201cWell, at least a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>She was on the verge of pointing out that there was coffee in the waiting room, then hesitated. He was right. She needed a break, even if it was only ten minutes in the hospital cafeteria.</p><p>They rode the elevator down to the basement and walked into the large, open room, which was mostly empty now. Colby reached for a serving tray and slid it along the counter, collecting a green dinner salad, a cellophane-wrapped turkey sandwich and coffee. Valerie surveyed the cottage cheese salad with the limp pineapple and instead grabbed a bottle of cranberry juice. She wasn\u2019t at all hungry, although she\u2019d eaten very little in the past few days.</p> <p>He withdrew his wallet and paid the cashier, then carried the tray to a table at the back of the room, near the window.</p><p>He chose one far removed from any of the occupied tables, and that started Valerie\u2019s heart pounding with a renewed sense of anxiety. Colby had brought her here to face the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to lose my father, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she asked outright, determined to confront the truth head-on.</p><p>Colby looked up, his dark eyes filled with surprise. \u201cNot if I can help it. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>She slumped against the back of the chair, so relieved that it was all she could do not to weep openly. \u201cI thought that was why you brought me here\u2014what you intended to tell me.\u201d With trembling hands, she picked up the bottle of juice and removed the top.</p> <p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to lose him.\u201d He spoke with such fierce conviction that she realized his will to keep her father alive was as strong as her own.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known my dad?\u201d she asked, leaning forward and resting her elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cA few years now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie vaguely recalled hearing Colby\u2019s name mentioned once or twice, but she couldn\u2019t remember when or for what reason. With her hectic work schedule she\u2019d been home only intermittently. Her last visit had been nearly six months ago, although she phoned weekly.</p><p>\u201cWe met soon after your mother died,\u201d Colby explained. \u201cYour father made a generous donation to the hospital in her name.\u201d</p><p>Valerie knew that David\u2019s contribution had been large enough for the hospital to begin construction of a new wing. The irony of the situation struck her for the first time, and she drew in a deep, painful breath. The new wing housed the Coronary Care Unit.</p> <p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d she said, feeling obliged to apologize\u2014or at least acknowledge his reputation. \u201cI understand that I was, uh, mistaken earlier in what I assumed about your skills. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt happens all the time. But back to your dad\u2014he and I play chess once a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever beat him?\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. \u201cOccasionally, but not often.\u201d</p><p>Valerie was good at chess herself, which was hardly surprising since her father had taught her to play. One day, perhaps, when all of this was over, she\u2019d challenge Colby to a game. Odd how easy it was to assume they\u2019d continue to know each other....</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very proud of you,\u201d Colby said casually as he unwrapped his sandwich.</p><p>Valerie suppressed a sudden urge to giggle. \u201cSo...he mentioned me before his attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt every opportunity.\u201d He frowned as he said it. He was, no doubt, thoroughly sick of the subject.</p> <p>Valerie settled back and crossed her arms, enjoying herself. \u201cIn other words, Dad\u2019s preoccupation with matching the two of us up isn\u2019t something new.\u201d</p><p>Colby paused, averting his gaze. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. He wasn\u2019t quite as blatant about it as he\u2019s been the past few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been curious about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Colby lifted his shoulders, as if to say she hadn\u2019t impressed him. Or was he saying she hadn\u2019t disappointed him?</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me a thing,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re everything your father said and more,\u201d he muttered, obviously hoping to satisfy her and at the same time put an end to the conversation.</p><p>Valerie knew it was sheer vanity to be so pleased. Still, although he might have intended his remark as a compliment, she didn\u2019t read any admiration in his eyes. If Dr. Colby Winston was attracted to her, he concealed it well. She hated to admit how much that wounded her pride. The truth was, she wanted him to be fascinated with her. She wanted him to feel enthralled, enchanted, impressed\u2014the way she was with him. Because, despite herself, and despite their awkward beginning, despite the prospect of a relationship with Rowdy Cassidy, she couldn\u2019t get Colby out of her mind.</p><p>In a strictly objective way, Valerie knew she was slim and attractive. No matter what her father said about her hair, it was styled in an exuberant tangle of russet curls that highlighted her cheekbones and unusual gray-green eyes.</p><p>Those eyes were her greatest asset in the looks department, although her mouth tended to be expressive. Being tall, almost five eight, was a plus, too. Norah was barely five three, and the entire world seemed to tower above her sister. When Valerie wore heels, there wasn\u2019t a man in her field she couldn\u2019t meet at eye level, which she considered a definite advantage.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like me, do you?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>Her question clearly took him aback, and he didn\u2019t immediately respond. \u201cI don\u2019t dislike you,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI make you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d she prodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not planning to fall in love with you. As I said before, there\u2019s someone else on the horizon. I\u2019m just...curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you feel about me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened, and Valerie could tell he wasn\u2019t accustomed to dealing with a woman as direct as she was. Most men weren\u2019t. Valerie didn\u2019t believe in suggestion or subtlety. The shortest distance between any two points was a straight line. She\u2019d learned that in high-school geometry and it had worked equally well in life.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re very good at what you do.\u201d</p><p>He was sidestepping her question and doing a relatively competent job of it, but she wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cWhich is?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cFunctioning in a male-dominated field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying I\u2019ve sacrificed my femininity?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help sounding a bit sarcastic.</p><p>His lips tightened again. \u201cYou\u2019re good at putting words in someone\u2019s mouth, too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut only when it suits my purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not sure how you feel about me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I knew the minute we met.\u201d</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow, waiting for him to finish. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t supply the answer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bright and attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d hoped to hear. He\u2019d revealed no emotion toward her. She\u2019d rarely met a man who was so...she searched for the right word. Staid, she decided. Stoical. He seemed to close himself up whenever he was around her, almost as though he felt he needed protection.</p><p>Valerie knew she could be overpowering and opinionated, but she wasn\u2019t cold or hard. Just straightforward. They were alike in that way, both sensible, seasoned professionals. It was common ground between them, yet Colby seemed determined to ignore their similarities.</p><p>He\u2019d been kind to her, she reminded herself. But she sensed that he would have behaved in the same compassionate manner regardless of who she was. Valerie understood that, even applauded it.</p><p>So why was she looking for something that wasn\u2019t there?</p><p>She shook herself mentally. \u201cAll right, Dr. Winston,\u201d she began in a brisk voice. \u201cTell me about my father.\u201d</p><p>Norah was asleep on the sofa when Valerie returned from the cafeteria. She spread the blanket over her sister, wondering why Norah wasn\u2019t at home. Norah stirred, her eyes fluttering open.</p><p>\u201cHello, Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Valerie said, smiling tenderly.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Norah asked, sitting up. She swept tangled hair away from her face, and Valerie saw that her soft blue eyes were puffy, as though she\u2019d recently been crying.</p><p>\u201cDown in the cafeteria with Colby.\u201d</p><p>Norah blinked, looking mildly surprised.</p><p>\u201cHe hadn\u2019t had dinner yet and asked me along so we could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel bad about what happened this morning,\u201d Norah said. \u201cI was upset about Dad and angry with you for going behind Colby\u2019s back. But then I realized I should have explained things better\u2014you know, told you about his qualifications.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI was angry that you hadn\u2019t talked to me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had, I might have saved myself a lot of trouble,\u201d Valerie agreed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, sis\u2014I would\u2019ve been upset, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there was ever a time we need to stick together, it\u2019s now. We can\u2019t allow a quarrel to come between us.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. Norah looked small and lost, and Valerie crossed the room to sit down beside her, placing a protective arm around her sister\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI wish Steffie was here,\u201d Norah murmured.</p><p>Valerie did, too, but in some ways perhaps it was best that their sister hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Her absence might well be the only thing keeping their father alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you and Colby talk about?\u201d Norah asked, pressing her head against Valerie\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDad, and what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Colby know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it looks like he may not have the option of waiting until Dad\u2019s lungs clear before performing open-heart surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his chances of survival would be practically nil if Colby went ahead with it now!\u201d</p><p>Valerie had felt the same alarm when Colby described the procedure to her. He\u2019d drawn a detailed diagram on a napkin and answered a multitude of questions. Although the surgery would be risky, it seemed to be the only alternative available to them. Valerie had understood and accepted Colby\u2019s reasoning, even though her father\u2019s chances were slim. She prayed the surgery could be delayed, but that was looking less promising every hour.</p><p>\u201cThe likelihood that he\u2019ll survive is a whole lot better with the operation than without,\u201d Valerie reminded her sister. \u201cStill, he said he\u2019d defer it as long as he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...oh, Val, it\u2019s so scary to think of what our lives would be like without Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She stroked her sister\u2019s hair, offering what reassurance and comfort she could.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t Colby wonderful?\u201d Norah asked after a while. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie smiled to herself, then nodded. He\u2019d made the surgery, with all its risks, seem the logical thing to do. For the first time since her arrival, she felt hopeful for her father\u2019s chances. She held on to that small surge of confidence with both hands. Colby had been patient, answering her questions, giving her reassurance and hope when she\u2019d felt none.</p><p>\u201cNow can you understand why everyone likes him so much?\u201d Norah asked, her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d intentionally baited him, determined to find out how he really felt about her. She\u2019d looked for some reaction, some sign, but he\u2019d given her nothing.</p><p>The more reserved he was, the more challenged she felt. Valerie doubted he ever raised his voice or lost his cool, composed air. Even when she\u2019d pressured him, he\u2019d shown almost no emotion. Yet Valerie couldn\u2019t shake the conviction that he was a man of deep feeling\u2014and strong passion.</p> <p>Colby was smiling; he\u2019d been smiling ever since he\u2019d left the hospital. He wasn\u2019t sure what had prompted him to invite Valerie down to the cafeteria. But he suspected it was because...well, because he enjoyed being with her. He\u2019d never known a woman who was so willing to speak her feelings. She was direct and honest and, damn it all, interesting. It wasn\u2019t that he found Sherry\u2014or for that matter, Norah\u2014boring. He enjoyed their company in an entirely different way.</p><p>But Valerie kept him on his toes. She didn\u2019t take anything at face value, but challenged and confronted until she was satisfied. He admired that. In fact, he admired her. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. This was a woman he could grow to love.</p><p>He\u2019d gone off the deep end, he told himself. Worked too many hours without a real break. He\u2019d listened to David Bloomfield once too often. There could never be anything between him and Valerie. She wasn\u2019t what he needed in a woman; not only that, she\u2019d never be content with life in Orchard Valley again.</p><p>He knew that as well as she did.</p><p>The next morning, with Norah at the hospital, Valerie felt comfortable about leaving for the first time since her arrival from New York. She desperately needed a change of clothes. She was still wearing the business suit she\u2019d had on when she\u2019d received Norah\u2019s message two\u2014no, three\u2014days earlier.</p> <p>She drove to the family home, down the mile-long driveway that led to the colonial house. She took a moment to glance at the hundreds of neat rows of apple trees, all in fragrant blossom. Then she hauled her suitcase up to her old bedroom, showered and changed into a pair of jeans and a soft blue sweater.</p><p>When Valerie returned to the hospital she felt a thousand times better. Norah was still asleep, curled up on the sofa, her knees tucked under her chin. She was so blonde and delicate that Valerie had an almost overpowering recollection of their mother. She came to an abrupt stop. The words of greeting froze on her lips and she turned into the hallway.</p><p>Quietly she fought back the tears. She\u2019d barely managed to compose herself before she saw Colby striding intently down the wide corridor, heading straight toward her, his face taut.</p><p>\u201cHave you got a moment?\u201d he asked stiffly.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Valerie said, puzzled by his obvious tension. \u201cIs something wrong? Is it Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is between you and me.\u201d Colby actually seemed angry. Furious, even, although he hadn\u2019t raised his voice. This was certainly the most emotion she\u2019d seen in him.</p> <p>He marched toward the elevator, with Valerie following, and then down the narrow passageway to the back entrance of the hospital and the employee parking lot. He was several yards ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she demanded. His pace was too swift for her to keep stride with him.</p><p>\u201cOutside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, we already are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d she practically shrieked, losing her patience.</p><p>Colby whirled around to confront her. \u201cI want to know exactly what you said to your father.\u201d</p><p>Valerie was confused. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUs.\u201d The simple little word resonated with anger, contempt, disgust.</p><p>Well, so much for her assumption that Colby Winston felt any attraction for her.</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d she repeated. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. There isn\u2019t any us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely my point,\u201d he snapped. \u201cPerhaps you can tell me why your father suddenly announced that you were falling in love with me\u2014and that he expected me to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d she exploded.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. What in the name of heaven did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Except for the time she\u2019d seen him yesterday evening, her father had been asleep. At least, his eyes had been closed and his breathing was shallow but regular.</p><p>\u201cHe knew we\u2019d talked in the cafeteria,\u201d Colby informed her coolly.</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe mentioned it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Norah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah, nothing. It came straight from the horse\u2019s mouth. That and a whole lot more.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned, staring down at the ground in an effort to think.</p><p>\u201cValerie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...thought he was asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he demanded a second time.</p><p>She was flustered now, which happened so rarely that it unnerved her even more. \u201cUh...just that we\u2019d spoken the other night and I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he insisted, his jaw muscles tightening.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, have this tendency to talk when I\u2019m upset. I don\u2019t mind telling you Dad\u2019s condition has really scared me. So if he\u2019s asleep, like he\u2019s been most of today, I sit by his side and tell him the things I\u2019ve been thinking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich included me?\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, she nodded. Rarely could she recall being more embarrassed. Color burned in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cValerie, what did you say to him?\u201d Colby asked for the third time. His voice was quiet but his face had sharpened with tension.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t remember everything she\u2019d mumbled, but what she did recall made her cringe. She\u2019d rambled on during those five-minute stretches, saying whatever came into her mind, and most of her thoughts seemed to concern Colby. Not for a second had she believed her father was awake enough to understand a word of it.</p><p>\u201cI told him how impressed I was with you,\u201d she began hesitantly. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t know you well, I sense a strength in you. I told him how grateful I was to you because I\u2019ve felt so helpless the last couple of days.\u201d</p><p>She chanced a look in his direction but his expression was impassive. Not knowing what else to do, she continued. \u201cIn any family crisis there\u2019s always one person who has to be strong, and everyone else leans on that person for support. I\u2019m the oldest and I feel responsible for the others. But when I saw my father that first time, I just...couldn\u2019t cope. It\u2019s even harder for Norah. I realized that the strong one in this situation is you. I told Dad that...and some other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other things?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t getting any better. \u201cThat I...found myself attracted to you. Not physically,\u201d she rushed to explain, conscious that she was lying. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to the emotional stability I sense in you. Only I didn\u2019t say all that to Dad because I didn\u2019t think he could hear me anyway.</p><p>\u201cWas that so terrible?\u201d she asked, when Colby remained silent.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he finally admitted in a hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Dad say to you?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>Colby\u2019s gaze touched hers, then withdrew. \u201cThat you\u2019d fallen head over heels in love with me. And that\u2019s a quote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Valerie said incredulously. \u201cNo wonder you were so upset!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUpset\u2019s not the word for it. I\u2019m worried about how this is going to affect David\u2019s recovery, especially since he seems to have all kinds of expectations now\u2014expectations that are going to be disappointed. Eventually he\u2019ll just have to realize you\u2019re not the kind of woman I intend to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Dr. Winston, you have nothing to worry about,\u201d she murmured, annoyed now. \u201cIf I was going to fall in love, it would be with a man who was a little more sensitive to my pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said, shrugging indifferently. \u201cYour father unfortunately read too much into your...remarks. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to say something to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who started this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t we just let the whole thing drop? By tomorrow he\u2019ll have forgotten I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not likely,\u201d Colby said in a grim voice. \u201cHe asked me to bring a preacher so we could be married at his bedside.\u201d</p><p>Valerie couldn\u2019t help it, she burst out laughing. It was as though all the tension, all the waiting and frustration, had broken free inside her. She laughed until the tears streamed down her face and her sides ached, and even then she couldn\u2019t stop. Clutching her stomach, she wiped the moisture from her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cColby, darling,\u201d she said between giggles. \u201cWhat shall I wear to the ceremony?\u201d</p><p>Colby apparently didn\u2019t find her antics humorous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want children, of course,\u201d she told him when she\u2019d managed to stop giggling. \u201cNine or ten, and I\u2019ll name the little darlings after you. There\u2019ll be little cheeses running around our happy home\u2014Cheddar and Parmesan and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have absolutely no intention of marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you don\u2019t right now, but that\u2019ll all change.\u201d She enjoyed teasing him, and the laughter was a welcome release after the tension of the past few days.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious, are you?\u201d</p><p>Valerie sighed deeply. \u201cIf you want me to say something to Dad, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not so bad, you know,\u201d she felt obliged to tell him. She was disappointed in his reaction, although she\u2019d never admit it. If she was going to make a fool of herself over a man, she didn\u2019t need to travel halfway across the country to do so!</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have a thing in common and shouldn\u2019t pretend we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave it at that, Valerie.\u201d</p><p>His attitude hurt. \u201cFine. I\u2019m not interested in you, either,\u201d she muttered. Without another word, she turned around and marched back into the hospital.</p><p>The man had his nerve. He made a relationship with her sound about as attractive as one with a...a porcupine! Colby acted as though she\u2019d purposely set a trap for him, and she resented that.</p><p>Norah was awake when she got back to the waiting room. Her younger sister looked up, smiling, as Valerie hurried in and began to pace.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Norah asked, pouring herself a cup of coffee. She gestured toward the pot, but Valerie shook her head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever noticed how opinionated and high-handed Colby Winston can be?\u201d she asked, still pacing furiously.</p><p>\u201cDr. Winston?\u201d Norah repeated. \u201cNot in the least. I\u2019ve never known him to be rude, not even when someone deserved it.\u201d</p><p>Valerie impatiently pushed the sleeves of her sweater past her elbows. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met a man who irritated me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought I did, too,\u201d she answered darkly.</p><p>\u201cSteffie phoned,\u201d Norah said, cutting off Valerie\u2019s irritation as effectively as if she\u2019d flipped a light switch. \u201cShe got through to the nurses\u2019 station here when she couldn\u2019t reach either of us at the house or on our cells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Valerie asked. \u201cIs the transportation strike over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Norah replied. \u201cShe\u2019s still trapped in whatever that town is. If she was in one of the big cities she wouldn\u2019t be having nearly as much trouble. She asked about Dad, and I told her everything\u2019s about the same. She sounded like she was close to tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Steffie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe said she\u2019d give everything she owns to find a way home.\u201d Norah sighed. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t break soon, I think Steff\u2019s going to hike over the Alps.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d do it, too; Valerie didn\u2019t doubt that for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI was with Dad earlier,\u201d Norah said, changing the subject again. \u201cHe was more alert than before.\u201d</p><p>Valerie frowned, well aware of the reason. Her dear, manipulative father seemed to think he was about to get his wish. Little did he realize she had no intention of marrying Dr. Colby Winston. Or that Colby was no more interested in her than she was in him.</p><p>Four</p><p>David Bloomfield\u2019s condition didn\u2019t change throughout the day that followed. Valerie saw Colby intermittently. He was in surgery most of the afternoon and came by, still wearing his surgical gown, to check on her father early that evening. Valerie happened to be there at the time, and she recognized the weariness in Colby\u2019s face. Without saying anything to her father, she trailed Colby out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about a cup of coffee?\u201d she suggested, and when he hesitated, she added lightly, \u201cI thought you might like to know how I warded off the preacher.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, then rubbed a hand across his eyes. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, glancing at his watch. \u201cGive me fifteen minutes and I\u2019ll meet you in the cafeteria.\u201d</p><p>Valerie headed downstairs with her briefcase and her laptop. That afternoon she\u2019d had her assistant e-mail the contents of several files to her. Even if she had to be out of the office while her father was ill, there were still matters that required her attention. She\u2019d spent much of the afternoon answering e-mails. Working out of the hospital waiting room wasn\u2019t ideal, but she\u2019d managed.</p><p>She was at a table in the cafeteria, reading over some notes on her laptop, when Colby arrived. As he pulled out a chair, she straightened, shut down the computer and closed it.</p><p>After a somewhat perfunctory greeting, Colby reached for the sugar canister in the middle of the table and methodically poured out a teaspoon, briskly stirring it into his coffee. \u201cI wanted to apologize,\u201d he began.</p><p>His words took her by surprise. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was out of line, coming down on you the way I did about the marriage business. I should\u2019ve realized your father was stretching whatever you said out of proportion. I took my irritation out on you.\u201d</p><p>She dismissed his apology with a shake of her head. \u201cIt was understandable. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes met hers as though he couldn\u2019t quite believe her. \u201cYou spoke to him?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>Valerie nodded, trying to conceal her amusement. \u201cMy poor father was distraught, or at least he tried to persuade me he was. But\u2014\u201d she sighed expressively \u201c\u2014he\u2019ll get over it just as I will.\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes melodramatically, teasing Colby just a little.</p><p>His eyes shot to hers, and a slow grin moved across his face, relaxing his features. \u201cDisappointed, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019ve always dreamed of a traditional white wedding gown\u2014one that matches the sheets on my father\u2019s hospital bed.\u201d She smiled and relaxed, too, feeling at ease with him now. She\u2019d been angry, but that was over, and she had to admit she actually liked this man. She certainly admired him.</p><p>Colby sipped his coffee, and once again she noted the lines of fatigue that marked his eyes and mouth.</p><p>\u201cRough day?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI lost a patient. Joanne Murphy. She died this afternoon in surgery. We knew there was a risk, but...\u201d He shrugged heavily. \u201cNo matter how often it happens, I never get used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Colby.\u201d Her hand slid over to his in a gesture of friendship and support.</p><p>His fingers gripped hers as if to absorb the comfort and consolation she offered. At the feel of his hand closing over hers, Valerie felt a thrill of happiness, and even more inexplicably, a sense of rightness. She didn\u2019t know how else to describe it. Yet almost immediately, the doubts and uncertainties flowed into her mind.</p><p>They were friends, nothing more, she reminded herself. And very recent friends at that. Neither of them was looking for anything else. Neither of them wanted anything else. But if that was really the case, why would she experience this deep ache of longing? For one impulsive moment she yearned to throw herself into his arms, rest her head against his shoulder and immerse herself in his strength. Lend him hers.</p><p>Valerie decided she had to ignore these uncharacteristic sensations. She withdrew her hand, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice its trembling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back before Norah wonders where I am,\u201d she said firmly. Valerie knew she was a woman who needed to be in control, who looked at a problem from all angles and worked toward the most favorable solution. But Colby Winston wasn\u2019t a problem to be solved. He was a man who left her feeling vulnerable and confused.</p><p>She was already on her feet, briefcase in one hand, laptop in the other, when Colby spoke. \u201cDon\u2019t leave...not yet.\u201d His voice was low, hesitant.</p><p>Valerie stared at him, unsure whether to stay or go.</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind.\u201d Colby shook his head, eyes suddenly guarded. \u201cActually, I should be leaving myself,\u201d he said quickly, bounding to his feet. He drank down several gulps of coffee, then strode out of the cafeteria, with Valerie close behind.</p><p>\u201cColby.\u201d She stopped him in front of the elevator. \u201cWhat is it you don\u2019t like about me?\u201d The question was out before she had time to analyze the wisdom of asking.</p><p>\u201cI do like you,\u201d he answered, frowning.</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed calmly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to marry someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d Valerie wasn\u2019t sure why she continued to probe, why it was necessary for her to understand his reasons. She only knew that she felt a compelling urge to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou have a brilliant future ahead of you,\u201d he said, not meeting her eyes. \u201cYour father\u2019s proud of your accomplishments, and rightly so. I admire your drive, your ambition, your ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut.\u201d She said it before he could. There had to be a but in there somewhere.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said with the slightest hint of a smile. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in getting involved with an up-and-coming female executive. When I commit myself to a woman and a relationship, I want someone who\u2019s more...traditional. Someone who\u2019ll consider making our home and rearing our children her career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He was wise to acknowledge that she wasn\u2019t the type who\u2019d be content to sit quietly by the fireplace and spin her own yarn. No, Valerie would soon figure out how to have that yarn mass-produced, then see about franchising it into a profit-making enterprise. Business was in her blood, the same way medicine was in his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to offend you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d she assured him, and it was the truth.</p><p>The elevator arrived and they stepped inside together. Neither spoke as Colby pushed the appropriate button. The doors silently glided shut.</p><p>Valerie wished they weren\u2019t alone. It seemed so intimate, so private, just the two of them standing there.</p><p>\u201cValerie, listen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, smiling up at him. \u201cReally. I asked, didn\u2019t I? That\u2019s how I am. You were honest with me, and I appreciate that. It\u2019s true I\u2019m attracted to you, but that\u2019s probably fairly common in our circumstances, since you saved my father\u2019s life and all. Being attracted doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d He broke off hastily, his eyes probing hers. \u201cOh, what the hell,\u201d he murmured, the words so low that Valerie had to strain to hear him. Then his hands were taking hold of her shoulders and drawing her toward him. His mouth unerringly found hers and without conscious intent, she responded to his kiss, feeling none of the awkwardness she experienced with other men. The kiss was much like the man. Warm, deliberate, devastating.</p><p>She heard a soft moan from the back of her throat.</p><p>His head shifted restlessly before he released her. He dropped his arms, looking completely shocked. Valerie didn\u2019t know what had distressed him most\u2014the fact that he\u2019d kissed her or that he\u2019d enjoyed it.</p><p>\u201cValerie, I...\u201d Her name was a whisper.</p><p>Just then the elevator doors opened, and Colby cast an accusing glare at the nurse who entered. Grabbing Valerie\u2019s hand, he jerked her onto the floor before the elevator doors closed again.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t CCU,\u201d she protested, glancing around. Good grief, they were on the maternity floor. Down the hall, a row of newborns was on display behind a glass partition.</p><p>But Colby didn\u2019t give her a chance to get a closer look. Still holding her hand, he led her to the stairwell. He held open the door, then released her and dashed up the steps. He was halfway up the first flight before he seemed to realize she was no longer beside him. He turned back impatiently.</p><p>\u201cColby,\u201d she objected. \u201cIf you want to run up the stairs, fine, but you\u2019re in better physical condition than I am. I sit at a desk most of the day, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, racing up the stairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, kissing you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nice enough, as kisses go,\u201d she said, out of breath from the exertion, \u201cbut don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have to marry me because of a simple kiss.\u201d The only way she could deal with this experience was to deny how strongly it affected her, push aside these unfamiliar, unwelcome feelings. She suspected that was how Colby felt, too.</p><p>\u201cOur kiss may have been a lot of things, but simple wasn\u2019t one of them,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much about something that really isn\u2019t important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes held such a quizzical expression that Valerie continued talking. \u201cYou\u2019re tired, and so am I,\u201d she said, making excuses for them both. \u201cWe\u2019re under a great deal of stress. You\u2019ve had a long, discouraging day and your guard slipped a little,\u201d she went on. \u201cMy being so pushy didn\u2019t help, either. You kissed me, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again.\u201d He spoke with absolute certainty.</p><p>Pride stiffened Valerie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best.\u201d Colby was right. Her personality was all wrong for someone like him. A doctor\u2019s work was emotionally demanding and physically draining; she couldn\u2019t blame him for seeking a wife who\u2019d create a warm cocoon of domesticity for him. A home filled with comfort and love and peace. Valerie couldn\u2019t fault his preference. She wished him well and determined to put the kiss out of her mind.</p><p>The next afternoon, Valerie went downtown. The streets of Orchard Valley greeted her like a long-lost friend. She felt heartened by the sight of the flower-filled baskets that hung from every streetlight.</p> <p>The clock outside the Wells Fargo Bank was still ten minutes slow, even after thirty years. When Valerie was thirteen, a watchmaker from somewhere out East had been hired to repair the grand old clock. He spent most of a day working on it, then declared the problem fixed. Two days after he\u2019d left town, the clock was back to running ten minutes late and no one bothered to have it repaired again, although it came up on the town council agenda at least once a year.</p><p>The barbershop with its classic red-and-white striped pole whirling round and round was as cheery as ever. Mr. Stein, the barber, sat in one of his leather chairs reading the Orchard Valley Clarion, waiting for his next customer. Valerie walked past, and when he glanced over the top of the paper, she smiled and waved. He grinned and returned the gesture.</p><p>The sense of homecoming was acute, lifting her spirits. She passed the newspaper office, two doors down from the barbershop; looking in the window, she noted the activity inside as the staff prepared the next edition of the Orchard Valley Clarion. She hadn\u2019t gone more than a few steps when she heard someone call her name.</p><p>She turned to find Charles Tomaselli, the paper\u2019s editor, directly behind her. \u201cValerie, hello. I wondered how long it\u2019d take before I ran into you. How\u2019s your dad doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the same,\u201d she answered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d He buried his hands in his pants pockets and matched his pace to hers. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Stephanie around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still in Italy.\u201d</p><p>Although he gave no outward indication of his feelings, Valerie sensed his irritation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t make the effort to come home even when her father\u2019s so ill? I\u2019d have thought she\u2019d want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying as hard as she can,\u201d Valerie said, defending her sister. \u201cBut she\u2019s stuck in a small town a hundred miles outside of Rome\u2014because of that transportation strike. But if there\u2019s a way out, Steffie\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>Charles nodded, and Valerie had the odd impression that he regretted bringing up the subject of her sister. \u201cIf you get the chance, will you tell your father something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet him know Commissioner O\u2019Dell called me after last week\u2019s article on the farm labor issue. That\u2019ll cheer him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe farm labor issue?\u201d Valerie repeated, wanting to be sure she understood him correctly.</p><p>Charles grinned almost boyishly, his dark eyes sparkling with pleasure. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re aware of this, but your father would make one heck of an investigative reporter. Tell him I said that, too. He\u2019ll know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Valerie agreed, wishing she knew more about the article and her father\u2019s role in it.</p><p>\u201cNice seeing you again,\u201d Charles said, turning to head back to the newspaper office. He hesitated. \u201cWhen you see Stephanie, tell her hello from me,\u201d he said over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be happy to.\u201d Thoughtfully, Valerie watched him walk away. Charles not only edited the Clarion, he wrote a regular column and most of the major features, like the farm labor story he\u2019d just mentioned. Considering his talent and energy, she was surprised he\u2019d stayed on with a small-town paper; he could have gone to work for one of the big dailies long before now. But then, these days, with major newspapers folding, maybe he\u2019d been smart not to leave.</p><p>She found it interesting that he\u2019d asked about Steffie. Several years ago, Valerie had suspected there was something romantic developing between them. Steffie had been a college student at the time and Charles had just moved to Orchard Valley. She remembered Steffie poring over every article, every column, exclaiming over Charles\u2019s skill, his style, his wit. To Valerie, it had definitely sounded like romance in the making. His comments about Stephanie now suggested it hadn\u2019t been entirely one-sided, either.</p><p>But then, romance was hardly a subject she knew much about. So if there was something between Steffie and Charles, it was their business and she was staying out of it. She knew just enough about relationships to make a mess of them. A good example of that was how she\u2019d bungled things with Colby.</p> <p>She felt a twinge of regret. Since their kiss, he\u2019d been avoiding her. Or at least she assumed he was. Until then, he\u2019d made a point of coming by and chatting with her when he could. They\u2019d always been brief visits, but their times together had broken up the monotony of the long hours she\u2019d spent at the hospital. She hadn\u2019t realized how much those short interludes meant to her until they stopped.</p><p>Norah was the one who\u2019d sent Valerie on the errand into town. Some flimsy excuse about picking up some photos from a roll of film their father had left for developing. He was admittedly old-fashioned when it came to cameras and photography; Valerie had wanted to buy him a digital camera last Christmas but he\u2019d insisted that he preferred his forty-year-old Nikon, which had served him well all these years. Asking her to collect the pictures now was a blatant attempt to get her out of the hospital, not that Valerie minded. She was beginning to feel desperate for fresh air and sunshine.</p><p>Although most of the orchards were miles out of town, she could\u2019ve sworn that when she inhaled deeply she caught a whiff of apple blossoms.</p><p>Spring was her favorite time of year. But although she\u2019d been home intermittently over the past decade, she\u2019d never spent more than a day or two and had never visited during April or May. She wondered if she\u2019d been unconsciously avoiding Orchard Valley during those months, knowing that the charm and the appeal of her home would be at their strongest then. Perhaps she\u2019d feared she might never want to leave if she came while the white and pink blossoms perfumed the air.</p><p>Not wanting to examine her thoughts too closely, Valerie continued down the street, past the feed store and the local caf\u00e9 until she arrived at her destination. Al\u2019s Pharmacy.</p><p>Al\u2019s was a typical small-town drugstore, where you could buy anything from cards and gifts to aspirin and strawberry jam. At one end of the pharmacy Al operated a state-run liquor store and in the opposite corner was a small post office. The soda fountain, which specialized in chocolate malts, was situated at the front. It had been there since the fifties, the kind of thing rarely seen outside of small towns anymore. Valerie had lost count of the number of times she\u2019d stopped in after school with her friends. She wondered if \u201cgoing to Al\u2019s for a chocolate malt\u201d remained as popular with local teenagers these days as it had been when she was growing up. She suspected it did.</p><p>\u201cValerie Bloomfield,\u201d the aging pharmacist called to her from behind the counter. \u201cI thought that was you. How\u2019s your dad doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah phoned and said you were on your way. I put those snapshots aside for you and just wrote it up on the bill. You tell your dad I\u2019m counting on him to go fishing with me come July, and I won\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Valerie promised.</p><p>She took the package and wandered outside. Curiosity got the better of her, though, and she paused on the sidewalk to open the envelope. Inside was an array of snapshots her father had taken that spring.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s heart constricted at the number of photos he had of her mother\u2019s grave site. In each, a profusion of flowers adorned the headstone. There were a couple of pictures of Norah, as well. The first showed her sitting in a chair by the fireplace, a plaid blanket around her knees and an open book on her lap. The second was taken outside, probably in late March. The wind had whipped Norah\u2019s blond hair about her face, and she was laughing into the sun. In both photographs her resemblance to their mother was uncanny.</p><p>Grief and pity tore at Valerie\u2019s heart as she imagined her father taking those pictures. He was so lost and lonely without his Grace, and the photographs told her that in an unmistakable and poignant way.</p><p>Her thoughts oppressive, Valerie walked aimlessly for a few minutes. When she saw that she was near the community park, she strolled in, past the swimming pool, now drained and empty, and followed the stone walkway that meandered through the manicured lawns. As she reached the children\u2019s playground, a breeze caught the swings, rocking them back and forth.</p><p>Memories of her childhood crowded her mind, and she sat in one of the old swings, almost wishing she could be a little girl again. It would\u2019ve been easy to close her eyes, pretending she was eight years old. She allowed herself a minute to remember Sunday afternoons spent in this very park, with David pushing her and a tiny Stephanie on these swings, catching them at the bottom of the slide. But she was thirty-one now and her father, whom she adored, was in a hospital room, fighting for each breath he drew.</p><p>She refused to even consider the possibility of losing him. Was she being selfish? She didn\u2019t know. Her father had said he was ready to die, ready to relinquish his life.</p><p>She dragged the toe of her shoe along the ground, slowing the swing to a halt. When the time came to let go of her father, Valerie prayed she could do it with acceptance and strength. When death came to him, she wanted it to be as a friend, not an enemy with a score to settle. But don\u2019t let him die yet. Please, not yet.</p><p>As she drove back to the hospital, past the strip malls that marked the highway, she caught sight of a recent addition. A movie theater, a six-plex. It astonished her that little Orchard Valley could have six movies all playing at once, especially in the era of DVDs and movies you could download from the Internet. She supposed that in a small town, going to the movies was still a major social event. The downtown theater she remembered so well from her teenage years still operated, but to a limited audience; according to Norah the features were second-run and often second-rate.</p><p>Orchard Valley had its share of national fast-food restaurants now, too, many of them situated along the highway. But as far as Valerie was concerned, hamburgers didn\u2019t get any better than those at The Burger Shack, a locally owned diner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The summer she was sixteen, Valerie had worked there as a waitress, serving customers for minimum wage, thinking she was the luckiest girl in town to have landed such a wonderful job. How times had changed! How much she\u2019d changed.</p><p>As she neared the hospital, Valerie felt a surge of reluctance. For nearly a week now, she\u2019d practically lived on the CCU floor with only brief visits home to shower and change clothes. It had been a strange week, outside ordinary time somehow. Four years ago, when her mother was dying, she\u2019d experienced something similar. But then her father and both her sisters had been there to share it. Now there were only two\u2014Norah and her. And Colby...</p><p>She pulled into the parking lot and found a vacant spot, then walked toward the main entrance, sorry to leave the sunshine.</p><p>The minute she entered the lobby, Norah sprang up from the sofa she\u2019d been sitting on. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever get back,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI stopped at the park. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffie called from Rome. She\u2019s flying home by way of Tokyo. I know it sounds crazy, but it was the most direct flight she could get. She\u2019s hoping to arrive sometime tomorrow night. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly when, but she said she\u2019d let us know as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she make it to Rome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her that, but she didn\u2019t have time to explain. I told Dad she\u2019d probably be here by tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Valerie felt herself relax. Until now, she hadn\u2019t realized just how tense she\u2019d been over Steffie\u2019s situation.</p> <p>\u201cColby wants to see you,\u201d Norah informed her next.</p><p>\u201cDid he say why?\u201d</p><p>Norah shook her head, frowning a little. \u201cYou two didn\u2019t have an argument, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>Norah shrugged vaguely. \u201cJust the way he looked when he asked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Norah was clearly regretting that she\u2019d said anything. \u201cIt\u2019s like he was eager to see you, but then relieved when I told him you\u2019d gone into town. That might seem absurd, but I can\u2019t think of any other way of describing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll catch him later.\u201d For some reason, Valerie wasn\u2019t quite ready to see him yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll stop by this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad doing?\u201d Valerie asked as they headed for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cNot so good. His breathing is more labored and the swelling in his extremities isn\u2019t any better. That\u2019s not a good sign. Colby\u2019s doing everything he can to drain his lungs, but nothing seems to work. In the meantime, Dad\u2019s growing weaker by the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe misses Mom even more than we knew,\u201d Valerie whispered, thinking about the snapshots she\u2019d picked up at Al\u2019s Pharmacy. She wondered how often he\u2019d visited their mother\u2019s grave. How often he turned to speak to the woman he\u2019d spent a lifetime with, remembering too late that she was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do if anything happens to Dad?\u201d Norah asked quietly.</p><p>A few days earlier, Valerie would\u2019ve rejected that possibility, adamantly claiming their father wasn\u2019t going to die. She\u2019d stubbornly refused to consider it. She wasn\u2019t as unyielding now.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut we\u2019ll manage. We\u2019ll have to.\u201d</p><p>They were seated in the waiting room when Colby arrived. Valerie glanced up from a business publication she was reading and knew instantly that something was wrong. Terribly wrong. His eyes, dark and troubled, met hers. Without being conscious of it, she stood, the magazine slipping unnoticed to the floor.</p><p>\u201cColby?\u201d His name became an urgent plea. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and reached for Valerie\u2019s hands, gripping them tightly with his own. His gaze slid from her to Norah. \u201cYour father\u2019s suffered a second heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Norah breathed.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Valerie\u2019s own heart felt as though it were in danger of failing just then. It pounded wildly, sending bursts of fear through her body.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t delay the surgery any longer.\u201d</p><p>Norah was on her feet, tears streaking her face. \u201cYou can\u2019t do the surgery now! His chances of survival are practically nil. We both know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any chance if we don\u2019t.\u201d Although he was speaking to Norah, it was Valerie\u2019s gaze he held, Valerie\u2019s eyes he looked into\u2014as if to say he\u2019d do anything to have spared her this.</p><p>Five</p><p>Colby had been with her father in the operating room for almost six hours, but to Valerie, it felt like six years.</p><p>While she waited, she recalled the happy times with her father and, especially as she entered adolescence, the not-so-happy ones. Her will had often clashed with his, and they\u2019d engaged in one verbal battle after another. Valerie had found her father stubborn, high-handed and irrational.</p><p>Her mother had repeatedly told Valerie the reason she didn\u2019t get along with her father was that the two of them were so much alike. At the time Valerie had considered her mother\u2019s remark an insult. Furthermore, it made no sense. If they were alike, then they should be friends instead of adversaries.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until her mother became ill that Valerie grew close to her father. In their love and concern for Grace, they\u2019d set aside their differences; not a cross word had passed between them since.</p><p>Valerie couldn\u2019t say which of them had changed, but she figured they\u2019d both made progress. All she knew was that she loved her father with a fierceness that left her terrified whenever she thought about losing him.</p><p>The passage of time lost all meaning as she paced, back and forth, across the waiting room floor. It wasn\u2019t the waiting room she was so familiar with, since Surgery was on the hospital\u2019s ground level; a small brick patio, bordered with a waist-high hedge, opened off glass doors. Every now and then, Valerie or Norah would wander outside to breathe in the cool air, to savor the peace and tranquility of the night. There\u2019d been no other patients in surgery that evening, no other families waiting for news.</p><p>Somehow word got out about her father\u2019s crisis. Pastor Wallen from the Community Church stopped by and prayed with Valerie and Norah. Charles Tomaselli was there for an hour, as well. Various friends, including Al Russell from the pharmacy, came, too.</p><p>At midnight, an exhausted Norah had curled up on the sofa and fallen into a troubled sleep. Valerie envied her sister\u2019s ability to rest, but found no such respite from her own fears.</p><p>Pacing and sucking on hard candy to relieve her nerves were the only methods she had of dealing with the terrible tension. She stared out the window at the bright moonlit night, then turned suddenly when she heard a soft footfall behind her. Colby stood there, still wearing his surgical greens.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes flew to his, but she could read nothing.</p><p>\u201cHe made it.\u201d</p><p>She nearly slumped to the floor with relief. Tears welled up, but she blinked them back. \u201cThank God,\u201d she whispered, raising both hands to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI nearly lost him once,\u201d Colby said hoarsely, shaking his head. How exhausted he looked, Valerie noted. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there was anything more we could do. It seemed like a miracle when his heart restarted. In some ways, it was. Only so much of what happens on the operating table is in my hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it was a miracle,\u201d Valerie whispered, hardly able to speak. She walked to the sofa on unsteady legs and bent to wake Norah. Her sister woke instantly\u2014her training as a nurse, no doubt\u2014and Valerie told her, \u201cDad made it through the operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe danger\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Colby cautioned. \u201cNot by a long shot. I wish I could tell you otherwise, but I can\u2019t. If he survives the night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he survived the surgery,\u201d Norah said, her voice raised with hope. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was possible. Surely that was his biggest hurdle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Colby agreed, \u201cbut his condition is critical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Norah answered, but a faint light began to glow in her eyes. From the little Norah had said, Valerie realized her sister hadn\u2019t expected their father to live through the ordeal. Now that he had, she was given the first glimmer of promise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes,\u201d Colby said, rubbing his eyes in an oddly vulnerable gesture. He must be running on pure adrenaline, Valerie thought. He\u2019d been in surgery earlier in the day and he\u2019d lost a patient; he\u2019d feared he was about to lose another one. He still could. He didn\u2019t need to say it aloud for Valerie to know.</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t think her father would live until morning.</p><p>\u201cI wish Steffie was here,\u201d Norah said after Colby had left.</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>Colby had been gone a few minutes when a male nurse appeared. He knew Norah and greeted her warmly, then told them they could each see their father, but for only a moment.</p><p>Valerie went first. She\u2019d assumed she was emotionally prepared, but the sight of her father destroyed any self-control she might have attained. Seeing him lying there so close to death affected her far more acutely than she\u2019d expected.</p><p>Hurriedly she turned and left, feeling as though she could barely breathe. She walked past Norah without a word. She stumbled onto the patio, hugging her middle with both arms, dragging in one deep breath after another in a futile effort to compose herself.</p><p>The tears, which she\u2019d managed to resist all evening, broke through in a flood of fear and anger. It was unfair. It was so unfair. How could she lose her father so soon after her mother?</p><p>She didn\u2019t often give in to tears, but now they came as a release. Huge sobs shook her body. Slowly, she lowered herself onto a concrete bench, then rocked back and forth as the hot, unstoppable tears continued to fall.</p><p>A hand at her back felt warm and comforting. \u201cGo ahead and let it out,\u201d Colby whispered.</p><p>He sat beside her, his arm around her shoulders, and gradually drew her to him. She had no strength or will to refuse. Nestling her face against his jacket, Valerie sobbed loudly, openly. Colby rubbed his cheek along her hair and whispered indistinguishable, soothing words. His arms were strong and safe, and she desperately needed him and he was there.</p><p>When there were no more tears left to shed, a deep shudder racked her body. She straightened and used her sleeve to wipe her damp face.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d Colby asked, his hand on her hair.</p><p>Valerie nodded, embarrassed now that he\u2019d found her like this. \u201cNorah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s talking to Mark Collins. One of the nurses who assisted me in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...thought I was prepared...didn\u2019t know I\u2019d fall apart like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been under a lot of stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have.\u201d She edged away from him, and taking the cue, he dropped his arm. She offered him a trembling smile, her gaze avoiding his.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could guarantee that your father\u2019s going to make it through this,\u201d he said, his voice heavy. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that, Valerie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Spontaneously, as though he\u2019d silently willed it, she raised her eyes to his. His hands grasped her shoulders, tightening as he urged her closer. His eyes seemed to darken as his mouth made a slow descent toward hers, stopping a mere fraction from her lips.</p><p>Valerie closed her eyes, and his warm breath caressed her face. She inhaled the pungent scent of surgical soap and something else, something that was ineffably him.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>It certainly wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected him to say. \u201cI...know,\u201d she said, but she was beyond listening to common sense. She needed Colby. His warmth, his comfort, his touch. And she wouldn\u2019t be denied.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The driving force of his kiss parted her lips, and Valerie was instantly caught in a whirlwind of sensation. Her hands reached for him, sliding up his solid chest, her fingers locking at the base of his neck.</p><p>He moaned, and she did, too. There was no resistance in Valerie, none. She surrendered herself to his kiss, to his need and her own.</p><p>With what seemed like reluctance, he broke away and slipped his mouth from hers.</p><p>She felt cold when he lifted his face. Opening her eyes, she glanced toward the waiting room, grateful to see that it was empty. They were alone in the shadows of the hedge, but a few seconds earlier it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if they\u2019d been standing in the middle of the bustling emergency room.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let that happen. We both\u2014\u201d</p><p>Valerie placed her finger over his lips, silencing him. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. Please.\u201d Her hands cupped his face and she gazed into his eyes, dark now with desire. \u201cI need you. Right or wrong, I need you. Just hold me.\u201d</p><p>A faint quiver went through her as he brought her back into his arms. Closing her eyes again, Valerie surrendered to the strength and safety she felt in his embrace.</p><p>He kissed her forehead lightly. His breath was uneven, and she found pleasure in knowing that he was no less affected by their encounter than she was.</p><p>As she\u2019d already told him, Valerie didn\u2019t want to question the right or wrong of it now. Neither of them was in any real danger of falling in love. Colby had explained the reasons a relationship between them was unfeasible. And she agreed with him. But their calm, rational words didn\u2019t take into account what she was experiencing. This excitement, this weightless sense of release and longing. She didn\u2019t want it to end. Apparently Colby didn\u2019t, either, because he made no move to let her go.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel so good in my arms,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t, not really. Soon they\u2019d both regret this, but she\u2019d save all the remorse for another day.</p><p>While she was in Colby\u2019s embrace, she didn\u2019t have to think about the future. She didn\u2019t have to worry about facing the world without anyone to guide and support her. For the first time since she\u2019d come home to Orchard Valley, Valerie didn\u2019t feel inadequate or alone.</p><p>True, Norah was with her and Steffie was due to arrive soon. The three of them had each other, yet Valerie couldn\u2019t quite escape the old roles; she was the one they\u2019d always depended on for encouragement, guidance, a sense of strength. Only Valerie didn\u2019t feel strong. She felt shaken, knocked off balance. She felt completely helpless....</p><p>\u201cNorah\u2019s looking for you,\u201d Colby said.</p><p>Valerie sighed and grudgingly broke away from him. She peered into the waiting room and noticed her younger sister. Norah\u2019s eyes found her at the same time. She didn\u2019t do a good job of concealing her shock.</p><p>Valerie stood and turned to Colby. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He remained sitting on the concrete bench and sent her a smile full of private meaning.</p><p>Norah met her at the door, eyes shifting from Valerie to Colby. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p> <p>Valerie nodded. \u201cDad\u2019s holding his own at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean Dad. I meant with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie answered, forcing a casual tone. \u201cI...just needed a good cry, and Colby lent me his shoulder.\u201d</p><p>Norah slipped her arm around Valerie\u2019s waist. \u201cHis shoulder, you say?\u201d she asked, with more than a hint of a smile. \u201cIt looked like more than that to me.\u201d</p><p>It was the following night, and once again Valerie and Norah had taken up residence in the waiting room. Several small groups of people were scattered about the area, either silent or speaking quietly.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s been asleep for nearly twenty hours.\u201d Valerie voiced her concern to Norah, who was far more knowledgeable about what was and wasn\u2019t usual after this kind of surgery. \u201cIsn\u2019t that too long? I realize the anesthesia has a lot to do with it, but I can\u2019t help worrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been awake for brief periods off and on today,\u201d Norah said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing very well, all things considered.\u201d</p><p>Her father wasn\u2019t Valerie\u2019s only concern. It was now after nine in the evening, and she\u2019d been waiting since morning for some word from Steffie, who was supposed to be arriving sometime that day. But no one had heard from her, and Valerie felt anxious.</p><p>\u201cDad tried to talk the last time I was with him,\u201d Norah told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense. He looked up at me and grinned as if he\u2019d heard the funniest joke in years and said \u2018six kids.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it, either,\u201d Norah murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Colby about it when I see him, but we keep missing each other.\u201d</p><p>Valerie sat down and thumbed through the frayed pages of a two-year-old women\u2019s magazine. It was a summer issue dedicated to homes and gardens, which only went to prove how desperate she was for reading material that would take her mind off her fears.</p><p>She glanced at photographs of bright glossy kitchens and \u201ccountry\u201d bedrooms, wicker-furnished porches and \u201cminimal\u201d living rooms\u2014all of them attractive, none of them quite real. None of them home.</p><p>And she knew with sudden certainty that home was here. Here in Orchard Valley at the family house. In the upstairs bedroom at the end of the hallway. Home was curling up with a good book by the fireplace in her father\u2019s den, and it was eating meals around the big oak table in the dining room her mother had loved.</p><p>That was home. She lived in her Houston condo in an exclusive neighborhood. She\u2019d had a decorator choose the color scheme and select the furniture, since she didn\u2019t have the time for either task. A housekeeper came in twice a week to clean. The condo was a place to sleep. An address where she could pick up her mail. But it wasn\u2019t a place of memories and it wasn\u2019t home.</p><p>She read an article in the same magazine about herb gardens. Gardening had always been her mother\u2019s hobby, but every now and then Valerie had helped her weed. The times they\u2019d spent working in the garden were among the fondest memories she had of her mother.</p><p>Perhaps in an attempt to recapture some of that simple happiness, Valerie had bought several large plants for her condo. But the housekeeper was the one who watered and fertilized them, since Valerie traveled so much.</p><p>Neither a home, at least not like the one she\u2019d been raised in, nor a garden seemed to be in her future. Colby had recognized that from the beginning. Just as well, although it hadn\u2019t warded off the magnetic attraction between them.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s mind wandered to their exchange the night before. Their kissing was undoubtedly a mistake, but it was understandable and certainly forgivable. Both were emotionally drained, their resistance to each other almost nonexistent. Yet Valerie couldn\u2019t bring herself to regret the time she\u2019d spent in Colby\u2019s arms.</p><p>It hurt a bit that he was avoiding her, because it told her he didn\u2019t share her feelings. In those moments with Colby, Valerie had experienced something extraordinary. She\u2019d always considered romantic love a highly overrated commodity. Dr. Colby Winston was the first man who\u2019d given her reason to reevaluate that opinion\u2014despite the fact that a relationship between them had no possible future.</p><p>Just when she was beginning to think he planned never to seek her out again, Colby surprised her. Norah had gone to talk with the nurse who\u2019d been assigned to care for their father, and Valerie sat alone in the SICU waiting room, shuffling through her thoughts. Colby was on her mind just then\u2014not that he was ever far from it.</p><p>She happened to glance up as he walked in. He was wearing a dark gray suit; she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen a handsomer man. Not even Rowdy Cassidy...</p><p>Their eyes met and held. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, with a breathless quality to her voice. Over the course of her career, Valerie had made presentations before large audiences. Her voice carried well, yet with Colby she felt like a first-grader asked to stand before the class and confess a wrong.</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d He paused and cleared his throat, then began again, sounding stilted and formal. \u201cI\u2019ve tied up everything here and I\u2019m addressing a seminar this evening at the university. However, I have time for a bite to eat before I leave. Would you join me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cI thought we should eat someplace other than the cafeteria.\u201d His voice was more relaxed now. \u201cThere\u2019s an Italian restaurant near here that serves excellent food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Valerie brightened until she realized he hadn\u2019t chosen the restaurant because he had a craving for spaghetti. He wanted to talk to her somewhere away from the hospital. Somewhere he could be assured none of his peers would be listening.</p><p>After leaving a message for Norah, they left the hospital in his car, a late-model maroon sedan. Sitting beside him, watching his strong, well-shaped hands on the steering wheel, gave Valerie a sense of intimacy, a feeling of familiarity.</p><p>The restaurant, a fairly new place she\u2019d never visited before, was elegantly decorated in black and silver. The lighting, low and discreet, created a welcoming ambience.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to pay for my dinner to apologize, you know,\u201d Valerie said, reading over her menu. She quickly decided on a bowl of minestrone soup and fettuccine with fresh asparagus. No wine, because it would send her to sleep.</p><p>\u201cApologize?\u201d Colby repeated.</p><p>Valerie lowered her menu and, crossing her arms, leaned toward him. \u201cNot apologize exactly. You brought me here to tell me you\u2019re sorry about what happened last night, didn\u2019t you? I mean, it\u2019s fairly obvious, since you\u2019ve been avoiding me all day. But don\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said off-handedly, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He scowled and set aside his menu. \u201cSometimes I forget how direct you can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have everything out in the open. There\u2019s no need to concern yourself with...what happened. I\u2014needed you, and you were there for me.\u201d</p><p>His scowl intensified. \u201cIn other words, any man would have suited your purposes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cOnly you. What we shared was very...sweet. I\u2019ll always be grateful to you for letting me cry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the crying that concerns me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kissing was very special, too,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose it was. But it might be best to forget that, uh, particular part of last night.\u201d</p><p>The waitress approached with pad and pen in hand. They placed their orders, then Valerie resumed the conversation. \u201cMaybe you can forget the kissing,\u201d she said in a mild tone, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be possible for me.\u201d</p> <p>Colby\u2019s gaze left hers. \u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to forget it, either,\u201d he said.</p><p>They both fell silent but a faint smile curved her lips as she savored his words. He\u2019d tried to dismiss the attraction between them and couldn\u2019t. Neither could she.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d he told her, his voice calm and resolute.</p><p>He\u2019d meant everything he\u2019d said earlier; that much Valerie understood. She couldn\u2019t change who she was. Easy as it would be to fall in love with him, Valerie knew she\u2019d never be truly happy as a homemaker. She had too much ambition, too many dreams. A business career was what she wanted, where her skills lay, and she couldn\u2019t relinquish that any more than Colby could give up his medical practice.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s doing remarkably well,\u201d Colby told her in an obvious attempt to change the subject.</p> <p>Valerie was delighted. Norah had told her repeatedly what excellent progress their father was making, and it was thrilling to have it confirmed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him listed as critical at the moment,\u201d Colby went on, \u201cbut I have a feeling he\u2019s going to surprise us all and live to be a hundred.\u201d</p><p>Valerie beamed Colby a happy smile, hardly able to speak for the emotion clogging her throat. \u201cWe owe you so much, Colby.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off her thanks and seemed grateful that the waitress appeared just then to deliver the first course of their meal.</p><p>The soup was delicious, but after a few spoonfuls Valerie was finished, her appetite gone. She managed only a taste of her fettucine. Colby glanced over, frowning, when she pushed the plate aside.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hardly touched your meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>Valerie lowered her eyes. \u201cI was just trying to decide how I was going to leave you, Colby, and not cry.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to sound quite so serious; she\u2019d meant to sound wryly amused.</p><p>Her words silenced him. His eyes met hers, and when he spoke, his voice revealed his sincerity. \u201cYou\u2019d be very easy to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut.\u201d She said the dreaded word for him.</p><p>\u201cBut we both know it wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said convincingly. Why wouldn\u2019t her heart listen?</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d Her father smiled weakly as she entered the cubicle in SICU. His hand reached for hers, brought it to his lips. \u201cI wondered when I\u2019d see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...went out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to tell him she\u2019d been with Colby.</p><p>Besides, there were other things to discuss. Norah had told Valerie the most unbelievable story. Apparently while Valerie was out for dinner, their father had told Norah about a vision he\u2019d had. A vision? Valerie didn\u2019t know what to make of that, any more than Norah did.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this Norah was telling me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Once again her father smiled, only this time it was brighter and there was a sparkle in his tired eyes. \u201cI died, you know. Ask Colby if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely Valerie remembered Colby saying something about her father\u2019s heart stopping and restarting, and considering it a miracle. \u201cI know we\u2019re very fortunate to have you with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore fortunate than you realize. Now, I don\u2019t want you getting all excited the way your sister did, but I don\u2019t expect you will. I had what those television reporters call a near-death experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe long dark tunnel with the light at the end?\u201d Valerie had certainly heard about the phenomenon.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cI was in a garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Garden of Eden?\u201d she asked lightly.</p><p>\u201cMight\u2019ve been. I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been aware that she was joking. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice the trees so much, but there might\u2019ve been an apple. What I did notice was the pretty woman tending the roses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Valerie breathed the question, hardly knowing where it came from.</p><p>David smiled and shut his eyes. \u201cWe had a good, long talk, your mother and I. She convinced me it wasn\u2019t my time to die, that there\u2019s still plenty for me to do on this earth. I wasn\u2019t pleased to hear it because I\u2019ve been thinking for some time now that I\u2019d rather be with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShush now, because I have a lot to tell you and I\u2019m getting weaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother loves you and is very proud of everything you\u2019ve accomplished, but she said you should take time to enjoy life before it passes you by.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like something her mother would say.</p><p>\u201cShe also told me I was an old fool to try and match you up with Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d She snapped her mouth closed, unwilling to say more.</p><p>\u201cGrace feels my pushing the two of you to marry was ridiculous. Said I should apologize for that.\u201d</p><p>Valerie remained silent.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d David continued, \u201clots more. Grace wanted to be sure she gave me plenty of reasons to come back to this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad she convinced you.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes drifted shut, but he opened them again with apparent effort. \u201cShe talked to me about Stephanie and Norah, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Daddy,\u201d she said softly, patting his hand. \u201cYou can tell me all about it next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to explain now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all going to get married. Your mother assured me all three of you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. Very...soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she whispered, although she wasn\u2019t sure he heard her.</p><p>So her father had gone through a near-death experience. Valerie didn\u2019t know how much credence to put in what he was saying. Marriage was the farthest thing from her mind at the moment. Obviously, marrying Colby was out of the question. And\u2014without even noticing\u2014she\u2019d lost interest in the idea of a relationship with Rowdy Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cShe gave me twelve reasons to live,\u201d her father announced sleepily. \u201cTwelve very good reasons.\u201d</p><p>Valerie recalled that Norah had said something about the number six. She couldn\u2019t imagine why her father was speaking in figures all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cTwelve reasons,\u201d Valerie echoed, then leaned forward to kiss his cheek.</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he grinned boyishly. \u201cYup, my grandchildren. You, my darling Valerie, are going to give me three. All within the next few years.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you spoke to your father?\u201d Colby asked Valerie when she arrived at the hospital the next morning, carrying an armful of apple blossoms for the nurses\u2019 station. He seemed to be waiting for her, and none too patiently.</p><p>She sighed, realizing what must have happened. \u201cI take it Dad told you about his experience in the Garden of Eden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the Garden of Eden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFiguratively, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know, then,\u201d Colby muttered. A hint of a frown flickered across his expression.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way\u2014at least Dad\u2019s given up his matchmaking efforts.\u201d Valerie had assumed Colby would be happy about that, so his reaction puzzled her.</p><p>His scowl deepened. \u201cHe apologized for even making the suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, what\u2019d I tell you?\u201d Valerie said, her mouth quirking with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019re both in the clear.\u201d</p><p>Apparently, this wasn\u2019t what Colby wanted to hear, either. \u201cHe also claimed you\u2019d be married before the end of the summer\u2014and that you\u2019d present him with three grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the next few years. It looks like I\u2019m going to be busy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Valerie hadn\u2019t taken her father\u2019s announcement too seriously; he\u2019d had some kind of pleasant hallucination, and if it made him feel better, if it gave him a reason for living, then that was fine. She\u2019d go along with it, although she wouldn\u2019t actively encourage him.</p><p>Besides, it was highly unlikely she\u2019d marry anytime soon, and even if she did, she had no intention of leaping into this motherhood business. Marriage would be enough of an adjustment. She enjoyed children, and naturally assumed she\u2019d eventually want a family, but definitely not in the first year or two following her marriage.</p><p>\u201cDid he say who you\u2019re supposed to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He wouldn\u2019t tell Norah, either, although he seemed to enjoy letting her know she\u2019s going to have six kids. Three boys and three girls, if you can believe it. You don\u2019t really buy any of this, do you?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted into a wry grin. \u201cThat would be ridiculous, only... Never mind,\u201d he finished abruptly.</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, clearly regretting that he\u2019d said anything. \u201cAnother patient of mine, an older woman, had a near-death experience. It was all rather...strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came back thinking she knew who her children would marry and how many grandchildren she was going to have?\u201d Valerie asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Colby threw her an annoyed glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d She was curious now, unable to disguise her interest.</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to know certain things about the future. She\u2014predicted, I guess is the word\u2014certain political events. She wasn\u2019t entirely sure how she knew, she just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what was that all about?\u201d</p><p>Colby obviously wasn\u2019t comfortable outlining the details of his patient\u2019s experience. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any more than an eighth-grade education, and she\u2019d never taken much interest in history or politics. But after that near-death phenomenon, she was suddenly able to discuss complicated world problems with genuine insight and skill. She didn\u2019t understand it herself, and I didn\u2019t have any medical explanation to offer her. The whole thing was as much a mystery to me as it was to her.\u201d</p><p>Until then, Valerie had to admit, she\u2019d found her father\u2019s experience somewhat...entertaining. She\u2019d been willing to tolerate it, since whatever had happened had been very real to David. This \u201cdreamtime\u201d with her mother had given his life a new purpose, and she was grateful for that, if nothing else.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d she asked Colby.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly none of this seemed quite as amusing. \u201cDad insists I\u2019ll be married before the end of the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me the same thing,\u201d Colby said. \u201cAbout you, I mean.\u201d He paused. \u201cIs it likely? I mean, is there someone back in Texas you\u2019ve been seeing on a regular basis?\u201d He clasped his hands behind his back and strolled slowly down the corridor. \u201cSomeone other than this person you were hoping to start dating soon?\u201d</p><p>She puffed out her cheeks, debating how much to tell him about Rowdy Cassidy. \u201cNot really, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he urged.</p> <p>\u201cMy boss, Rowdy Cassidy.\u201d She shifted the spray of apple blossoms, conscious of their heady aroma in the antiseptic-smelling hospital corridor.</p><p>\u201cThe owner of CHIPS?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone out on a formal date with him, although until recently we saw each other nearly every day. We\u2019ve often traveled together, and attend business dinners together. It wasn\u2019t until I got here and Dad started talking about you and me marrying that\u2014well, Rowdy seems the natural choice for me. He\u2019s as dedicated to his career as I am and...we get along well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wealthy man. Prominent in his field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Colby clenched his jaw as though he disapproved.</p><p>\u201cDo you know something about Rowdy that I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met the man. Everything I know about him I\u2019ve read online or in the papers. But from all outward appearances, the two of you should be an ideal couple.\u201d His words were indifferent. Then without saying anything else, he turned and walked away from her.</p><p>\u201cColby,\u201d Valerie called, once she\u2019d recovered from her initial surprise. She hurried after him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You\u2019re acting like I\u2019ve done something to offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry,\u201d he said, his voice low. His gaze held hers with a disturbing intensity. \u201cI remember what you said yesterday about wondering how we were going to say goodbye. I was just thinking the same thing. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be able to stand by and watch you marry another man.\u201d</p><p>To her the solution was simple. He could marry her himself. But...they\u2019d both already decided that wouldn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked, needing to know. \u201cIs there someone special you\u2019ve been seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her heart felt as if it had done a nosedive, colliding with her stomach. Her face must have revealed her shock because he elaborated.</p><p>\u201cSherry Waterman. I thought Norah might have mentioned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nurse?\u201d she guessed.</p><p>Colby nodded. \u201cSherry has her nursing degree and she\u2019s also trained as a midwife. That\u2019s what she\u2019s been doing for the past five years. She\u2019s good with children and she enjoys weaving and gardening.\u201d His voice was brisk and matter-of-fact as he listed Sherry\u2019s qualifications.</p><p>\u201cShe...sounds exactly right for you.\u201d The aching admission was torn from her throat. Although it was painful to think of Colby with another woman, Valerie knew he\u2019d chosen well in Sherry Waterman. Domestic, talented, perfect in all the ways Valerie wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been dating for the last year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA year,\u201d Valerie repeated slowly, surprised he hadn\u2019t proposed to Sherry long before now. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t keep her waiting then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep telling myself the same thing.\u201d</p><p>His words hurt, although Valerie pretended otherwise. \u201cI\u2019m delighted for you, Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowdy Cassidy will make you a good husband.\u201d His eyes probed hers.</p><p>Valerie smiled and nodded, then they both turned and walked in opposite directions. And although she was tempted, she didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s cell phone vibrated, and she took the call in the hospital lobby.</p><p>\u201cValerie, it\u2019s Rowdy. Thought I\u2019d check and see how everything\u2019s going with your father. No one\u2019s heard from you in a while.\u201d</p><p>When had she last reported into CHIPS headquarters? Two days before, she calculated. Two whole days! Valerie found that hard to believe. Until recently, her job had been all-consuming, but it wasn\u2019t that way now. She\u2019d completely overlooked her work responsibilities, forgotten everything that had once been so important. It seemed impossible that she could have allowed so much time to slip past.</p><p>\u201cMy father had open-heart surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulously well. His recovery in the last twenty-four hours has been remarkable.\u201d She didn\u2019t tell him that much of the improvement was a result of a change in attitude. Since his \u201cconversation in the garden\u201d with Grace, David Bloomfield\u2019s will to live was stronger than ever. If there was anything to worry about now, it was the fact that Steffie hadn\u2019t arrived yet and no one had heard from her. Valerie had spent part of the morning calling the airlines to find out which flight she was on, to no avail.</p><p>\u201cWe miss you around here,\u201d Rowdy said in that casual way of his. Valerie could picture him sitting in his office, leaning back in his plush leather chair, cowboy boots propped on the mahogany desk. She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing Rowdy without his boots and hat. She always thought of him as the Texan of frontier legend, the man who tackled life with robust energy, who considered no problem insurmountable. He worked hard, played hard and lived hard.</p><p>\u201cI miss CHIPS, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea when you\u2019ll be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, no, but if you need me because of the Old West Bank deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Rowdy said, breaking in. \u201cWe\u2019re handling that from our end, so don\u2019t you worry about a thing. I just wanted you to know I miss you.\u201d</p><p>The personal pronoun didn\u2019t escape Valerie\u2019s notice. Rowdy was attracted to her. \u201cMy father wanted me to thank you for the flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cTh-they got here yesterday morning.\u201d She\u2019d hardly been aware of it at the time, although the nurses had all exclaimed over the lavish bouquets. Now, she felt flustered and nervous with him, something that had never happened before. Their relationship was moving into new territory, and Valerie found the ground unstable and a bit frightening.</p><p>\u201cActually the flowers were for you. I thought you needed something to brighten up your day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very thoughtful of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least I could do for my favorite executive. You hurry back, you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. And, Rowdy, thanks for calling.\u201d She closed her cell phone and let her breath rush out in a deep sigh.</p><p>Norah was already in the waiting room when Valerie returned there. \u201cThat was Rowdy Cassidy,\u201d she explained unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with him?\u201d Norah asked without preamble. \u201cI thought you and Dr. Winston might be hitting it off, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby\u2019s involved with Sherry Waterman.\u201d Valerie kept her voice steady, making a strenuous effort to feign disinterest.</p><p>One glance at Norah told her she hadn\u2019t succeeded. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall that I never bothered to mention Sherry. There\u2019s a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Valerie shrugged. \u201cI wondered...I mean, even Colby seemed to think you had, or rather that you should have.\u201d She\u2019d wanted to ask her sister, but had hesitated, almost preferring not to know.</p><p>\u201cThose two have been dating for a year. If Colby was serious about Sherry he would\u2019ve asked her to marry him before now. Even Sherry\u2019s given up on them, although Colby doesn\u2019t seem to have figured that out yet. The last I heard, she was seeing someone else. Not that I blame her,\u201d Norah was quick to add. \u201cIt must be the most frustrating thing in the world to be crazy about a guy and have him lukewarm toward you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered me,\u201d Norah pressed. \u201cWhat about Rowdy? Are you in love with him?\u201d</p><p>Valerie shrugged again, uncomfortable with the subject of her boss, unsure of her own feelings toward him. \u201cYes and no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beginning to sound like Colby. I think he loves everything Sherry represents. She\u2019s a nurturing, kind-hearted woman. She fits the image of what Colby wants in a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s stopping him?\u201d</p><p>Norah gnawed on her lower lip for a moment. \u201cMy guess is that she bores him. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Sherry\u2019s not a boring person. Actually when I think about it, Sherry and I are a lot alike. She\u2019s a homebody like me, and little things mean a lot to her. She doesn\u2019t need an active social life or fancy clothes. Given the choice between a stay-at-home date with a rented movie or dining in a world-class restaurant, she\u2019d opt for the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much better suited to Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Valerie asked, her voice rising in astonishment. Hadn\u2019t Norah just finished describing the kind of woman Colby wanted\u2014a woman completely unlike Valerie?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the looks the two of you exchange,\u201d Norah continued thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not blind, you know. I can feel the attraction between you. It\u2019s mutual\u2014and it\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Valerie said, becoming preoccupied with the crease in her wool trousers.</p><p>\u201cYes, really!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019ll admit we\u2019re attracted to each other, but nothing\u2019s going to come of it.\u201d She glanced at her watch, wanting an excuse to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop in and see Dad.\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s smile seemed all-knowing. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>David Bloomfield\u2019s color was better, and he grinned happily when he saw his eldest daughter.</p><p>\u201cHello, Dad,\u201d she said in a cheerful voice as she leaned over to kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d he whispered, holding out his hand to her. \u201cListen, sweetheart, you\u2019re spending too much time at the hospital. Take the day and get out in the sunshine. You\u2019re beginning to look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll do you good. No more sleeping on some dilapidated couch in the waiting room, either.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d slept in her own bed in her own room for the first time the night before. In the morning, she\u2019d been astonished at how well rested she felt. And she\u2019d indulged in a long, hot shower, followed by a good breakfast\u2014cooked by Norah.</p><p>The crews were just beginning to spray the apple trees under the direction of Dale Howard, the orchard manager. She\u2019d heard the familiar sounds of men working in the orchards. It brought back memories of years past, of racing down the long, even rows, and climbing onto the low limbs of the trees, sitting there like a princess surveying her magical kingdom. Orchard Valley was magical, a town set apart.</p><p>For Valerie, coming home was like escaping to the past. The people were friendly, the neighbors neighborly, and problems were shared. It was a little piece of heaven.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at the hospital last night,\u201d she told him, pulling herself out of her musings. She loved Orchard Valley more than any place on earth, but she\u2019d never be satisfied living here. There wasn\u2019t enough challenge, not enough to tax her mind. No, Houston was her future and she accepted that with only one regret. Colby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I heard,\u201d her father answered. \u201cI saw Colby earlier.\u201d</p><p>Valerie watched his expression, hoping for\u2014what?\u2014some sign, some indication of her father\u2019s thoughts. And of Colby\u2019s...</p><p>There was none.</p><p>\u201cWell? What did the good doctor have to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention me?\u201d she couldn\u2019t prevent herself from asking.</p><p>\u201cNope, can\u2019t say he did. Does that disappoint you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any reason he should mention you?\u201d</p> <p>Valerie was sorry she\u2019d brought up the subject. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>Her answers seemed to make him smile. \u201cSo you like my doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been wonderful to you,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about me,\u201d David told her gruffly. \u201cI\u2019m referring to you. You\u2019re attracted to him, aren\u2019t you, Valerie? You were never very good at hiding your feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met a man who appeals to me more,\u201d Valerie said truthfully. There was no point in trying to deceive her father. He knew her all too well, and he understood her better than anyone, sometimes better than she understood herself.</p><p>\u201cHe feels the same way?\u201d The question was calm, as though he were speaking to a child.</p> <p>Valerie lowered her eyes before shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019d never work, and we both know it.\u201d</p><p>She expected an argument from her father, was even looking for one. She wanted him to tell her she was wrong, that love could work when two people were committed to each other. That it wouldn\u2019t matter how dissimilar they were, how differently they viewed life. That nothing mattered but the love they shared...</p><p>Her father, however, didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Discouraged, Valerie said goodbye and returned to the waiting room. On her way, she saw that Norah sat talking to another doctor at the end of the hallway. She was grateful her sister had left, because she needed time alone to think.</p><p>If she wanted evidence that people with very different personalities could fall in love and make the relationship work, she need look no further than her own parents. The story of how they\u2019d met and fallen in love was like a fairy tale, one that, as a child, she\u2019d never tired of hearing.</p><p>Her father had gone to university and obtained his degree in business administration. Armed with his dreams, he\u2019d built a financial empire and became a millionaire within a few years. Then he\u2019d collapsed with rheumatic fever, nearly losing his life. While he was in the hospital recuperating, he\u2019d met a young nurse. David knew the moment he met Grace Johnson that he was going to love her. It never occurred to him that she\u2019d refuse his marriage proposal.</p><p>Several months of relentless pursuit later, he\u2019d convinced Grace to marry him. Despite the fact that she was deeply in love with David, Grace had been afraid. She was a preacher\u2019s daughter who\u2019d lived a simple life. David was a business tycoon who\u2019d taken automation technology to new industry heights. Grace\u2019s fears about a marriage to David Bloomfield were warranted. But over the years, love had proven even the most hardened skeptics wrong, and the two had lived and loved together until her mother\u2019s death a few years before.</p><p>Her own romance wasn\u2019t going to have a fairy-tale ending, the way her parents\u2019 had. Her father knew it, too, otherwise he would\u2019ve been the first to encourage her.</p> <p>Her father, however, had said nothing.</p><p>Valerie was working in the den on her laptop, putting files in order, when she saw the red car hurtle down the driveway. She thought, for one hopeful moment, that it might be Colby, but then remembered he drove a maroon Buick. Still, she hastened to answer the door.</p><p>It was Charles Tomaselli, looking tired and frustrated.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Stephanie?\u201d he demanded without so much as a greeting.</p><p>Her sister\u2019s absence had been weighing on Valerie\u2019s mind, too. She\u2019d done everything she could think of; she\u2019d even placed a call to the American Embassy in Rome, with no results.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard a word. I don\u2019t know what could\u2019ve happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow late is she?\u201d</p><p>Valerie had to think for a moment. In the past week, she\u2019d lost all track of time. \u201cNorah was the last person to speak to Steffie,\u201d she explained. \u201cLet me see\u2014that was just before Dad\u2019s surgery. Steffie thought she\u2019d be home within twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was forty-eight hours ago.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to remind her, Valerie thought irritably. \u201cShe\u2019s coming by way of Tokyo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTokyo? She\u2019s flying to Oregon via Japan?\u201d Charles snapped.</p><p>\u201cI gather she didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should be making some inquiries?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI already have. Tell me who else I should call and I\u2019ll be happy to do so.\u201d</p><p>Charles settled down on the top porch step, resting both elbows on his knees. \u201cI have to tell you, Valerie, I\u2019m worried. She should\u2019ve been here before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some friends, some connections,\u201d Charles said absently, \u201cand I\u2019ve checked with them. But they can\u2019t find any trace of her on the flights scheduled out of Rome. If she isn\u2019t here by tomorrow afternoon, I don\u2019t think you have any alternative but to contact the authorities.\u201d</p><p>Valerie swallowed tightly, then nodded. She could slap Steff silly for putting them through all this worry.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay, Charles,\u201d Valerie said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d He turned to look up at her.</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know, I just am.\u201d</p><p>Charles stood agilely, his gaze leveled on the long narrow driveway that led in from the road. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right, Valerie. I hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hoped so, too. And she wondered if his concern for Stephanie meant as much as she thought it did.</p><p>Norah came back from the hospital a half hour later, talkative and lively. \u201cI can\u2019t get over how much Dad\u2019s improved in such a short time.\u201d</p><p>Valerie took the shrimp salad she\u2019d prepared for their dinner from the refrigerator. Salads were her specialty. That, and folding napkins. She could do both without a hitch.</p><p>For the first time since her arrival, Valerie had spent most of the day away from the hospital. When her father had suggested she leave, she\u2019d initially felt a bit annoyed. But as she revisited the life that had once been hers in this quiet community, she accepted the wisdom of his advice. She had needed to get out, to breathe in the serenity she found in Orchard Valley and exhale the fear that had choked her from the moment she\u2019d received Norah\u2019s frantic message. Then, after her walk, she\u2019d come back to the house, and because she\u2019d never been idle in her life, she\u2019d set up a communications center in her father\u2019s den.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to work, starting tomorrow,\u201d Norah announced between bites of lettuce, shrimp and slices of hard-boiled egg. \u201cThe hospital\u2019s understaffed, but then when isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll still be able to see Dad, maybe even more often than before. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind. You do whatever you think best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave, are you?\u201d Norah asked, rushing the words. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this if the hospital didn\u2019t need me so badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>Norah took another forkful of salad. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet tonight. Is anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to worry Norah about Steffie\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>\u201cColby asked about you.\u201d</p><p>She felt her stomach churn with contradictory emotions. Part of her was thrilled that he\u2019d even mentioned her, yet she experienced a growing sense of apprehension.</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Norah answered blithely. \u201cHe said he thought it was a good idea for you to get out of the hospital more. You\u2019ve practically been living there ever since you arrived.\u201d She slowly chewed another bite of her salad. \u201cHe asked me what I knew about Rowdy Cassidy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Valerie put down her fork, her appetite having fled. \u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth. That I\u2019ve never met the man, but Dad seems to think he\u2019s wonderful. You probably weren\u2019t aware of this, but Dad\u2019s been following CHIPS ever since you started working there. He thinks Rowdy\u2019s a genius. Funny, though\u2014I got the impression that wasn\u2019t what Colby wanted to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shrimp was on sale at Vern\u2019s Market,\u201d Valerie said, changing the subject abruptly, not wanting to talk about Colby. Not now when she felt so vulnerable, so conscious of the attraction between them. \u201cVern said he cooked it himself this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about Colby?\u201d</p><p>Valerie grinned. Her sister hadn\u2019t graduated magna cum laude for nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anyplace tonight, are you?\u201d Norah asked next.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d drive in to the hospital and visit Dad, but other than that, no. Do you need me to do something?\u201d</p><p>Norah shrugged. \u201cI may be wrong, but I think Colby wanted to talk to you. I have a feeling he might call.\u201d</p><p>Norah was right.</p><p>When Valerie returned from her trip to the hospital, her sister had left a note taped to her bedroom door.</p><p>COLBY PHONED. SAID HE\u2019D TALK TO YOU IN THE MORNING.</p><p>Valerie read the message with mixed feelings. Thrill and dread went at it for round two, again evenly matched. She determined to forget everything\u2014love, Colby, the future\u2014for tonight. The morning would be soon enough to resume her worries. She craved the forgetfulness of sleep, the escape from thought and feeling.</p><p>Valerie had assumed she\u2019d fall asleep with the same ease she had the previous night. For a solid hour she beat her pillow, tossed and turned in an effort to find a comfortable position. Finally giving up, she reached for the light on the bedside table and read until her eyes closed and the business journal slipped from her fingers.</p><p>But Valerie\u2019s exhausted sleep wasn\u2019t the restful oblivion she\u2019d longed for. Colby wandered into her dreams like an uninvited guest.</p><p>He looked handsome, dressed in the suit he\u2019d worn the night he\u2019d taken her to the Italian restaurant.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to forget me, are you?\u201d</p><p>In her dream, Valerie said nothing, but only because she had no argument. She merely stared at him, adoring every feature, every movement.</p><p>A noise disturbed her, distracting her from Colby. Irritated, she looked over her shoulder to see what it was and when she looked back, he was gone. She cried out in frustration, the sound of her own voice jerking her awake. She was sitting upright in the bed, heart pounding furiously.</p><p>It took her another moment to realize there was some sort of commotion going on downstairs. She climbed out of bed and grabbed her robe.</p><p>From the top of the stairs, she saw Norah, laughing and crying at once. A battered suitcase stood on the floor, along with a leather coat and an umbrella. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSteffie!\u201d Valerie cried excitedly, racing down the stairs.</p><p>Her sister was home.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Colby picked up the clipboard at the foot of David Bloomfield\u2019s bed, scanning the notations the nursing staff had written through the night. Although his eyes were lowered, he couldn\u2019t help being aware of David Bloomfield\u2019s cocky grin.</p> <p>\u201cYou must be feeling more like your old self this morning,\u201d he observed genially.</p><p>David\u2019s smile widened. \u201cI\u2019m feeling more chipper each and every day. How much longer do you intend to keep me prisoner here? I\u2019m itching to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother week,\u201d Colby answered, replacing the clipboard. \u201cPerhaps less, depending on how well you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA week!\u201d David protested. \u201cAre you sure you aren\u2019t holding me up just so you\u2019ll have an excuse to visit with Valerie?\u201d</p><p>Colby\u2019s hackles rose, and he was about to defend his medical judgment when he realized the old man was baiting him\u2014and enjoying it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have you transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit this morning,\u201d Colby continued, \u201cbut first I want you up and walking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been up.\u201d</p><p>Colby glanced back at the chart, surprised to see no indication of the activity.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t let anyone know. I felt a bit dizzy, so I only walked around the bed. Not much of a trip, but it tired me out plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not to get out of this bed again unless there\u2019s someone with you, understand?\u201d He used his sternest voice.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d David agreed. Stroking his chin, he studied Colby. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty as a picture, that oldest daughter of mine. Isn\u2019t she, Doc?\u201d</p> <p>Colby ignored both the comment and the question. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of the physio staff come down in a few minutes and we\u2019ll see how well you do with your exercises. I imagine that by this afternoon you\u2019ll have conquered the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, that Rowdy Cassidy\u2019s been calling her two, three times a day.\u201d</p><p>Colby stiffened at the mention of the other man\u2019s name. He\u2019d tried to tell himself that Valerie would be happier married to Cassidy. They shared the same attitudes, beliefs and ambitions; together they\u2019d take the business world by storm. Rowdy was exactly the type of dynamic personality who\u2019d help Valerie fulfill her goals and dreams. She\u2019d never be content as a physician\u2019s wife, he told himself again. Nevertheless, he was having trouble accepting the obvious.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought of himself as romantic. His career had consumed his life from the time he was a high-school sophomore. His much-loved grandfather had died of heart disease, and it was then that Colby had decided to become a doctor. Everything else had been subordinated to that goal. Only in the past year or so had he felt the desire to marry and start a family.</p><p>He\u2019d acted upon that desire with methodical thoroughness, mentally tabulating a list of his wants and needs. He\u2019d looked around at the single women in Orchard Valley and decided to date Sherry Waterman. If things didn\u2019t work out with Sherry, Norah Bloomfield was next on his list, although he was concerned about their age difference.</p><p>Things had worked out with Sherry, at least in the beginning. He\u2019d found her refreshing and genuine and fun. Problems crept up later, when he discovered that she was entirely predictable. Involved with a woman who embodied every trait he wanted in his life\u2019s partner, he\u2019d been...bored. He wasn\u2019t sure anymore that he needed someone quite so even-tempered and domestic.</p><p>According to the schedule he\u2019d set for himself, he should have been married by now.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>To irritate him further, the only woman he\u2019d been strongly attracted to in the past year was Valerie Bloomfield, and anyone with a lick of sense could see they weren\u2019t the least bit compatible.</p><p>For months, long before his heart attack, David Bloomfield had found excuses to drag his oldest daughter\u2019s name into their conversations. By the time he met Valerie, Colby was thoroughly sick of hearing about her. He hadn\u2019t even expected to like her. Instead, his heart and his head had been spinning out of control from that first moment.</p><p>It was time to put an end to such nonsense, before either of them took this attraction business too seriously.</p><p>\u201cCassidy would be a good match for a woman like Valerie,\u201d he said as offhandedly as he could. The last thing he wanted was for Valerie\u2019s father to know how attracted he was to her, although he suspected David already knew. The old man seemed to have a sixth sense about things like this.</p><p>\u201cRowdy will, at that,\u201d David returned matter-of-factly. \u201cI should know, too.\u201d The cocky grin was back in place.</p><p>Colby\u2019s chest tightened, his anger simmering just beneath the surface. David hadn\u2019t referred to his dream lately, the one he\u2019d termed his near-death experience. But from bits and pieces of conversation, Colby had learned that David was still predicting Valerie\u2019s wedding. It made sense that the man he expected her to marry was Rowdy Cassidy.</p><p>All the better. He\u2014</p><p>\u201cStephanie\u2019s home,\u201d David said conversationally, cutting into Colby\u2019s thoughts. \u201cI saw her briefly this morning. What a lovely sight she was to these tired old eyes.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded, finding it difficult to dispel the image of Valerie married to her employer. Well, he\u2019d better get used to the idea, because it was likely to happen soon. And because he refused to deliberately ruin his life by marrying the wrong woman.</p><p>He\u2019d call Sherry this afternoon, Colby decided with renewed determination, and ask her out to dinner. One thing was certain; he intended to steer clear of Valerie Bloomfield, regardless of how hard that was.</p><p>So much for the best laid plans, Colby mused as he left the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Valerie was standing in the corridor waiting for him. As always, when he saw her, his heart was gladdened. An old-fashioned expression, perhaps, but he didn\u2019t know how else to describe what he felt when he was with Valerie.</p><p>He remembered the time he\u2019d sought her out after losing Joanna Murphy. Just being with her had taken the sharp edge off the pain of that unexpected death, had helped him deal with the frustration, the sense of powerlessness. When she\u2019d suggested coffee, his first inclination had been to refuse, but he\u2019d found he couldn\u2019t. Sharing his concerns with her had, in some indefinable way, comforted him.</p><p>It seemed to him that their conversation had helped her, too, in coming to terms with her father\u2019s illness.</p><p>They\u2019d helped each other. In thinking about those moments together, Colby understood why he couldn\u2019t simply dismiss his fascination with her as sexual attraction. That was part of it, all right. But more than any woman he\u2019d ever known, Valerie Bloomfield was his equal. In intelligence, in emotional strength, in commitment to those she loved.</p><p>Every time Colby had been with her since, he experienced an elation, a small joy that left him feeling bewildered. Left him wanting to be with her even more. Yet he knew he couldn\u2019t afford to pursue a relationship that had no chance of lasting.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d Valerie asked, her eyes meeting his expectantly.</p><p>He frowned and shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah left a note for me last night, saying you\u2019d phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that. It was nothing.\u201d He wanted to kick himself for that phone call now. He\u2019d been looking for a reason to talk to her. His day had been long and tiring, and his defenses down, so he\u2019d made up an excuse to hear the sound of her voice.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you I\u2019m transferring your father from SICU this morning,\u201d he went on quickly. \u201cHis progress has been nothing short of remarkable. If it continues like this, he\u2019ll be out of the hospital inside a week.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s eyes sparkled with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful news! It seems everything\u2019s happening at once. I don\u2019t know if you heard, but Steffie got home last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I understand.\u201d Colby watched her closely. Although she said nothing else, he realized that something was troubling Valerie. Her brow had furrowed, ever so briefly, when she mentioned her sister\u2019s name. Colby suspected she wasn\u2019t aware of the tiny, telltale action.</p><p>\u201cSomething going on with your sister?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYes, just now. She was sitting in the waiting room reading a copy of the Clarion when she jumped to her feet, demanding to know if I\u2019d read it. Before I could say anything, she dashed out, taking the paper with her. I can\u2019t remember ever seeing Steffie so angry. I\u2019m not sure what got into her, but I\u2019m guessing it has to do with Charles Tomaselli.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll tell you eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she will, too, although I have a feeling this is connected to an article he wrote with Dad\u2019s help. I just don\u2019t understand what she found so offensive. I read it and I didn\u2019t see any problem. Those two can\u2019t seem to get along. They never could. It\u2019s always surprised me, because she seemed to be so keen on him and I was beginning to think he felt the same way.\u201d</p><p>The temptation to linger, even to suggest they have coffee together, was overwhelming, but Colby resisted. He was doing a lot of that where Valerie was concerned. Resisting. He only hoped his willpower held firm until she went back to Texas\u2014and to Cassidy\u2014where she belonged.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d Steffie said, standing in the doorway outside Valerie\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHave you got a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Valerie was sitting up in bed reading, but her mind wasn\u2019t on the latest computer technology she\u2019d had every intention of studying. With infuriating frequency, her thoughts drifted away from high resolution monitors and narrowed in on Colby. She welcomed her sister\u2019s visit, not least as a distraction.</p><p>Steffie crossed the room and sat on the edge of Valerie\u2019s bed. \u201cI made a complete fool of myself this morning,\u201d she said, her eyes downcast.</p><p>Valerie waited for her to explain, but further details didn\u2019t seem to be forthcoming. Her curiosity was aroused, but she didn\u2019t want to pry.</p><p>\u201cWith Charles,\u201d Steffie finally said, drawing her knees up and circling them with her arms. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time, either. He\u2019s the one person in the world I swore I\u2019d never speak to again and then, the first few hours I\u2019m home, I make an idiot of myself over him.\u201d</p><p>Valerie set aside her business journal and drew up her own knees. \u201cHe\u2019s been worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to him? When? What did he say?\u201d Steffie\u2019s head came up. Her long dark hair fell to the middle of her back, and her eyes probed Valerie\u2019s. Although Steff was almost twenty-seven, she looked closer to eighteen. Especially now, when she felt so embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cCharles asked about you shortly after I got home, and later he was concerned because you didn\u2019t arrive when we expected you. Apparently he made some inquiries, trying to track you down. Both Norah and I were so caught up in what was happening with Dad that we weren\u2019t as worried about your late appearance as we should\u2019ve been. Charles, however, seemed terribly anxious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe was just hoping I\u2019d get home in time to make an idiot of myself, which I did.\u201d</p><p>Valerie thought that was unfair of Steffie. \u201cCharles has been wonderful,\u201d she protested, still wondering exactly what Stephanie had done.</p><p>\u201cTo you and Norah. I\u2019m the one he can\u2019t get along with.\u201d Steffie\u2019s shoulders rose as she gave a deep, heartfelt sigh. \u201cHow do you know when you\u2019re in love, really in love?\u201d she asked plaintively.</p><p>Their mother should be the one answering that question. Not Valerie. She hadn\u2019t figured out her relationships with Colby or Rowdy. Bemused, she shook her head. She could outsmart the competition, put together some of the biggest deals in the industry, but she didn\u2019t know how to tell if she was in love.</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could answer that,\u201d Valerie said quietly. \u201cI know next to nothing about love. I was sort of hoping you\u2019d be able to enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>Steffie frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me we\u2019re going to have to talk to Norah about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Valerie said, then started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? Listen, Val, this isn\u2019t a time for humor, or even pride. If Norah knows more than we do, which she probably does, then we should forget she\u2019s the youngest and come right out and ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ask Norah about love, because she isn\u2019t here,\u201d Valerie said. \u201cShe\u2019s on a date.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie started to laugh, too, not because it was particularly funny, but because it was a rare moment of shared closeness.</p><p>\u201cReading between the lines of your letters, I assumed you\u2019d fallen in love with your boss,\u201d she said next. \u201cYou never said as much, but the two of you seemed to be spending a lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might\u2019ve been half in love with him until I met Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s heart doctor?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cWhen I first got home, Dad was fully expecting to die. He actually seemed to be looking forward to it, which annoyed everyone. Although not being able to get home must have been a nightmare for you, it might be the one thing that kept him hanging on as long as he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sidestepping the issue. Tell me about Colby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt started with Dad\u2019s matchmaking efforts, which I found rather amusing and Colby found utterly frustrating, but then as we got to know each other we realized there was a spark.\u201d More of a blowtorch than a spark, really, but she wasn\u2019t going to say that.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re in love with Colby, then why do you look like you\u2019re going to cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we both know it wouldn\u2019t work. He\u2019s a small-town doctor, who also lectures at Portland University. Although he could practice anywhere, he wants to stay right here in Orchard Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could be happy here,\u201d Valerie said miserably. \u201cNot anymore. And there are other problems, too....\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you truly loved each other, you\u2019d be able to find a solution to your differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I don\u2019t know if this is love, and I don\u2019t think Colby does, either. Everything would be much easier if we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if he\u2019s the right person...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m attracted to him. I think about him constantly, but is that enough for me to forsake all my ambitions? Give up my career? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said again, \u201cand it\u2019s got me tied up in knots. How do I decide? And if I did quit CHIPS and found some other job around here, how do I know I wouldn\u2019t resent him five years down the road? How do I know he wouldn\u2019t end up resenting me for not being a more traditional kind of woman\u2014which is what he wants? Besides, even if I do love Colby, how can I be sure he feels the same way about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish Mom was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Valerie said fervently. \u201cOh, Steffie, so do I.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t see Colby for several days. Four, to be exact. As her father\u2019s health improved, she spent less and less time at the hospital, therefore decreasing her chances of casually running into him. She was working out of the house, and that helped. Being in a familiar place, doing familiar tasks, allayed her fears and tempered her frustrations.</p><p>She knew she should think about returning to Texas. The crisis had passed, and by remaining in Orchard Valley she was creating one of a different sort. CHIPS, Inc., needed her. Rowdy Cassidy needed her. She\u2019d already missed one important business trip, and although Rowdy had encouraged her to stay in Orchard Valley as long as necessary, he\u2019d also let her know he was looking forward to her return.</p><p>Valerie had almost run out of excuses for staying in Oregon. Her father was going to be discharged in record time and Valerie, with her two sisters, planned a celebration dinner that included Colby.</p><p>She was surprised he\u2019d accepted the invitation. Surprised and pleased. She was hungry for the sight of him. He was in her thoughts constantly, and she wondered if it was the same for him.</p><p>All afternoon, she\u2019d been feeling like a schoolgirl. Excited and nearly giddy at the prospect of her father\u2019s homecoming\u2014especially since Colby would be driving him back.</p><p>Norah had been in the kitchen most of the afternoon, with Stephanie as her assistant. Since Valerie\u2019s culinary skills were limited to salad preparation and napkin folding, she\u2019d been assigned both jobs, along with setting the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Steffie called from the kitchen.</p><p>Valerie, who was carefully arranging their best china on the dining-room table, shot a glance at the grandfather clock. \u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re due in less than thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I detect a note of panic?\u201d Valerie teased.</p><p>\u201cDinner isn\u2019t even close to being done,\u201d Steffie told her.</p><p>They\u2019d chosen a menu that included none of their father\u2019s favorites. David Bloomfield was a meat-and-potatoes man, but that was all about to change. Colby had been very definite about that. From now on, David would be a low-cholesterol-and-high-fiber man.</p><p>\u201cThe table\u2019s set,\u201d Valerie informed the others. As far as she knew, it was the first time they\u2019d brought out the good china since their mother\u2019s death. But their father\u2019s welcome-home dinner warranted using the very best.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Valerie glanced out the living-room window to see Colby\u2019s maroon car coming down the long driveway. \u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d she shouted, hurrying to the front porch, barely able to contain her excitement.</p><p>This moment seemed like a miracle to her. She\u2019d come to accept that she was going to lose her father, and now he\u2019d been given a second chance at life. This was so much more than she\u2019d dared hope.</p><p>Steffie and Norah joined her on the porch. Colby climbed out of the car first and came around to assist David. It was all Valerie could do not to rush down the steps and help him herself. Although her father had made phenomenal progress in the eight days since his surgery, he remained terribly pale and thinner than she\u2019d ever seen him. But his eyes glowed with obvious pride and satisfaction as he looked at his three daughters.</p><p>He turned to Colby and said something Valerie couldn\u2019t hear. Whatever it was made Colby\u2019s eyes dart toward Valerie. She met his gaze, all too briefly, then they looked hurriedly away from each other, as though embarrassed to be caught staring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid dinner\u2019s not quite ready,\u201d Norah said as Colby eased David into his recliner by the fireplace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting two weeks for a decent meal,\u201d David grumbled. \u201cHospital food doesn\u2019t sit well with me. I hope you\u2019ve outdone yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have,\u201d Norah promised, smiling at Valerie. Their father wasn\u2019t expecting poached salmon and dill sauce with salad and rice, but he\u2019d adjust to healthier eating habits soon enough.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything, Dad?\u201d Valerie asked, assuming he\u2019d request the paper or a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWalk down and see if the Howard boy is still in the orchard, would you, Val?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I don\u2019t think you should worry about the orchard now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. I just want to know what\u2019s been going on while I was laid up. I promise I\u2019m not going to overdo it. Colby wouldn\u2019t let me. I tried to die three times, but he was right there making sure I didn\u2019t. You don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to ruin all that work, do you?\u201d</p><p>Valerie grinned. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll check and see if the foreman\u2019s still around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby,\u201d David said, raising his index finger imperiously, \u201cyou go with her. I don\u2019t want her walking in the orchard alone.\u201d</p><p>The request was a shamefully blatant excuse to throw them together, but neither complained.</p><p>Colby followed her out the front door and down the porch steps. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to come,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been walking through these orchards since I was a toddler. I won\u2019t get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad was just inventing a way for us to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too. He told me while we were driving here that he intended to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Her father had hinted more than once that he anticipated a prompt wedding between her and Rowdy Cassidy. He\u2019d apparently dropped the idea of her marrying Colby\u2014so did he want her to clarify that in person? He seemed downright delighted at the prospect of Rowdy as a son-in-law, talking about her marriage as if it were a foregone conclusion.</p><p>\u201cHow have you been?\u201d Colby asked. They strolled in the late-afternoon sunshine toward the west side of the orchard, where the equipment was kept. There was a small office in the storage building, as well, and if Dale Howard was still in the orchard that was the most likely place to find him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been fine. And you?\u201d Valerie could tell him the truth about her feelings or she could tell him a half-truth. She chose the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Colby clasped his hands behind his back, as she\u2019d seen him do before. It might have been wishful thinking on her part, but Valerie thought he did so in an effort to keep from touching her.</p><p>\u201cI understand your boss is calling you every day,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI understand you took Sherry Waterman out to dinner this week,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t help,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe whole time we were together I kept thinking I\u2019d rather be with you. Is that what you were hoping to hear?\u201d</p><p>Valerie dropped her gaze to the dirt beneath her feet. \u201cNo, but I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>How rigid his words sounded, as though he was holding himself in check, but finding it more and more difficult. \u201cWhat isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? You didn\u2019t have to come with me! I\u2019ve already explained that I\u2019m perfectly capable of finding my way\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCHIPS stock went up two dollars a share last week.\u201d</p><p>Colby was leaping from one subject to the next. \u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d she said cautiously. \u201cI\u2019m sure Rowdy\u2019s thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a stockholder myself I am, but what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHouston is where you belong, with Rowdy Cassidy and all his millions.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy had been telling her the same thing. Not in quite the same words, but he wanted her in Texas. With him. Not a day passed that he didn\u2019t let her know how much he missed her. Rowdy wasn\u2019t romantic; fancy words weren\u2019t his forte. He was as straightforward as Valerie herself. He missed her, he said, missed the time they spent together and the discussions they\u2019d shared. He hadn\u2019t realized how much until she\u2019d left.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going back?\u201d Colby demanded.</p><p>Valerie understood that this was the whole purpose of their being alone together. This was the reason he\u2019d fallen in with her father\u2019s schemes and had walked in the orchard with her. He wanted her out of Orchard Valley and out of his life.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d she promised, and her voice cracked with pain. The intensity of it took her by surprise; embarrassed, she increased her pace to a half trot, wanting to escape.</p> <p>\u201cValerie.\u201d His voice came from behind her.</p><p>\u201cNo, please... You\u2019re right. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish her thought. Colby caught her by the upper arm and turned her to face him, bringing her into his warm embrace.</p><p>He took her wrists and placed them around his neck as though she were a rag doll, then circled her waist with his arms and brought her tight against him. Before she had a chance to catch her breath, his mouth was on hers.</p><p>Valerie felt as though she\u2019d drown in the sheer ecstasy of being in his arms again. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. It wasn\u2019t supposed to feel so right, so good. His mouth was eager and she opened to him as naturally as a flower to the sun.</p><p>She clung to him, and then he suddenly jerked his head away. Valerie pressed her face into his shoulder and shuddered. She might\u2019ve been able to forget him, forget these feelings, if he hadn\u2019t kissed her again, if he hadn\u2019t taken her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cValerie, can\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let this continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you willing to risk everything we\u2019ve both worked all our lives to achieve? Are you going to change, or do you expect me to? The fact is, you know that neither of us wants to give anything up. So we\u2019ve got to put an end to this. Because, Valerie, we have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>Offhand, Valerie could think of several things they had in common, but she didn\u2019t mention them. There was no point. She understood what Colby was saying. If they went on as they were, it would lead to the inevitable, and they\u2019d be so deeply in love that they\u2019d forget what was keeping them apart. They\u2019d choose to forget that Valerie had a brilliant career waiting for her back in Houston. They\u2019d choose to forget that Colby wanted a woman who\u2019d be a dedicated homemaker. They\u2019d overlook even the most obvious differences. For a while, their love would be enough, but that wouldn\u2019t last, not for long.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back,\u201d Colby said, releasing her.</p><p>\u201cDad won\u2019t be worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about your father. I\u2019m talking about you, Valerie. Go back to Texas,\u201d he said, his dark eyes holding hers, \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late.\u201d He turned and walked away. It was the second time he\u2019d pleaded with her to leave, and this time hurt even more than the first.</p> <p>Eight</p><p>\u201cColby\u2019s taken Sherry Waterman out three nights in a row,\u201d Norah said casually over a cup of coffee Saturday morning. \u201cThey\u2019ve gone out every night since Dad\u2019s been home.\u201d She nibbled her toast, but her gaze managed to avoid Valerie\u2019s, as though she felt guilty about relaying the information.</p><p>\u201cI assume there\u2019s a reason you want me to know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Norah murmured. \u201cSherry was at the hospital, and we had a chance to talk. She says she can\u2019t understand why Colby keeps asking her out. The spark just isn\u2019t there. They enjoy each other\u2019s company, but they\u2019re never going to be more than friends. It almost seems as if Colby wants to make it something it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Sherry\u2019s reading more into the situation than is there.\u201d Valerie didn\u2019t actually believe that, but she felt compelled to suggest it. She knew exactly what Colby was doing\u2014escaping her, fighting everything he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cSherry realizes Colby\u2019s in love with someone else, and she also knows he\u2019s fighting it.\u201d Norah\u2019s words were an eerie echo of her own thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it, Val? Colby\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him,\u201d Valerie insisted, munching furiously on her toast.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>She gave a careless shrug and answered the question with one of her own, always a good business move. \u201cWhat do I know about love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know enough,\u201d Norah argued. \u201cPlease, do everyone a favor and put the poor guy out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you suggest I do that?\u201d Valerie asked, genuinely curious. She was miserable, too, but no one seemed to take that into consideration. In other circumstances, she would\u2019ve talked to Steffie, but her middle sister was obviously having relationship problems of her own\u2014not that she was forthcoming with the details.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of heaven,\u201d Norah cried, \u201cjust marry him. He\u2019s crazy about you. Any fool can see that, and you\u2019re in love with him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes love isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Norah insisted.</p><p>Perhaps to Norah, who was young and idealistic. But there were too many complications Valerie couldn\u2019t afford to ignore in her relationship with Colby. Besides, he\u2019d been pretty explicit about wanting her to leave.</p><p>\u201cI think you should quit your job, move back home and marry Dr. Winston,\u201d Norah said decisively.</p><p>\u201cAnd do what?\u201d Valerie asked. \u201cTake up politics? Learn to knit? If I was really lucky, I might find some job in town that\u2019s about a tenth as interesting as the job I have now. Listen, I\u2019ve been an active businesswoman for the past eight years. Do you honestly think I\u2019d be happy sitting at home knitting sweaters for the rest of my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would eventually. It\u2019ll take a little adjusting, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Norah.\u201d Valerie sighed and gave her starry-eyed sister a pitying smile. \u201cYou make everything sound so simple. It just isn\u2019t. Colby isn\u2019t exactly pining away for me, not if he\u2019s spending all that time with Sherry. If he wants me to stay, he\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t? Are you willing to throw away a chance at happiness because you\u2019ve got too much pride? You should tell him you\u2019re willing to stay,\u201d Norah said heatedly. \u201cWhy does everything have to come from Colby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, believe me. But it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s too late?\u201d their father asked from the kitchen doorway. He was dressed in his plaid housecoat, the belt cinched tightly at the waist. He ran a hand through his disheveled hair, looking as though he\u2019d only just awakened.</p><p>Norah automatically stood and guided him to a chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two arguing about?\u201d he asked. \u201cI could hear you all the way in the back bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Their father was sleeping downstairs because Colby didn\u2019t want him climbing stairs yet. Although he hadn\u2019t complained, Valerie knew her father was anxious to return to his own room.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t arguing, Dad,\u201d Valerie said, paying no attention to Norah\u2019s angry look.</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d David countered, smiling up at Norah as she brought him a cup of coffee. \u201cSeems to me I heard Norah suggest you should marry Colby. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying for weeks. So has everyone else who\u2019s got a nickel\u2019s worth of sense.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s throat seemed to close up on her. \u201cHe has to ask me first. And...and you acted as if you felt Rowdy and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhooey. Rowdy Cassidy\u2019s a good man, but he\u2019s not for you. If it sounded like I thought you should marry Rowdy, that was just to get you\u2014and that stubborn doctor\u2014thinking. As for Colby not asking you, ask him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d The list of objections was too long to enumerate. The best thing to do was ignore the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never been shy about going after what you want. I\u2019ve always admired that about you. You love him, don\u2019t you? So ask him to marry you\u2014or at least to give a relationship with you a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised by what he says,\u201d Norah told her.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Valerie said sadly. \u201cColby\u2019s as traditional as they come. When he\u2019s found the woman he wants to marry, he\u2019ll propose himself.\u201d</p><p>Neither Norah nor her father offered a rebuttal, which suited Valerie. A few minutes later she left the kitchen and went up to her room to dress, but she didn\u2019t get far. Sitting on the end of her bed, she closed her eyes and tried to think. Was she being unnecessarily stubborn? Was Norah right? Was she allowing pride to impede happiness? Questions came at her from all directions, and she felt at a loss to answer them.</p><p>There seemed to be only one way of learning what she needed to know and that was to confront Colby. For years she\u2019d been finding solutions in all kinds of unlikely situations. It was her greatest strength in business; however, when it came to her own life, she drew a blank. There had to be an answer that suited them both, but she couldn\u2019t figure out what it was.</p><p>She was obviously the last person Colby expected to see when he answered his door. Valerie saw the astonishment in his eyes and felt encouraged. She\u2019d hoped to catch him off guard and had succeeded.</p><p>\u201cHello, Colby,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cValerie...hello.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d dressed carefully, taking time to select the perfect outfit for her purposes. Something that would remind him that she was a woman\u2014but not a pushover. She\u2019d chosen a lovely pale pink sweater dress Steffie had brought with her from Italy.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I came in for a few minutes?\u201d she asked when he didn\u2019t immediately invite her inside.</p><p>\u201cOf course. I didn\u2019t mean to be rude. I was writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWriting?\u201d She followed him into his living room and when he gestured toward the sofa, she sat there, hoping she appeared cool and serene. As though her visit was nothing more than a social call, when in fact the direction of her whole life depended on it. She had too much experience in negotiating to permit her feelings to show, but she was more nervous about this meeting than any business deal she\u2019d ever accomplished. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on an article for the American Journal of Medicine,\u201d he elaborated. \u201cThe editor asked me six months ago if I\u2019d be willing to contribute a piece and I\u2019m only getting around to it now.\u201d</p><p>Valerie felt a surge of pride. Colby had an impressive future ahead of him. The world would be a better place because of his dedication and caring. Their eyes met, and Valerie wanted to tell him how much she respected him, how proud she was of him, but she couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t want anything she said now to sway his decision later.</p><p>\u201cI have something to ask you,\u201d she said, standing abruptly. She glanced around, then sat down again.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d His gaze fell to her hands and she realized she was rubbing her palms together. She stopped, embarrassed by this display of nervousness.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I saw you,\u201d she began in a voice that was more hesitant than she\u2019d intended, \u201cyou asked me to leave Orchard Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the answer to that as well as I do. Your father\u2019s recovery has been a lot faster than we could\u2019ve hoped. Eventually you\u2019re going back, so I can\u2019t see any reason to prolong this...interlude. Texas is where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, if a man\u2019s going to hold me and kiss me, it should be Rowdy Cassidy.\u201d</p> <p>A brief flash of anger showed in his eyes, but was almost immediately quelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean,\u201d he returned smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help asking myself something,\u201d she said, her voice growing smaller despite her efforts. \u201cIs my leaving what you really want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could stay in Orchard Valley.\u201d Her gaze clung to his, hopefully, eagerly. \u201cThis is my home. It\u2019s where I was born and raised, where I attended school. Some of my friends still live here and I know just about everyone in town.\u201d The words were rushed, practically tumbling over one another.</p><p>Colby breathed in deeply and seemed to hold his breath. His hands tightened into fists. \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Valerie had wondered how he\u2019d respond. She knew what she wanted him to say\u2014that he needed her in his life. Instead, he\u2019d responded with a cruelly flippant question.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I stay?\u201d she repeated slowly, her eyes never wavering from his. \u201cBecause you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Her words were met with a brief, tension-wrought silence as though her frankness had shocked him. He looked away.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you love me?\u201d he demanded in a tone that suggested this wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her own voice was husky with something close to regret. \u201cAll morning I\u2019ve been wishing I\u2019d dated more in high school and college, because then I\u2019d know what to say. I\u2019ve always been too...direct. I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s just part of my nature.\u201d</p><p>Colby didn\u2019t respond, which made her hurry to fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cThis is when you\u2019re supposed to admit you love me, too,\u201d she prompted anxiously. \u201cThat is, if you do... I may not have been a Homecoming Queen, but I\u2019m woman enough to know you care for me, Colby. The least you can do is admit it and let me salvage what little pride I have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoving you has never been the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for that,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cBut love isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we know that?\u201d she asked, although she\u2019d said the same thing herself less than two hours earlier. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even tried. It seems to me no one would\u2019ve gotten anywhere in this world if they\u2019d decided to quit before even trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it so tempting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do? I really do?\u201d His words thrilled her. They gave her the first sign of encouragement since her arrival. \u201cI was thinking...there are companies in the Pacific Northwest I could work for...companies that would be glad to have me.\u201d</p><p>Colby stood and moved across the room. Not knowing what else to do, Valerie followed him.</p><p>\u201cI think you should kiss me,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d He turned as he said her name. He wasn\u2019t expecting her to be so close behind him, because he nearly collided with her. His hands reached for her shoulders to steady her.</p><p>It was exactly what Valerie had hoped would happen. She moved automatically into his embrace, wrapping her arms around his waist, hugging him close. She raised her mouth expectantly to his and wasn\u2019t disappointed.</p><p>With a groan, Colby claimed her lips. His hands were in her hair as he tilted her head back and kissed her with a hunger that left her breathless and weak.</p><p>\u201cValerie...no.\u201d Reluctantly he stepped away from her, bracing his hands against her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Deftly Colby stepped farther back, putting as much distance as possible between them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asked angrily.</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d she repeated, still trapped in the excitement his kiss had aroused.</p><p>\u201cDid you think coming here and seducing me would mean an offer of marriage? It\u2019s not very original, Valerie. I would have thought better of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeduce you?\u201d Hot color sprang instantly to her cheeks. \u201cI wasn\u2019t...I had no intention\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the way it looked to me.\u201d</p><p>If he was trying to upset her, he was certainly doing an effective job. She forced herself to take several deep breaths. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to seduce you, Colby, nor am I going to let you annoy me into starting an argument. I came because I had to know. I had to find out for myself if there was a chance for us. If not, tell me so right now and I\u2019ll leave. I\u2019ll walk out that door and we\u2019ll both forget I was ever here.\u201d She paused. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his expression fierce, but he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d she demanded. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t want me. Tell me to get out of your life and I\u2019ll go, Colby. I won\u2019t even look back.\u201d</p><p>She remained on the far side of the room, frozen in misery.</p><p>Still Colby said nothing. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about any unpleasant scenes. I\u2019ll pack up my belongings, drive myself to the airport, and you\u2019ll never hear from me again.\u201d Her voice remained steady despite the hoarseness of pain.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d she cried. \u201cTell me to go...if that\u2019s what you want. But if you had an ounce of sense, you\u2019d ask me to stay right here and marry you. You don\u2019t have any sense, though. I know\u2014because you\u2019re going to do what you think is the noble thing and send me away. Well, I won\u2019t make it easy for you, Colby. If you want me out of your life, you\u2019re going to have to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might if I could get a word in edgewise.\u201d</p><p>Valerie choked on a sob and swallowed the laughter. \u201cI love you! Doesn\u2019t that mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched into fists again, and his eyes, his beautiful eyes, didn\u2019t stray from her.</p><p>\u201cSay it!\u201d she shouted. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t want me. Better yet, tell me you\u2019re crazy in love with me and that you\u2019re willing to find a way to make everything right for us. Tell me that instead.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, Colby. If I walk out that door, whatever was between us is over. I\u2019ll go about my business and you\u2019ll go about yours. I refuse to waste the rest of my life waiting for you.\u201d She dashed the tears from her cheeks with the back of one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be someone very special in my life.\u201d The words were so soft she barely heard them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cTell me to get out of your life. Make it really clear so I\u2019ll know you mean it, so I won\u2019t question it later. So you won\u2019t question it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d She gulped. \u201cBut still not good enough. Haven\u2019t you ever heard of being cruel to be kind? Just make sure you mean what you say, because this is the only chance you\u2019ll have.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to promise to marry me. Just ask me to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d It was shouted at her, as though something had snapped inside him. \u201cYou want me to be cruel, is that what it takes? Does it have to come to this? You\u2019re an intelligent woman, or so I assumed, but this...this performance is ridiculous. I owe you nothing. You want me to tell you to go? Then go. You don\u2019t need my permission.\u201d He stormed to the other side of the room and held open the door for her. \u201cGo back to Texas, Valerie. Marry your cowboy.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she was afraid to move, afraid her legs would no longer support her. She nodded. She moved shakily past him.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she whispered and then, unable to resist, brushed her fingertips down the side of his face. When she looked back at this moment, there would be no regrets. She\u2019d offered him everything she had to give, and he was turning her away. There was nothing more she could do.</p><p>Colby glanced at his hands, the very hands he used to save lives, and saw they were trembling with the force of an emotion so strong it was all he could do not to smash them into a concrete wall.</p><p>When Valerie left, he\u2019d been furious. He would have preferred it if she\u2019d packed her bags and quietly disappeared. That was what he\u2019d envisioned. Not this dreadful scene. Not dragging out their emotions, prolonging the pain.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have been so difficult for him. This wasn\u2019t a new decision, but one he\u2019d made long before he\u2019d ever kissed her, long before he\u2019d held her in his arms and comforted her.</p><p>The phone rang and he seized it, grateful for the reprieve from his thoughts. \u201cHello,\u201d he snapped, not meaning to sound so impatient.</p><p>\u201cColby, is this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry...of course not. I was just thinking...\u201d He let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I won\u2019t be able to make our dinner tonight, after all.\u201d</p><p>How sweet she sounded, Colby mused. Why couldn\u2019t he feel for her the things he felt for Valerie Bloomfield? Heaven knew he\u2019d tried in the past few days. He\u2019d done whatever he could think of to spark their interest in each other, but to no avail.</p><p>\u201cMy aunt Janice arrived and my parents asked me to take her over to my brother\u2019s place,\u201d Sherry explained. \u201cI hope this isn\u2019t inconvenient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d He heard something else in her voice, a hesitancy, a disappointment, but he chose not to question it.</p><p>\u201cColby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d The irritation was back, but it wasn\u2019t Sherry who\u2019d angered him. It was his own lack of feeling for her. This past week, he\u2019d spent four evenings with her. He\u2019d held her and kissed her, and each time her kisses had left him cold and untouched.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be tactless, but I don\u2019t think we should see each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her words shocked him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, although he knew the reasons and didn\u2019t blame her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me you\u2019re interested in, it\u2019s Norah\u2019s sister. I like you, Colby, don\u2019t get me wrong, but this just isn\u2019t working. We\u2019ve been seeing each other for over a year now, and if we were going to fall in love it would\u2019ve happened before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t given it a real chance.\u201d Colby didn\u2019t understand why he was arguing with her when he was in full agreement. Sherry would make some man a wonderful wife. Some other man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re using me, Colby.\u201d</p><p>He had nothing to say in his own defense. He hadn\u2019t realized until she\u2019d said it, but Sherry was right. He had been using her. Not to make Valerie jealous, or in any devious, underhanded way, but in an effort to prove to himself that he could happily live without Valerie.</p> <p>The experiment had backfired. And now he was alone, wondering how he could have let the only woman he\u2019d ever loved walk out of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this I hear about you going to Texas?\u201d David Bloomfield asked when Valerie joined him on the front porch following the evening meal. She sat on the top step, her back pressed against the white column while her father rocked in his old chair. She looked at the blooming apple orchard, breathed in the scent of pink and white blossoms perfuming the air. The setting sun cast a golden glow across the sky.</p><p>Valerie hadn\u2019t said anything at dinner about returning to Texas, and was surprised that her father was aware of her intentions. She\u2019d sat quietly in her place at the table, pushing the food around her plate and hoping no one would notice she wasn\u2019t eating.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go back, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, his voice tender.</p> <p>\u201cA little.\u201d A lot, her heart cried, but it was a cry she\u2019d been ignoring from the moment she left Colby\u2019s home. \u201cYour health\u2019s improved so much,\u201d she said with forced cheerfulness. \u201cYou don\u2019t need me around here anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I do,\u201d her father countered smoothly, continuing to rock. \u201cColby needs you, too.\u201d</p><p>His name went through her like the blade of a sharp sword, and her breath caught at the unexpected pain. Her father was the reason she\u2019d come home, but Colby was the reason she was leaving.</p><p>\u201cLove is funny, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she mused, wrapping her arms around her knees the way she had as a young girl.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are so much alike,\u201d her father said. \u201cYour mother saw it before I did, which I suppose is only natural. I\u2019m proud of you, Valerie, proud of what you\u2019ve managed to accomplish in so short a time, proud of your professionalism. Cassidy\u2019s lucky to have you on his team, and he knows it\u2014otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have promoted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a terrific future with CHIPS.\u201d She said it to remind herself that her life did have purpose. There was somewhere to focus all her energy. Something that would help her forget, give her a reason to go on.</p> <p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s and my romance wasn\u2019t so easy, either, you know,\u201d her father said, rocking slowly. \u201cShe was this pretty young nurse, and I was head over heels in love with her. To my mind, she was lucky to have me. Problem was, she didn\u2019t seem to think so. I was a business success, a millionaire. But none of that impressed your mother.\u201d His smile was wryly nostalgic, his eyes gazing into a long-ago world. \u201cConvincing Grace to marry me was by far the most difficult task I\u2019d faced in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t love you?\u201d That was impossible for Valerie to comprehend.</p><p>\u201cShe loved me, all right, she just didn\u2019t think she\u2019d make me the right kind of wife. I was wealthy, socially prominent and, as you know, your mother was a preacher\u2019s daughter from Oregon. Before I contracted rheumatic fever I was one of the most sought-after bachelors in California, if I do say so myself. But I hadn\u2019t met the woman I wanted to marry until your mother became my nurse.\u201d</p><p>How achingly familiar this sounded to Valerie. She\u2019d been content with her own life until she met Colby. Falling in love was the last thing she\u2019d expected when she returned home.</p><p>\u201cThere were other problems, too,\u201d David went on. \u201cYour mother seemed to think my work habits would kill me, and she wasn\u2019t willing to marry me only to watch me work myself to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you solved everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d A wistful look stole over him. \u201cI loved your mother from the first moment I opened my eyes and saw her standing beside my hospital bed. I remember thinking she was an angel, and in some ways she was.\u201d His face shone with the radiance of unending love. \u201cI knew if she\u2019d ever agree to marry me, I was going to have to give up everything I\u2019d worked so hard to achieve. That meant selling my business and finding something new to occupy my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did it, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot without a lot of deliberation. I\u2019d already made more money than I knew how to spend, but I realized I wasn\u2019t going to be happy retiring before the age of forty. I had to have something to do. It took a couple of years\u2014and Grace\u2019s help\u2014to figure out what that should be.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI feel the same way. I\u2019d never be happy just sitting at home\u2014 I\u2019m too much like you.\u201d The extent of his sacrifice shook her. \u201cHow could you have given up everything you\u2019d worked all those years to build?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout your mother my life would\u2019ve been empty. My work didn\u2019t matter anymore. Grace was important, and the life we were going to build together was important. I gave up one life but gained another, one I found far more fulfilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t you ever get bored or restless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, but not nearly as much as I expected. When we\u2019d been married a year or two, your mother saw I had too much time on my hands and we looked around for something to occupy me, some new interest. That was when we bought the orchard and moved here.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMy own Garden of Eden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever understood how much you\u2019d changed your life to marry Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a sacrifice, and at the time it seemed like a huge one, but as the years passed, I realized she\u2019d been right. I would\u2019ve killed myself if I\u2019d continued in business. Your mother brought balance into my life, the same way Colby will bring balance into yours.\u201d</p><p>She allowed a moment to pass before she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying Colby, Dad. I wish I could tell you I was, and that we were going to seek the same happiness you found with Mom, but it isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>It was as if she hadn\u2019t said a word. \u201cYou\u2019ll be so good for him, Valerie. He loves you now, and you love him, but what you feel for each other doesn\u2019t even begin to approach the love you\u2019ll experience over the years, especially after the children arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019re not listening to me.\u201d He seemed to be in a dream world that shut out reality. She had to make him stop, had to pull him out of the fantasy.</p><p>\u201cHe needs you, too, you know, even more than you need him. Colby\u2019s lived alone too many years. Only recently has he recognized how much he wants a woman in his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Her father closed his eyes and smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t truly believe that, do you? He wants you so much it\u2019s eating him alive.\u201d</p><p>She lacked the strength to argue with her father, not after her confrontation with Colby earlier in the day. Nor did she have the energy to explain what had passed between them. In her mind, it was over. She\u2019d told him she wouldn\u2019t look back and she meant it. She\u2019d swallowed her pride and gone to him and he\u2019d cast her out of his life.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hate him for being cruel; she\u2019d asked for that. Nor had she made it easy for him to reject her. But he\u2019d done it.</p><p>David sipped his coffee, and his smile grew even more serene. \u201cYou have such happiness awaiting you, Valerie. This problem with my heart is a perfect example of good coming out of bad. My attack was what brought you racing home. Heaven only knows how long it would\u2019ve been before you met Colby if it weren\u2019t for this bum heart of mine.\u201d</p><p>Valerie reached for her own mug of coffee and took a sip. \u201cYou want anything else before I go inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon? It\u2019s not even dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a lot to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to think about what I said?\u201d</p><p>She hated to disappoint him, hated to disillusion a romantic old man whose judgment was clouded by thirty years of loving one woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Valerie promised, but it was a lie. She intended to push every thought, every memory of Colby completely from her mind. That was the only way she\u2019d be able to function. She got slowly to her feet.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded, still smiling. \u201cStay with me, then. There\u2019s no need for you to hurry inside.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hesitated. This conversation was becoming decidedly uncomfortable. Despite her father\u2019s illusions, she had to face what had happened between her and Colby, accept it as truth and get on with her life. Pining away for him would solve nothing. And listening to her father only added to the pain.</p><p>\u201cI need to do a few things before I leave.\u201d The excuse was weak, but it was all she could think of.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time. Sit with me a spell. Relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Dad?\u201d she asked with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI know for a fact that you\u2019re going to marry Colby,\u201d he said, smiling up at her, his eyes bright and clear. \u201cYour mother promised me.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Valerie said, suppressing the urge to argue with him. \u201cIf it\u2019s about your dream, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than a dream! I was dead. I told you\u2014ask Colby if you don\u2019t believe me. I crossed over into the valley of shadows. Your mother was waiting for me there and she wasn\u2019t pleased. No, sir. She was downright irritated with me. Said it wasn\u2019t my time yet, and I was coming home much too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this seemed very real to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was real.\u201d His voice had grown louder. \u201cNow you sit down and listen, because what I\u2019m about to tell you happened as surely as I live and breathe.\u201d</p><p>Trapped, Valerie did as her father asked, lowering herself to the top porch step. \u201cAll right, Dad, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled down at her, apparently appeased. \u201cI\u2019ve missed your mother, and I didn\u2019t want to continue living in this world without her. She told me my thinking was all wrong. She promised me the years I have left will be full and happy ones, with nothing like the loneliness I\u2019ve endured since she\u2019s been gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they will.\u201d Valerie didn\u2019t put much stock in this near-death experience of her father\u2019s, but he believed it and that was the important thing.</p><p>\u201cProblem was, I didn\u2019t much care about my life back here,\u201d he went on, almost as if he hadn\u2019t heard Valerie. \u201cI was with Grace, and that was where I wanted to be. As far as I was concerned, I wasn\u2019t going back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie was familiar with her father\u2019s stubbornness; she\u2019d inherited a streak of it herself.</p><p>\u201cYour mother told me there was a reason for me to return. To tell you the truth, I\u2019d already decided I wasn\u2019t going to let her talk me into it. She was darn good at that, you know. She\u2019d drag me into the most outlandish things and make me think it was my idea.\u201d</p><p>Her father was grinning as he spoke, his eyes twinkling with a rare joy.</p><p>\u201cThat was when she told me about you girls. Your mother and I were standing by a small lake.\u201d He frowned, evidently trying to remember each detail of his experience. \u201cShe asked me to look into the water. I thought it was an unusual request, considering the discussion we were having.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Valerie was picturing trout and maybe some bass, knowing how much her father enjoyed lazing away a summer afternoon fishing.</p><p>\u201cI saw the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe future?\u201d This sounded like something out of a science fiction novel.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cThe water was like a window and I could look into the years ahead. I saw you and your sisters, and you know what? It was the most beautiful scene I could ever have imagined. So much joy, so much laughter and love. I couldn\u2019t stop looking, couldn\u2019t stop smiling. There were my precious daughters, all so happy, all so blessed with love, the same way your mother and I had been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds lovely, Dad.\u201d Her father had undergone traumatic surgery and just barely survived. If he believed in this dream, if he maintained he\u2019d actually spoken to her mother, then Valerie couldn\u2019t bring herself to disillusion him. Nor did she want to argue. Especially not now, when her own emotions had taken such a beating.</p> <p>\u201cI remember every single moment of that meeting with your mother. I didn\u2019t see a single angel, though. I don\u2019t mind telling you, that was a bit of a disappointment. Nor did I hear anyone playing the harp.\u201d</p><p>Valerie hid a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou understand what I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he returned impatiently. \u201cAbout you and Colby. He\u2019s the one I saw you with, Val. You had three beautiful children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, why now?\u201d At his quizzical gaze, she elaborated. \u201cWhy are you trying so hard to convince me to marry Colby? After the surgery, you seemed to have given up the idea. What happened to change your mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both so darned stubborn. I hadn\u2019t counted on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you apologized for the matchmaking, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I remember. I gave it up on Grace\u2019s advice, but only because I felt you two wouldn\u2019t need any help from me. But I quickly found out you need my help more than ever. That\u2019s why I talked about Cassidy so much. To get you thinking about what you really wanted. And to make Colby a little jealous. Face it, Val. Eventually you\u2019re going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please, I know you want to believe this, but it just isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Without realizing what he was doing, her own father was making everything so much more painful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand, child? Colby loves you, and you love him, and you\u2019re going to have a wonderful life together. Naturally there\u2019ll be ups and downs, but there are in any marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not marrying Colby,\u201d she said from between gritted teeth. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, I only met him a few weeks ago!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an old man whose elevator doesn\u2019t go all the way to the top, but you\u2019re wrong.\u201d He gave her a lazy smile. \u201cI know what I saw. All I\u2019m asking is that you be patient with Colby and patient with yourself. Just don\u2019t do anything foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing back to Texas. You belong here in Orchard Valley now. It\u2019s where you\u2019re going to raise your children and where Colby\u2019s going to continue his practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>Valerie stood, her chest aching with the effort to breathe normally. She felt so empty, so alone. More than anything, she wanted to believe her father\u2019s dream, but she couldn\u2019t. She just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already booked my flight. My plane leaves in the afternoon.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for her father to disagree with her, to tell her what a terrible mistake she was making. Instead she hurried into the house and up the stairs, not stopping until she was inside her room, with the door firmly closed.</p><p>She hauled her suitcase from the closet. There wasn\u2019t much to pack, and the entire process took her all of five minutes. She didn\u2019t weep. Her tears had already been spent.</p><p>When she returned to Texas, she\u2019d be more mindful of love. It had touched her life once; perhaps it would again. In time. When her heart had healed. When she was ready.</p><p>With that thought in mind, she reached for the phone on the nightstand and held it in her lap, staring sightlessly at the keys. After an endless moment, she tapped out the long-distance number.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The deep male voice sounded hurried and impatient.</p><p>\u201cHello, Rowdy,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d He seemed delighted to be hearing from her. \u201cI\u2019m glad you phoned. I tried to reach you earlier in the day, but your sister told me you were out. Did she mention my call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Was it something important?\u201d Norah must have been the one who answered, since Steffie was out most of the day. Romantic Norah, who so badly wanted Valerie to marry Colby and live happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t urgent. I just wanted to see how soon CHIPS could have you back. There\u2019s been a big hole here since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize my being gone has been an inconvenience\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. I wasn\u2019t referring to the workload, I was talking about you. Like I told you before, I got used to having you around,\u201d he said gruffly, as though he was uncomfortable saying such things. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem right with you not here. You\u2019re an important part of my team. That\u2019s how come I\u2019m giving you a ten percent raise\u2014just so you\u2019ll know how much you\u2019re appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Valerie gasped. \u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is. Now, when are you flying home?\u201d</p><p>Home. Home wasn\u2019t in Texas, it never really had been, but Rowdy wouldn\u2019t understand that.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. That was actually the reason for my call. I\u2019ve booked my flight for tomorrow. I\u2019ll arrive early in the evening and be at the office Monday morning.\u201d She forced some enthusiasm into her words.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news! It\u2019s just what I was hoping to hear. We\u2019ll celebrate. How about if I pick you up at the airport and take you to dinner?\u201d</p><p>The invitation surprised her, although she supposed it shouldn\u2019t have. \u201cAh...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say. She\u2019d already promised herself she wasn\u2019t going to spend the rest of her life pining away for Colby Winston. Yet when the opportunity arose to put the past firmly behind her and begin a new life, she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she told him regretfully. \u201cNot just yet. I\u2019m going to need some time to readjust after being away for so long.\u201d It had been less than three weeks, but it felt like a whole lifetime.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been gone too long,\u201d Rowdy said, his voice low and resonant. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Valerie. I haven\u2019t made a secret of it, either. When you get back, I\u2019d like the two of us to sit down and talk.\u201d</p><p>Sudden dread attacked her stomach, her nerves. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted to hear. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know if that\u2019d be a good idea, Rowdy. I don\u2019t mean to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Rowdy cut in. \u201cAnd I have to admit, I share your concern. An office romance can lead to problems. That\u2019s why I want us to talk. Clear the air before we get involved.\u201d</p><p>It obviously hadn\u2019t occurred to Rowdy that she might not be interested. But only a little while ago, the prospect of a relationship with him would have filled her with excitement.</p><p>Colby had hardly ever spent a more uncomfortable night. He hadn\u2019t been able to sleep and, finally giving up, had gone downstairs to read. Another hour ticked slowly by, and still his mind refused to relax. Feeling even more disgruntled, he set the novel aside.</p><p>It would have helped if Sherry had kept her dinner date, but she\u2019d cancelled. Not only that, she\u2019d let him know she didn\u2019t want to see him again. She was right to have done it, too\u2014a fact that didn\u2019t improve his disposition.</p><p>When it came to his relationships with women, Colby just wasn\u2019t getting anywhere. Okay, so he was behind schedule. He\u2019d underestimated the difficulty of finding the type of wife he wanted.</p><p>His requirements were very specific, which was why he\u2019d intended to conduct his search in a methodical, orderly manner. It wasn\u2019t as though he\u2019d discovered any shortage of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d girls, either. Unfortunately, most of them didn\u2019t appeal to him.</p><p>This only served to confuse him further. Obviously there was a flaw in his plan. Of one thing he was certain\u2014Sherry was out of the picture. For that matter, so was Valerie.</p><p>Valerie.</p><p>Her name seemed to be engraved on his mind, but by sheer force of will, he turned his thoughts in another direction. He got up and moved into his den to print out the article he\u2019d been working on earlier that day. Although he\u2019d shrugged off its importance when he spoke to Valerie, he was well aware that the invitation to submit it was a real honor. He\u2019d done exhaustive research, and every word he\u2019d written had been carefully considered.</p><p>But right then and there, Colby realized it meant nothing. Nothing. With an angry burst of energy, he crumpled the sheets and tossed them in his wastebasket.</p><p>Colby rarely acted in anger. Rarely did he allow himself to display any emotion. He\u2019d schooled himself well; he\u2019d needed to. He dealt with death so often, with fear, with grief. It became crucial, a matter of emotional survival, to keep his own feelings strictly private. Over the years, that had become second nature. For the first time in recent memory, he deplored his inexperience at expressing emotion.</p><p>He had no trouble recognizing that his inability to sleep, his lack of interest in a good novel, his discontent with the article he was writing, were all caused by what had happened between him and Valerie that morning.</p><p>He\u2019d done what he had to do. It hadn\u2019t been easy\u2014for either of them\u2014but it was necessary. She\u2019d made him angry with her demand that he be cruel. She wouldn\u2019t accept anything less. By the time she left, he\u2019d been furious. She\u2019d prodded and pushed and shoved until, backed into a corner, he\u2019d had no choice.</p><p>Every harsh word he\u2019d spoken had boomeranged back to hit him. She\u2019d insisted repeatedly that he tell her to get out of his life. And he\u2019d done it....</p><p>It was over, which was exactly what he wanted. Valerie would go back to Texas and he\u2019d continue living here in Orchard Valley. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her sad gray eyes would haunt him. And it had taken all afternoon to forget the feel of her fingertips as they grazed his face.</p><p>His intention had been to send her away, hurt her if he had to, so the break would be final. He hadn\u2019t grasped how much that would cost him.</p><p>Twenty hours later, he was still angry. Still in pain.</p><p>Walking back into his living room at 2:00 a.m., Colby sank into the recliner and reached for the television remote control. Surely there\u2019d be some movie playing that would hold his attention for an hour or two.</p> <p>He was wrong. All he could find\u2014other than infomercials and vapid talk shows\u2014was a 1950s love story, filmed in nostalgic black and white. The last thing Colby was in the mood to watch was a sentimental romance with a happy ending. He turned off the television and stood up.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been out to the Bloomfields\u2019 in three days. Although David was home and they\u2019d scheduled an appointment at the office early in the week, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to stop by and see how the older man was recovering. They were friends, and it was the least Colby could do\u2014for the sake of a longstanding friendship.</p><p>That decision made, he found himself yawning loudly. Fatigue greeted him like an old comrade, and in that moment Colby knew he\u2019d be able to sleep.</p><p>Valerie was dressed, her suitcase packed. She\u2019d lingered in her room far longer than necessary. Her flight wasn\u2019t until 1:00 p.m.\u2014not for another four hours\u2014so she had plenty of time, yet she felt an intense need to be on her way. But there was another feeling that ran even deeper, even stronger: she dreaded leaving.</p><p>\u201cValerie?\u201d</p> <p>She turned to see Steffie standing in her bedroom doorway, frowning as she glanced at the suitcase. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d</p><p>Valerie gave her a wide and completely artificial smile. \u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful morning, how could I possibly not smile? Dad\u2019s home and thriving, you\u2019re here, and Norah\u2019s in seventh heaven because she\u2019s got someone to cook for.\u201d</p><p>Steffie grinned. \u201cYeah, I know. But I can\u2019t help feeling you shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life\u2019s in Texas now.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie wandered into the room and sat on the edge of the bed. \u201cIf you\u2019re running away, it\u2019s a mistake. I made the same one myself three years ago. I embarrassed myself in front of Charles Tomaselli, and then because I was so mortified and because I couldn\u2019t bear to face him, I decided to study in Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a wonderful opportunity to travel. Do you honestly regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, not the travel and the experience. But leaving was wrong. I didn\u2019t realize it then, but I do now. I went into hiding. I know that sounds melodramatic, but it\u2019s the truth. At the time it seemed like the only thing to do, but I understand now that I should have swallowed my pride instead of walking away from everything I loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sometimes we do,\u201d Steffie said. \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did. Don\u2019t run away, because at some point down the road, you\u2019re going to regret it, just like I did.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s eyes were intent, silently pleading with Valerie to reconsider. If she hadn\u2019t gone to Colby the day before, Valerie might have hesitated, but there was no reason now for her to stay. There was no reason to hope Colby would change his mind.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d Steffie said, walking over to look out Valerie\u2019s bedroom window.</p><p>Valerie moved aside the white curtains and peered outside. Steffie was right. A maroon car was making its way down the long driveway.</p> <p>Colby.</p><p>A surge of excitement shot through her. He\u2019d come to tell her he\u2019d changed his mind, to ask her not to leave. Only seconds before, she\u2019d been so sure there was no hope and now it flowed through her like current into an electrical wire. Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t squelch it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014it\u2019s Colby,\u201d Valerie said, when she found her voice.</p><p>Steffie gave a cry of sheer joy. \u201cI knew it! I knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to let you go. Everyone knows how he feels about you, how you feel about him. He\u2019d be a fool if he let you go back to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know I was leaving today,\u201d Valerie said calmly, although he must have figured it out for himself. He must\u2019ve recognized that she wouldn\u2019t stay in Orchard Valley any longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out what he wants,\u201d Steffie said, her voice high and excited. \u201cLet\u2019s play this cool, okay? You stay up here and when he asks for you, I\u2019ll casually come and get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie, for heaven\u2019s sake, be romantic for once in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could be plenty of other reasons Colby\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make him suffer, or are you going to forgive him right away? Personally, I think he should suffer...but only a little.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Steffie hurried downstairs without another word.</p><p>Valerie couldn\u2019t keep her heart from racing, but she refused to play this silly game of wait-and-see. She reached for her suitcase and started resolutely down the stairs, the way she\u2019d originally intended.</p><p>She was on the top step when she heard Colby ask to see her father. Her father\u2014not her. If it hadn\u2019t hurt so much, Valerie would have laughed at Steffie, who looked completely stunned. Her sister stared at Colby, her mouth open, hand frozen on the door, blocking his entrance.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Steffie repeated after a shocked moment. \u201cYou\u2019re here to see Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d</p><p>Some slight sound must have alerted Colby that Valerie was standing at the top of the stairs. His gaze rose and linked with hers before slowly lowering to the suitcase in her hand. Valerie detected a frown, as though he\u2019d been caught by surprise.</p><p>\u201cValerie\u2019s leaving for the airport this morning,\u201d Steffie announced in a loud, urgent voice, implying that Colby had better do something fast.</p><p>What Steffie hadn\u2019t grasped was that Colby didn\u2019t want to do anything\u2014other than bid her a relieved farewell.</p><p>\u201cYou should tell Dad that Dr. Winston\u2019s here,\u201d Valerie said mildly. \u201cHe\u2019s probably in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Steffie left, and Valerie gradually descended the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re packed up and ready to go,\u201d he said in a conversational tone.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMy flight leaves at one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot soon enough, though, is it, Colby?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the question, and Valerie regretted the pettiness that had prompted her to ask. He stood before her, his expression unreadable. She was grateful when her father appeared. Grateful because she wasn\u2019t nearly as expert at hiding her feelings as Colby. She was afraid he could read much more of her emotional turmoil than she wanted him to.</p><p>\u201cColby, my boy, good to see you. You\u2019ve been making yourself scarce the last few days.\u201d David steered Colby into the kitchen, then glanced back at Valerie, scowling at the suitcase in her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of time, Val. Come and have a cup of coffee before you leave.\u201d</p><p>For her father\u2019s sake, she resisted the temptation to argue. Shrugging, she set her luggage aside and dutifully followed Colby and David into the large family kitchen.</p><p>The two men sat at the table while Norah served them coffee. Valerie didn\u2019t sit with the others, but pulled out a stool in front of the counter and perched on that.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d check in and see how you were feeling,\u201d Colby was saying.</p><p>\u201cNever felt better,\u201d her father said in response.</p><p>Valerie noticed how Colby avoided looking in her direction. He was uncomfortable with her; his back was stiff, his shoulders rigid with tension. Perhaps he\u2019d expected her to have left by now.</p><p>Valerie sipped her coffee and briefly closed her eyes, wanting to savor these last few moments with her family. Norah, an apron tied around her waist, was busy pulling hot cinnamon rolls out of the oven. Homemade ones, from the recipe their mother had used through the years. The scent of yeast and spice filled the kitchen, and it was like stepping back in time. Their kitchen had always been where everyone gathered, a place of warmth and laughter and confidences shared.</p><p>Steffie couldn\u2019t seem to stand still. She paced to one side of the room, then crossed to the other, as though debating her next course of action.</p><p>Valerie found it endearing that her sister cared so much about what happened between her and Colby, especially when Steffie\u2019s own romance was so problematic. Valerie sensed that things weren\u2019t going well between her sister and Charles Tomaselli, but she wasn\u2019t in any position to be offering advice.</p><p>Steffie paused, her eyes pleading with Valerie. She seemed to be begging her to stay in Orchard Valley. To listen to her heart...</p><p>After a moment Valerie couldn\u2019t meet her sister\u2019s gaze and purposely looked away.</p><p>Conversation floated past her, but she wasn\u2019t aware of what was being said or who was saying it. The sudden need to leave was too powerful to ignore. If she didn\u2019t do it soon, she might never be able to. Slipping down from the stool, she deposited her mug, still half full of coffee, in the sink.</p><p>\u201cThe rolls will be ready to eat any minute,\u201d Norah said, looking at her anxiously. She, too, seemed to want Valerie to stay.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pick up something at the airport later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d her father asked, as if this was news to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got lots of time.\u201d</p><p>Valerie gave the first excuse that came to mind. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get the rental car back to the agency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you want to go?\u201d Steffie asked forlornly, moving toward her sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Valerie answered in a soft voice, throwing her arms around Steffie in an affectionate hug. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like I\u2019ll never be back, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let it take you three years, the way it did me,\u201d Steffie whispered into Valerie\u2019s ear. \u201cI just can\u2019t help thinking you\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is for the best,\u201d Valerie said.</p><p>Norah stood behind Steffie, waiting her turn to be hugged, her pretty blue eyes as sad as Steffie\u2019s. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really going. I loved having you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been good, hasn\u2019t it, Dad?\u201d Valerie said, trying to lighten the atmosphere. \u201cI\u2019d like to suggest another family reunion, only next time let\u2019s plan things a bit differently. If I\u2019m going to take three weeks away from CHIPS, I\u2019d prefer to see more than a hospital waiting room.\u201d</p><p>David Bloomfield stood, his gaze holding Valerie\u2019s. He seemed to be asking her to remain a little longer, but she firmly shook her head. Every minute was torture.</p><p>She dared not look in Colby\u2019s direction. That made it easier to pretend he wasn\u2019t there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a great idea for a family reunion,\u201d Steffie said eagerly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we all take a trip to Egypt? I\u2019ve always wanted to ride a camel and see the pyramids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEgypt?\u201d Norah echoed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a camping trip? We used to do that years ago, and it was fun. I remember us sitting around the campfire singing and toasting marshmallows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamping!\u201d Steffie cried. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. I remember mosquitoes the size of Alabama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we had fun,\u201d Norah reminded them.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you did, but count me out,\u201d Valerie said, laughing quickly. \u201cMy idea of roughing it is going without room service.\u201d She glanced from one sister to the other, loving them both so much she thought she\u2019d start to cry. Blinking rapidly, she stepped forward and flung her arms around her father\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe dream,\u201d he returned, his eyes bright and intense. \u201cI was so sure....\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t need to be reminded of her father\u2019s dream. \u201cMaybe someday it\u2019ll happen.\u201d But she didn\u2019t believe it, any more than she believed the dead could come back to life.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to say goodbye to Colby, aren\u2019t you?\u201d her father urged.</p> <p>She\u2019d been hoping to avoid it. But she realized it would be impossible to leave without saying something to Colby, who was her father\u2019s doctor, her father\u2019s guest. David released her and she saw that Colby was on his feet and moving toward her. Her pride would\u2019ve been salvaged, at least a little, if he\u2019d revealed even a hint of sadness. But from all outward appearances she was nothing more to him than a passing acquaintance. It was as if he\u2019d never held her in his arms, never kissed her.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Colby,\u201d she said as cheerfully as she could. \u201cThank you for everything you did for Dad\u2014for all of us. You were...wonderful.\u201d She extended her hand, which he took in his own. His fingers tightened on hers, his grip almost painful.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Valerie,\u201d he said after a moment. As before, it was impossible to read his expression. \u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned away, afraid that if she didn\u2019t leave soon, she\u2019d do something utterly stupid, like burst into tears.</p><p>Everyone followed her to the front porch. Eager to get away now, Valerie hurried down the steps. Not bothering to open the trunk, she set her suitcase on the backseat.</p><p>\u201cPhone once in a while, would you?\u201d Steffie called.</p> <p>Valerie nodded. \u201cTake care of Dad, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Val.\u201d Norah pressed her fingers to her lips and blew her a kiss.</p><p>Rather than endure another round of farewells, Valerie slid into the driver\u2019s seat and closed the door. She didn\u2019t look at the porch for fear her eyes would meet Colby\u2019s.</p><p>Escaping was what mattered. Fleeing before she made a fool of herself a second time over a man who didn\u2019t want her.</p><p>She started the car, raised her hand in a brisk wave and pulled away. The tightness in her chest was so painful it was almost unbearable. For a moment she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d be able to continue. The thought that she needed a doctor was what dispersed the horrible pain. It broke free on a bubble of hysterical laughter.</p><p>She needed a doctor, all right, a heart doctor. With the sound of her amusement still echoing in her ears, Valerie looked back one last time, her gaze seeking Colby\u2019s.</p><p>Hard as it was, she managed a slow smile, a smile of gratitude for what they\u2019d shared.</p><p>She drove away then and didn\u2019t glance back.</p> <p>Not even once.</p><p>Ten</p><p>For long minutes, no one said a word. Colby stood frozen on the Bloomfield porch, his eyes following Valerie\u2019s rental car as it sped down the driveway. His hands knotted into tight fists at his sides, and his chest throbbed with suppressed emotion.</p><p>The timing of this visit couldn\u2019t have been worse. He\u2019d had no idea Valerie was leaving that morning, and like a fool he\u2019d stumbled upon the scene. He cursed himself for not calling first.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d been thinking when he\u2019d decided to come here. No, that wasn\u2019t true. Visiting David had been an excuse. He\u2019d come to see Valerie. He\u2019d hoped, perhaps, to find a private moment to talk to her. But for the life of him, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d intended to say. He certainly hadn\u2019t changed his mind, hadn\u2019t planned to sweep everything under the proverbial rug and pretend that love would conquer all. He\u2019d leave that kind of idealism to the world\u2019s romantics. He wasn\u2019t one of them; he was a physician and he dealt with reality. He had no intention of deluding himself into believing he and Valerie had a chance together, even if she did entertain thoughts like that herself.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d Stephanie cried, glaring at Colby. Tears swam in her eyes. He\u2019d always considered weeping females cause for alarm; he never knew what to say to them.</p><p>But there\u2019d been that time with Valerie, the night of David\u2019s surgery, Colby reminded himself. She\u2019d been sobbing out her grief and fear. With anyone else he would\u2019ve sought another family member to offer the needed consolation. But he hadn\u2019t looked for Norah that night. Instead he\u2019d gone to Valerie himself. He\u2019d felt his own terrible loss. He couldn\u2019t hold out hope for her father\u2019s recovery, not when everything indicated that David probably wouldn\u2019t survive the night. And so he\u2019d sat on the concrete bench beside her and placed his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>Valerie had turned to him, and buried her face against him. The surge of love he\u2019d experienced in that moment was unlike anything he\u2019d ever felt. Stroking her hair, he\u2019d savored the feel of her in his arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back,\u201d David said, interrupting Colby\u2019s memories.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Stephanie argued in a trembling voice. \u201cShe won\u2019t. Not for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie\u2019s not like that,\u201d Norah said. \u201cShe\u2019ll visit again. Soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should she, when everything she equates with home means pain? It\u2019s too easy to stay away, too easy to make excuses and be satisfied with a phone call now and then.\u201d Suspecting that David\u2019s second daughter was speaking from experience, Colby studied her.</p><p>She must have felt his scrutiny because she turned suddenly, undisguised anger blazing from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou might be a wonderful surgeon,\u201d she said, her gaze as hard as flint, \u201cbut you\u2019re one of the biggest idiots I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Colby blinked in surprise, but before he could respond, Stephanie ran back inside the house. Shocked by the verbal attack, he looked at Norah. They\u2019d worked together for a number of months and he\u2019d always been fond of her.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with my sister more,\u201d Norah said with an uncharacteristic display of temper. \u201cYou are an idiot.\u201d Having said that, she stormed into the house as well.</p><p>David chuckled, and Colby relaxed. At least one member of this family could appreciate the wisdom of his sacrifice. Stephanie and Norah acted as if he should be arrested. Both seemed to think it\u2019d been easy for him to let Valerie drive away, although nothing was further from the truth. Even now he needed to grab hold of the railing to keep from racing after her.</p><p>If only she hadn\u2019t turned at the last moment and looked straight at him. And smiled. The sweetest, most beautiful smile he\u2019d ever seen. A smile that would haunt him to his grave.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Colby whispered, his eyes never leaving the driveway, although Valerie\u2019s car was long out of sight. By now she was probably two miles down the road.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d David assured him.</p><p>Something in the older man\u2019s tone made Colby glance at him. The inflection seemed to suggest that however much Colby might love Valerie, he didn\u2019t love her enough. But he did! He loved her so much that he\u2019d sent her out of his life. It seemed that no one, not even David Bloomfield, could appreciate the depth of his sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cRowdy Cassidy will be a much better husband for her than I ever would,\u201d Colby said, steeling himself against the pain his own words produced.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I doubt it,\u201d David responded, walking over to his wicker rocking chair and lowering himself into it. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve noticed, but Valerie and I are a lot alike.\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned. The similarity hadn\u2019t exactly escaped him. Here were two people who each possessed a streak of stubbornness that was wider than the Mississippi. Both were intelligent, intuitive and ambitious. Hard-working. Single-minded.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never be happy living here in Orchard Valley,\u201d Colby said, his gaze returning to the driveway. He couldn\u2019t seem to make himself look away. It was as if that road was his only remaining connection to Valerie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Valerie would never be content in a small town again. Not after living in Houston.\u201d</p><p>The reassurance should have eased the ache in his heart, but it didn\u2019t. He told himself there was no reason to linger. Carrying on a polite conversation was beyond him, yet he didn\u2019t seem to have the energy to leave.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you how I met Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you did.\u201d Valerie must be three or four miles down the road by now, Colby estimated.</p><p>\u201cOur courtship was a bit unusual. It isn\u2019t every day a man woos a woman from a hospital bed.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. Before long, Valerie would be close to the interstate, and then it would be impossible to catch her. Not that he was going to chase after her.</p><p>\u201cGrace wasn\u2019t keen on marrying me, for a number of reasons. All good ones, I might add. She loved me, that much I knew, but to her mind love wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s words diverted Colby\u2019s attention from the road. He swiveled his gaze to the older man, who was rocking contentedly as though they were discussing something as mundane as the best bait for local trout.</p><p>\u201cGrace was right. Sometimes love isn\u2019t enough,\u201d David added.</p><p>\u201cIn your case she was wrong,\u201d Colby mumbled, displeased. For the first time he understood where this discussion was leading. Valerie\u2019s father was going to force him to admit that he was as big an idiot as Stephanie and Norah had claimed. Though he might be a little more subtle about it.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I knew I\u2019d need to make some real changes before Grace would agree to marry me, but I was willing to make them because I knew something she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>A wistful look came over David, and his eyes grew hazy. \u201cDeep in my soul, I knew I\u2019d never love another woman the way I loved Grace. Deep in my soul, I recognized that she was the one chance I had in this life for real happiness. I could\u2019ve done the noble thing and let her marry some nice young man. There were plenty who would\u2019ve thanked me for the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you, though, it was the most difficult decision of my life. Marrying Grace was the biggest risk I ever took, but I never regretted it. Not once.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. David was telling him exactly what he wanted to hear. He, too, had made his decision; he\u2019d set Valerie free to find what happiness she could. Rowdy Cassidy was waiting in the wings, eager to step into his place. Eager to help her forget. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colby\u2019s mind flashed to Sherry Waterman. He liked her and enjoyed her company. He felt the same about Norah. But it was Valerie who set his heart on fire. Valerie who challenged him. Valerie whom he needed. Not anyone else, only Valerie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about her,\u201d David continued. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. In a while, she\u2019ll regroup and be a better person for having experienced love, even for such a short time. As for marrying Rowdy Cassidy, I don\u2019t think you need to concern yourself with that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know my daughter. I know exactly what I would\u2019ve done had Grace decided against marrying me. I\u2019d have gone back to my world, worked hard and made a decent life for myself. But I would never have fallen in love again. I wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Colby didn\u2019t say anything. By now, Valerie was on the interstate. It was too late. Even if he did go after her, they wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. Not on the freeway with cars screaming past. It would be reckless and dangerous and beyond all stupidity to chase her now. Besides, what could he possibly have to say that hadn\u2019t already been said?</p><p>David stood. \u201cYou want another cup of coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I should be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in your office bright and early Tuesday morning, then.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded. It was time to get back to his life, the life he\u2019d had before he met Valerie Bloomfield.</p> <p>Valerie refused to cry. She\u2019d never been prone to tears and, except for a few occasions, had usually managed to fend them off. Even as a child, she\u2019d hated crying, hated the way the salty tears had felt on her face.</p><p>What astonished her was how much it hurt to hold everything inside. It felt as though someone had crammed a fist down her throat and expected her to breathe normally.</p><p>In an effort to push aside the pain of leaving Colby, she focused her thoughts on all the good he\u2019d brought into her life. Without him, she would have lost her father. Norah had told her as much that first evening. Colby was the one who\u2019d convinced her father to go to the hospital. Colby was the one who\u2019d performed the life-saving surgery.</p><p>If for nothing else, she owed him more for that than anyone could possibly repay.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t all he\u2019d given her. Dr. Colby Winston had taught her about herself, about love, about sacrifice.</p><p>She would always love him for that. Now she had to teach herself to release him, to let him go. Finding love and then freely relinquishing it might well prove to be a tricky business. She\u2019d never given her heart to a man before. Loving Colby was the easy part. It felt as though she\u2019d always known and loved him, as if he\u2019d always been part of her life. It seemed impossible that they\u2019d met only a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Leaving him was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done.</p><p>The self-doubts, the what-ifs and might-have-beens rolled in like giant waves, swamping her with grief and dread.</p><p>Dragging in a deep breath, she fought the urge to turn the car around and head back. Back to Orchard Valley. Back home.</p><p>Back to Colby.</p><p>Instead, she exhaled, tried to relax, tried to tell herself that everything would feel much better once she got to Texas. She\u2019d be able to submerge the pain in her job. When she resumed her position with CHIPS, she could begin to forget Colby and at the same time treasure her memories of him.</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t realize there were tears in her eyes until she noticed how blurry the road in front of her had become. Hoping to distract herself, she turned on the radio and started humming along with a country-western singer lamenting her lost love.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Valerie muttered to herself, weeping harder than ever. Irritably, she snapped off the radio, then swiped at the tears with the back of one hand, reminding herself she was too strong, too independent, for such weak emotional behavior.</p><p>Not until she was changing lanes on the freeway did she see the Buick behind her. A maroon sedan, traveling at high speed, passing cars, going well over the limit.</p> <p>Colby? It couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>More than likely it was just a car that looked like his. It couldn\u2019t be him. He\u2019d never come after her. That wasn\u2019t his style. No, if he ever had a change of heart, something she didn\u2019t count on, it wouldn\u2019t be for weeks, months. Colby wasn\u2019t impulsive.</p><p>The Buick slowed down and moved directly behind Valerie\u2019s car and followed her for a moment before putting on the turn signal. If it hadn\u2019t been for the tears in her eyes she would\u2019ve been able to make out the driver\u2019s features.</p><p>The car honked. It had to be Colby. He didn\u2019t expect her to stop on the freeway, did he? It wouldn\u2019t be safe. There was an exit ramp only a few miles down the road and she drove toward that, turned off when she could and parked. Luckily traffic was light, and the shoulders on both sides of the road were wide enough for her to park safely. When she did, Colby pulled in behind her.</p><p>She\u2019d barely had time to unfasten her seat belt before he jerked open her door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m chasing after you.\u201d</p><p>Legs trembling, she climbed out of her car and stood leaning against it, hands on her hips. \u201cThis better be good, Winston. I\u2019ve got a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something in my eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth eyes apparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, both eyes.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what silly game he thought he was playing, but she didn\u2019t have the patience for it. \u201cWhy are you here? Surely there\u2019s a reason you came racing after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She crossed her arms and shifted her position. Whatever Colby wanted to say was obviously causing him trouble, because he started pacing in front of her, hands clenched.</p><p>\u201cThis is even harder than I expected,\u201d he finally admitted.</p><p>Not daring to hope, Valerie said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe what a mess I\u2019ve made of this. Listen.\u201d He turned to face her, his expression as closed as always. \u201cI want you to come back to Orchard Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you and because I\u2019d like us to talk this through. You love me, too, Valerie. I don\u2019t think I realized how much until just now. It must\u2019ve been so hard to come to me, to lay your heart out like that and then have me send you away. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize,\u201d she broke in.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Valerie had no idea, not the slightest, where all this was leading. She took a shaky breath. \u201cAll right, you\u2019ve apologized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to talk, we can do it at the airport.\u201d That seemed like a fair suggestion.</p><p>\u201cI want to do more than talk,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to show me how we\u2019re going to make this marriage work, because darned if I know. We haven\u2019t got one thing working in our favor. Not one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why even try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you leave now I\u2019m going to regret it for the rest of my life. Sure as anything, I\u2019m going to think back to this moment for the next fifty years and wish I\u2019d never let you go. The problem is, I\u2019m not sure what to do now\u2014you\u2019ve got me so tied up in knots I can\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t look happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m not happy. I\u2019m furious.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grinned. \u201cLove is rather frightening, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Colby grinned, too, for the first time. \u201cBut you know something? It\u2019s living without you, without your love, that frightens me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Colby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say we did get married,\u201d he said, the gravel under his feet crunching as he paced.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s say we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to want a job outside the home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Colby, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, at least two.\u201d She found it odd to be discussing something so personal while standing at the side of a road.</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose to be both a mother and an executive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to be both a father and a surgeon? Not to mention a husband? You have a career, too, Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have it all, Valerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can you! Besides, it doesn\u2019t have to be either or. Half the women in America maintain a career and a family, but there have to be compromises. You\u2019re right, I won\u2019t be able to do everything. I couldn\u2019t even begin to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of farming our children out to strangers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t, either, but there are ways of working around that. Ways of making the situation acceptable to both of us. For one thing, I could set up an office at home. It\u2019s pretty common these days with e-mail and teleconferencing and everything. Rowdy might be willing to start a branch of the company on the West Coast, and I think he might be persuaded to pick Oregon\u2014especially if a hard-working executive chose to live there.\u201d</p><p>Colby nodded and thrust his hands into his pockets.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not what you want in a wife, Colby. You\u2019d rather I was the kind of woman who\u2019d be content to stay home and do needlepoint and put up preserves. But that isn\u2019t who I am, and I can\u2019t change. I\u2019d give anything to be the woman you want, but if I\u2019m not true to myself, the marriage would be doomed before we even said our vows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be concerning ourselves with some unrealistic image I\u2019ve invented. What about the man you want?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and looked away. \u201cYou\u2019re the only man I\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her then, wrapping his arms tightly around her, dropping a gentle kiss on the side of her neck. A deep shudder went through him as he exhaled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to be able to stop loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so terrible?\u201d she asked in a whisper, her throat raw.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the most wonderful blessing of my life.\u201d His eyes were warm and loving as he brought up his hands to clasp her shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve been arrogant. Selfish. I nearly destroyed both our lives because I refused to accept the gift you offered me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Colby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be any guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted guarantees, I\u2019d buy myself a new car. Everything in life is a risk, but I\u2019ve never been more willing to take one than with you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m very sure of what I feel for you, even though it all developed so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it sprang to life fully formed,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThe most exciting thing is that we have a lifetime to get to know everything about each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re in for an adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019ll be the grandest adventure of all.\u201d Valerie\u2019s arms went around his neck as he lowered his mouth to hers. One kiss wiped out the pain and the torment of these past few days. Colby must have felt it, too, because he kissed her again and again, their need insatiable, their joy boundless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A car driving past honked noisily, disturbing them.</p><p>Valerie reluctantly broke off their kiss. \u201cYou might have chosen someplace a bit more private, Dr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we try this again later, with champagne and a diamond ring?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded because speaking when her heart was so full would have been impossible.</p> <p>Her father was sitting on the porch when Valerie and Colby pulled up in front of the house late that afternoon.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Dad you were coming after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know it myself until I left here. Before I realized what I was doing, I was on the freeway, racing after you like a bat out of hell. I didn\u2019t have a clue what I was going to say when I found you.\u201d</p><p>Valerie tucked her hand in his and pressed her cheek to his shoulder. \u201cYou looked like you wanted to bite my head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked like a man who was calling himself every kind of fool in existence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor coming after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFor letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Valerie rewarded him with an appreciative kiss on the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Colby groaned softly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to want a long engagement. The sooner we can arrange this wedding, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d</p><p>Colby kissed her lightly on the lips. \u201cI have the sneaking suspicion your father hasn\u2019t moved since you took off for the airport.\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d been gone for hours, returning the rental car to Portland, and then stopping for an elegant lunch in an equally elegant restaurant. Before leaving the city, they\u2019d visited a well-known jewelry store where Valerie chose a beautiful solitaire diamond engagement ring. That very ring was on her finger now. It felt as if it had always been there.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you two got back,\u201d her father said as Colby helped her out of his car. \u201cI was beginning to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know we were coming?\u201d Colby asked.</p><p>\u201cI knew before you left here that you\u2019d be back with Valerie before the end of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you couldn\u2019t possibly have known.\u201d She waited for a protest, but none came. Her father sat back in his rocker and grinned happily.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know more than that about what\u2019s going to happen to you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about that dream again,\u201d Valerie murmured, slipping her arm around Colby\u2019s waist and smiling up at him. He brought her close to his side.</p><p>\u201cLove\u2019s shocked you both,\u201d David said, wagging a finger at them. \u201cBut there are a few more shocks in store for you. Just wait and see what happens when my twin grandsons are born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwins?\u201d Colby echoed incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to name them after their two grandfathers. The blond one will be David, and he\u2019ll be the spitting image of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins,\u201d Colby said again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Valerie said with a laugh. \u201cI could get used to a few surprises now and then, especially if it means I can be with you.\u201d</p><p>Colby gazed down at her and Valerie realized her father was right. Love had caught them unawares, but it was the best surprise of their lives.</p><p>STEPHANIE</p><p>For Heidi Pollard</p><p> A woman of letters</p><p>One</p><p>Home.</p><p>Stephanie Bloomfield lugged her heavy suitcase up the porch steps of the large white-pillared house. She moved quietly, careful not to wake her two sisters, although it occurred to her that they might be at the hospital.</p><p>She herself had spent the best part\u2014no, the worst part\u2014of the past two days either on a plane or standing at the counter in a foreign airport. Or was that three days? She couldn\u2019t tell anymore.</p><p>Norah, her younger sister, had managed to call her in Italy nearly a week ago about their father\u2019s heart attack. The connection had been bad and she\u2019d had difficulty hearing, but Norah\u2019s sense of urgency had come clearly over the wire. Their father was gravely ill, and Steffie needed to hurry home\u2014something that turned out to be much easier said than done.</p><p>Steffie had been living just outside Rome, attending classes at the university. She\u2019d been participating in a special program, learning Italian and studying Renaissance history, culture and art. For three years she\u2019d traveled effortlessly from one end of the country to the other. Now, when she desperately needed to fly home, the airports were closed by a transportation strike that paralyzed Italy. It didn\u2019t help that she\u2019d been staying in a small, relatively isolated village hundreds of miles from Rome. She\u2019d gone on a brief holiday, visiting a friend\u2019s family.</p><p>It had taken her several days and what felt like three lifetimes to arrange passage home. Days, when it should\u2019ve been a matter of hours. This past week had been the most stressful of her life. She\u2019d been in touch with her sisters as often as possible, and at last report Norah had said that their father was resting comfortably. Still, she\u2019d heard the dread in Norah\u2019s voice. Her youngest sister had never been much good at hiding the truth. Although she\u2019d tried to sound reassuring, Steffie was well aware that her father\u2019s condition had worsened. That was when she\u2019d undertaken the most daring move of her life. She\u2019d made contact with some men of questionable scruples, sold every possession of value and, at a hugely inflated price, obtained a means out of the country, by way of Japan, with layovers in places she\u2019d never expected to visit. It was decidedly an indirect route to Oregon, but she was home now. Heaven only knew how much longer it would have taken if she hadn\u2019t resorted to such drastic measures.</p><p>After a whole day of waiting at the Tokyo airport, fighting for space aboard any available flight to the States, and then the long flight itself, Steffie was frantic for news of her father. Frantic and fearful. In some ways, not knowing was almost better than knowing....</p><p>She opened the front door and stepped silently inside the sleeping house. She\u2019d adjusted her watch to Pacific time, but her mind was caught somewhere between Italy and Tokyo. She was too exhausted to be tired. Too worried to be hungry, although she couldn\u2019t remember the last meal she\u2019d eaten.</p><p>Setting down her impossibly heavy suitcase, she stood in the foyer and breathed in the scent of polished wood and welcome.</p><p>She was home.</p><p>Her father\u2019s den was to her right, and she immediately felt drawn there. Pausing in the doorway, she flipped on the light switch and stood gazing at the room that was so much her father\u2019s. A massive stone fireplace commanded one entire wall, while two other walls were lined with floor-to-ceiling bookcases.</p><p>She looked at his wingback chair, the soft leather creased from years of use. Closing her eyes, Steffie breathed in deeply, savoring the scent of old leather and books and the sweet pungency of pipe tobacco. This was her father\u2019s room, and she\u2019d never missed him more than she did at that moment.</p><p>His presence seemed to fill the den. His robust laugh echoed silently against the walls. Steffie could visualize him sitting behind the cherrywood desk, the accounting ledgers spread open and his pipe propped in the ugly ceramic ashtray\u2014the one she\u2019d made for him the summer she turned eleven.</p><p>The photograph of her mother caught her eye. David Bloomfield could leave his daughters no finer legacy than the love he\u2019d shared with their mother. He\u2019d changed after Grace\u2019s death. Steffie had noticed it even before she left Orchard Valley. She\u2019d guessed it from his letters in the years since. And she\u2019d been especially aware of the changes when he came to visit her in Italy last spring. The spark was gone. The relentless passion for life that had always been so much a part of him was missing now. Each month his letters were more painful to read, more lifeless and subdued. Without his wife at his side, David Bloomfield was as empty as...as that chair there, his old reading chair, standing in front of the fireplace.</p><p>Steffie\u2019s gaze slipped to the newspaper spread across the ottoman. It felt as though, any minute, her father would walk through the door, settle back into his chair and resume reading.</p><p>Only he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He might never sit in this room again, Steffie realized, her heart constricting with pain. He might never reach for one of his favorite books and lovingly leaf through its pages until he found the passage he wanted. He might never sit by the fireplace, pipe in hand. He might never look up when she entered the room and smile when he saw it was Steffie\u2014his \u201cprincess.\u201d</p><p>The pain in her chest grew more intense and the need to release her emotions burned inside her, but Steffie ignored it, as she had a thousand times before. She wasn\u2019t a weeper. She\u2019d guarded her emotions vigilantly for three long years. Ever since that night with Charles Tomaselli when he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>She brushed the memory aside with the efficiency of long practice. Charles was a painful figure from her past. One best forgotten, or at least ignored. She hadn\u2019t thought of him in months and refused to do so now. Sooner or later she\u2019d be forced to exchange pleasantries with him, but when she did, she\u2019d pretend she had trouble remembering who he was, as though he were merely a casual acquaintance and not the man who\u2019d broken her heart. That seemed the best way to handle the situation\u2014to pretend she\u2019d completely forgotten their last humiliating encounter.</p><p>If he did insist on renewing their acquaintance, which was unlikely, she\u2019d show him how mature she was, how sophisticated and cosmopolitan she\u2019d become. Then he\u2019d regret the careless, cruel way he\u2019d treated her.</p><p>There was a sound in the hallway, and Steffie moved out of the den just as Norah reached the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSteffie? My goodness, you\u2019re home!\u201d Norah exclaimed, rushing to embrace her.</p><p>And then, with a small cry of welcome, Valerie, the oldest of the three, bounded down the stairs, her long cotton gown dancing about her feet.</p><p>\u201cSteff, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home,\u201d Valerie cried, wrapping her arms around both sisters. \u201cWhen did you get in? Why didn\u2019t you let us know so we could meet you at the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flew standby most of the way, so I wasn\u2019t sure when I\u2019d land. I caught the Air Porter and then a cab.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m just glad I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Valerie said with an uncharacteristic display of emotion, wiping the tears from her cheeks. Normally Valerie was a model of restraint. Seeing her this shaken revealed, more plainly than anything she could\u2019ve said, how desperately ill their father was.</p><p>By tacit agreement, they moved into the kitchen. Valerie set about preparing a pot of tea. According to the digital clock on the microwave, it was a little past three. Steffie hadn\u2019t realized it was quite that late. She could hardly recall the last time she\u2019d slept in a bed. Four days ago, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Dad?\u201d It was the question she\u2019d been yearning to ask from the moment she\u2019d walked in the door. The question she was afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing just great,\u201d Norah said, her soft voice rising with delight. \u201cWe came really close to losing him, Steffie. Valerie and I were in a panic because things looked bad and Dr. Winston couldn\u2019t delay the surgery. And Dad pulled through! But...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut he...\u201d Valerie began when Norah hesitated.</p><p>\u201cHe what?\u201d Steffie prompted. Although she was thrilled with the news that her father had survived the crisis, she couldn\u2019t help wondering why both her sisters seemed reluctant to continue. \u201cTell me,\u201d she insisted. She didn\u2019t want to be protected from the truth.</p><p>\u201cApparently Dad had a near-death experience,\u201d Norah finally said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that fairly common? Especially during that kind of surgery? I\u2019ve been reading for years about people who believe they traveled through a dark tunnel into the light.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how common it is to talk to someone in the spirit world, would you?\u201d Valerie snapped.</p><p>\u201cDad claims he talked to Mom.\u201d Once again it was Norah who supplied the information.</p><p>\u201cTo Mom?\u201d Steffie felt numb, unsure of how to react.</p><p>\u201cWhich we all know is impossible.\u201d Valerie hurried barefoot across the kitchen floor to pour boiling water into the teapot. She placed three mugs, three spoons and the sugar bowl on a tray; when the tea had steeped, she filled the cups, obviously preoccupied with her task. Carrying the tray to the table, she served her sisters, then leaped up to get a plate of Norah\u2019s home-baked cookies. \u201cI think Dad needs to talk to a counselor,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cValerie.\u201d Norah sighed as though this was a well-worn argument. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou would, too, if Dad was saying to you the things he says to me.\u201d Valerie stirred her tea without looking up.</p><p>Norah sighed again. \u201cDad honestly believes he spoke to Mom and if it makes him feel better, then I don\u2019t think we should try to discount his experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was Mom supposed to have said to him?\u201d Steffie asked, intrigued by the interplay between her two sisters. She helped herself to a couple of oatmeal cookies as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what worries me the most.\u201d Valerie raised her voice, clearly unsettled. \u201cHe\u2019s got some ridiculous notion that we\u2019re all going to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, that\u2019s profound.\u201d Steffie couldn\u2019t hide her amusement. The three of them were of marriageable age; it made sense that they\u2019d eventually find husbands.</p><p>\u201cBut he claims to know who we\u2019re going to marry,\u201d Norah said, grinning sheepishly, as though she found the whole thing amusing.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s been wearing this silly smile for two days.\u201d Valerie groaned, dropping her forehead onto her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s been talking about a houseful of grandchildren, too. The ones we\u2019re supposed to present him with\u2014and all in the next few years. If it wasn\u2019t so ludicrous, I\u2019d cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he said who I\u2019m supposed to marry?\u201d Steffie asked, curiosity getting the better of her.</p><p>Valerie lifted her head to glare at Stephanie, and Norah chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s something else that irritates Valerie,\u201d she explained. \u201cDad hasn\u2019t told any of us, at least not directly. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s acting like he knows this wonderful secret and he\u2019s keeping it all to himself, dropping hints every now and then. I swear it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind it,\u201d Norah said. To someone else, she might have sounded self-righteous, but Steffie recognized her younger sister\u2019s compassion and knew that it edged out any hint of righteousness. \u201cDad\u2019s smiling again. He\u2019s excited about the future and even if he\u2019s becoming a bit...presumptuous about the three of us, I honestly can\u2019t say I mind. I\u2019m just so glad to have him alive.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded, her argument apparently gone. \u201cI guess I can put up with a few remarks, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time one of us hasn\u2019t stayed all night at the hospital,\u201d Norah said, her mouth curving into a gentle smile. \u201cDr. Winston insisted there wasn\u2019t any need. Not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by that guy,\u201d Valerie muttered under her breath. \u201cHe may look like your average, laid-back country doctor, but he\u2019s got a backbone of steel.\u201d</p> <p>He must have, if Valerie was reacting like this, Stephanie thought with sudden interest. It seemed that her sister had finally encountered a will as strong as her own. So, either Valerie had changed her ways or she had\u2014could it be?\u2014a soft spot for this Dr. Winston.</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Steffie said quickly, \u201cI missed the worst of it. Dad\u2019s out of danger now and will eventually recover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Norah said cheerfully. \u201cEverything\u2019ll be back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Valerie shook her head. \u201cIn a few weeks Dad will be the picture of health, but the three of us will be pulling out our hair after listening to all his talk about marriage, husbands and grandchildren!\u201d</p><p>Bright sunlight poured through the open window of Steffie\u2019s bedroom when she woke. The house was quiet, but the sounds of the day drifted in from outside. Birds chirped merrily in the distance and a spring breeze set the chimes on the back porch tinkling and rustled the curtains lightly. She could hear work crews in the orchard\u2014spraying the apple trees, Steffie guessed.</p><p>After those long days of struggling to get home, she exulted in the sensation of familiarity, wrapping the feel of it around her like a warm quilt. The crisis had passed. Her father would survive, and all the world seemed brighter, sweeter, happier.</p><p>Reluctantly she slid out of bed and dressed, pulling a pair of slacks and a light sweater from her suitcase.</p><p>She found a note on the kitchen table explaining that both Valerie and Norah were at the hospital. They were going to leave her arrival a surprise, so she could come anytime she was ready. No need to rush. Not anymore.</p><p>Selecting a banana from the fruit bowl on the kitchen counter, she ate that while reheating a cup of coffee in the microwave. As the timer was counting down the seconds, she walked into her father\u2019s den and reached for the newspaper, intending to take it with her to the hospital.</p><p>She would read it, Steffie decided, to catch up on the local news. But even as she formed this thought, she knew she was lying to herself.</p><p>There was only one reason she was taking the local newspaper with her. Only one reason she\u2019d even picked it up. Charles Tomaselli. She turned to the front page. The Orchard Valley Clarion. She allowed her eyes to skim the headlines for a moment.</p><p>Emotion came at her in waves. First apprehension. She\u2019d give anything to avoid seeing Charles again. Then anger. He\u2019d humiliated her. Laughed at her. She\u2019d never forgive him for that. Never. The agony of his humiliation smoldered even now, years later. Yet, much as she wanted to hate Charles, she couldn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t love him anymore. That was over, finished. He\u2019d cured her of love in the most effective way possible. No, she reassured herself, she didn\u2019t love him\u2014but she couldn\u2019t make herself hate him, either.</p><p>She could handle this. She had to. Besides, he was probably as eager to avoid any encounters between them as she was.</p><p>She gulped down half the steaming coffee. Then she tucked the paper under her arm and grabbed the car keys Norah had thoughtfully left on the kitchen table and headed out the door.</p><p>When she got to Orchard Valley General, Steffie paused, taken aback by a sudden rush of grief. The last time she\u2019d gone through those doors had been the day her mother died. Steffie\u2019s heart stilled at the nearly overwhelming sadness she felt. She hadn\u2019t expected that. It took her a couple of minutes to compose herself. Then she continued toward the elevator.</p><p>When she arrived at the waiting room, she found Norah speaking to one of the nurses, while Valerie sat reading. It was so unusual to see her older sister doing anything sedentary that Stephanie nearly did a double take.</p><p>\u201cSteffie!\u201d Norah said, her face lighting when she saw her sister. \u201cDid you get enough sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d That was true, although it would take more than one night\u2019s rest to recuperate from the past week.</p><p>\u201cDid you fix yourself some breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, little mother, I did. Can I see Dad now or is there anything else you\u2019d like to ask me?\u201d She slipped an arm around her sister\u2019s trim waist, feeling elated. It was wonderful to be home, wonderful to be with her family.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Valerie said, joining them. \u201cDad asked me earlier when we\u2019d last heard from you. I told him this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be moved out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit tomorrow,\u201d Norah said happily. \u201cThen we\u2019ll all be able to see him at once. As it is now, only one of us can visit at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah, would you like me to take your sister in to see your father?\u201d Another nurse had bustled up to them.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Steffie answered eagerly before Norah could speak. The nurse led her through a hallway with glass-walled cubicles. Every imaginable sort of medical equipment seemed to be in use here, but Steffie barely noticed. She was far too excited about seeing her father. The nurse stopped at one of the cubicles and gestured Stephanie inside.</p><p>He was sitting up in bed. He smiled and held out his arms to her. \u201cSteffie,\u201d he said faintly, \u201ccome here, Princess.\u201d She saw that he was connected to several monitoring devices.</p><p>She walked into his hold, careful to stay clear of the wires and tubes, astonished at his weak embrace after the bone-crushing hugs she was accustomed to receiving. Her sisters had said the spark was back in his eyes. They\u2019d talked about how well he looked.</p><p>Stephanie disagreed.</p><p>She was shocked by his paleness, by the gauntness of his appearance. If he was so much better now, she hated to think what he must have looked like a week ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d her father said, his voice cracking with emotion. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d Steffie said, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye as she straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home to stay?\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure how to answer. Home represented so much to her, much more than she\u2019d realized, but she loved Italy, too. Still, just gazing out on the orchards this morning had reminded her how much she\u2019d missed her life in Orchard Valley.</p><p>She\u2019d left bruised and vulnerable; she\u2019d returned strong and sure of herself. Being in Italy had helped her heal. But there was no longer any reason to stay away. She was ready to come home.</p><p>She\u2019d been trying to decide what to do next when she\u2019d received word of her father\u2019s heart attack. Her courses were completed, but remaining in Italy had a strong appeal. She could travel for a while, continue her studies, perhaps do some teaching herself. She could move to some place like Boston or New York. Or she could return to Orchard Valley. Steffie hadn\u2019t known what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home for as long as you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay,\u201d her father insisted with unshakable confidence.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d</p><p>He smiled mysteriously and his voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cYour mother told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Steffie was beginning to appreciate Valerie\u2019s concerns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYup. I suppose you\u2019re going to act like your sister and suggest I see some fancy doctor with a couch in his office. I did talk to your mother. She sends her love, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t know how to respond. Should she ask him to convey a message for her? \u201cWhat did Mom...tell you?\u201d she ventured instead.</p><p>\u201cQuite a bit, but mainly she said I had quite a few years left in me. She promised they\u2019d be good ones, too.\u201d He paused, chuckling softly. \u201cYour mother always did know I had a soft spot for babies. And there\u2019s going to be a passel of them born in this family within the next few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn even dozen.\u201d The first sign of color crept into his cheeks. \u201cCan you believe it? My little girls are going to make me a grandfather twelve times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds like I\u2019ve got a screw loose, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, you think whatever you like if it makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than thinking, Princess. It\u2019s a fact, sure as I\u2019m lying here. But never mind that now. Let me get a look at you. My goodness,\u201d he said, grinning proudly, \u201cyou\u2019re even lovelier than I remembered.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie beamed with pleasure. She knew very well that she was no raving beauty, but her looks were nothing to be ashamed of, either. Her dark hair was straight as a clothespin, reaching to the middle of her back. She wore it pulled away from her face, using combs, a style that accentuated her prominent cheekbones and the strong lines of her face. Her eyes were deep brown.</p><p>Steffie had just started to regale her father with the adventures of the past week when the same nurse who\u2019d escorted her in to see him reappeared, ready to lead her back to the waiting area.</p><p>Steffie wanted to argue. They\u2019d barely had five minutes together! But she forced back her objections; she wouldn\u2019t do anything that might upset her father. She kissed his leathery cheek and promised to return soon.</p><p>Valerie was waiting for her, but Norah was nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Valerie asked, glancing up from her magazine. \u201cDid he say anything about talking to Mom?\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded, secretly a little amused. \u201cHe seems downright excited about the prospect of grandchildren. I hate to see him disappointed, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Valerie muttered.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re the oldest, it makes sense you should be the first,\u201d she teased, enjoying her sister\u2019s blank look.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cTo produce a grandchild for Dad. The last time you wrote, I seem to remember you had quite a lot to say about Rowdy Cassidy. Might as well aim high\u2014marry a multimillionaire\u2014even if he is your boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowdy,\u201d Valerie repeated as though she\u2019d never heard the name before. \u201cOh...Rowdy. Of course there\u2019s always Rowdy. Why didn\u2019t I think of him?\u201d With that, Valerie returned to her magazine.</p><p>Baffled, Steffie shook her head.</p><p>She wandered over to the coffeemaker, poured herself a fresh cup and sat down near her sister. She picked up the newspaper she\u2019d brought with her and opened it to the front page, reading each article in turn. She was relieved to recognize several names; obviously not much had changed while she was away.</p><p>Folding back the second page of the weekly paper, she found that her eyes were automatically drawn to the small black-and-white photograph of Charles Tomaselli. For a wild second her heart seemed to stop.</p> <p>He looked the same. Still as attractive as sin. No man had the right to be that good-looking. Dark hair, gleaming dark eyes. But what bothered her the most was the impact his picture had on her. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. She should be free of any emotional entanglement. She should be able to stare at that photograph and feel nothing. Instead she was swamped by so many confused, uncomfortable emotions that she could hardly breathe.</p><p>Determined to focus her attention elsewhere, she started on an article with Charles\u2019s byline. He\u2019d written an investigative feature, clearly one of a series, about the unhealthy and often unsafe conditions under which many of the migrant workers lived and worked in the community\u2019s apple orchards.</p><p>Two paragraphs into the piece, Steffie had to stop reading. She\u2019d come to her father\u2019s name, along with the name of their orchard. Obviously Charles hadn\u2019t done his research! Steffie knew how hard her parents had worked to ease the plight of the migrant workers. Her mother had set up a medical clinic. And unlike certain other orchard owners, her father had built them decent housing and seen to it that they were properly fed and fairly paid.</p><p>Steffie tried to continue reading, but the red haze of anger made it impossible. Her stomach twisted in painful knots as she rose to her feet, tucking the paper under her arm.</p><p>\u201cValerie,\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat was Dad doing when he suffered his heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Norah said he was sitting on the porch. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was reading the newspaper, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know for sure, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been!\u201d Steffie declared, walking toward the elevator. She stabbed the button with her thumb, seething at the sense of betrayal she felt. All the evidence pointed to one thing. She\u2019d found the paper spread open in his den. Her father had picked up the Orchard Valley Clarion, read the article and then in shock and dismay had wandered onto the porch.</p><p>\u201cSteffie, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you read this?\u201d she asked, thrusting the newspaper in front of her sister. \u201cDid you see what Charles Tomaselli wrote about our father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I skimmed it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the date,\u201d she said, folding back the front page.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Valerie asked, still sounding confused.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the day of Dad\u2019s heart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be upset, too, if you\u2019d worked half your life improving the conditions of migrant workers only to have your efforts ridiculed before the entire community!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffie,\u201d Valerie said, gently pressing Steffie\u2019s arm. \u201cCharles is Dad\u2019s friend. He\u2019s called several times to ask about him. Why, he was even here the night of Dad\u2019s surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was probably feeling a large dose of guilt.\u201d It seemed perfectly obvious that Charles knew what he\u2019d done. Her father\u2019s heart attack had happened the same day the article was published. So Charles must have known, must have figured it out himself. And that was why he\u2019d come calling\u2014she was sure of it.</p><p>But it was going to take a whole lot more than a few words of concern to smooth over what he\u2019d done. Once Steffie had confronted Charles, she intended to stop at Joan Lind\u2019s office. Joan might be as old as a sand dune, but she was a damn good attorney and Steffie meant to sue Tomaselli for everything he ever hoped to have.</p><p>The elevator arrived and she stepped briskly inside.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Valerie asked as the doors started to close.</p><p>\u201cTo give Tomaselli a piece of my mind.\u201d</p><p>The doors blocked Valerie from view, but her sister\u2019s words came through loud and clear. \u201cA piece of your mind? Are you sure you have any to spare?\u201d</p><p>By the time Steffie reached Main Street and located a parking spot, the anger and hurt actually made her feel ill. Her cheeks were feverishly hot. Her stomach churned.</p><p>Charles disliked her, and he was taking it out on her father. Well, she couldn\u2019t let him do it.</p><p>She entered the newspaper office, then hesitated. There was a reception desk and a polished wooden railing; it separated the public area from the work space, with its computer terminals and ringing phones. Beyond it several desks occupied by reporters and other staff lined each side of the room, creating a wide center aisle that led directly to the editor\u2019s desk.</p><p>She noticed Charles immediately. As the Clarion\u2019s editor, he had a work area that took up the entire end of the room. He was on the phone, but his eyes locked instantly with hers. There\u2019d been a time when she would have swooned to have him look at her like this\u2014with admiration, with surprise, with a hint of pleasure. But that time was long past.</p><p>Undaunted, she opened the low gate and walked purposefully down the center aisle until she got to his desk. She could hear the gate swinging back and forth behind her, keeping time with her steps. By now, Charles clearly understood that this wasn\u2019t a social call.</p><p>\u201cBrent, let me get back to you.\u201d He abruptly replaced the receiver. \u201cWell, well, if it isn\u2019t Stephanie Bloomfield. To what do I owe this visit?\u201d</p><p>His casual insouciance infuriated her. Steffie slapped the newspaper down on his desk. \u201cDid you really think you\u2019d get away with this?\u201d she asked, astonished by the calmness of her own voice.</p><p>Charles\u2019s eyes steadily held hers. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou published this...piece, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat piece do you mean? I publish lots of pieces.\u201d</p><p>His attitude didn\u2019t fool her. \u201cThe one about living conditions among migrant orchard workers. Now, I ask you, who owns the largest apple orchard in three counties? The first paragraph is filled with innuendo, but then you get right down to brass tacks, don\u2019t you\u2014by naming my father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephanie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished yet!\u201d she shouted. In fact, she was just warming up to her subject. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think any of us would notice, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotice what?\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest as though he\u2019d grown bored with her tirade.</p><p>\u201cThe date of the article,\u201d she said, gaining momentum. \u201cIt\u2019s the same day as my father\u2019s heart attack. The very same day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephanie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d Tears rolled down her face. \u201cEveryone calls me Steffie.\u201d Roughly, she wiped them away, hating this display of weakness, especially in front of Charles. \u201cI\u2014don\u2019t know how you can live with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want the truth, I don\u2019t have much of a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think your sort would,\u201d she muttered contemptuously. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll be hearing from Joan Lind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoan Lind retired last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll hire someone else,\u201d she said, turning on her heel. She marched through the office, slamming the low gate, which had only recently recovered from her entrance.</p><p>To her surprise, confronting Charles hadn\u2019t eased her pain.</p><p>When she pulled out of the parking space, the tires spun and squealed. She felt suddenly embarrassed. She hadn\u2019t meant to make such a dramatic exit. Nor was she pleased when she glanced in her rearview mirror to find that Charles had followed her outside.</p><p>Two</p><p>With the hurt propelling her, Steffie raced home. In her present frame of mind, she didn\u2019t dare go back to the hospital. Now wasn\u2019t the time to make polite conversation with her sisters, or to meet her father\u2019s doctor. Not when she desperately needed to vent this terrible sense of frustration and betrayal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charles\u2019s treachery cut deep. They\u2019d had their differences, but Steffie had never once believed he would purposely set out to hurt her or her family. She\u2019d been wrong. Charles was both vindictive and unforgiving, and that was more painful than the things he\u2019d said to her that last day they\u2019d been together. That horrible day when he\u2019d laughed at her.</p><p>She was shocked he still had the power to make her feel like this, but apparently his grip on her heart was as strong now as it had been three years earlier. The time she\u2019d spent away from home, the time she\u2019d given herself to heal, might never have existed. She was no less vulnerable to him now.</p><p>From the moment Steffie first met Charles, she\u2019d been fascinated with him. Infatuated. In the beginning, she hoped he returned her feelings. She\u2019d been attending the University of Portland, making the fifty-mile commute into the city every day. Her mother had died a few months earlier, so Steffie had decided against moving into a dorm, as she\u2019d originally planned.</p><p>In her sorrow, she\u2019d craved the comfort of familiar people and places. She was worried, too, about her father, who seemed to be walking around in a fog of grief.</p> <p>Valerie was already living in Texas at that point, and although she\u2019d come home often while their mother was ill, her work schedule had kept her from visiting much since.</p><p>Norah, who was in the university\u2019s nursing program, used to drive to Portland with her. But Steffie would have made the hour\u2019s drive twice a day by herself if she\u2019d had to, simply so she could see Charles more often.</p><p>It mortified her now, looking back. Her excuses to see him had been embarrassingly transparent. She\u2019d been so wide-eyed with adoration that she\u2019d repeatedly made a fool of herself.</p><p>Her cheeks flamed as she recalled the times she\u2019d followed him around like a lost puppy. The way she\u2019d studied every word, every line, he\u2019d written. The way she\u2019d worshiped him from afar, until her love had burned fiercely within her, impossible to contain or control....</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to remember, and as she so often had in the past, she blocked the memories from her mind rather than relive the humiliation she\u2019d suffered because of him.</p> <p>Her anger had cooled by the time she\u2019d finished the ten-mile drive out of Orchard Valley to the family home. Once she arrived, the thought of going inside held no appeal. She needed to do something physically demanding to work off her frustration.</p><p>The stables were located behind the house. Valerie and Norah had never really taken to riding, but Steffie, who was the family daredevil, had loved it. The sense of freedom and power had been addictive to a young girl struggling to discover her own identity. Some of the happiest memories of her childhood were the times she\u2019d gone horseback riding with her father.</p><p>She knew from Norah\u2019s letters that he hadn\u2019t ridden much lately and had left exercising the horses to the hired help.</p><p>The stable held six stalls, four of them empty, and a tack room at the rear. Both Fury and Princess raised their sleek heads when she entered the barn. Princess was the gentle mare her father had purchased and named for her several years earlier; Fury was her father\u2019s gelding, large and black, notoriously temperamental. He pawed the ground vigorously as she approached.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing, big boy?\u201d she asked, rubbing his soft muzzle. \u201cI\u2019m not ignoring you, Princess,\u201d she told the mare across the aisle. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m in the mood for a really hard workout.\u201d</p><p>After allowing Fury to refamiliarize himself with her, Steffie collected saddle and bridle from the tack room. She slipped on Fury\u2019s bridle, then opened the stall gate and led him out. The gelding seemed to be as eager to run as she was to ride, and he shifted his weight impatiently as she tightened the girth and adjusted the stirrups.</p> <p>Leading him out of the stable, she\u2019d set her foot in the stirrup, ready to mount, when she noticed a small red sports car racing down the driveway. It didn\u2019t take her two seconds to recognize Charles.</p><p>Steffie had no intention of speaking to a man she considered a traitor. In fact, she didn\u2019t want to ever see him again. She planned to talk to her sisters, then seek legal counsel. Charles would pay for what he\u2019d done to her father, and she\u2019d make sure he paid dearly. Even if he retained bitter feelings about her, that was no reason to take vengeance on her family.</p><p>Reaching for the saddle horn, she hoisted herself onto Fury\u2019s back. She hadn\u2019t used a Western saddle since she\u2019d left home and needed a moment to get used to it again. Fury scampered in a side trot as Steffie changed her position, leaning slightly forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, boy,\u201d she assured him in a calm, quiet voice that belied her eagerness to escape\u2014and leave Charles behind.</p><p>She ignored his honk and although it was childish, she derived a certain amount of pleasure from turning her back on him. She nudged Fury\u2019s sides and with her chin at a haughty angle, trotted away.</p><p>She\u2019d only gone a short distance when she became aware that Charles was following her. Fury didn\u2019t need any encouragement to increase his steady trot to a full gallop. Although she was an experienced horsewoman, Steffie wasn\u2019t prepared for the sudden burst of speed. Fury raced as though fire was licking at his heels.</p><p>Holding on to the reins, Steffie adjusted as well as she could, bouncing and jolting uncomfortably, unable to adapt to Fury\u2019s rhythm. She\u2019d ridden in Italy, but not nearly as often as she would\u2019ve liked and always with an English-style saddle. Not only was she out of practice, she didn\u2019t have the strength to control a horse of Fury\u2019s size and power\u2014especially one who hadn\u2019t been exercised lately. She should\u2019ve thought of that, she groaned. Thank goodness he was familiar with the terrain. He galloped first along the dirt road, bordered on both sides by apple trees. He kicked up a cloud of dust in his wake, which made it impossible for Steffie to tell whether Charles had continued after her. She prayed he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Only when Fury took a sharp turn to the left, through a rough patch of ground, did Steffie see that Charles was indeed behind her. She tried to pull in the reins, to slow Fury down to a more comfortable trot, but the gelding had a mind of his own. She tried to talk to him but her hair flew about her face, the long ends slapping her cheeks, blinding her. Between her bouncing in the saddle and the hair flapping in her face, she couldn\u2019t manage a single intelligible word.</p> <p>By now she had a lot more than Charles to worry about. She was about to lose what little control she had of the horse. And on this rough ground, she feared for the animal\u2019s safety, not to mention her own.</p><p>Steffie remembered the land well enough to realize they were headed for a bluff that overlooked the valley. It was at the farthest reach of her family\u2019s property, and a place Steffie had often gone when she needed to be alone. She approved of Fury\u2019s choice, if not his means of getting there.</p><p>Her one consolation was that it would be virtually impossible for Charles to follow her any farther. His vehicle would never make it over the rock-strewn landscape. With no other option, he\u2019d be forced to turn back. Or wait. And if he chose to wait by the side of the dirt road, he\u2019d be out of luck\u2014she\u2019d simply take another route home, connecting with the road at a different point.</p><p>Once they reached their destination, Fury slowed to a canter. Steffie pulled back on the reins, slid out of the saddle and commanded her trembling legs to keep her upright. She wiped the sweat from the gelding\u2019s neck and rubbed him down with a handful of long dry grass, then led him to a nearby stream. She was loosely holding the reins, allowing him to drink the clear, cool water, when she saw a whirl of dust. Thinking at first that it might be a dust devil, she only glanced in that direction. Her heart sank all the way to her knees when she made out the form of a red sports car.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t possible. The terrain was far too uneven and rocky. Charles must be insane to risk the undercarriage of his car by racing after her.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she turned to face him, refusing to give one quarter. Charles bounded out of the small car like a spring being released. She nearly flinched at the hard, angry set of his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he demanded\u2014as though he had a right to ask.</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t acknowledge him but resumed her rubdown of the horse.</p><p>\u201cYou might have been killed, you idiot! And you might have killed that horse, too.\u201d</p><p>She was about to tell him she was no idiot, but she refused to become involved in a shouting match. And she did feel guilty about taking out a horse she couldn\u2019t control\u2014her father\u2019s horse, yet. But Charles was a traitor, and worse. The next time she spoke to him, Steffie thought angrily, it would be through an attorney.</p><p>It looked for a moment as though he intended to grab her by the shoulders; in fact, what she heard him mutter sounded like a threat to \u201cshake some sense\u201d into her. He raised his hands, then briefly closed his eyes and spun away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed a bit, have you?\u201d he cried, jerking one hand through his hair as he stalked toward his car.</p><p>Still Steffie remained silent, although she had to bite her tongue in an effort not to lash back at him. He\u2019d purposely hurt her family, hurt her. There was nothing left to be said.</p><p>He yanked his car door open, and Steffie blinked at the unexpectedness of his withdrawal. She wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d planned to do, but this swift capitulation came as a surprise.</p><p>Not wanting him to assume she cared about his actions one way or the other, she tried to ignore him. She looped Fury\u2019s reins around a low branch and walked away. Her legs were trembling so badly that she decided to climb onto a boulder. Perched there, she gazed out at the sweeping view of the valley below, jewel-like in its green lushness.</p><p>Charles\u2019s footsteps behind her announced that he hadn\u2019t left, after all.</p><p>\u201cRead it!\u201d he shouted, slapping the very newspaper she\u2019d given him against her thigh. \u201cThis time finish the article.\u201d</p><p>Steffie gasped, then pressed her lips together, tilting her head to avoid looking at him.</p><p>\u201cFine, be stubborn. That\u2019s nothing new. But if you won\u2019t read the article, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d He opened the paper.</p><p>Steffie wanted to blot out every word, but she wouldn\u2019t resort to anything quite as juvenile as plugging her ears. She cringed inwardly as his strong voice read the opening paragraph. On hearing it a second time, she felt the piece sounded even more hostile to her father than she\u2019d believed earlier. It was as though Charles had taken the very heart of David Bloomfield\u2019s accomplishments and crushed it with falsehoods and accusations.</p><p>By the time he reached the spot where Steffie had stopped reading, where her father\u2019s name was mentioned, the anger inside her had rekindled. She closed her eyes to the wave of pain that threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>He read on, and she waited with foreboding for the attack she knew was coming. But it didn\u2019t happen. As Charles continued, she suddenly realized how wrong she\u2019d been. How terribly wrong. Her heart in her throat, she turned toward him. Charles went on, reading a direct quote from David Bloomfield in which he told of the changes he\u2019d made over the years to aid migrant workers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first Steffie was convinced she\u2019d misunderstood. Nor was she entirely sure she could believe Charles. He might be making it up as he went along, she thought wildly, instead of actually reading the article. She reached for the newspaper and snatched it away from him.</p><p>It only took her a moment to locate the paragraph he\u2019d just read. He hadn\u2019t made it up! There, bold as could be, was the quote from her father, followed by two long paragraphs that reported the progressive measures Bloomfield Orchards had implemented over the years.</p><p>Her stomach plummeted, and she began to feel as though she were sitting in a deck chair on the Titanic. That feeling intensified as she finished reading the article. Because she soon discovered that not only was her father quoted\u2014approvingly\u2014several times, but their family orchard was used as a model for other local orchards to follow.</p><p>Steffie drew in a deep breath before she looked up at Charles. Once again, she\u2019d made a fool of herself in front of him. She cringed in acute embarrassment and self-contempt. What a jerk she\u2019d been. What a total jerk.</p> <p>She\u2019d known that meeting Charles again was inevitable. She\u2019d hoped that on her return he\u2019d view her\u2014from afar, of course\u2014as mature. Sophisticated. She\u2019d wanted him to see her as cosmopolitan and cultured, unlike the lovesick twenty-two-year-old who\u2019d left Orchard Valley three years before.</p><p>She\u2019d imagined their first meeting. She\u2019d step forward, a serene smile on her face, and hold out her hand politely. She\u2019d murmur ever so sweetly that it was lovely to see him again, but unfortunately she couldn\u2019t quite recall his name. Charles Something-or-other, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>\u201cIt looks like I owe you an apology,\u201d she said instead, her voice quavering a bit despite her efforts to keep it even.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d say you owe me an apology!\u201d he flung back. \u201cI\u2019d assumed you might have changed in three years. Instead you\u2019re an even bigger...nuisance.\u201d</p><p>His words felt like a slap across the face, and she flinched involuntarily. There wasn\u2019t a thing she could say in her own defense, nothing that would take away the shame of what she\u2019d done. No words would erase the way she\u2019d stomped into his office and created a scene in front of his entire staff.</p> <p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d she said as steadily as her crumbling poise would allow.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me, taking off like that,\u201d he raged. \u201cYou might have killed yourself.\u201d</p><p>Again, there was nothing she could say. Had she been in any other frame of mind, she would have recognized that with a horse like Fury, she was heading for trouble.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy woman!\u201d he shouted, his anger fully ignited now. \u201cHow do you think I would\u2019ve felt if you\u2019d been hurt? What about your father? You accuse me of causing his heart attack! What do you think would\u2019ve happened to him if you\u2019d killed yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I...\u201d Hating the telltale action, she bit her lip to stop its trembling.</p><p>To Steffie\u2019s dismay, he reached down and pulled her to her feet. His hands clasped her shoulders and he drew her into his arms.</p> <p>Before she had a chance to react, she was completely caught in his embrace, her hands trapped against his heaving chest.</p><p>One hand left her shoulder and slid into her long, tangled hair.</p><p>\u201cDo you even have a clue what I was thinking?\u201d he whispered. \u201cDo you have any idea what was going through my mind?\u201d</p><p>Her heart thundered. She should fight her way out of his embrace. She should demand that he release her, tell him he had no right to take her in his arms. But Steffie couldn\u2019t make herself move, couldn\u2019t make herself speak.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to stop him even when it became obvious that he was going to kiss her. Mentally she braced herself, closing her eyes.</p><p>When his mouth found hers, it was a gentle brushing of lips. Her eyes opened in wonder and surprise.</p><p>Charles kissed her again, longer this time, his mouth gliding over hers. Before she realized what she was doing, she moved her arms upward and timidly locked them behind his neck. Her lips parted to his and he pressed her closer.</p><p>But only for a moment. \u201cNo, Steffie,\u201d he said in a raw whisper, clasping both wrists and breaking her hold. He stepped back. Their eyes met for several seconds before he turned and hurried away.</p> <p>He left as abruptly as he\u2019d arrived, his sports car spitting dirt and small stones as he roared off. She sighed and prepared to mount Fury for the long journey home.</p><p>Steffie took a nap that afternoon, waking sometime in the early evening. The sun was setting, dousing the orchards in a lovely shade of pink. Not knowing what time it was, she came downstairs to find Norah in the kitchen, emptying the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Norah greeted her, smiling brightly when she saw Steffie. \u201cI was beginning to wonder if you\u2019d ever wake up. You must\u2019ve been exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a plate for you in the oven. I bet you\u2019re famished.\u201d</p><p>The last thing she\u2019d eaten had been that banana at breakfast. Murmuring her thanks, she walked across the room and removed the plate. Her sister had always been a good cook and Steffie gazed longingly at the broiled chicken breast, red new potatoes and fresh green beans.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you go this morning?\u201d Norah asked cheerfully, continuing to put the dishes away. \u201cValerie said you seemed upset about Charles Tomaselli.\u201d</p><p>Steffie pulled out a stool at the counter and sat down to eat. \u201cI needed to ask him something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get everything settled?\u201d</p><p>Steffie lowered her gaze. \u201cEverything\u2019s clear now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. He really has been wonderful through all this. Dad\u2019s pleased with how well the article on migrant workers was received. You read it, didn\u2019t you? The two of them spent weeks collecting facts, and Dad actually did a bit of undercover work. It was the first time since Mom died that he showed much interest in anything. I don\u2019t think even Charles knows how much Dad put into that piece. He must\u2019ve gone over every detail a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>Steffie, who was just about to begin her meal, promptly lost her appetite. \u201cI\u2014I didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to mail you the article, but then Dad had the heart attack and everything else fell by the wayside,\u201d Norah explained conversationally, leaning against the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Val?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the den. She\u2019s working. You know Val. She\u2019s got a mobile office set up there. Although I have to admit her mind hasn\u2019t been on the job lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Steffie made an effort to taste her meal. The chicken was tender and delicious. She took a second bite.</p><p>Norah wiggled her eyebrows playfully. \u201cIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s a romance brewing between Val and Dr. Winston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is?\u201d Steffie asked, fork poised in midair. \u201cWhat about Valerie\u2019s boss? Every time I got a letter from her it was Rowdy this and Rowdy that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about Rowdy, but I do know what I saw the night of Dad\u2019s surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d Steffie asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cValerie fell apart after we were allowed to go in and see Dad. She didn\u2019t realize I knew how upset she was, but I figured she needed a few minutes alone. I hadn\u2019t seen Dad myself, and when I did, I could understand Valerie\u2019s concern. He was very close to death. I don\u2019t know how much anyone\u2019s told you about Dad\u2019s condition, but it\u2019s a miracle he survived the open-heart surgery. Anyway,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cwhen I went in to see Dad I wondered if he\u2019d last the night. I know Colby didn\u2019t think he would. Neither did any of the others on the surgical team. Naturally, they didn\u2019t say that, but I could tell what they were thinking. I\u2019ve worked in surgery often enough myself to know who\u2019s likely to survive and who isn\u2019t. One look told me we\u2019d be lucky if Dad lasted another few hours, although I was encouraged because he\u2019d survived the surgery itself. There were plenty of complications, with the fluid in his lungs and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Valerie,\u201d Steffie urged.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, Valerie. Well, after she\u2019d been with Dad she went out onto the patio outside the surgical waiting room. She was crying, which we both know is rare for Val. I could tell she needed someone. When I got back from seeing Dad, I started to go out to her, thinking we\u2019d be able to comfort each other, but I stopped when I saw that Colby was with her.\u201d</p><p>Steffie had heard wonderful things about Dr. Winston already, but his compassion for her sister confirmed everything she\u2019d come to know of him. She said so to Norah, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey were sitting together and he was holding her in his arms. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but he had this...look. As though he would\u2019ve done anything within his power to take away her pain. I thought right then that he had the look of a man who\u2019s just discovered he\u2019s fallen in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Valerie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she might have realized they were in love with each other before Colby did. You know how strong Valerie is, how she never wants to let anyone do anything for her. Well, for the first time since I can remember, she needed someone and Colby\u2019s the person she turned to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie and Dr. Winston,\u201d Steffie said slowly. She\u2019d often wondered what it would be like when her oldest sister fell in love. Valerie had always been so pragmatic, much too sensible to get involved in a relationship while she was in college. She was there to be educated, not to find a husband, she\u2019d told Steffie.</p><p>\u201cThen Dad began to improve,\u201d Norah went on, \u201cand he started all this talk about the three of us marrying and having kids. I\u2019m afraid Valerie\u2019s taking it much too seriously, worrying about it too much. But then, she\u2019s in love for the first time in her life and she\u2019s frightened half to death that Colby\u2019s the wrong man for her. Or more to the point, that she\u2019s the wrong woman for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is love, and if they both feel so strongly, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s smile was sad and a bit hesitant. \u201cColby\u2019s as traditional as they come. I think he wants a woman straight out of the 1950s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerie knows this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she does. Colby\u2019s well aware of what Valerie\u2019s like, too. Her calling isn\u2019t the kitchen, it\u2019s the boardroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say more power to her.\u201d In Steffie\u2019s opinion, Colby Winston should appreciate her sister\u2019s God-given talents.</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d Norah agreed. \u201cBut if Valerie marries Colby she\u2019d probably have to quit her job. For one thing, CHIPS doesn\u2019t have an office in this part of the country. And she\u2019s worked too hard and too long to let go of her career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, they\u2019d both have to compromise\u2014and they can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Norah said again. She sighed. \u201cNo one ever told me love could be so complicated. I feel sorry for them both. They couldn\u2019t be more miserable.\u201d</p><p>Steffie finished off the last of the small red potatoes, not wanting her sister to guess how curious she was about her father\u2019s \u201cchat\u201d with her mother. \u201cWhat do you think of all this talk about Dad\u2019s...experience?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Norah pulled up a stool and sat across from her. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He believes he talked with Mom and that\u2019s what\u2019s important, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure of anything anymore. She\u2019d once been confident that she knew what she wanted in life. Then everything had fallen apart. But the time she\u2019d spent in Italy had helped her regain a perspective on her own life...hadn\u2019t it?</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Steffie with a sense of horror that she\u2019d spent three years studying and traveling in Italy, and her primary purpose had been to impress Charles Tomaselli when she returned.</p><p>She\u2019d impressed him, all right, by making an even bigger fool of herself than before.</p> <p>\u201cDad\u2019s been talking about his grandchildren all afternoon,\u201d Norah continued, breaking into Steffie\u2019s thoughts. Steffie was grateful for the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cGrandchildren,\u201d she repeated softly. \u201cFrom you, naturally?\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine Valerie as a mother, and she herself had no intention of marrying. When her father was well enough to come home, Steffie intended to find herself an apartment in Portland and to apply for a fellowship and begin her doctorate. She\u2019d completed her master\u2019s in Italy after an intensive language program, and in her last year there, she\u2019d also taken several advanced courses. It was hard to believe someone so well educated could be so dismally unaware of her own motives, she mused unhappily.</p><p>\u201cDad claims I\u2019m going to present him with six grandchildren,\u201d Norah said, barely restraining a smile. \u201cCan you imagine me with six children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means Valerie\u2019s going to be responsible for another six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, three. According to Dad\u2019s ramblings, you\u2019re going to have three of the little darlings yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie grinned, in spite of her depression. The picture of her married and with a brood of children was somewhat amusing. She\u2019d only loved one man in her life and the experience had been so painful that she was determined never to repeat the mistake.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see,\u201d Steffie said, sliding off her stool to carry her now-empty plate to the sink.</p><p>\u201cI guess we will,\u201d Norah concurred.</p><p>Although she\u2019d slept for a good part of the afternoon, two hours later Steffie was yawning. Making her excuses, she returned to her bedroom, showered and got into bed, savoring the crisp, clean sheets.</p><p>Sitting up, her knees tucked under her chin, she pondered her conversation with Norah. In the years since she\u2019d moved away, a number of her friends had married. She\u2019d gotten wedding invitations, passed on by Norah, every few months. And several of her high school and college friends were already mothers, some two times over.</p><p>While she was in Italy, Steffie hadn\u2019t allowed herself to think about anything more pressing than her studies, which had occupied most of her time. She\u2019d traveled and studied and worked hard. But at odd moments, when she received a wedding invitation or a birth announcement, she\u2019d occasionally taken a moment to wonder if her life was missing something. Or when she was with Mario, the adorable young son of her landlady in Rome, she\u2019d imagined, more than once, how it would feel to have a family of her own.... She\u2019d usually managed to suppress the yearning quickly.</p> <p>And now she was experiencing it again, and more sharply than ever before. All this talk of weddings and children troubled her. She felt excluded, somehow. In the end, Valerie would probably marry her Dr. Winston, and there\u2019d be a wonderful man for Norah, she was sure of it.</p><p>But for her? She found she couldn\u2019t believe in the same kind of happy ending.</p><p>Three</p><p>Although she was exhausted, Steffie couldn\u2019t sleep. After tossing about restlessly and tangling her sheets, she sat on the edge of the bed and pushed the long hair away from her face.</p><p>She\u2019d prefer to think the nap she\u2019d taken that afternoon was responsible for this inability to sleep.</p><p>But she knew better.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sleep because her thoughts wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. The memory of what a fool she\u2019d made of herself with Charles hounded her until she wanted to scream.</p><p>With graphic clarity she recalled the first time she\u2019d heard of Charles Tomaselli. She\u2019d read his introductory column in the Clarion and had loved his wit. No matter what she thought of him now, she could never fault his talent as a writer. Charles had a way of turning a phrase that gave a reader pause. He chose his words carefully, writing in a clear, economical manner that managed to be both clever and precise. And he had a wide range of subjects, covering everything from social trends to the local political scene.</p> <p>When she\u2019d read his first few columns, she\u2019d assumed he was much older, because the confidence of his observations and his style suggested a man of considerable experience. It wasn\u2019t until several weeks later that she actually met him. At the time she\u2019d been so dumbstruck she could barely put two words together.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to tell him how much she enjoyed his editor\u2019s column, but the words had twisted on the end of her tongue and came out sounding jerky and odd, like something a preschooler might say.</p><p>She\u2019d been terribly embarrassed, but Charles had responded graciously, thanking her for the compliment.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the fact that he was in his late twenties\u2014and not his fifties\u2014that had taken Steffie by surprise. Nor was it the fact that he was strikingly handsome, although he was. What struck Steffie like a fist to the stomach was the instant and powerful attraction she felt for him.</p><p>Unlike Valerie, who\u2019d gone out on only a handful of dates through high school and college, Steffie had had an active social calendar. She\u2019d always been well liked by both sexes\u2014popular enough to be voted Prom Queen her senior year of high school. But although she had lots of friends who happened to be boys, Steffie had never been in love. She\u2019d thought, more than once, that she was, but she\u2019d been wise enough to realize she was only infatuated, or in love with the idea of being in love.</p><p>Although she was twenty-one, going on twenty-two, she\u2019d never been involved in a serious relationship. She hadn\u2019t considered herself ready for one\u2014until she met the newly hired editor of the Orchard Valley Clarion.</p><p>When she met Charles, she knew immediately that she was going to love this man. How she could be so certain was unclear, even to her, but to the very depths of her young heart, she was absolutely convinced of it.</p><p>After that initial meeting, Steffie had driven home in a daze. She didn\u2019t tell anyone, including her sisters, what she felt. She didn\u2019t know how she could possibly explain her feelings without sounding silly. Love at first sight was something reserved for movies and romance novels.</p><p>She\u2019d been filled with questions, wondering if Charles had felt it, too; she soon persuaded herself that he had.</p><p>He was older\u2014twenty-seven, she discovered\u2014amazingly mature and sophisticated, while she was an inexperienced third-year college student.</p><p>Steffie lived for the next edition of the Clarion, ripping open the newspaper until she found his column, and devoured each word Charles had written. Occasionally he wrote a feature article, and she read those just as avidly. She soon discovered that other people were equally taken with his work. He\u2019d been in town for less than two months and had already become a source of pride and pleasure to the entire community.</p><p>Steffie straightened and reached over to turn on her bedside lamp. Obviously she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep, and sitting in her room, dredging up memories of Charles, wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>The house was dark and silent, which meant Valerie and Norah were both asleep. Not wanting to wake either of her sisters, Steffie slipped quietly down the dimly lit stairs.</p><p>She thought about making herself a cup of tea, then decided against it. Instead, she tiptoed into her father\u2019s den. She turned on a soft light and reached for Sonnets from the Portuguese\u2014an especially lovely edition her father had given her mother years ago, before they were married. Steffie cuddled up in his reading chair, already comforted.</p><p>The leather felt cool against her skin. An afghan her mother had knitted when the girls were still young lay neatly folded on the ottoman. Valerie must have brought it in with her, since it hadn\u2019t been there the night before.</p><p>Steffie reached for the rose-colored afghan and tucked it around her, then turned to one of her favorite poems.</p><p>She made it through two pages before her mind drifted back to Charles. Back to that first year...</p><p>He hadn\u2019t noticed her. Hadn\u2019t shared the instant attraction. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even remembered her name. Steffie was stunned. She\u2019d dreamed of him every night since the day they met. Wonderful dreams of laughing and loving, of strolling hand in hand through the apple orchard, sharing secrets and planning the rest of their lives. Her heart was so full of love that it was all she could do not to tell him outright.</p><p>Getting a man to notice her was a new challenge for Steffie. Until then, it had always been the other way around. The men\u2014no, boys\u2014had been the ones to seek her out. For the first time in her life, Steffie found herself at a disadvantage in a relationship. Clearly the only option open to her was to let Charles know as subtly as possible that she was interested. It shouldn\u2019t be such a difficult task for a former Prom Queen.</p><p>Except that it was...</p><p>The first thing Steffie did was to write him a letter commending his writing ability and his opinions. She\u2019d agonized over every word, then waited nearly two weeks for a reply.</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been one.</p><p>Charles hadn\u2019t printed her letter and didn\u2019t respond, either. Steffie had been crushed. Never one to quit, though, she\u2019d visited the newspaper office with suggestions for a wide variety of stories. As she recalled, she\u2019d managed to come up with 150 such ideas. Admittedly some were better than others.</p><p>Charles had been polite, but had made it plain that although he appreciated her suggestions, he already had an enthusiastic staff whose job it was to come up with regional stories.</p><p>Her plan had been for Charles to be so awed by her concern about local issues and her invaluable ideas that he\u2019d invite her to dinner to discuss her interest. Although, in retrospect, it sounded terribly naive, she\u2019d actually believed this would happen.</p><p>Apparently, she spent more time than she realized hanging around the newspaper office over the next few months because Charles unexpectedly asked her out for coffee one morning.</p><p>Steffie had been so excited that she could barely sit still. She was further encouraged when Charles chose a booth in the farthest, most private corner of the local coffee shop.</p><p>Even now, more than three years afterward, Steffie could recall how thrilled she\u2019d been. She\u2019d slid into the red vinyl seat across from him, sure he could read all the love and adoration in her eyes.</p><p>The encounter, however, proved to be a bitter disappointment for Steffie. Charles had been kind, but firm. He couldn\u2019t help noticing, he\u2019d said, how much time she spent at the newspaper office, and was sure her studies must have been suffering. He\u2019d also gotten her letter and the other notes she\u2019d sent him, and although he was flattered by her attention, he was much too busy with the paper to become involved in a relationship. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Steffie had pressed him for more of an explanation, he\u2019d told her without a second\u2019s pause that he considered her too young for him. Furthermore, he felt she was...too innocent.</p><p>Steffie was aghast at his lack of foresight. She was a mature woman, and six years\u2019 difference in their ages was unimportant. If she didn\u2019t object, then he shouldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>As an active member of her high school debating team, Steffie had learned how to argue, and now she\u2019d used every skill at her disposal.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>He\u2019d finally told her she was a nice kid but he simply wasn\u2019t interested. That he was a busy man and didn\u2019t have the time or patience to be a babysitter. A babysitter! He wasn\u2019t exactly impolite, but it was clear he had no intention of asking her out. Ever.</p><p>Their coffee had just been served, and Charles hadn\u2019t taken more than a sip before he tossed some money on the table and left.</p><p>Steffie had remained there, too hurt to breathe, too numb to feel anything more than a painful disappointment. She couldn\u2019t remember how long she\u2019d sat in the booth. Long after her coffee had cooled, she knew.</p><p>Obviously she\u2019d sat there much too long because she\u2019d decided that Charles Tomaselli was clearly lying.</p><p>\u201cSteff.\u201d</p> <p>The gentle voice was followed by a warm hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing sleeping down here?\u201d</p><p>Steffie raised her head and blinked. Valerie, dressed in a housecoat, stood beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Valerie said with a smile. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>Moving her legs, Steffie winced at the unexpected discomfort. Her legs were stiff and sore and the book still lay open on her lap.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to fix myself coffee and toast before heading to the hospital. Do you want some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She worked one shoulder and then the other and rotated her neck, hoping to ease the crick. Her thoughts had been so full of what had happened between her and Charles in those early days that she couldn\u2019t remember falling asleep. It surprised her that she had. She wondered if her musings had followed her into her dreams, then felt it would be better if they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how good Dad looks compared to a week ago,\u201d Valerie said when Steffie joined her in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there.\u201d She paused, shaking her head. \u201cIt was so crazy being stuck in Italy like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d Valerie paused, clutching a large earthenware mug \u201c\u2014in a way I\u2019m grateful you couldn\u2019t get home for a while. It might be the one thing that kept Dad alive. He was determined to see you before he died.\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure she understood. \u201cDo you mean to say Dad had a means of controlling the timing of his...demise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Death was what he wanted. If I\u2019ve learned anything through all this, it\u2019s that the human will is incredibly powerful.\u201d</p><p>Steffie began making toast, taking the butter and Norah\u2019s homemade strawberry jam out of the refrigerator. \u201cI\u2019m not totally clear on what you mean about the human will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can explain it,\u201d Valerie said after a moment, her look distant and thoughtful. \u201cAll I know is that Dad was on the brink of death for days. When I first arrived, Colby told us Dad would require open-heart surgery. He wanted to perform the operation immediately but couldn\u2019t because of various complications Dad was experiencing. If you want the medical terms for all this you can ask Norah or Colby, but basically it boiled down to one thing. Dad had lost the will to fight for his life. He\u2019s been miserable without Mom. We both know that, but I don\u2019t think anyone fully appreciated exactly how lonely he\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left him.\u201d Despite Valerie\u2019s reassurances, Steffie partially blamed herself for her father\u2019s failing health. She\u2019d known when he came to visit her in Italy last year that something was wrong. He\u2019d taken the trip to Europe not out of any desire to travel but because Valerie and Norah had thought it would help revive his spirits. The fact that Steffie was living in Italy had been a convenient excuse.</p><p>Steffie had enjoyed the time with her father, and had been excited about showing him the country she\u2019d come to love and introducing him to her new friends. She\u2019d carefully avoided any conversation having to do with Orchard Valley or her mother. Her father had urged her to come home, but she\u2019d already registered for new courses and paid her rent in advance and planned another trip. All excuses. Because it really came down to one thing: she\u2019d been afraid to go home.</p><p>Steffie Bloomfield afraid! The family daredevil. Dauntless, reckless Steffie Bloomfield was afraid of a mere man. More precisely, she was terrified of having to speak to Charles again, of looking him in the eye and pretending it didn\u2019t hurt anymore. Pretending she didn\u2019t love him. Pretending she didn\u2019t feel humiliated.</p><p>She was incapable of shrugging off the past, especially when it was much simpler just to stay in Europe. She loved her art history courses, she enjoyed traveling throughout Italy, she was fond of her landlady\u2019s family, she had lots of friends and acquaintances. She\u2019d discovered, too, that she had a real aptitude for languages; besides being proficient in Italian, she\u2019d picked up some French and German and hoped to continue learning them. No, she\u2019d decided, there were too many good reasons to remain in Europe. And so she\u2019d stayed.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to ride to the hospital with me?\u201d Valerie asked, apparently deep in her own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might need to do a few errands later, but you might be able to get a ride home with Norah if I\u2019m not back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried. I haven\u2019t been able to spend much time with Dad yet.\u201d Steffie felt guilty about rushing out of the hospital the day before without returning to see him.</p><p>As it turned out, Steffie couldn\u2019t have chosen a better morning to be with her father. It was the day he was being transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit and onto the surgical ward. His time in the SICU was only four days, his recovery nothing short of remarkable. Even Dr. Winston seemed to think so.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get over how beautiful you\u2019ve become,\u201d her father said when he woke from a brief nap. Steffie was sitting at his bedside, doing the New York Times crossword puzzle and feeling downright pleased with herself that she\u2019d managed to fill in a good half of the answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ve become,\u201d Steffie said with a laugh, \u201cand that\u2019s Italian. The first day after I left Rome I slipped from English to Italian and then back again without noticing. I think I spent twice as long clearing customs as anyone else, simply because the agent didn\u2019t know what to make of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can you cook me some real Italian spaghetti?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cI certainly can, and I promise it\u2019ll be so good you\u2019ll dream about it the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith plenty of garlic?\u201d</p><p>Steffie raised the tips of her fingers to her lips and made a loud smacking sound. \u201cWith enough garlic to ward off vampires for the next hundred years. Besides, I hear garlic\u2019s good for your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut lousy for your love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us needs to worry about that,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d David Bloomfield shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Princess. You, my darling Stephanie, are about to discover what it means to be in love.\u201d</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t want to say she already knew all she cared to on that subject. Thanks, Dad\u2014but no thanks, she told him silently. Falling in love wasn\u2019t an experience she wanted to repeat.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to argue with me like Valerie did, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould there be any point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiling broadly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe I really talked to your mother, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d It wasn\u2019t that she disbelieved him exactly. He was convinced that something had happened, so her opinion was irrelevant. He claimed to have enjoyed a lengthy conversation with her mother while strolling around some celestial lake. Valerie had mentioned it soon after Steffie\u2019s arrival. Norah had talked about it, too. Steffie found their accounts fascinating. Did she believe it had happened? She didn\u2019t know. She was inclined to think he\u2019d experienced some kind of revelation\u2014but whether it was spiritual, as he thought, or a dream, or a fantasy of his own making, she had no idea. And it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be the only one who doesn\u2019t believe my talk with your mother was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it. Time will prove me right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve you right about what?\u201d a distinctive male voice asked from behind her. Steffie froze and the dread washed over her.</p><p>Charles Tomaselli.</p><p>He was the last person she\u2019d expected to meet here. The last person she wanted to see again.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, David?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you have,\u201d Charles said wryly.</p><p>Steffie was on her feet immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to chat,\u201d she said with a cheery lilt, anxious to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for you to go,\u201d her father countered, holding out his hand to her. \u201cYour smile is the brightest sunshine I\u2019ve seen in days. Isn\u2019t that so, Charles?\u201d</p><p>Steffie cringed inwardly, and not giving Charles time to comment, quickly squeezed her father\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to have too much company all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably true,\u201d Charles agreed. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve got some business to discuss with you. I thought you\u2019d be interested in hearing what happened as a result of that article we did on the migrant-worker situation.\u201d</p><p>Steffie\u2019s breath caught in her throat until she realized Charles wasn\u2019t referring to the stunt she\u2019d pulled in his office the day before. She went weak with relief when she heard him mention something about Commissioner O\u2019Dell initiating an inspection program.</p><p>Steffie still hadn\u2019t looked at Charles, still hadn\u2019t turned to face him. She delayed it as long as possible, leaning forward to kiss her father\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll get a ride back to the house with Valerie or Norah, but I\u2019ll be in again this evening and we can finish our...discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you then, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded and mentally braced herself as she turned away from her father\u2019s bed. She looked shyly at Charles. To her astonishment, their eyes met instantly. They seemed drawn to gaze at each other, as though neither could resist the pull of mutual attraction. Her own heart gave a small burst of joy and she wondered if, deep within, his did, too.</p><p>\u201cHello, Steffie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles.\u201d Her voice was low and wispy. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Dad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBye, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes skidded past Charles as she hurried from the room, eager now to make her escape. By the time she reached the end of the corridor, she heard a roaring in her ears and she was breathless\u2014all because of a casual encounter with Charles. Obviously she\u2019d need to prepare herself mentally for even such minor confrontations.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been nearly as shy with him that summer evening three years earlier, she remembered with chagrin. It mortified her now to think of her brazen behavior....</p><p>If Charles considered her a kid when he\u2019d invited her for coffee, then Steffie decided she owed it to herself to show him he was wrong. Without difficulty, she\u2019d been able to discover where Charles lived. Crime had never been much of a problem in Orchard Valley, and Charles had been kind enough to leave his front door unlocked.</p> <p>When he appeared several hours later, there were scented candles lit throughout the living room and a bottle of champagne chilling in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, darling?\u201d Steffie had called out from the bathroom. She\u2019d been sitting in a bubble-filled tub for the better part of an hour, and her skin had started to shrivel. She was also worried about the candles dripping and the champagne getting warm, but she dared not leave, fearing she\u2019d never be able to get the bubbles just right again. It was important that he think she was completely nude, though in reality she wore a skimpy bikini.</p><p>Charles didn\u2019t answer. He stalked into the room, stopping abruptly in the doorway as his shocked gaze fell on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d he\u2019d demanded.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should know I\u2019m not a child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what are you\u2014a mermaid?\u201d</p><p>She forced a soft laugh and said in what she hoped was a sultry, adult voice, \u201cNo, silly man, I\u2019m a woman and if you\u2019ll come here, I\u2019ll prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut? But...but I was hoping you\u2019d join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, sweetheart. Now either you remove yourself from my home or I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d</p><p>She pushed her big toe under the water tap. \u201cI think my toe might be stuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll call the plumber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Charles, darling...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles, nothing,\u201d he snapped. Marching into the bathroom and gripping her by the upper arm, he lifted her halfway out of the tub. She screeched, stumbling to find her balance. As soon as she was upright, Charles tossed a towel at her and told her she had five minutes to leave before he called the police.</p><p>Steffie had fled, but she\u2019d seen the gleam of male admiration in Charles\u2019s eyes, seen the way he\u2019d looked at her for a second or two. And, fool that she was, she hadn\u2019t been the least bit discouraged. Instead, she\u2019d devised yet another plan.</p><p>Steffie wandered into the waiting area searching for Valerie. One of the orderlies mentioned that her sister had gone to pick up office supplies. Steffie remembered hearing something about an errand, but she hadn\u2019t been paying enough attention to recall whether Valerie was returning to the hospital or going straight home.</p><p>Oh, well, there was always Norah.</p><p>Tracking down her youngest sister didn\u2019t take long. Within five minutes, Steffie found her in the emergency room\u2014preparing to go on duty. The hospital was understaffed, and now that their father was beginning to recover, Norah had returned to work. Steffie didn\u2019t bother to ask for a ride.</p><p>Hoping Charles would be gone, she went back to the surgical ward. Her luck hadn\u2019t improved, and they met at the elevator.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were headed home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to wait for Valerie,\u201d she said, trying to edge past him. \u201cOr get a cab.\u201d</p><p>His arm blocked her escape. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that. I\u2019ll drop you off at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she returned stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you, anyway,\u201d he said, none too gently guiding her into the elevator. \u201cAnd as they say, there\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t necessary, Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but it is.\u201d</p><p>She noticed, when he led her out of the hospital to the parking lot, that he was driving the same red sports car she\u2019d seen the day before. It eased her conscience a bit that it hadn\u2019t been damaged during his race across the countryside.</p><p>He opened the door for her, and Steffie climbed inside. She was adjusting the seat belt when Charles joined her. The space seemed to shrink like silk pressed against a hot iron. Their shoulders touched, their thighs, their arms. For a moment, Steffie held her breath.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to talk to me?\u201d she said after he\u2019d pulled out of the hospital parking lot. She was leaning as close to the passenger door as she could.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d discuss it over a glass of iced tea. You are inviting me inside, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He turned and grinned at her, that boyish, slightly skewed grin she\u2019d always found so appealing.</p><p>She\u2019d planned to tell him she had no intention of letting him in; instead she cleared her throat and said, \u201cIf you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>The ten-mile drive to the house generally took fifteen minutes. Steffie could have sworn Charles was purposely dragging out the time, driving well below the speed limit. They were so close in the small cramped car that she couldn\u2019t avoid brushing against him, even though she tried not to. She was trying to forget that he\u2019d kissed her the day before, and this didn\u2019t make it any easier.</p><p>Steffie closed her eyes. It was all she could do not to shout at him to hurry. Why was he prolonging these moments alone? The least he could do was make polite conversation.</p><p>\u201cMy father seems cheerful, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d If Charles wasn\u2019t going to say something, then she would. Anything to ease this terrible awareness.</p><p>\u201cHe certainly does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a reason to live now, and that\u2019s made all the difference in the world. I\u2019m not sure what to think about his dream, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...nothing... It\u2019s not important.\u201d Steffie couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d done. In her nervousness, in her desperation to fill the silence, she\u2019d blurted out what should never have been shared.</p><p>She relaxed when Charles finally turned off the road onto the mile-long family driveway. He parked in front of the house.</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t wait for him, but threw open her door and jumped out, her keys already in hand. She had the front door open by the time he caught up with her, and tossing her purse onto the hall table, led him briskly into the kitchen.</p><p>Norah had made some iced tea that morning. Steffie silently thanked her sister for her thoughtfulness as she took out the cold pitcher. A minute later, she\u2019d found two tall glasses, added ice and sliced a fresh lemon. Another minute, and the drinks were ready.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it you wanted to say?\u201d Steffie reluctantly asked. She hadn\u2019t realized how warm she was and held the glass between both hands, enjoying the coolness against her palms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about what happened yesterday,\u201d Charles said, walking away from her. He paused at the bay window that overlooked the backyard. Just beyond his view was the stable. \u201cOr more appropriately, what shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss it,\u201d Steffie said adamantly. She didn\u2019t want to hear any more about her irresponsible accusations and rash actions. Nor did she wish to hear how much Charles regretted kissing her.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone needs to apologize, it\u2019s me,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just leave it at that? I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Charles\u2019s back was to her as he stared outside toward the stables. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever infuriated me this much,\u201d he said quietly. He turned, set his glass of iced tea aside and thrust his hands into his pockets. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a woman who manages to irritate me the way you do.\u201d</p><p>Steffie stiffened. \u201cI\u2019ve already apologized for leaping to conclusions. I admitted I was wrong.\u201d She shrugged elaborately. \u201cMy only excuse is that I spent a hellish week trying to get home and I haven\u2019t slept properly in days and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d he said, interrupting her. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for an apology.... Actually I\u2019m here to make my own. I want you to know I\u2019m sorry about chasing after you. It was a dangerous thing to do. I might have spooked Fury into throwing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention damaging your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s put it behind us,\u201d Steffie suggested with a weak smile. \u201cI was wrong to run away. It was...childish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were angry, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met a man who manages to irritate me the way you do,\u201d she said, consciously echoing his words.</p><p>\u201cWe always seem to get on each other\u2019s nerves, don\u2019t we?\u201d His grin was warm and gentle, just as his kiss had been. Strangely, Steffie found his smile no less devastating.</p><p>\u201cWe certainly have a history of annoying each other.\u201d It took her more courage than he\u2019d ever know to refer to the past. But suddenly she hoped they could put that behind them, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never be able to forgive myself if anything had happened to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really in any danger of Fury throwing me.\u201d Okay, so that was a slight exaggeration, but she had stayed in the saddle.</p><p>\u201cIt was, shall we say, a memorable way for us to meet again.\u201d Charles\u2019s voice was husky. He moved closer to her and she lowered her eyes, but not before she noticed how his attention seemed to center on her mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not sorry about.\u201d He took another step toward her and raised his hand to touch her cheek. His fingers brushed aside a stray lock of hair. Steffie couldn\u2019t move. She couldn\u2019t think coherently. She could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret kissing you,\u201d Charles whispered.</p><p>Then she did move. Trembling, she stepped backward and bolted to the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cStephanie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall\u2014call me Steffie,\u201d she stuttered. Her hands were shaking so badly that she jerked them behind her.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to call you Stephanie. You\u2019re not a little girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>She smiled brightly. Now was the perfect time to convince him how sophisticated she\u2019d become after three years in Europe\u2014sophisticated and experienced. She was sure that was the type of woman he expected, the type of woman he wanted.</p><p>\u201cAs kisses go, it was very nice,\u201d she agreed in an offhand manner. Was she overdoing it? she wondered. \u201cYours had a gentleness, and that was unusual. Most men aren\u2019t like that, you know? When they kiss a woman it\u2019s hot and sweaty. They leave a girl breathless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Charles said, raising one eyebrow.</p><p>She placed her hands on her hips, fashion-model style, and tilted back her head, letting her long brown hair swing lightly. \u201cI\u2019m not the same person I was three years ago. You\u2019re right about that. I\u2019m all grown-up now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the ride home,\u201d she said, walking out of the kitchen. She hoped Charles would follow her because she wasn\u2019t sure how much longer she could maintain this performance.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else these...hot, sweaty men taught you?\u201d he asked in a dispassionate voice. He reached for his iced tea, apparently disinclined to leave quite so soon.</p><p>She turned around and smiled serenely. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d Deciding to give him the answer he deserved, she rashly went on. \u201cAs you might imagine, I met men of all nationalities\u2014students from all over Europe\u2014and I sampled my fair share of kisses.\u201d Mostly chaste kisses of greeting or farewell, but he didn\u2019t have to know that. And then there were Mario\u2019s exuberant hugs.... Mario was only four years old, but Charles didn\u2019t have to know that, either.</p> <p>Charles scowled, and set his glass down on the counter hard enough to slosh liquid over the edges. He stalked past her. \u201cGoodbye, Steffie,\u201d he said coldly, throwing the words over his shoulder.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d slammed the front door that she understood his words had been meant as an insult. He was telling her he\u2019d changed his mind, reconsidered. He\u2019d seen through her little dramatization and decided he\u2019d been wrong: she wasn\u2019t an adult. She remained a silly, immature girl.</p><p>Steffie wandered between two rows of budding apple trees, contemplating her latest disaster with Charles. The setting sun cast a rosy splendor over the orchard. All her life, Steffie had come out here when she needed to think. This was where she found peace, and a tranquillity that eased her burdens. Since her last meeting with Charles, there\u2019d been plenty of those. And regrets. She hadn\u2019t seen him in several days and that helped. But it also hurt. There were so many unanswered questions between them, so many unspoken words.</p><p>Hearing footsteps behind her, Steffie turned to see Norah walking toward her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something!\u201d Norah moaned.</p> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked when Norah moved three agitated paces ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help Valerie. You can give her advice. You\u2019ve had more experience with men.\u201d</p><p>Steffie suppressed the urge to laugh at the irony of this statement, considering her ludicrous performance in front of Charles. She reached up to run her fingers along the smooth bark of a branch. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s making the biggest mistake of her life,\u201d Norah said dramatically. It wasn\u2019t often that her sister sounded so distraught. Unfortunately Steffie was hardly the ideal person to advise Valerie on romance.</p><p>\u201cI told you before that Valerie and Dr. Winston are in love,\u201d Norah continued. \u201cEveryone around them can see it. And whenever Valerie and Colby are together, they can\u2019t keep their eyes off each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t seeing each other anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding each other. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve talked in days.\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s words struck a chord in Steffie. She knew exactly what Valerie was doing, because she was guilty of the same thing herself. She hadn\u2019t seen Charles since the day he\u2019d driven her home from the hospital. They were obviously taking pains to avoid each other\u2014just like Valerie and Dr. Winston.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what I can do,\u201d Steffie muttered.</p><p>\u201cTalk to Val,\u201d Norah argued. \u201cShe might listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>Norah hesitated, frowning. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019ll think of something. I\u2019ve given it my best shot and I just wasn\u2019t getting through to her. Maybe you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you have so much faith in my abilities,\u201d Steffie said lightly.</p><p>\u201cI do have faith in you,\u201d Norah said, her blue eyes serious. \u201cYou\u2019re different now than before you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years in Italy will do that to a girl.\u201d As she had with Charles, Steffie strived to seem flippant and worldly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean that. You\u2019re more thoughtful. More\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014mature, I guess. Before you left Orchard Valley you acted like you had to prove yourself to the world, but it isn\u2019t like that now. I can\u2019t see you doing some of the crazy things you used to do.\u201d</p><p>Just as well that Norah didn\u2019t know about some of her \u201cmature\u201d behavior these past few days. And thank heaven no one in the family had any idea of the embarrassing stunts she\u2019d pulled trying to attract Charles\u2019s attention three years ago.</p><p>\u201cI remember the time you stood on Princess bareback and rode around the yard. You were lucky you didn\u2019t break your neck.\u201d</p><p>Steffie remembered the incident well. It had been shortly before their mother died. She\u2019d been grieving so terribly, and doing something utterly dangerous had helped vent some of her pain and grief. But Norah was completely right. She shouldn\u2019t have done it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk to Valerie,\u201d Steffie promised, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how much good it\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Steffie tried. But the conversation with her sister hadn\u2019t gone as planned. One look at Valerie told her how much her sister was suffering. Valerie tried to hide it, but Steffie knew the signs from her own limited experience with love.</p><p>They\u2019d become involved in a lengthy discussion about love, then decided neither one of them was qualified to advise the other. They\u2019d thought of bringing Norah in on the conversation but that suggestion had resulted in a bout of unexpected giggles. They couldn\u2019t ask Norah about falling in love because she was too busy dating.</p><p>One interesting detail that emerged from their talk was something Valerie mentioned almost casually. While Steffie was struggling to find a way home, Charles had seemed very concerned about her. He\u2019d even pulled a few strings in an effort to help when she didn\u2019t arrive on schedule.</p><p>Although they\u2019d never openly discussed her relationship with Charles, Valerie seemed to know how Steffie felt. It wasn\u2019t that Steffie had tried to conceal it; with one breath, she admitted she\u2019d made a fool of herself over the newspaper article and with the next, she\u2019d asked her sister about falling in love. Valerie was certainly astute enough to figure out Steffie\u2019s feelings for Charles.</p><p>David Bloomfield was now recuperating at home and doing well. Steffie still hadn\u2019t seen Charles. She\u2019d thought maybe he\u2019d be stopping by the house to visit her father, whose release from the hospital had been a festive event.</p><p>Steffie was pleased to see that Valerie and Colby were able to steal a few moments alone that afternoon, but she didn\u2019t think their time together had gone well. They\u2019d gone for a walk in the orchard; Valerie had looked pale and sad when they returned, and Colby had remained silent throughout the celebration dinner that followed.</p><p>Knowing it was inevitable that she\u2019d see Charles again, Steffie tried to mentally brace herself for their next meeting.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have guessed it would be at the local gas station.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Steffie Bloomfield,\u201d Del of Del\u2019s Gas-and-Go greeted her when she went inside to pay for her fill-up and buy a bottle of soda. \u201cI swear you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. Del was pot-bellied and at least sixty, but he had to be the biggest flirt in town. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, too. What do I owe you for the gas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were a rich man, I\u2019d say the gas was free. Looking at your pretty face is payment enough. Right, Charles?\u201d</p><p>It always happened when she was least prepared, when seeing him was the last thing she expected.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Charles answered from behind her with a decided lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHello, Charles,\u201d she said, turning around to greet him, trying to sound casual and slightly aloof. She pasted a smile on her face, determined not to let him fluster her as he had every single time they\u2019d encountered each other.</p><p>\u201cStephanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you heard, but Dad\u2019s home now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got word of that the other day.\u201d Charles took his wallet out of his hip pocket and paid for his gas.</p><p>Steffie twisted the top off her soda and took a deep swallow. It tasted cool and sweet, bringing welcome relief to her suddenly parched throat. \u201cI was thinking you might stop by and visit.\u201d Hoping more aptly described her thoughts, but she couldn\u2019t admit that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer as he followed her outside. The service-station attendant was washing her windshield and Steffie lingered, wanting to say something, anything, to make a fresh start with Charles.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you wrote one of your first columns about Del\u2019s, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a good memory,\u201d Charles said, his words a bit less stiff.</p><p>The boy had finished with her windows and there was no further excuse to dawdle. Reluctantly she opened her car door. \u201cIt was good seeing you. Oh, by the way, Valerie told me you made several efforts to find me when I was trying to get home from Italy. I appreciate all the help you gave my family.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. She set one foot inside the car, then paused and glanced back at Charles. She had to speak up\u2014now. \u201cCharles.\u201d He turned around again, a surprised expression on his face. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very grateful for your friendship to my family\u2014and to me.\u201d With that she ducked inside her car, heart racing, and drove off without looking back.</p><p>Unfortunately dinner that evening was a strained affair. Norah had come to Steffie an hour before with the news that Colby had dated another nurse, a friend of Norah\u2019s, three nights running. Norah didn\u2019t know whether to tell Valerie, and had asked Steffie\u2019s advice.</p><p>Steffie thought it best not to say anything to their sister until Norah had slept on the matter.</p><p>But Steffie suspected that Valerie was already aware of it, suspected that Valerie knew it in her heart. Although her sister hadn\u2019t said anything to the family, Steffie believed she\u2019d quietly made arrangements to return to Texas and her job as vice president of CHIPS, a software company based in Houston.</p><p>Everyone could feel something was wrong, but no one said a word during dinner. Everyone was terribly polite\u2014as though the others were strangers\u2014which only heightened the tension.</p><p>Their father had made his excuses, claiming to be especially tired, and with Norah\u2019s help retired to his room almost immediately after dinner.</p><p>Apparently Valerie wasn\u2019t in the mood for company either, because she excused herself and retreated to her bedroom, leaving Steffie and Norah to their own devices.</p><p>After they\u2019d finished clearing up after dinner, Norah left to attend a wedding shower for a friend.</p><p>Feeling at loose ends, Steffie inspected the kitchen. On impulse, she decided to make the spaghetti sauce she\u2019d promised her father. She dragged out the largest pot she could find and began to assemble ingredients. Fresh tomatoes, onions, tomato paste, garlic. No fresh herbs, so dried would have to do. Oh, good, a bottle of nice California red... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Humming to herself, she put on a CD of Verdi\u2019s Aida and turned up the volume until the music echoed against the kitchen walls. The emotional intensity and dramatic characterizations of the Italian composer suited her mood.</p><p>She found an old white apron her father had used years before whenever he barbecued. Wrapping it around her waist, she drew the long strings around to the front and tied them.</p><p>Half an hour later, she was stirring the last of the tomato paste into the pot. She added a generous amount of red wine, all the while singing at the top of her lungs. The sound of someone pounding at the back door jolted her back to reality.</p><p>Running barefoot across the kitchen, she pulled open the door and saw Charles standing there, holding a pot of purple azaleas.</p> <p>\u201cCharles! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one answered the front door,\u201d he remarked dryly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d She walked to the counter to turn off her CD player. \u201cCome in.\u201d The silence was nearly deafening.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said your father was home from the hospital?\u201d As though self-conscious about holding a flowerpot, he handed it to Steffie.</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d she said, setting the plant aside. \u201cHow thoughtful. I\u2019m sure Dad will love this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t for David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was...we just got a full-page ad from How Green Is My Thumb Nursery and I felt it might be a gesture of good faith to buy something. I thought you\u2019d appreciate an azalea more than your father would.\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say other than a soft \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, apparently eager to leave. He stepped toward the door and she desperately tried to think of something to keep him there, with her.</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked quickly, even though the sauce was only just starting to simmer and wouldn\u2019t be properly ready until the following day.</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just putting together a pot of spaghetti sauce for tomorrow. Dad asked me to cook him an Italian meal and...well, if you wouldn\u2019t mind waiting a bit, I\u2019ll be happy to fix you a plate. It really needs to simmer longer, but I know from experience that it\u2019s perfectly edible after an hour.\u201d She sounded breathless by the time she\u2019d finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already had dinner, but thanks, anyway,\u201d Charles told her. \u201cI could do with a cup of coffee, though.\u201d He nodded toward the half-full pot sitting beside the stove.</p><p>\u201cSure...great. Me, too. I\u2019d get Dad but he\u2019s sleeping,\u201d she explained as she poured him a cup, then one for herself.</p><p>\u201cThrough that?\u201d Charles motioned toward the CD player.</p><p>\u201cSure. He loves listening to the same music I do. Besides, he\u2019s way over on the other side of the house. I doubt he could even hear it.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention that a tragic love story might suit Valerie\u2019s mood, however. And since her sister\u2019s bedroom was directly above the kitchen she was the one most likely to have been serenaded.</p><p>Charles held the mug in both hands and walked over to examine her efforts. \u201cSo you learned to cook while you were away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she admitted.</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have guessed you were the domestic type.\u201d He stirred the sauce with a wooden spoon, lifted it out of the pot and tasted it, using one finger. His brows rose. \u201cThis is good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must\u2019ve been some Italian man you were hoping to impress.\u201d</p><p>The only man she\u2019d ever wanted to impress was the one standing in the kitchen at that very moment.</p><p>\u201cI was too busy with my studies to date much,\u201d she said, dumping the empty tomato-paste cans in the recycling bin.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the impression you gave me the other day.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, her back to him. \u201cI know. I certainly seem to make a habit of playing the fool when I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Charles\u2019s voice was rueful. \u201cI\u2019ve occasionally suffered from the same problem.\u201d</p><p>The unexpectedness of his admission caught her off balance, and she twisted around to face him. For a long, unguarded moment she soaked in the sight of him.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anyone I dated very often,\u201d she told him in a raw whisper.</p><p>\u201cSurely there was someone?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. They gazed silently into each other\u2019s eyes, and Steffie seemed to lose all sense of time.</p><p>Charles was the one who broke the trance. \u201cUh, your pot seems to be boiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darn, I forgot to turn down the burner.\u201d She raced across the kitchen, flipped the knob on the stove and stirred the sauce briskly, praying it hadn\u2019t burned.</p><p>While she stood at the stove, Steffie basked in a glow of unfamiliar contentment. It felt so wonderful to be with Charles\u2014not fighting or defensive, not acting like a love-struck adolescent. For the first time, she was truly comfortable with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the sauce will be fine,\u201d she murmured, picking up her coffee mug.</p><p>He pulled out a chair and sat.</p><p>As she was getting cream, sugar and teaspoons, she thought she heard some noise from upstairs. Glancing at the ceiling, she frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Steffie joined him at the table, adding only cream to her own coffee and pushing the sugar bowl toward Charles. \u201cI\u2019m worried about Valerie,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cSo is Norah. Everyone is, except Dad, which is for the best\u2014I mean, he\u2019s got enough on his mind healing from the surgery. He shouldn\u2019t be worrying about any of us.\u201d</p><p>Charles added a level teaspoon of sugar to his coffee, then paused, the spoon held above his cup. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I take sugar?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze skirted away from his. \u201cWe had coffee together once before, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d came his automatic response.</p><p>Steffie preferred not to dredge up the unhappy memory again, especially since he didn\u2019t even seem to recall it. She stared down at the table. \u201cIt was the first time you asked me to\u2014you know, leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cThe first time,\u201d he repeated, then shook his head in apparent confusion. Just as well, Steffie thought to herself, astounded that he had absolutely no recollection of an incident she remembered in such complete and painful detail.</p><p>She decided to change the subject. \u201cNorah baked cookies the other day, if you\u2019d like some.\u201d</p><p>Charles declined. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on with your sister.\u201d His eyes darted to the ceiling.</p><p>Steffie wondered how much of Valerie\u2019s dilemma she should confide in him, but then remembered Norah\u2019s telling her that Charles had been with them the night of her father\u2019s surgery. More than likely he knew how Colby and Valerie felt about each other.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in love,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Doc Winston, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded. \u201cThey both seem to have fallen hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure she could explain, when she didn\u2019t entirely understand it herself. So she shrugged and said, \u201cI think Colby wants her to be something she can\u2019t. Valerie\u2019s an incredibly gifted businesswoman. But I gather he wants a woman who\u2019d be happy to stay home and be a housewife\u2014there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, of course, but it just isn\u2019t right for Valerie. It doesn\u2019t look like either one of them is going to compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she loves him, maybe she should be willing to compromise first,\u201d Charles said, then sipped his coffee. \u201cTake the first step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Colby? Why does it always have to be the woman who compromises? Don\u2019t answer that, I already know. Women have been forced to adapt to men\u2019s fickle natures for so many generations that it comes to us naturally,\u201d she said with heavy sarcasm. \u201cRight?\u201d</p><p>Charles was silent. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to argue about your sister,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cI know, it\u2019s just that I found your statement so\u2014\u201d She stopped in midsentence because she didn\u2019t want to fight with him, either. They\u2019d done so much of that. And she didn\u2019t want this encounter to end the way all the others had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about her, and I can\u2019t help feeling a bit defensive. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s making arrangements to return to Texas\u2014and I wish she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had much time with her, have you?\u201d</p><p>Steffie tapped the mug with her spoon, staring into the dregs of her coffee. \u201cThat\u2019s not the whole reason I wish she\u2019d stay.\u201d She was silent for a moment. \u201cLeaving your problems behind simply doesn\u2019t work. Not unless you\u2019ve exhausted every possibility of reaching a compromise. In fact, I think leaving can make everything much worse. The problem is, I can\u2019t tell Valerie that. It\u2019s one of those painful realities we each need to discover on our own, I guess. I\u2019m going to talk to her, but I doubt it\u2019ll make any difference.\u201d</p><p>Charles\u2019s dark eyes were sympathetic. \u201cI hope she listens.\u201d</p><p>Steffie thanked him with a smile. \u201cI hope she does, too, but the three of us seem to share a wide streak of stubbornness.\u201d</p><p>Charles rubbed his eyes, and she realized he must be exhausted. \u201cYou won\u2019t get an argument out of me,\u201d he said with a tired grin.</p><p>\u201cAre you still working as many hours?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFifty to sixty a week. We publish twice weekly now and eventually we\u2019re looking to go daily. Some days I feel like I\u2019m married to that paper.\u201d</p><p>The word \u201cmarried\u201d seemed to hang in the air. At one time Steffie had been convinced beyond any doubt that they\u2019d be married, she and Charles. It was this unshakable resolve that had created so many difficulties in her relationship with him. Naively, she\u2019d assumed that all she had to do was show him they were meant to love each other and after a few short object lessons, he\u2019d agree. Now she knew that life\u2014and love\u2014didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>\u201cAre you still a jack-of-all-trades at the paper?\u201d she asked, remembering that his job meant he had a hand in every aspect of publishing the newspaper\u2014from writing, editing and layout to distribution.</p><p>\u201cEverything except the classifieds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have an intern?\u201d</p><p>Charles relaxed against the back of his chair and nodded. \u201cWendy. She\u2019s a recent graduate from the University of Portland.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as he spoke, and a red light went on in front of Steffie\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat happened to Larry? I thought you were working with him?\u201d The idea of Charles spending long hours with an attractive college student filled her with a sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cNo, he moved on to an Internet news service. So, Wendy\u2019s with me now.\u201d</p><p>Wendy\u2019s with me now? Then it came to her. She didn\u2019t need to worry about competing for Charles anymore.</p><p>She was out of the running.</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cIs someone here?\u201d Steffie heard her father even before he entered the kitchen. He was wearing his plaid housecoat, cinched at the waist, which emphasized the weight he\u2019d recently lost. His white hair was rumpled from sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDavid, hello,\u201d Charles said, standing to shake hands with him. Her father slowly made his way to the table, declining Charles\u2019s gesture of assistance.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were still asleep,\u201d Steffie said with a loving smile. She\u2019d missed the worst of the crisis, but her sisters had repeatedly told her how close they\u2019d come to losing their father. Now, every time she was with him, she felt a sense of renewed love and gratitude that his life had been spared.</p><p>\u201cHow do you expect a man to sleep with such delicious smells coming from the kitchen?\u201d David grumbled good-naturedly. \u201cI swear it\u2019s driving me to distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my Italian spaghetti sauce.\u201d</p> <p>Her father squinted. \u201cBut we already ate dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The sauce needs to simmer for several hours and it\u2019s even better if you let it sit overnight. I was hoping to surprise you tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Her father nodded approvingly. \u201cSounds great, Princess.\u201d Then he grinned at Charles. \u201cGood to see you, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, old man.\u201d</p><p>She could tell that they\u2019d often bantered like this. The atmosphere was relaxed, one of shared affection and camaraderie.</p> <p>\u201cYou were in the neighborhood and decided to stop by?\u201d David inquired. It wasn\u2019t likely Charles would come this way except to visit the Bloomfields, and they all knew it.</p><p>\u201cI stopped in to check up on you,\u201d Charles said, but his gaze drifted involuntarily toward Steffie. Their eyes met briefly before she looked away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason?\u201d her father pressed.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, brought that for Stephanie,\u201d he said and pointed in the direction of the potted azalea.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t by any chance happen to be sweet on my little girl, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Steffie broke in urgently, \u201chow about something to drink? Coffee, tea, a glass of water?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing, thanks. I just came to see if I was dreaming about garlic and basil or if this was for real. I\u2019ll leave the two of you to yourselves now.\u201d He stood awkwardly, as though he wasn\u2019t quite steady on his feet. Steffie\u2019s instincts were to help him, but she knew it was important that he do as much as possible on his own. She stepped back, ready to assist him if necessary.</p><p>Charles must have been thinking the same thing because he stood beside her, a concerned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you to your room,\u201d she said. The effort of rising from his chair and walking a few paces seemed to deplete her father\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d he objected. \u201cYou\u2019ve got company. Charles isn\u2019t here to visit me. I heard him say so himself. That was just an excuse so he could bring you that pretty flower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Her father grumbled, but allowed her to wrap her arm around his waist to support him. She looked over her shoulder at Charles. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d</p><p>No sooner were they out of the kitchen than David came to a halt, wearing the most delighted grin Steffie had ever seen. \u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. Then he started chuckling softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that your mother was right about this, too. Surprises me, but it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Right about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, there\u2019s nothing between us! We\u2019re hardly even friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but all that\u2019s about to change. Soon, too. Very soon.\u201d</p><p>Her father continued to mutter under his breath, as pleased as ever. Steffie closed her ears to his remarks, knowing that he had to be referring to his dream\u2014the time he\u2019d supposedly spent tiptoeing around the afterlife, gathering information. It hadn\u2019t bothered her nearly as much when he was going on about Valerie and Colby, but now that it was her turn, she felt decidedly uneasy.</p><p>\u201cCharles isn\u2019t here to see me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cBringing me the azalea didn\u2019t mean anything. He got a new advertising account, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sure he intended to give it to you, but you were sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Arguing wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere, and besides, she didn\u2019t want to keep Charles waiting. She suspected he\u2019d be leaving soon, anyway. Her father sat on the edge of his bed, his eyes curious as he smiled up at her. \u201cI might have guessed. I wasn\u2019t sure what to think when your mother mentioned you and Charles. She told me you\u2019ve been in love with him for quite some time. She\u2019s right, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Steffie kissed his brow and ignored his question. \u201cDo you want me to tuck you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, no! You hurry back to your young man. He\u2019s waiting for you. Has been for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Dad,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>Her father\u2019s grin broadened. \u201cBy golly, your mother was right,\u201d she heard him mutter again. \u201cI should\u2019ve known. Forgive me, Grace, for doubting.\u201d</p><p>Outside the bedroom door, Steffie started to tremble. Without directly saying so, her father was telling her what she\u2019d most dreaded hearing, and at the same time what she desired above all.</p><p>Whether it was the result of fantasy, intuition or, as he believed, spiritual intervention, he\u2019d become convinced that she\u2019d be marrying Charles. The same way he was so certain about what would happen between Valerie and Colby Winston. And Steffie wasn\u2019t any more confident about her older sister\u2019s relationship than she was about her own with Charles.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost,\u201d Charles told her when she rejoined him in the kitchen.</p><p>She raised her eyes to his, dismayed that he\u2019d noticed. She needed to sit down. He was right, it had been a scare, listening to her father talk like that about the two of them, making marriage sound imminent.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Is your father okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOh, he\u2019s fine, growing stronger every day...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see him smile again.\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded and glanced at the simmering pot of sauce. Anything to keep her eyes away from Charles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really wrong?\u201d he asked her. His concern was gentle and undemanding, and it touched her heart. This was the man she\u2019d always known him to be. The man she\u2019d fallen in love with\u2014the man she\u2019d never been able to forget.</p><p>Had it been anyone else, she would have laughed off her father\u2019s words. She would have joked with her \u201cdestined\u201d husband-to-be about how her father was bent on playing matchmaker.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do that with Charles, not when she\u2019d so blatantly played the role herself. He\u2019d assume, and not without justification, that she was up to her old tricks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, forcing herself to smile brightly. \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking how lucky we are to have him with us again.\u201d</p><p>Charles studied her intently. \u201cYou\u2019re sure there\u2019s nothing wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She looked at him in what she hoped was a reassuring manner.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201d She smiled, to take the sting from her words. \u201cYou\u2019ve already done so much. We\u2019re all indebted to you...you\u2019ve been wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound like some saint. Trust me, Stephanie, no one\u2019s going to canonize me\u2014especially with the things I\u2019m thinking right now.\u201d He was behind her before she even realized he\u2019d moved. His hands were on her shoulders and he drew her back and slipped his arms around her waist. He nuzzled her neck and breathed in deeply, as though to inhale her scent.</p><p>Deluged with warm sensation, Steffie closed her eyes and savored the moment. She\u2019d never believed this could happen. She dared not believe it even now.</p><p>It would be so easy to turn into his arms, to bury herself in the comfort he offered. She\u2019d dreamed of this for so long. But now that it was here, she was afraid.</p><p>Her hands folded over his, which were joined at her middle. \u201cI\u2014the flowers are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gesture of good faith.\u201d</p><p>His words confused her. He must have sensed her uncertainty because he spoke again in a low voice. \u201cLet\u2019s start all over again, shall we? From the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 I\u2019m not sure I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>He softly kissed the side of her neck, then released her and turned her around so they were face to face. \u201cHello there, my name\u2019s Charles Tomaselli. I understand you\u2019re Stephanie Bloomfield. It\u2019s a real pleasure to meet you.\u201d He held out his hand to her, which she took. If his eyes hadn\u2019t been so serious, she would have burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cCharles, you say? Anyone call you Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly ever. Anyone call you Steffie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I was much younger,\u201d she teased. \u201cA mere kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re recently back in town. I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve had time to notice, but there\u2019ve been a few changes in Orchard Valley. How about if I drive you around, show you the place?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo time like the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019ve just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that won\u2019t stand in your way. It shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m completely trustworthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll accept your kind invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to bring a sweater?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>He reached for her hand, his fingers entwined with hers as he led her toward the front door. It felt like the most natural thing in the world for them to be together.</p><p>They bounded down the steps, carefree and laughing. Charles opened the car door for her, helped her inside and without warning leaned forward to kiss her. Their lips met briefly, then lingered. When he broke away, Charles seemed surprised himself. Steffie glanced up at him, thinking she might read some sign of regret in his eyes, but there was none. Only a free-flowing happiness that reflected her own feelings exactly.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d Norah asked late the next morning. \u201cI came home from Julie\u2019s wedding shower and you were nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>Steffie spread a thin layer of her sister\u2019s strawberry jam across her English muffin. \u201cI went out for a while.\u201d She didn\u2019t add any details because her father was sitting at the table, lingering over his cup of coffee and the paper. He\u2019d make all the wrong assumptions if he knew she\u2019d been with Charles.</p><p>They\u2019d spent nearly two hours driving around the area. Charles had taken her past several new businesses, including fast-food restaurants and some specialty boutiques. He\u2019d shown her the recently constructed six-plex movie theater, a new housing complex and a brand-new mall on the outskirts of town. The drive had been highlighted by an ongoing commentary that included the latest gossip.</p><p>Steffie hadn\u2019t enjoyed herself so much in ages. Charles had been entertaining and fun, and he seemed to take pains never to refer to their past differences. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was late when they\u2019d gotten back to the house, but they sat in the car for another thirty minutes, talking, before Steffie went inside.</p><p>She\u2019d fully expected to lie awake half the night savoring the time she\u2019d spent with him, but to her astonishment, she\u2019d fallen asleep immediately.</p><p>\u201cSteffie was out with Charles,\u201d their father announced without looking up from his paper. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get home until late.\u201d</p><p>Steffie feverishly worked the knife back and forth across the muffin, spreading the already thin layer of jam even thinner.</p> <p>\u201cCharles Tomaselli?\u201d Norah repeated as though she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard correctly.</p><p>\u201cTwo girls and a boy,\u201d David returned cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Steffie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou and Charles,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get married and within the next few years have your own family.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue with her father or listen to more of this, Steffie glanced at her sister. \u201cI need to do a few errands around town, but then I\u2019m driving to Portland. Does anyone need anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPortland?\u201d her father echoed. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was time I applied for my doctorate and a part-time teaching position at the university. I am qualified, Dad, as you well know since you paid dearly for my education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t worry about finding work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize the country\u2019s in a recession, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be married before the end of the summer, so don\u2019t go complicating everything with a job.\u201d</p><p>Steffie could feel the heat leap into her face. He seemed so certain of a marriage between her and Charles, and that exasperated her no end. \u201cDad, please listen\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for you to be starting a job or a course and then taking time off for a honeymoon.\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure if it was a good idea to humor him anymore. This had gone on long enough, but she didn\u2019t know what to say. She was aware that her father claimed everything would work out between Valerie and Colby, too. After seeing her older sister\u2019s pale, drawn features that morning, Steffie had no faith in her father\u2019s words. Not that she\u2019d really ever believed him...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t actually expect to make a lot of contacts, since most of the offices won\u2019t be open on a Saturday, but I\u2019m hoping to look around, check out the library, get a few names. Obtaining a teaching position now might be difficult, anyway, especially for the fall session. But I\u2019d like to get started on a thesis soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words you\u2019re going to Portland, no matter what I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go shopping when you\u2019re done,\u201d her father suggested. \u201cTry on a few wedding dresses. Both you and your sister are going to need \u2019em. Soon.\u201d</p><p>Norah was watching Steffie closely and spoke the moment their father had left the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Norah pleaded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue,\u201d Steffie said, fully agreeing with her sister\u2019s concern. \u201cIf Dad insists on believing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Dad,\u201d Norah blurted out impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m talking about Valerie.\u201d</p><p>Steffie\u2019s exasperation with her father was quelled by her compassion for Valerie. \u201cWhat can we do?\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s face was pinched with worry. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know, but we can\u2019t let her leave town like this. She came down early this morning.... I decided I had to tell her about Colby dating Sherry Waterman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d Valerie take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s so hard to read sometimes. It was as if she already knew, which is impossible.\u201d Norah frowned. \u201cI wish you\u2019d talk to her again. She\u2019s in her room now and, Steffie, I\u2019m really worried about her. She\u2019s in love with Colby\u2014she admitted it\u2014but she seems resigned to losing him.\u201d</p><p>Steffie thought she understood her older sister\u2019s feelings.</p><p>\u201cTo complicate matters,\u201d Norah went on, \u201cValerie and I started talking and...arguing, and Dad heard us. He asked what we were fighting about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to say anything. Dad did all the talking. At least he and I agree. Dad believes Valerie should go talk this out with Colby, too. But I don\u2019t think she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Valerie now?\u201d Steffie asked.</p><p>Norah looked away. \u201cShe\u2019s upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d Her sister had been spending a lot of time alone in her room lately.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think you should go to her. Someone\u2019s got to. Valerie needs us, only she\u2019s so independent she doesn\u2019t know how to ask.\u201d</p><p>Steffie disagreed. Her sister was getting\u2014and apparently ignoring\u2014advice from just about everyone, when what she needed to do was listen to her own heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about you and Charles?\u201d Norah asked with open curiosity. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you even liked him.\u201d</p><p>In light of their recent confrontation over the newspaper article, it was natural for her sister to assume that.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is definitely an improvement,\u201d Norah muttered.</p><p>Eager to leave before Norah asked more questions, Steffie went upstairs to her room. She toyed with the idea of talking to her sister, of telling her that seeking a long-distance cure for a broken heart didn\u2019t work.</p><p>But Valerie was intelligent enough to make her own decisions, and Steffie didn\u2019t feel qualified to say or do any more than she already had.</p><p>She dressed in a bright blue suit for her trip to Portland, one Valerie would have approved of had she been home. Her sister had mysteriously disappeared without saying where she was headed.</p><p>Steffie was on her way out the door when her father stopped her. \u201cSit on the porch with me awhile, will you, Princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The wicker chair beside her father had belonged to her mother. Steffie sat next to him and gazed out over the sun-bright orchard she loved so much.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious about this\u2014getting a teaching position and all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can\u2019t stay home and do nothing. It\u2019d be a waste of my education.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, Princess.\u201d</p><p>All his talk of marriage was beginning to annoy her. \u201cBut, Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a couple of weeks. You\u2019ve been home such a short while\u2014 I don\u2019t want you to move away just yet. All I ask is that you delay a bit longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be moving out right away...\u201d She hesitated. She couldn\u2019t deny her father anything, and he knew it. \u201cTwo weeks,\u201d she promised reluctantly. \u201cWe\u2019ll visit, catch up, make some plans. Then I\u2019ll start looking for an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Charles coming for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d invited him, but he had a late-afternoon meeting and doubted he\u2019d be back in time.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to miss out on your Italian dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should fix a plate and take it into town for him. A bachelor like Charles doesn\u2019t often get the opportunity to enjoy a home-cooked dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to be doing just fine on his own,\u201d Steffie said, hiding a smile. Her father wasn\u2019t even trying to be subtle.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fine young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I think he\u2019s probably one of the most talented newsmen I\u2019ve ever read. To be honest, I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s still in Orchard Valley. I thought one of the big-city newspapers would\u2019ve lured him away long before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve tried, but Charles likes living here. He\u2019s turned down several job offers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d That he\u2019d received other offers didn\u2019t surprise Steffie, but that her father was privy to the information did. Then she remembered he and Charles had worked together on the farm-worker article.</p><p>\u201cI know Charles quite well,\u201d her father answered. \u201cWe\u2019ve become good friends the past few years.\u201d</p><p>Steffie crossed her legs. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten the two of you wrote that article.\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head. \u201cCharles wrote nearly every word of that story. All I did was get a few of the details for him and add a comment now and then, but that was it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe credits you with doing a lot more.\u201d</p><p>Her father was silent for a few minutes, reflective. Steffie wondered if he was worrying about Valerie the way Norah had been. She was about to say something when her father spoke.</p><p>\u201cCharles is going to make me a fine son-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Steffie closed her eyes, trying to control the burst of impatience his words produced.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, don\u2019t, please,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about Charles marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d he asked, sounding almost offended. \u201cWhy, Princess, he\u2019s loved you for years, only I was too blind to notice. I guess I had my head in the clouds, because it\u2019s as clear as rainwater to me now. Soon after you left for Italy, he started coming around, asking about you. Only...he was so subtle about it I didn\u2019t realize what he was doing until I saw the two of you together last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a clue, do you?\u201d her father said, chuckling and shaking his head. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you since I didn\u2019t guess it myself.\u201d</p><p>The way her father made it sound, Charles had spent the past three years pining away for her. Steffie knew that couldn\u2019t be true. He was the reason she\u2019d left. He\u2019d humiliated her, laughed at her.</p><p>\u201cWhen your mother said you\u2019d be marrying Charles\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, please.\u201d Steffie felt close to tears. \u201cI\u2019m not marrying Charles.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, eyes narrowed in concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Princess? You love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did...but that was a long time ago when I was young and very foolish.\u201d Her father had no way of knowing just how foolish she\u2019d been.</p><p>Even after the incident in Charles\u2019s home, when she\u2019d soaked in his tub until her skin resembled a raisin, she hadn\u2019t stopped. Some odd quirk of her nature refused to let her believe he didn\u2019t want her, not when she loved him so desperately.</p><p>Oh, no, she hadn\u2019t been willing to leave well enough alone. So she\u2019d plotted and planned his downfall.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>Leaving a message at the newspaper office that her father needed to see him right away, Steffie had waited in the stable for Charles\u2019s arrival. She\u2019d spread fresh hay in the first stall.</p><p>No one was home and she tacked a note on the front door directing Charles to the stable.</p><p>He\u2019d arrived right on time. She had to say that for him; he was punctual to a fault. He hesitated when he saw she was there alone, then asked to talk to her father. He kept his distance\u2014which might have had something to do with the pitchfork in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steffie had planned this meeting right down to the minutest detail. She\u2019d worn tight jeans and a checkered shirt, half unbuttoned and tied at her waist.</p><p>She remembered Charles repeating that he was anxious to talk to her father. Among other things, he\u2019d told her, he wanted to clear the air about what was happening between him and Steffie.</p><p>At the time she\u2019d nearly laughed out loud. Nothing was happening, despite her best efforts.</p><p>Steffie remembered again how perfect her timing had been. As she was chatting with him, explaining that she wasn\u2019t sure where her father had gone, she set aside the pitchfork and started up the ladder that led to the loft. At precisely the right moment, she lost her balance, just as she\u2019d planned. After teetering for a second, she dropped into Charles\u2019s arms.</p> <p>He broke her fall, but the impact of her weight slamming against him had taken them both to the floor, and into the fresh hay. For a moment, neither said a word.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d He spoke first, his voice low and angry.</p><p>Steffie had never been more \u201call right\u201d in her life. For the first time she was in Charles\u2019s arms and he held on to her as though he never intended to let her go, as though this was exactly where he\u2019d always wanted her to be.</p><p>Steffie had gazed down on him and slowly shaken her head. His gaze had gone to her parted lips and then his hands were in her hair and with a groan he\u2019d guided her mouth to his. The kiss was wild, crazily intense. No man had ever kissed her with such hunger or need. Steffie didn\u2019t understand what she was feeling; all she knew was that she wanted Charles more than she\u2019d ever wanted anything. So she\u2019d done what came instinctively. She\u2019d kissed him back with the same searing hunger, until it seemed neither of them would be able to endure the intensity any longer.</p><p>Steffie would never forget how he\u2019d rolled away from her, bounding effortlessly to his feet, breathing hard.</p> <p>At first he\u2019d said nothing. Steffie knew she\u2019d have to speak first. So she\u2019d looked up at him and said what had been on her heart from the moment they\u2019d met. She\u2019d told him simply, honestly, how much she loved him.</p><p>Steffie would forever remember what happened next.</p><p>Charles had stared down at her in silence for several heart-stopping seconds, and then he\u2019d begun to laugh. Deep belly laughs, as though she\u2019d said the funniest thing he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>She was exactly what he needed, he\u2019d said with a twinge of sarcasm\u2014a lovesick girl running after him. How many times did he have to tell her he wasn\u2019t interested? When he was ready for a woman in his life, he wanted exactly that, a woman, not a child. Especially not one as immature as she was.</p><p>He\u2019d said more, but by then Steffie was running toward the house, tears streaking her face. The sound of his laughter had followed her, taunting her, ridiculing her.</p><p>\u201cCharles has loved you all these years,\u201d her father said now. He spoke confidently, crashing into her memories and dragging her back to the present. The past was so painful that Steffie was content to leave it behind.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s never loved me,\u201d she whispered through a haze of remembered pain.</p><p>\u201cAh, my sweet Princess,\u201d her father countered. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cDad, listen to me.\u201d Steffie stood, turning her head for fear her father would see the tears glistening in her eyes. \u201cWhatever you do, please don\u2019t say anything to Charles about\u2014you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing in love with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cbut I\u2019m particularly concerned about this marriage thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat worries you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, it worries me a great deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand, do you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad, you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteffie, my Princess, don\u2019t limit yourself to the things you understand,\u201d her father said in the gentlest voice imaginable, \u201cotherwise you\u2019ll miss half of what life has to offer.\u201d</p><p>She had to leave, had to escape before she dissolved into an emotional storm of tears. Not until she was in the car, heading she didn\u2019t know where, did she realize her father hadn\u2019t promised one way or the other. He might well blurt everything to Charles.</p><p>By the time Steffie had reached Orchard Valley, she\u2019d composed herself. She\u2019d do her errands\u2014pick up dry cleaning, visit the small local library, mail a birthday card to little Mario in Italy\u2014before she drove to Portland. Because it was Saturday, Main Street was busy and she was fortunate to find a parking spot. Not so fortunate as she would have liked, however, since the only available space was directly in front of the newspaper office.</p><p>For at least ten minutes, Steffie sat in the family station wagon, considering whether to talk to Charles herself. Should she warn him about her father\u2019s crazy dream, his matchmaking hopes?</p><p>She was still debating the issue when she saw him, talking to the girl at the front desk. Her heart gladdened at the mere sight of him. He\u2019d removed his suit jacket and the sleeves of his white shirt were rolled halfway up his arms. He was so attractive, so compelling. For several minutes she watched him, mesmerized.</p><p>At first glance, Steffie thought Charles might have been talking to Norah, but that was impossible. The resemblance was there, though. This young woman was blonde and exceptionally pretty. Even from inside her car, Steffie could see how she gazed up at Charles with wide, adoring eyes.</p><p>The dread that went through her was immediate and unstoppable. She was jealous, and she hated it. The blonde was probably Wendy, the apprentice Charles had mentioned, and Steffie didn\u2019t doubt for an instant that she was in love with him. Not that Steffie blamed her; she\u2019d once played the role of doting female herself. Was playing it even now, despite her most strenuous efforts.</p><p>Charles was still talking to his intern, his hand resting against the back of her chair. He leaned forward as the two of them reviewed something, their heads close together. The blonde laughed at some remark of his and smiled up at him, her heart in her eyes.</p><p>Steffie couldn\u2019t watch any more. It was like looking back several years and seeing what a fool she\u2019d made of herself. Hurriedly she got out of the car and swung her purse over her shoulder. Forcing her eyes away from the newspaper office, she locked the car door. She was about to walk down the street when Charles stepped onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cStephanie, hello.\u201d He sounded surprised to see her. More than that, he sounded pleased.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she returned awkwardly, feeling guilty, although she wasn\u2019t sure why. It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d actually been spying on him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d he asked, giving her business suit an appreciative glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I was thinking about driving into Portland and visiting the university after I do some errands here. I plan eventually to rent an apartment in the city, but Dad...\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>Charles grinned knowingly. \u201cBut your father wasn\u2019t delighted with the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I promised him I\u2019d wait another couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy two weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d For a few seconds, she panicked, wondering if Charles had guessed, wondering if her father had mentioned his dream, praying he hadn\u2019t. \u201cIt seemed like a reasonable compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got a moment? I\u2019d like you to meet Wendy. She\u2019s the intern I was telling you about. Bart\u2019s here, as well. You remember Bart, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Steffie bit her lip, feeling reluctant. The last time she\u2019d been to the newspaper office she\u2019d come bent on vengeance, with threats of a lawsuit burning in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll throw in lunch. I\u2019ve got an appointment at one, but it\u2019s barely twelve now.\u201d</p><p>She was still caught in the throes of indecision, when Charles took her firmly by the elbow and escorted her inside. She felt a wave of relief; after all, the opportunity to spend time with him, even a few minutes squeezed in between appointments, was too precious to decline.</p><p>It might have been Steffie\u2019s imagination, but the people in the newspaper office seemed delighted to see her. She wondered what Charles could possibly have said to salvage her reputation.</p><p>A couple of the reporters, one of whom she remembered from high school, welcomed her back to Orchard Valley. Bart, the pressman, inquired about her father\u2019s health. Even Wendy seemed inclined to like her, which raised Steffie\u2019s guilt by several uncomfortable notches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back at one,\u201d Charles said as he guided Steffie out the front door.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Bart stopped abruptly when Charles cut him off with a glare.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here in plenty of time,\u201d he promised. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d he asked, smiling down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s most convenient for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Half Moon\u2019s serving sandwiches now. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d When Steffie left for Italy, the Half Moon, just down the street from the Clarion, had been a small coffee shop.</p><p>Now she saw that it had been expanded and modernized. While Charles placed their order, Steffie found them a table. Several customers, old acquaintances, greeted her and asked about her father, and before she realized it, she was completely at ease, laughing and joking with the people around her.</p><p>When Charles returned with their turkey-and-tomato sandwiches and coffee, she smiled at him happily, content to shed the troubled thoughts she\u2019d carried into town with her. At least for the moment...</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your father this morning?\u201d Charles asked, holding his sandwich with both hands to keep bits of tomato and lettuce from escaping.</p><p>\u201cCantankerous as ever.\u201d Opinionated, too, and occasionally illogical, but she didn\u2019t say any of that. Even if she decided to warn Charles, now didn\u2019t seem to be the time. Not when they were sitting across from each other, relaxed and lighthearted, and all the world felt right.</p><p>The hour passed quickly. This kind of pure, simple happiness never lasted, she told herself. But, oh, how she wished it could. Charles seemed equally reluctant for their visit to end.</p><p>Steffie walked back to work with him. \u201cThanks for lunch,\u201d she said, standing on the sidewalk in front of the office.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d Charles promised as Bart came out, looking anxiously at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d Charles told him, a bit impatiently. He turned back to Steffie. \u201cSometime tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She nodded eagerly.</p><p>Sometime tomorrow. A few short hours and yet it felt like a lifetime away.</p><p>Valerie was leaving.</p><p>Steffie did try talking to her. She\u2019d tried to explain that running away from love wouldn\u2019t help; it would just follow her wherever she went. Her sister had listened, then quietly packed her bags.</p><p>Sunday morning, when Valerie was about to go, Colby showed up unexpectedly. Steffie was thrilled; it was as if everything she\u2019d read about the power of love, everything she\u2019d always secretly believed, was true. Colby would prove it. He\u2019d come to declare his love and sweep Valerie off her feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It soon became clear, however, that Colby wasn\u2019t there because of Valerie. He hadn\u2019t known she was catching a flight that afternoon, and when he heard, he seemed to accept it as inevitable. Furthermore, he had no intention of stopping her. No intention of asking her to stay. If anything, he seemed almost relieved at her imminent departure.</p><p>When the moment came for Valerie to go, Steffie thought she might burst into tears herself. She\u2019d so desperately wanted to believe in the power of love, in its ability to knock down barriers and leap over obstacles.</p><p>Valerie hugged them all farewell, and with shoulders held stiff and straight, walked from the porch to her rental car. Then, just before she left, she turned and looked at Colby.</p><p>Steffie would always remember the tenderness she saw in her sister\u2019s eyes. It was as though she\u2019d reached back, one last time, to say goodbye...and to thank him. At least, that was how it seemed to Steffie. She\u2019d never been so affected by a mere glance. That look of Valerie\u2019s was full of love, but it also expressed dignity and a gracious acceptance.</p> <p>Steffie was trying to sort out her mingled emotions of anger and pain as Valerie drove away. She turned to Colby, who still stared after her sister\u2019s car. It took every ounce of self-control she had not to scream at him. Only the anguish in his eyes prevented her from lashing out, and when she recognized the intensity of his pain, her own anger was replaced by a bleak hopelessness.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be back,\u201d her father said with the same unquestioning confidence that had driven Steffie nearly mad with frustration.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, her voice quavering. \u201cShe won\u2019t. Not for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>Then, unable to face either Colby or her father, she dashed back into the house. Norah followed soon afterward, and Steffie realized that her younger sister was crying.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to marry Rowdy Cassidy,\u201d Norah wailed. \u201cWhat\u2019s so terrible is that she doesn\u2019t even love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what makes you think Valerie would do anything so foolish?\u201d Steffie asked calmly. Valerie might be unhappy about losing Colby Winston, but she was too sensible to enter into a loveless marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Norah said as she continued to sob. \u201cHe\u2019s in love with her. He\u2019s called nearly every day and sent flowers and...and Valerie\u2019s so vulnerable right now. I just know she\u2019s going to make a terrible mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVal\u2019s not going to do anything stupid,\u201d Steffie reassured her sister. Valerie wouldn\u2019t marry her boss on the rebound\u2014Steffie was confident of that. Deep down, she knew exactly what her sister would be doing for the next three years\u2014if not longer. She knew because she\u2019d done it herself. Valerie would try to escape into her work, to the exclusion of everything else. Because then she wouldn\u2019t have time to hurt, time to deal with regrets and might-have-beens. She wouldn\u2019t have time to look back or relive the memories.</p><p>An hour later, Steffie took a glass of iced tea out to her father, who stubbornly refused to leave the porch. He sat in his rocking chair, anxiously studying the road. \u201cThey\u2019ll both be back,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t try to disillusion him. By nightfall he\u2019d be forced to accept the truth without her prompting.</p> <p>Within ten minutes of Valerie\u2019s departure, Colby had left, too. He hadn\u2019t raced down the driveway in hot pursuit or given the slightest indication that he was going anywhere but back to town.</p><p>\u201cMark my words,\u201d her father said confidently. \u201cValerie and Colby will be married before the end of June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you and Charles will follow a few weeks later. All three of my daughters are going to be married this summer. I know it in my heart, as surely as I know my own name.\u201d</p><p>Although she nearly choked, Steffie swallowed her words of argument.</p><p>Needing some physical activity to vent her frustrations, she saddled Princess. She knew better than to try her luck with Fury again. But the mare, who was generally docile, seemed to sense Steffie\u2019s mood and galloped down the long pasture road and across the rocky field until they reached the bluff. The same place Fury had taken her.</p><p>Holding the reins, Steffie slid off the mare\u2019s back and sat on the very rock she had before. She lost track of time as she sat looking out on the valley, thinking about Valerie. And Colby. Remembering her own disastrous relationship with Charles, and how her willful behavior had destroyed any chance they\u2019d had three years ago. Now there seemed to be a fresh beginning for her and Charles, however fragile it might be. Not for Valerie, though... Life wasn\u2019t fair, she thought, and love didn\u2019t make everything perfect.</p><p>She rode slowly back and had just finished rubbing down Princess and leading her into her stall when Charles appeared. \u201cI thought I heard someone here.\u201d He stood by the stable door, hands on his hips, smiling.</p> <p>\u201cCharles.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have been so surprised to see him. After all, he\u2019d made a point of telling her he\u2019d be in touch.</p><p>\u201cYour dad figured you\u2019d gone out riding, but he seemed to think you\u2019d be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been waiting long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Your father\u2019s kept me entertained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still on the front porch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t moved since I got here.\u201d</p><p>Dispirited, Steffie looked away. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was afraid of. Valerie\u2019s gone, and he seems to believe she\u2019ll come back if he sits there long enough.\u201d</p><p>Charles frowned heavily. \u201cIs something going on? A problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered quickly, perhaps too quickly because Charles\u2019s eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cI mean, nothing you need to worry about. Dad desperately wants to believe Colby and Val will kiss and make up\u2014that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s being so stubborn. By dinnertime he\u2019ll have to recognize that it simply isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>It might\u2019ve been because she was nervous and flustered, or maybe she just wasn\u2019t watching where she was going, but Steffie tripped over a bale of hay.</p><p>Although she threw out her arms in an effort to right herself, it was too late. She fell forward, but before she completely lost her balance, Charles caught her around the waist. He twisted his body so that when they went down, he took the brunt of the fall.</p><p>It was as though the years had evaporated. They\u2019d been in virtually the same position on that previous occasion, with Steffie sprawled over him, her heart pounding. Only this time she hadn\u2019t manipulated the circumstances. This time she wasn\u2019t in control.</p><p>They were both breathing hard. A tumult of confused emotions raged within her, and she braced her arms against him, ready to get up and move away. Instead, his arms, which were around her waist, held her firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we\u2019ve been here before,\u201d he said, his eyes gazing into hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened that day?\u201d</p><p>Incapable of speaking, she nodded again.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the way we kissed?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him, couldn\u2019t allow him to read the answer in her eyes.</p><p>He held her fast for another long moment before he gradually eased his hold. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. The instant she was free, she rushed to her feet, not realizing she must have sprained her ankle. But when she placed her weight on her left foot she experienced a sharp stabbing pain. She couldn\u2019t suppress a whimper as she leaned against the stall door for support.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Charles said, immediately getting to his feet. He slipped his arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ve just twisted my ankle\u2014it hardly hurts at all,\u201d she lied.</p><p>Without another word, Charles effortlessly scooped her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCharles, please,\u201d she said, growing angry. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine. It\u2019s a minor sprain, nothing more. There\u2019s no need for this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply but began to carry her out of the stable.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen. You should put ice on it right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to know I don\u2019t appreciate these caveman tactics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d He was short of breath by the time he reached the back door, which infuriated Steffie even more. \u201cPut me down this instant,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d He managed, after some difficulty, to open the door, then deposited her unceremoniously in a chair\u2014like a sack of flour, she thought with irritation. He was pulling open the freezer section of the refrigerator and removing the ice-cube tray.</p><p>She rested her sore foot on her opposite knee and was about to remove her shoe when he stopped her. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles, you\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but carefully drew off her shoe and sock. His fingers were tender as he examined her ankle, and it felt strangely intimate to have him touch her like this.</p><p>\u201cI told you already\u2014it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore,\u201d she argued. \u201cI might have gotten up too fast or put my foot down wrong. I don\u2019t feel a thing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry standing up.\u201d</p><p>Cautiously she did. His arm circled her waist as she gingerly placed her weight on the foot. \u201cSee,\u201d she said, feeling both triumphant and foolish. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure. Try walking.\u201d</p><p>The floor felt cool against her bare foot as she took a guarded first step. There was barely a twinge. She tried again. Same result. \u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d And she proceeded to prove it by marching around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Charles replaced the ice-cube tray in the freezer, but he was frowning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so disappointed,\u201d she teased as she pulled on her sock and shoe.</p><p>He glanced at her, then smiled slowly, sensually. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of some inventive ways to avoid kissing a man, but...\u201d He let the rest fade as he sat down beside her, then pulled her chair toward him until they sat face to face, so close their knees touched.</p><p>Steffie shut her eyes as his hands came to rest on her shoulders. His breathing grew ragged and he whispered her name. \u201cStephanie,\u201d he said, leaning forward to touch her lips with his own.</p><p>Steffie was afraid\u2014of his kiss and of her own response. But she felt a thrill of excitement, too. He must have sensed that, because the quality of his kiss changed from gentle caress to fierce desire.</p><p>Charles groaned, and she slid her hands up his chest, delighting in the feel of hard, smooth muscles as she gave herself fully to his kiss.</p><p>Suddenly he broke away, his shoulders heaving. Steffie let her eyes flutter open and for a long silent moment they stared at each other.</p><p>His hand reached out to touch her hair, a small, intimate gesture that moved her unbearably.</p><p>Then he stretched out his arms, clasping her by the waist and lifting her from the chair to set her securely in his lap. She wasn\u2019t given the opportunity to protest before his mouth claimed hers once more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This time his kiss was slow and gentle, as tender as the earlier kiss had been hungry and demanding. She felt herself melting in his arms, surrendering the last of her resistance.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about what happened,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She knew what he meant, and she wanted none of it. That scene in the stable\u2014the fall she\u2019d faked\u2014was much too embarrassing to examine even now. \u201cThat was in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be settled between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, trying to change his mind with a deep, hungry kiss.</p><p>His voice was rough when she finished. \u201cSteff, we have to clear the past before we can talk about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only just met, remember?\u201d He was the one who\u2019d suggested they start over. He couldn\u2019t bury the past and then ask that they exhume it.</p><p>\u201cJust listen to me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she pleaded. Maybe never, her heart whispered, balking at the idea of reliving a time that had been so painful for her.</p> <p>\u201cSoon.\u201d He tangled his fingers in her hair and spread kisses across her face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she agreed reluctantly.</p><p>The sound of laughter broke into the haze of her pleasure. At least Steffie assumed it was laughter. It took her a wild moment to realize the sound was coming from the porch, and that it must be her father. Not knowing what to think, she slowly broke away from Charles.</p><p>\u201cIs that David laughing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Steffie shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d better find out if something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and they walked hand in hand to the porch.</p> <p>\u201cDad?\u201d she asked softly when she saw her father, rocking contentedly. His smile broadened when he noticed her and Charles. His gaze fell to their hands, which were still clasped tightly together, and his eyes fairly twinkled. \u201cCheck the freezer, will you? By heaven, I wish I\u2019d thought of this sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe freezer?\u201d she repeated, glancing at Charles, wondering if her father had lost his wits. \u201cWhy do you want me to check it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need something special to fix for dinner tonight. We\u2019re going to have a celebration!\u201d</p><p>Steffie frowned in puzzlement. \u201cWhat kind of celebration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a wedding in the family.\u201d</p><p>Steffie groaned inwardly. \u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, Princess, there isn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Dad...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee there?\u201d he said, pointing toward the long stretch of driveway. \u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d</p><p>Steffie looked, but she couldn\u2019t see anything except a small puff of dust, barely discernible against the skyline.</p><p>\u201cI was about to give up on those two,\u201d he said with a wry chuckle. \u201cThey\u2019re both too stubborn for their own good. I have to admit they gave me pause, but your mother was right. Guess I shouldn\u2019t have doubted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister and Colby. They\u2019re on their way back to the house now.\u201d</p><p>Steffie glanced up again, and this time the make and color of the car was unmistakable. Colby was returning to the house. And although she couldn\u2019t clearly tell who the passenger was, she knew it had to be her sister.</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cEven now I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Valerie said wistfully, sitting cross-legged on her bed. Steffie and Norah lounged on the opposite end, listening.</p><p>\u201cColby actually chased you down on the freeway?\u201d Norah wanted to know.</p><p>Valerie\u2019s smile lit up her whole face as she nodded. \u201cIt really was romantic to have him race after me. He told me he didn\u2019t realize he was planning to do it until he was on the interstate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got everything worked out?\u201d Steffie asked. From what Norah had told her, and from remarks Valerie herself had made, she knew there were a lot of obstacles standing in the way of this marriage.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked things out the best we can. It\u2019s been a struggle to come up with the right compromises. I\u2019ve got a call in to Rowdy Cassidy at CHIPS. I think I can talk him into letting me open a branch of the company in Oregon. He\u2019s already done a feasibility study for the Pacific Northwest. He was just waiting until he could find the right person to head it up. He didn\u2019t originally have me in mind, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have a problem giving it to me. Then again\u2014\u201d she paused thoughtfully \u201c\u2014it may be better to discuss this in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby doesn\u2019t mind if you continue working?\u201d Norah\u2019s voice was tinged with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cNo. Because it\u2019s what I need. Naturally he\u2019d rather I was there to pamper him when he gets home from the hospital every night, but this way we\u2019ll learn to pamper each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d Steffie leaned forward to hug her sister. Valerie\u2019s eyes reflected an inner joy that Steffie had never seen in her before. This was what love\u2014real love\u2014did for a person. When two people cared this deeply for each other, it couldn\u2019t help but show.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve decided to go ahead with the wedding, Colby wants to do it as soon as possible,\u201d Valerie went on to say. \u201cI hope everyone\u2019s willing to work fast and hard because we\u2019ve got a wedding to plan for next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext month!\u201d Norah\u2019s blue eyes widened incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI was lucky to get him to wait that long. Colby would rather we flew to Vegas tonight and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d was Norah and Steffie\u2019s automatic response.</p><p>\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be the sentimental sort,\u201d Valerie admitted sheepishly, \u201cbut I actually want a large fancy wedding. Colby loves me enough to agree, as long as I organize it quickly. Once that man makes a decision, there\u2019s no holding him back.\u201d</p><p>Steffie smiled to herself. Dr. Colby Winston was in for a real surprise. Valerie was talented enough in the organizational department to manage the United Nations. If he gave her a month to arrange their wedding, she\u2019d do a beautiful job of it with time to spare.</p><p>A wedding so soon meant the family was about to be caught up in a whirlwind of activity, but that suited Steffie. It was time for them to celebrate. The grieving, the anxiety, were over.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing a lot of Charles lately, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Norah asked, looking expectantly at Steffie. \u201cDo you think we could make this a double wedding?\u201d</p><p>Valerie smiled broadly at Steffie, as though she\u2019d be in favor of the idea, too.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been seeing that much of Charles,\u201d Steffie answered, thrusting out her chin. She realized she sounded defensive. \u201cWell, I\u2014I suppose we have been together quite a bit lately, but there\u2019s certainly never been any talk of marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Charles,\u201d Norah said, studying Steffie closely. \u201cI mean, I could go for this guy, given the least bit of encouragement. First Valerie falls in love and now you. You know, it\u2019s a little unfair. I\u2019m the one who lives at home and you two fly in and within a few weeks nab the two most eligible men in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Steffie argued. \u201cYou make it sound like a done deal. Trust me, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him,\u201d Valerie said quietly. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t reply. She was unwilling to openly admit her feelings for Charles. It would be so easy to fool herself into believing he held the same tenderness for her. But he\u2019d never said so, and other than a few shared kisses he hadn\u2019t given her any indication he cared.</p><p>But he had, something inside her said.</p><p>Steffie refused to listen. She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, forget that she\u2019d made a fool of herself over him, not once but three times. Because she\u2019d cared, and he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how Charles feels about me,\u201d Steffie said in a soft steady voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d Norah exclaimed.</p><p>And Valerie added, \u201cSteffie, it\u2019s obvious how he feels.\u201d</p><p>Steffie discounted their assurances with a shrug. \u201cFor all I know, he could be hanging around me in order to get close to Norah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles? No way.\u201d Both Valerie and Norah burst into loud peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you wouldn\u2019t mind me dating him?\u201d Norah teased, winking at Valerie.</p><p>\u201cFeel free.\u201d In fact, Steffie would throttle Norah if she went within ten feet of Charles, though she could hardly say so.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re joking,\u201d Norah said, shaking her head. \u201cI should\u2019ve seen what was going on a long time ago. I don\u2019t know how I could\u2019ve been so dense. Charles and Dad became friends shortly after you left\u2014good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean a thing,\u201d Steffie insisted. She didn\u2019t need anyone else building up her hopes, and although her sisters meant well, their encouragement would only make her disappointment harder to bear.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t mean much if Charles hadn\u2019t made a point of asking about you every time he stopped by,\u201d Norah was saying. \u201cI have to hand it to the guy, though\u2014he was always subtle about his questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, whenever I talked to Charles, Steffie\u2019s name cropped up in the conversation,\u201d Valerie reported thoughtfully. \u201cI should have guessed myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too involved with Colby to see anything else,\u201d Norah teased and then sighed. She crossed her arms and rested them atop her bent knees. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy for you two, but I wish I\u2019d fall in love. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s my turn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you leaping to conclusions here?\u201d Steffie asked. She wasn\u2019t exactly sporting an engagement ring the way Valerie was. She and Charles hadn\u2019t arrived at that stage of commitment\u2014and probably never would. Besides, her past mistakes with him had been the result of leaping to certain incorrect conclusions about his feelings, and she wasn\u2019t ready for a repeat performance.</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t see Charles again until Tuesday afternoon. She wasn\u2019t surprised not to hear from him, knowing how involved he was with the production of the paper during the first part of every week.</p><p>Valerie and Steffie had driven into town to visit The Petal Pusher, the local flower shop. Valerie had decided on a spring color theme for her wedding and had already chosen material for Steffie\u2019s and Norah\u2019s gowns in a pale shade of green and a delicate rose.</p><p>Valerie angled the car into the slot closest to the flower shop. Since the newspaper office was almost directly across the street, it was natural for her to glance curiously in that direction.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to Charles in a couple of days, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy with the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s time to stop in now and say hello if you want. I\u2019ll be talking to the florist, so you might as well.\u201d</p><p>Steffie was tempted, but felt uncomfortable about interrupting Charles at work. \u201cSome other time,\u201d she said with a feigned lack of interest, though in actuality she was starving for the sight of him. Helping Valerie plan her wedding had forced some long-buried emotions to the surface. Steffie hadn\u2019t admitted until these past few weeks how deeply she longed for marriage herself. A family of her own. A husband to love and live with her whole life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A husband.</p><p>Her mind stumbled over the word. There\u2019d only ever been one man she could imagine as her husband, and that was Charles. Even though Steffie knew it was unwise, she\u2019d started dreaming again. She found herself fantasizing what her life would be like if she was married...to Charles. She wanted to blame her sisters for putting such thoughts in her head, but she couldn\u2019t. Those dreams and fantasies had been there for years. The problem was that she couldn\u2019t suppress them anymore.</p><p>An hour later, at the same moment as Steffie and Valerie were leaving the flower shop, Charles happened to step out of the Clarion office.</p><p>Steffie instinctively looked across the street, where he was walking with Wendy, deep in conversation. Something must have told him she was there because he glanced in her direction. He grinned warmly.</p> <p>Steffie relaxed and waved. He returned the gesture, then spoke to Wendy before jogging across the street to join Steffie and her sister.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he said, but his eyes lingered on Steffie. He barely seemed to notice Valerie\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d It was ridiculous to feel so shy with him. \u201cI\u2019d have stopped in to say hello, but I knew you\u2019d be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never too busy for you.\u201d His eyes were affectionate and welcoming.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d Valerie hissed close to Steffie\u2019s ear. Then, more loudly, \u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of errands to run, if you two would like a chance to talk.\u201d</p> <p>Charles checked his watch. \u201cCome back to the office with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d If he\u2019d suggested they stand on their heads in the middle of Main Street, Steffie would have willingly agreed.</p><p>Valerie cast a quick glance at the clock tower. \u201cHow about if I meet you back at the car in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour,\u201d Charles supplied, reaching for Steffie\u2019s hand. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019d like to show you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll see you then, Steff,\u201d Valerie said cheerfully. She set off at a brisk walk, without looking back.</p><p>Their fingers entwined, Charles led Steffie across the street to the newspaper office. \u201cI was going to save this for later, but now\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d He ushered her in and guided her down the center aisle, past the obviously busy staff, to his desk.</p> <p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but a mock-up of the Clarion\u2019s second page wasn\u2019t it. As far as she could see, it was the same as any other inside page she\u2019d read over the years.</p><p>\u201cClearly I\u2019m missing something,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cIs the type different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, we\u2019ve used the same fonts as always.\u201d He crossed his arms and leaned against the desk, looking exceptionally pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cHow about a hint?\u201d she asked, a bit puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI might suggest you read the masthead,\u201d he said next, his dark eyes gleaming.</p><p>\u201cThe masthead,\u201d she repeated as she scanned the listings of the newspaper\u2019s personnel and the duties they performed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will. Charles Tomaselli, editor and publisher. Roger Simons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d he said, holding up his hand.</p> <p>\u201cPublisher,\u201d she said again. \u201cThat\u2019s new. What exactly does it mean?\u201d</p><p>His smile could have lit up a Christmas tree. \u201cIt means, my beautiful Stephanie, that I now own the Orchard Valley Clarion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharles, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d She resisted the urge to throw her arms around him, but it was difficult.</p><p>\u201cMy dream\u2019s got a mortgage attached,\u201d he told her wryly. \u201cA lot of folks think I\u2019m an idiot to risk so much of my future on a medium that\u2019s said to be dying. Newspapers are folding all over the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Clarion won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to spill over with joy. She knew how much Charles loved his work, how committed he was to the community. \u201cI\u2019m so excited about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said, his smile boyishly proud. \u201cI\u2019d say this calls for a celebration, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost definitely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>She nodded eagerly and they set the date for Thursday evening, deciding on a restaurant that overlooked the Columbia River Gorge, about an hour\u2019s drive north.</p><p>Steffie felt as if her feet didn\u2019t touch the pavement as she hurried across the street thirty minutes later to meet her sister. Never, in all the time she\u2019d known Charles, had she seen him happier. And she was happy with him, and for him. That was what loving someone meant. It was a truth she hadn\u2019t really understood before, not until today. This intense new feeling had taught her that real love wasn\u2019t prideful or selfish. Real love meant sharing the happiness\u2014and the sorrows\u2014of the person you loved. Yes, she understood that now. She realized that her past obsession with Charles had focused more on her own desires than on his. Her love had matured.</p><p>Charles had wakened within her emotions she hadn\u2019t known it was possible to experience. Emotions\u2014and sensations. When she was with him, especially when he kissed her, she felt vibrant and alive.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to cry, you\u2019re so happy,\u201d Valerie said when Steffie joined her in the car. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose Charles popped the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cBut he asked me to dinner to help him celebrate. Guess what? Charles is the new owner of the Clarion.\u201d</p><p>Valerie didn\u2019t seem nearly as excited as Steffie. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be working a lot of extra hours then, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d If he spent as much time at the newspaper as he had three years earlier, there wouldn\u2019t be any extra hours left.</p><p>\u201cI suppose his eating habits are atrocious.\u201d</p><p>Steffie suspected they were, but she shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019d enjoy a home-cooked meal every now and then, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Steffie eyed her sister suspiciously. \u201cIs there a point to this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she answered with a sly grin. \u201cI think you should heat up some of that fabulous spaghetti sauce and take it to him later. You know what they say about the way to a man\u2019s heart, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, that sounds exactly like a suggestion of Dad\u2019s. What\u2019s your interest in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Valerie said coyly, \u201cthat way I wouldn\u2019t feel guilty about asking you if I could take some to Colby\u2019s. If he tasted your spaghetti sauce and happened to assume, through no error of mine, that I\u2019d cooked this fabulous dinner\u2014\u201d she paused to inhale deeply \u201c\u2014he\u2019d be so overcome by the idea of marrying such a fabulous cook that he\u2019d go over the wedding list with me and not put it off for the third time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s method in your madness, Valerie Bloomfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. Colby doesn\u2019t know that I can\u2019t tell one side of a cookie sheet from the other. I don\u2019t want to disillusion him quite so soon. He suggested I make dinner tonight and, well, you get the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do indeed. I\u2019ll be happy to share the spaghetti sauce with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hang around the kitchen to be sure some of the aroma sticks to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the recipe if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want, but if I have trouble cooking with a microwave, heaven only knows what I\u2019ll do once I\u2019m around a stove. One with burners and a real oven.\u201d</p><p>Steffie chuckled. She certainly had no objection to helping her sister prepare dinner for Colby, but she wasn\u2019t sure taking a plate over to Charles\u2019s house was such a good plan.</p><p>Valerie and Norah convinced her otherwise.</p><p>\u201cCharles never did get to sample your cooking,\u201d Norah reminded her. \u201cHe stopped by and you offered him dinner, but he\u2019d already eaten. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>Norah looked mildly surprised, as though everyone must be aware of what went on between Steffie and Charles. \u201cDad told me.\u201d</p><p>Her dear, matchmaking father. Steffie should have known.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to hurt anything,\u201d Valerie reminded her. \u201cIf you want, you can ride into town with me. I\u2019ll go over to Charles\u2019s house with you and we can drop off the meal, then I\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>Steffie still wasn\u2019t sure, but Norah and Valerie believed it was a romantic thing to do. They both seemed to think Charles was serious about their relationship.</p><p>As for Steffie, she didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. In fact, she preferred not to think about their relationship at all. And yet...</p><p>She remained hesitant about this project of delivering him a surprise dinner but Valerie and Norah were so certain it would be a success that she went ahead with it.</p><p>They were apparently right.</p><p>She\u2019d found his door open\u2014that hadn\u2019t changed, she thought with a twinge of embarrassment\u2014and had left a container of the sauce, some noodles with instructions and a couple of last-minute extras on his kitchen table.</p><p>Steffie was propped up in her bed reading a new mystery novel at ten-thirty that night. Her bedroom window was open and a breeze whispered through the orchard. The house was quiet; her father had gone to bed an hour earlier, and her sisters were both out for the evening.</p><p>When the phone chimed, she answered on the first ring, not wanting it to wake her father.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you do it?\u201d Charles asked, sounding thoroughly delighted. \u201cI came home exhausted and hungry, thinking I was going to have to throw something in the microwave for dinner. The minute I walked into the house, I smelled this heavenly scent of basil and garlic. I followed my nose to the table and found your note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should thank Valerie and Norah. The whole thing was their idea.\u201d Had he been furious, Steffie would gladly have shifted the blame, so she figured it was only right to share the credit.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t tasted spaghetti that good since my grandmother died. I\u2019d forgotten how delicious homemade sauce can be.\u201d</p><p>Steffie was warmed by the compliment. \u201cI\u2019m glad you enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnjoyed it! You have no idea. It was like stepping back into my childhood to spend the evening with my grandmother. She was a fabulous cook, and so are you.\u201d</p><p>Steffie leaned against the heap of pillows and closed her eyes, savoring these precious moments.</p><p>\u201cThe bottle of red wine and the small loaf of French bread were a nice touch,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said again. A dozen unnamed emotions whirled inside her.</p><p>\u201cI wish you didn\u2019t live so far out of town,\u201d Charles said next. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d come over right now\u2014to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t live so far out, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re both making wishes, there are a few other things I\u2019d like, as well,\u201d he added in tones as smooth as velvet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re limited to three.\u201d How raspy her own voice sounded.</p><p>Charles chuckled. \u201cOnly three? What happens if I want four?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I seem to remember reading about a handsome young newsman who was turned into a frog because he got greedy about wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many have I got left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll choose carefully.

Fury and Princess will be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d he murmured. Steffie could picture him sprawled comfortably on his sofa, talking to her, a glass of wine in his hand.</p><p>\u201cBe warned, you have only one wish left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me a moment\u2014I want to make this good. I\u2019ve had two glasses of wine and in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m feeling kind of mellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d She smiled to herself.</p><p>\u201cKnow what I\u2019d like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cWith my last wish, I\u2019d like to wipe out the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s easy,\u201d she said, and even though he couldn\u2019t see her, she made a sweeping motion with her hand. \u201cThere. It\u2019s gone, forgotten, never to be discussed again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-oh. I think I made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sweep it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked, striving for a flippant air. \u201cIt was one of your wishes, and it\u2019s in my power to grant it, so I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want it wiped out completely. Let\u2019s talk about it now, Stephanie, get this over with once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Steffie\u2019s heart jolted. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s gone, vanished. I haven\u2019t a clue what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Willfully she lowered her voice, half pleading with him, not wanting anything to ruin these moments.</p><p>The silence stretched between them. \u201cYou\u2019re right, this isn\u2019t something we can discuss over the phone. Certainly not when I\u2019m half drunk and you\u2019re so far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d Charles told her, and she could hear the satisfaction in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m so exhausted I\u2019m dead on my feet, and at the same time I feel so elated I want to take you in my arms and whirl you around the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never once mentioned buying the paper.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean it as a criticism. But he\u2019d managed to keep it a secret not only from her, but from just about everyone in town. When Steffie had mentioned Charles\u2019s news to her father, he\u2019d been as pleasantly surprised as she.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t, but believe me, I was dying to tell you. Negotiations can be tricky. I was prohibited from saying anything until I\u2019d reached an agreement with Dalton Publishing and the financing had been arranged.\u201d</p><p>Steffie snuggled down against her pillows. \u201cSo much is happening in our lives. First there was Dad\u2019s heart attack, and now Valerie\u2019s wedding. Oh, Charles, I wish you were here to see Valerie. I didn\u2019t know anything in the world could fluster my sister, but I was wrong. Being in love flusters her.</p><p>\u201cI was with her Monday when she tried on wedding dresses. My practical, levelheaded older sister would stand in front of a mirror with huge tears running down her cheeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was crying?\u201d</p><p>Steffie smiled at the memory. \u201cYes, but these were tears of joy. She never allowed herself to believe that Colby loved her enough to work through the things that stood between them. The two of them are so different, and that\u2019s been the problem all along. But neither of them seems to understand, even now, that it was those very differences that attracted them to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>His words gave Steffie pause. \u201cI know but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m attracted to you, Stephanie. Very attracted.\u201d</p><p>It was ironic that she\u2019d told him how love had completely unsettled her sister, only to be sitting on her own bed a few minutes later with the phone pressed against her ear and the tears sliding down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered in a trembling voice.</p><p>\u201cStephanie? What\u2019s wrong? You sound like you\u2019re crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the silliest thing I ever heard,\u201d she rallied, rubbing her eyes with one hand.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, laughing and crying at once, \u201cyou\u2019re flat out of wishes.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cMore wine?\u201d Charles asked, reaching for the bottle of Chablis in its silver bucket.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Steffie said, smiling her appreciation. Their dinner had been delectable. It was one meal she wouldn\u2019t soon forget, although it was Charles\u2019s company that would linger in her mind more than the excellent halibut topped with bay shrimp.</p><p>\u201cHow about dessert?\u201d</p><p>Steffie pressed her hands to her stomach and slowly shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d He leaned against the back of his chair and gazed out the window to the Columbia River below. The gorge was in one of the most scenic parts of Oregon. Steffie had always loved this view of the mighty river coursing through a rock-bound corridor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve looked forward to this evening for a long time,\u201d Charles said, turning back to her.</p><p>\u201cI have, too.\u201d Until tonight, Steffie had only dreamed of being with Charles like this. As his equal, an adult...a woman in love.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen you look more beautiful, Stephanie.\u201d</p><p>His words brought a flush of color to her cheeks. Steffie had dressed carefully, choosing an elegant Italian knit dress in a subdued shade of turquoise. Valerie had lent Steffie her pearl necklace and earrings, and Norah had contributed a splash of her most expensive perfume.</p><p>Her sisters and her father, too, had put a good deal of stock in this evening\u2019s date. Steffie wasn\u2019t sure what her family was expecting. No doubt some miracle. For herself, she was content just to spend the evening with Charles.</p><p>\u201cYou look wonderful yourself.\u201d She wasn\u2019t echoing his compliment, but was stating a fact. He\u2019d worn a dark suit with a silk tie of swirling colors against a pale blue shirt.</p><p>\u201cThen we must make an attractive couple tonight,\u201d Charles commented, rotating the wine goblet between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWe must,\u201d Steffie agreed.</p><p>Charles finished off the last of his wine and set the glass aside. \u201cYou were generous enough to grant me three wishes the other night, remember?\u201d</p><p>Steffie wasn\u2019t likely to forget. She felt warm and shivery inside whenever she thought about their late-night telephone conversation.</p><p>\u201cBeing the honorable gentleman I am, not to mention talented and handsome, as you so aptly pointed out, it seems only fair that I return the favor. You, my lady, are hereby granted three wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I want?\u201d Steffie cocked her head.</p><p>\u201cWithin reason. I\u2019d be willing to drive you to Multnomah Falls to watch the water by moonlight, but I might have a bit of trouble if you decide you want world peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Falls by moonlight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d ask for that one.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the way he\u2019d turned her question into a pre-approved wish. \u201cCharles,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so shocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am. I\u2019d never have guessed it.\u201d</p><p>She was teasing him, and enjoying it and was surprised when he frowned briefly. \u201cThat\u2019s because we\u2019ve never discussed what happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said, holding a finger to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my wishes. We\u2019ll discuss nothing unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened. \u201cI think we should. There\u2019s a lot we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who granted me three wishes,\u201d she reminded him solemnly.</p><p>He nodded, his expression somewhat disgruntled. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I did, and if you want to squander one of your wishes, then far be it from me to stop you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too lovely a night to dredge up the past, especially when it\u2019s so embarrassing. Let\u2019s just look forward\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Charles agreed quickly and turned to thank their waiter when he brought two cups of steaming coffee to the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll just look ahead. Now, remember you have one remaining wish.\u201d</p><p>Steffie hesitated. \u201cDo I have to claim it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the wishes expire at midnight.\u201d</p><p>Steffie laughed softly. \u201cYou make me feel like Cinderella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s because I\u2019d like to be your prince.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was dark and unguarded. Steffie lowered her eyes, for fear he\u2019d read all the love that was stored in her heart.</p><p>\u201cDo I frighten you?\u201d he asked after a moment.</p><p>Steffie\u2019s eyes flew back to his. \u201cNo. I thought I frightened you!\u201d</p><p>He laughed outright at that. \u201cNot likely.\u201d</p><p>They drank their coffee in silence, as though afraid words would destroy the mood. After Charles had paid the bill, he drove toward Multnomah Falls, managing the twisting narrow highway with ease. Steffie had visited the Falls many times, but had always been a bit scared of the drive. However, Charles took the sharp turns in slow, controlled moves, and she relaxed, enjoying the trip.</p><p>The rock walls along the road were built of local basalt more than seventy years earlier, during the Depression.</p><p>\u201cI love this place,\u201d Charles said as they reached the parking area across the roadway from the waterfall. Because it was a weeknight, there were only a few cars in the lot.</p><p>Dusk was settling, and the tall, stately firs bordering the falls were silhouetted against the backdrop of a cloud-dappled sky. The forested slopes were already dark as Steffie and Charles began the gradual, winding ascent to the visitors\u2019 viewpoint.</p><p>A chill raced down her arms and Steffie was grateful she\u2019d brought a thin coat with her. Multnomah Falls was Oregon\u2019s highest waterfall, plummeting more than six hundred feet into a swirling pool, then slipping downward in a second, shorter descent. The force of the falling water misted the night.</p><p>With his hand at her elbow, Charles guided them to the walkway that wove up the trail. When they got to the footbridge that spanned the falls, Steffie stopped to gaze at the magnificence around her. The sound of falling water roared in her ears.</p><p>\u201cIf we wait a few minutes, the moon will hit the water,\u201d Charles told her. He stood behind her, shielding her from the wind that whipped across the water\u2019s churning surface.</p><p>Steffie closed her eyes. Not to the beauty of the scene before her, but to the sensation she experienced in Charles\u2019s protective embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of holding you like this,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOf wrapping my arms around you and feeling you next to me. I love the way your hair smells. It reminds me of wildflowers and sunshine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steffie couldn\u2019t speak. She couldn\u2019t get even one word past the knot in her throat. She swallowed and slowed her breathing, hoping that might help, because there was so much she longed to say, so many things she yearned to tell him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to be separated from you again,\u201d Charles told her, his voice raw.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand. Charles had all but sent her away. He\u2019d all but cast her out of his life. She turned in his arms until they faced each other and raised her hands to his face.</p><p>Charles smiled then and gently gripped her wrists. He moved his head until his mouth met the sensitive skin of her palm, and he kissed her there.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, three years ago there was so much I couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI have one wish left,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI want you to kiss me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d She could hear the smile in his voice.</p><p>They\u2019d kissed before, but they\u2019d never shared what they did in those moments. Charles\u2019s lips found hers in the sweetest, most loving exchange she\u2019d ever experienced, and Steffie\u2019s emotions exploded to life.</p><p>Steffie wanted this, wanted it more than anything she\u2019d ever known, yet at the same time she felt overwhelmed by confusion. Charles had ordered her out of his life, laughed at her declaration of love, humiliated her until she couldn\u2019t bear to live in the same town. Now, he seemed to be suggesting that he hadn\u2019t wanted her to go, and that he never wanted her to leave again.</p> <p>Steffie wasn\u2019t sure what to believe. With all her heart she longed to lose herself in Charles\u2019s kiss, to savor all the sensations that flooded her. And yet the uncertainty remained. Did he merely desire her, or did he, too, feel a forever kind of love?</p><p>But his kiss wiped out all thought as the joy rushed through her, replacing fear and doubt.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d Charles whispered suddenly. He broke away, still holding her shoulders, and brushed his mouth against her forehead. Then he released her.</p><p>Steffie\u2019s father was sitting by the fireplace in his den when she let herself into the house later that night. She saw the lamplight spilling into the entryway and decided to check on him.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d David was sitting in the wingback leather chair beside the fireplace, her mother\u2019s afghan tucked around his legs. His head drooped and his lips were slightly parted.</p><p>Steffie had spoken before she realized he was asleep. But just as she turned to tiptoe from the room, he stirred.</p> <p>\u201cSteffie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you,\u201d she told him quietly.</p><p>\u201cGood thing you did. I was waiting up for you.\u201d He ran one hand through his hair and sat up straighter. \u201cHow was your dinner with Charles?\u201d</p><p>Steffie sank onto the ottoman, angling her legs to one side. She knew her eyes had a dreamy look, but she didn\u2019t care. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Charles ask you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me anything?\u201d she repeated, feigning ignorance. \u201cWhat could he possibly have to ask me?\u201d</p><p>David Bloomfield frowned. \u201cPlenty. I thought\u2014I hoped he was going to mention...an upcoming event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that!\u201d she said with a light disinterested laugh. If the evening hadn\u2019t been so wonderful, she would\u2019ve felt irritated with his pressure tactics. But she found it impossible to complain when she was this happy.</p> <p>\u201cHe did, you mean? And what did you tell him? Don\u2019t keep me in suspense, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Steffie splayed her fingers and studied the smoothly polished nails before sighing. \u201cI told him we\u2019ll see about it on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunday? You\u2019re going to keep that boy in agony until Sunday?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, affecting a complete lack of concern. \u201cHe wanted to know if we could go horseback riding, and I said we could probably do it on Sunday. That\u2019s the question you\u2019re referring to, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d came his disappointed reply. \u201cAnd well you know it. I expected that boy to ask you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he didn\u2019t and even if he had\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he had, what?\u201d The frown slid back into place. \u201cI tell you, Stephanie, you\u2019re as stubborn as your mother when it comes to this sort of thing. You can\u2019t fool me\u2014you\u2019ve been in love with Charles for years. If he asks you to marry him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he hasn\u2019t and from what I could see, he doesn\u2019t have any intention of doing so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re free to think what you want, Dad, but keep in mind that this is my life and I won\u2019t take kindly to your interfering in it. And remember that Charles values his privacy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ask you to marry him,\u201d her father muttered under his breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he intends to, either?\u201d he demanded, louder now.</p><p>\u201cNot to my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>A look of righteous indignation came over him. \u201cThen I\u2019d better have a talk with that boy. I won\u2019t allow him to trifle with your affections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Steffie had trouble not laughing over the old-fashioned terms he used. She was sure Charles would find it humorous, too, if she suggested he was \u201ctrifling\u201d with her heart.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Steffie. I refuse to let that young man hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only has that power if I give it to him\u2014which I won\u2019t. You\u2019re looking at a woman of the twenty-first century, Dad, and we\u2019re too smart to let a man trifle with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I\u2019m having a talk with him.\u201d</p><p>Her expression might have been outwardly serene, but Steffie\u2019s insides were dancing a wild jig. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cApparently Charles Tomaselli doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad! We talked about this before, remember?\u201d Her good mood was quickly evaporating. \u201cNow I want you to promise you\u2019re not going to interfere with Charles and me.\u201d</p><p>Her father refused to answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be mortified if you even bring up the subject of marriage to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trusting you, Dad. Now good night.\u201d She stood and kissed his forehead before hurrying up the stairs to her own bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the ride to the airport,\u201d Valerie said as they drove out of town early Saturday afternoon. Her sister\u2019s flight was scheduled to leave at six, which gave them plenty of time for a leisurely trip into Portland. Valerie was going to meet with Rowdy Cassidy to tell him about her engagement and request a job transfer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to do it,\u201d Steffie assured her older sister. Now that Valerie had set the preparations for her wedding in motion, she was free to return to Texas. There were several tasks, besides the discussion with Cassidy, that she needed to take care of. She had to pack her personal things, deal with her furniture and put her condo on the market.</p><p>\u201cColby wanted to come with me, but his schedule\u2019s full,\u201d she explained wistfully. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ll both have to adjust to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavy schedules?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Rowdy about that while I\u2019m in Houston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll agree to let you head up the West Coast branch of CHIPS?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.... I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be pleased about my wanting to leave Houston, but he hasn\u2019t got a choice.\u201d Steffie noticed a hesitancy in her sister that she hadn\u2019t seen earlier. \u201cRowdy can be hard to predict,\u201d Valerie added. \u201cHe might be absolutely delighted for me and Colby. But there\u2019s also a chance that he\u2019ll be angry I took an extended leave of absence to plan my wedding.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell him the whole truth about why I didn\u2019t return the day I said I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Steffie prodded, briefly taking her eyes from the road when Valerie didn\u2019t immediately offer the information.</p><p>\u201cI know I should have, but it just didn\u2019t seem right to do it over the phone. Besides, I\u2019m afraid Rowdy might be...have been interested in me himself. At one point, I even thought I was interested in him! Good heavens, I didn\u2019t know a thing about love until I met Colby. I don\u2019t mean to hurt Rowdy\u2019s feelings but I can\u2019t give him any hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to fly back with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Rowdy\u2019s really a gentleman beneath that cowboy exterior.\u201d</p><p>Steffie\u2019s suspicions were raised. \u201cDoes the good doctor know how Rowdy feels about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he might. Then again, we\u2019ve never really discussed Rowdy, and why should we? If you want the truth, I think Colby would rather forget about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should take his head out of the sand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you go saying anything to him,\u201d Valerie said vehemently. \u201cI mean it, Steff. What happens between Rowdy and me is between Rowdy and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Colby the jealous type?\u201d Steffie remembered how she\u2019d felt the day she saw Charles standing next to Wendy, the intern at the Clarion. Until that moment, she\u2019d never thought of herself as jealous. Even now the blood simmered in her veins when she recalled how the little blonde had gazed up at Charles, her blue eyes wide with open admiration.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Colby is or not. I only know how I\u2019d feel if the situation was reversed.\u201d Valerie seemed to consider her next words. \u201cBefore Colby and I became engaged he was dating a nurse named Sherry Waterman, a friend of Norah\u2019s. Apparently he\u2019d been going out with her for quite a while. Everyone was expecting them to announce their engagement. Norah seemed to feel otherwise, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear Norah\u2019s got a sixth sense about these things.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI think she does, too. At any rate, Colby and I decided that although we were attracted to each other, a long-term relationship was out of the question. Colby...asked me to hurry up and leave because my staying made everything so much more painful for us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Steffie was outraged. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing he didn\u2019t say that around me.\u201d</p><p>Valerie laughed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really mean it. Oh, maybe he did at the time, but I didn\u2019t make falling in love easy for either of us.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s stubbornness was a trait the three Bloomfield sisters shared, Steffie thought with a small, rueful grin.</p><p>\u201cAfter we talked, Colby started dating Sherry again. I think they went out four or five nights in a row. I didn\u2019t know about it, but in a way, I guess I did. I certainly wasn\u2019t surprised when I heard.</p><p>\u201cPoor Norah felt she had to let me know what was happening. I think it was harder on her than on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the funny part,\u201d Valerie said pensively. \u201cAt first I was so jealous I wanted to scratch Sherry\u2019s eyes out. I fantasized about hunting down Colby Winston and making him suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve asked me to help you. I\u2019d gladly have volunteered.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Valerie smiled and patted Steffie\u2019s forearm. \u201cSpoken like a true sister, but as I said that was my first reaction. What I found interesting was that it didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cI sat down and thought about it and realized how selfish and unfair I was being to Colby. If I truly loved him, I should want him to have whatever made him happy. If that meant marriage to Sherry Waterman, then so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words you were willing to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that was a turning point for me. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, it hurt more than anything I\u2019ve ever done. Remember the day I was supposed to fly back to Houston?\u201d</p> <p>Steffie wasn\u2019t likely to forget it. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I got ready to leave, I really had to work at controlling myself. I wasn\u2019t sure I could make it down the front steps without bursting into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were upset....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally, Colby would have to choose right then to stop in for a visit. That man\u2019s sense of timing is going to be a problem.\u201d Valerie shook her head in mock exasperation.</p><p>Steffie laughed. Give Valerie a week and she\u2019d have Colby\u2019s life completely reorganized.</p> <p>\u201cSomehow I managed to pull it off,\u201d Valerie continued. \u201cI remember sitting in the car and\u2014this is odd\u2014I felt a sense of peace. I don\u2019t know if I can explain it. I felt this incredible...nobility. Don\u2019t you dare laugh, Steffie, I\u2019m serious. I didn\u2019t stop loving Colby\u2014if anything, I loved him more. Here I was, willingly walking away from the first man I\u2019d ever loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to throttle Colby about then.\u201d</p><p>Valerie grinned. \u201cI remember learning about the tragic hero in my college literature courses. In some ways, I felt like I qualified for the tragic heroine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t sorry you\u2019d fallen in love with him, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was grateful. I was leaving him and at the same time I was giving him permission to find his own joy. And like I said, that somehow...ennobled me.\u201d</p><p>Steffie recalled the farewell scene on her front porch when she\u2019d been so angry with Colby. \u201cI...don\u2019t know if I could be that noble about Charles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Steffie was being entirely honest. \u201cWe had a wonderful dinner on Thursday, then we drove to Multnomah Falls and watched the moonlight on the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. We walked up to the footbridge and...talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet!\u201d Valerie laughed.</p><p>\u201cWe did\u2014only we did more kissing than talking.\u201d Steffie knew that Charles had wanted to talk, wanted to discuss the past with her. She hated the thought of reliving all that pain. But more than anything she dreaded examining her utterly ridiculous behavior. Every time she recalled the scene in his bathroom, with her playing the role of waterlogged enchantress, she burned with humiliation. Someday they\u2019d talk about it, but not now. It was too soon.</p><p>\u201cDad seems to think you two will get married.\u201d</p><p>This discussion was a repeat of the one she\u2019d had with her father every day for the past two weeks. \u201cYou know Dad when he\u2019s got a bee in his bonnet. I\u2019ve had to make him promise not to say a word about marriage to Charles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really believe he listened to you?\u201d Valerie asked.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Valerie frowned as she turned to stare out the car window. Steffie\u2019s hands tightened on the steering wheel and she glanced around her. Wild rhododendrons blossomed along the side of the road, their bright pink flowers a colorful contrast to the lush green foliage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Dad.\u201d</p><p>Valerie\u2019s words surprised Steffie. \u201cWhy? He\u2019s getting stronger every day. His recovery is nothing short of miraculous. I\u2019ve heard you say so yourself, at least a dozen times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll rephrase that. I\u2019m worried for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Whatever for?\u201d As far as Steffie was concerned, her life had rarely been better. She\u2019d applied for late admission to the Ph.D. program and planned to begin researching thesis topics soon. As for Charles...well, things were wonderful. Yes, she still had a lot of murky ground to cover with him, but there\u2019d be time for that later.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s riding high on success,\u201d Valerie reminded her. \u201cHe seems to think that because everything fell into place with Colby and me, it should for you and Charles, as well. Remember he\u2019s supposed to have dreamed all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. We\u2019ve had our go-arounds on that issue. He\u2019s told me at least twice a day for the past two weeks that I\u2019m going to marry Charles by the end of the summer. Now I just smile and nod and let him think what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt drives me nuts.\u201d Possibly because she wanted to believe it so badly...</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you nervous that Dad\u2019s going to get impatient and say something to Charles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Steffie answered automatically. \u201cDad and I\u2019ve been over this. He knows better than to say anything to Charles.\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded. \u201cI wish I shared your confidence.\u201d</p><p>Steffie put on a good front for the remainder of the drive, but she was growing more and more concerned. She knew one thing; she didn\u2019t have the personality to take on the role of tragic heroine. She\u2019d leave that to her older, wiser sister.</p><p>As soon as Valerie had checked in for her flight to Texas, Steffie headed back to Orchard Valley. As the minutes ticked away, she became increasingly anxious to get home.</p><p>It was just like Valerie to plant the seeds of doubt and then fly off, leaving Steffie to deal with the result\u2014a garden full of weeds!</p><p>When she pulled into the driveway, Steffie experienced an immediate sense of relief. Her world was in order; her fears shrank to nothing. All was well. Her father was rocking on the front porch, the way he did every evening. He smiled and waved when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cHello, good-lookin\u2019,\u201d she said as she climbed out of the car. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a great afternoon. Every day\u2019s wonderful now that I\u2019ve got all these reasons to live. Oh, before I forget, Charles stopped by to see you. Guess he must\u2019ve been in the neighborhood again.\u201d A smile twinkled from her father\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou might want to call him. I suspect he\u2019s waiting to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>Steffie froze. Doubt sprang to new life. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to him about...what we discussed, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I didn\u2019t say a word you wouldn\u2019t want me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs positive as I\u2019m sitting here.\u201d</p><p>Steffie went inside the house, reassured by her father\u2019s words. Norah was busy in the kitchen, kneading bread dough on a lightly floured countertop.</p><p>\u201cDid you happen to see Charles?\u201d Steffie asked in passing. She opened the refrigerator and removed a cold soda.</p><p>\u201cHe stopped by earlier and sat on the porch with Dad. I think he was here for about fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Steffie swallowed a long cool drink. \u201cI\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>She waited until she was in her room, then sat on her bed and reached for the phone. Although it had been several years since she\u2019d called Charles, she still remembered his number. The same way she remembered everything else about him.</p><p>He must have been sitting by the phone, because he answered even before the first ring was finished.</p><p>\u201cCharles, hello,\u201d she said happily. \u201cDad said you came by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>His voice was cool, and Steffie paused as the dread took hold inside her. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot wrong, exactly. I guess you could say I\u2019m disappointed. I thought you\u2019d changed, Steffie. I thought you\u2019d grown up and stopped your naive tricks. But I was wrong, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Steffie struggled to keep the anger and distress from her voice. She hurried to the porch, her fists clenched against her sides. \u201cYou told me...you promised...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cWhat exactly did you say to Charles?\u201d</p><p>Her father glanced upward momentarily, clearly puzzled. \u201cNothing drastic, I assure you. Is it important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s important! I need to know.\u201d She had to call on every ounce of self-control not to shout at him and demand an explanation. She longed to chastise him for doing the very thing she\u2019d begged him not to.</p><p>\u201cYou look upset, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am upset and I\u2019m sure you know why... Just tell me what you said to Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down a bit and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Steffie did as her father requested, sitting on the top porch step near his chair and leaning back against the white pillar. \u201cCharles stopped in this afternoon, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we had a nice chat. He tried to make me think he was here to visit me, but I saw through that.\u201d Her father\u2019s smile told Steffie all she needed to know. For one angry second, she thought he resembled a spider, waiting patiently for someone to step into his web.</p><p>\u201cObviously I was the subject under discussion, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d She forced herself not to yell, not to rant and rave at a man so recently released from the hospital.</p><p>Her father rocked back and forth a few times, then nodded. \u201cWe talked about you.\u201d</p><p>Steffie closed her eyes, her frustration mounting. \u201cI see. And what did the two of you come up with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me tell you what Charles said first.\u201d</p><p>She balled her hands into fists again, praying for patience. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Charles stopped by, as I said, pretending it was me he was here to visit, when we both knew he was coming to see you. I went along with it for a while, then asked him flat out what his intentions were toward you. I fully expected you to be wearing an engagement ring by now, and I let him know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Without meaning to, Steffie sprang to her feet. \u201cYou breached a trust! I trusted you to keep your word, not to talk to Charles about this. And now you pass it off as...as nothing. Don\u2019t you realize what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>For the first time he looked chagrined. \u201cI did it because I love you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad...you\u2019ve made everything so much more difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you interested in what he had to say?\u201d His smile was bright and cocky again. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you? Now sit back down and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d She sighed, lowering herself onto the porch step, her legs barely able to support her. She was shaking with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cCharles seemed more concerned with the fact that I\u2019d asked than with answering the question. To be perfectly honest, Princess, he wasn\u2019t overly pleased with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he even answered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. He said if the subject of marriage did come up, then it was between the two of you, and not the three of us. It was a good response.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou never should\u2019ve said anything about us marrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Princess, the way I figured it, he was going to pop the question, anyway. Besides, I don\u2019t want Charles leading you on, or hurting you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, you\u2019ve made it nearly impossible for me now and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me finish, because there\u2019s more to tell you.\u201d But after silencing her, he went strangely quiet himself.</p> <p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she urged, clenching her jaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to think of a way to tell you this without annoying you even more. I told Charles something you didn\u2019t want me to tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dream?\u201d The question came out a whisper. \u201cBut you said you hadn\u2019t told Charles anything I wouldn\u2019t want you to. And before\u2014you promised you wouldn\u2019t mention marriage!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Princess, I never did promise. I took it under consideration, but not once did I actually say I wouldn\u2019t discuss this with Charles. Now don\u2019t look so worried. I didn\u2019t tell him a thing about talking to your mother or about the three precious children the two of you are going to have someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Charles say? No,\u201d she amended quickly, \u201ctell me exactly what you said first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, like I already told you, we were chatting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet to the part where you brought up marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. But I want you to know I didn\u2019t say anything about the dream. Not because you didn\u2019t want me to, but because when it came right down to it, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d believe me. You three girls are having trouble enough, so I can hardly expect someone outside the family to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told Colby about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. He\u2019s my doctor. He had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. In other words you blurted out that you expected Charles to marry me\u2014because you didn\u2019t want him trifling with my heart?\u201d Spoken aloud, it sounded so ludicrous. Not to mention insulting. No wonder Charles was cool toward her.</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly. I asked his intentions. He said that was between the two of you. As I already explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Steffie relaxed a little. \u201cAnd that was the end of it?\u201d she murmured hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him you were anticipating a proposal of marriage, and for that matter so was I.\u201d</p><p>Steffie ground her teeth to keep from screaming. It was worse than she\u2019d feared. Sagging against the pillar, she covered her face with both hands. It would\u2019ve been far better had he told Charles about the dream. That way, Charles might have understood that she\u2019d had nothing to do with this. Instead, her father had made everything ten times worse by not mentioning it.</p><p>Charles was angry with her; that was obvious from their telephone conversation. He\u2019d refused to discuss it in any detail, just repeating that he was \u201cdisappointed.\u201d He seemed to believe she\u2019d manipulated her father into approaching him with this marriage business. He wasn\u2019t likely to change his mind unless she could convince him of the truth.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d her father asked when she left him and returned a moment later with her purse and a sweater.</p> <p>\u201cTo talk to Charles\u2014to explain things, if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d David\u2019s grin was full. \u201cAll that boy needs is a bit of prompting. You\u2019ll see. Once you get back, you\u2019ll thank me for taking matters into my own hands. There\u2019s something about making a commitment to the right woman that fixes everything.\u201d</p><p>Steffie was drained from the emotion. She found she couldn\u2019t remain angry with her father. He\u2019d talked to Charles with the best of motives. And he didn\u2019t know what had gone on between her and Charles in the past\u2014the tricks she\u2019d played. So he couldn\u2019t possibly understand why Charles would react with such anger to being pressed on the issue of marriage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait up for you and when you get home we\u2019ll celebrate together,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Steffie grinned weakly and nodded, but she doubted there\u2019d be anything to celebrate.</p><p>She took her time driving into town, using those minutes to organize her thoughts. She hoped Charles would be open-minded enough to accept her explanation. Mostly, she wanted to reassure him that she hadn\u2019t talked her father into interrogating him about marriage. They\u2019d come so far in the past few weeks, she and Charles, and Steffie didn\u2019t want anything to spoil that.</p><p>Charles was waiting for her, or he seemed to be. She\u2019d barely rung his doorbell when he answered.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d His immediate appearance took her by surprise. \u201cI\u2014I thought it might be a good idea if the two of us sat down and talked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He didn\u2019t smile, didn\u2019t show any sign of pleasure at seeing her.</p><p>\u201cDad told me he talked to you about...the two of us marrying.\u201d The words felt awkward on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cHe did mention something along those lines,\u201d Charles returned stiffly.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t asked her to make herself comfortable or invited her to sit down. It didn\u2019t matter, though, since she couldn\u2019t stand still, anyway. She paced from one side of his living room to the other. She felt strangely chilled, despite the warm spring weather.</p><p>\u201cYou think I put Dad up to it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said frankly.</p><p>He stood rooted to the same spot while she drifted, apparently aimlessly, around the room. His look, everything about him, wasn\u2019t encouraging. Perhaps she should have delayed this, let them both sleep on it, instead of forcing the issue. Perhaps she should\u2019ve dropped the whole thing, and let this misunderstanding sort itself out. Perhaps she should go home now before the situation got even worse.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask Dad to say anything to you,\u201d she told him simply.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you? This is ridiculous! If you intend to drag the past into every disagreement, punish me for something that happened three years ago, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about three years ago. I\u2019m talking about here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say this for you, Steffie, you\u2019ve gotten a lot more subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, you park in front of the newspaper office just as I happen to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. I was talking to Wendy, and when I looked up, I saw you sitting in your car, staring at us. Just how long had you been there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, I realize what a fool I\u2019ve been. You\u2019ve been spying on me for weeks, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The idea was so outlandish that Steffie found herself laughing incredulously. Nothing she said would make any difference, not if he believed what he was saying. Because if he did, there was nothing of their relationship left to salvage.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no fooling you, is there?\u201d she threw out sarcastically. \u201cYou\u2019re much too smart for me, Charles. I\u2019ve been hiding around town for days, following you with binoculars, charting your activities. It\u2019s amazing you didn\u2019t catch on sooner.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her scornful remarks. \u201cVery convenient the way you twisted your ankle the other day, too, wasn\u2019t it? Somehow you managed to fall directly into my arms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe timing was perfect, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she said with a short, humorless laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I couldn\u2019t have planned that any better.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThen there was the dinner waiting for me at the house the other night. Italian, too, just the way my grandmother used to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting how I knew that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of this adds up to one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d she asked scathingly, folding her arms. She\u2019d assumed far too much in this relationship. She\u2019d lowered her guard and actually believed Charles loved her, because she loved him so deeply. Now she understood how wrong she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cIt adds up to the fact that you\u2019re playing games again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the moonlight the evening we were at Multnomah Falls. I arranged that, too. I have to admit it took some doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be sarcastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d she returned defiantly.</p><p>Charles frowned and muttered something she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cI must say I\u2019m surprised you caught on so quickly, what with me being so subtle and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s clear the air once and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the air is clear,\u201d she said, waving her arms wildly. She knew she was going too far with this, but the momentum was building and she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cI\u2019ve been found out, and now it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s no need to pretend anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge. It\u2019s supposed to be sweet, and it would\u2019ve been if you hadn\u2019t caught on when you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what did you intend to do?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you don\u2019t have that figured out, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Stephanie.\u201d His voice was hard as ice and just as cold.</p><p>\u201cFine, if you must know. Once I got you to the point of proposing\u2014\u201d she paused dramatically \u201c\u2014I was going to laugh and reject you. It seems only fair after the way you humiliated me. You laughed at me, Charles, and it was going to be my turn to laugh at you. Only you found me out first....\u201d</p><p>His frown deepened into a scowl. \u201cYour father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, he didn\u2019t know anything about that part. Getting him to shame you into a marriage proposal was tricky, but I managed it by telling him I was afraid you were...trifling with my affections.\u201d She gave a deep exaggerated sigh, astonished that he seemed to believe all this.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re too clever for me, Charles. What can I possibly say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if you left now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right. Well, at least you know what it feels like to have someone laugh at you.\u201d</p><p>Charles walked to his front door and held it open for her. With a jaunty step, Steffie walked out of his house. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you around, but you don\u2019t need to worry\u2014I won\u2019t be spying on you anymore.\u201d</p><p>His jaw was clamped tightly shut, and Steffie realized she\u2019d succeeded beyond all her expectations. Charles was disgusted with her. And furious. So furious that he couldn\u2019t get her out of his home fast enough.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame a girl for trying,\u201d she said with a shrug once she\u2019d slipped past him.</p><p>In response, Charles slammed his door.</p><p>By the time Steffie was inside the car, she was shaking so badly that she could hardly insert the key into the ignition. Her breath seemed to be trapped in her chest, creating a painful need to exhale. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like Charles, she was angry, angrier than she\u2019d ever been in her life. In one rational corner of her mind, she knew\u2014had known all along\u2014that it was a mistake to goad him with all those ridiculous lies.</p><p>But the shocking thing, the sad thing, was that he\u2019d believed them. To his way of thinking, apparently, it all fit. And as far as Steffie was concerned, there was nothing more to say.</p><p>In time, she\u2019d regret her outburst, but she didn\u2019t then. At that moment, she was far too infuriated to care. In time, she\u2019d regret the lies, the squandered hopes\u2014but it wouldn\u2019t be soon.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d her father asked, his expression pleased and expectant as she let herself into the house an hour later. \u201cAre you two going to look for an engagement ring in the next few days?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Steffie said, moving into his den. As he\u2019d promised earlier, her father was waiting up for her, reading in his favorite chair.</p><p>His face fell with disappointment. \u201cBut you did talk about getting married, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. We, uh, got sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t argue, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Steffie was unsure how much to tell him. She worried that if he knew the extent of the rift between her and Charles, he\u2019d feel obliged to do something to patch things up.</p> <p>David set aside his reading glasses and gazed up at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing him again soon, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Living in Orchard Valley made that very likely. It was the reason she\u2019d chosen to study in Europe three years earlier. \u201cNaturally I\u2019ll be seeing him.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, appeased. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go up to my room and read. Good night, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Princess.\u201d</p><p>On her way up, Steffie met Norah at the top of the stairs. Her younger sister glanced in her direction and did an automatic double take. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean other than the fact that you look like you\u2019re waiting to get to your room before you cry?\u201d</p><p>Her sister knew her too well. Steffie felt terrible\u2014discouraged, disheartened, depressed. But in her present mood, she didn\u2019t have the patience to explain what had happened between her and Charles.</p><p>\u201cWhat could possibly be wrong?\u201d Steffie asked instead, feigning a lightness she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>\u201cFunny you should say that,\u201d Norah said, tucking her arm through Steffie\u2019s and leading the way to her bedroom. \u201cValerie asked me nearly the same thing not long ago. What could possibly be wrong? Well, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s probably trouble with a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery astute of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously it\u2019s Charles.\u201d Norah didn\u2019t react to Steffie\u2019s mild sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She was tired, weary right down to her bones and desperately craving a long, hot soak in the tub. Some of her best thinking was accomplished while lazing in a bathtub filled with scented water. She\u2019d avoided bubble baths since the time she\u2019d spent hours in one waiting for Charles.</p> <p>\u201cDid you two have a spat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Norah, I appreciate your concern\u2014really, I do... I don\u2019t mean to sound ungrateful, but I\u2019m tired and I want to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed? Good grief, it\u2019s only seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>Norah eyed her suspiciously. \u201cIt must have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, I have a lot to do on Monday.\u201d</p><p>Norah\u2019s interest was piqued. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Portland to see about my application at the university and to find an apartment.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Norah said nothing. Her mouth fell open and she wore a stunned look. \u201cBut I thought you told Dad you were going to wait on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now you aren\u2019t? Even after you promised Dad?\u201d</p><p>Steffie glanced away, not wanting her sister to see how deeply hurt she was. How betrayed she felt that Charles would believe she was deceitful enough to trick him into marriage. It seemed that whenever Charles Tomaselli was involved, she invariably ended up in pain.</p><p>\u201cI feel better than I have in years.\u201d David greeted Steffie cheerfully early the next morning. He was sitting at the kitchen table, drinking a cup of coffee and studying the Portland Sunday paper. He welcomed her with a warm smile, apparently not noticing his daughter\u2019s lackluster mood. \u201cBeautiful morning,\u201d David added.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Steffie mumbled as she poured herself a cup of coffee and staggered to the table. Her eyes burned from lack of sleep, and she felt as though she was walking around in a nightmare.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the entire night arguing with herself about the lies she\u2019d told Charles. In the end, she\u2019d managed to convince herself that she\u2019d done the right thing. Charles wanted to believe every word. He\u2019d seized every one of her sarcastic remarks, all too ready to consider them truth.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will Charles be by?\u201d her father asked conversationally.</p><p>\u201cCharles?\u201d She repeated his name as though she\u2019d never heard it before.</p><p>\u201cI thought the two of you were going horseback riding this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...I\u2019m not sure Charles will be able to come, after all.\u201d The date had probably slipped his mind, the way it had hers. Even if he did remember, Steffie sincerely doubted he\u2019d show up. As far as she was concerned, whatever had been between them was now over. In fact, the more she reviewed their last discussion, the angrier she became. If he honestly believed the things she\u2019d suggested\u2014and he certainly seemed to\u2014then there was no hope for them. None.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get dressed for church,\u201d Steffie said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of time yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorah has to get there early.\u201d Her sister sang in the choir. Generally Norah left the house before the others, but Steffie thought she\u2019d ride with Norah this morning, if for no other reason than to escape her father\u2019s questions. From the looks David was giving her, he was about to subject her to a full-scale inquisition.</p><p>Attending church was an uplifting experience for Steffie. During that hour, she was able to forget her troubles and absorb the atmosphere of peace and serenity. Whatever solace she found, however, vanished the minute she and Norah drove into the yard shortly after noon.</p><p>Charles\u2019s car was parked out front.</p><p>Steffie tensed and released a long, slow sigh.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Norah asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d But at the same time, she wasn\u2019t about to back down, either. She wouldn\u2019t allow Charles to chase her from her own home. He was on her turf now, and she didn\u2019t run easily.</p><p>Steffie parked behind Charles\u2019s sports car and willed herself to remain calm and collected. Her father must have heard them because he stepped outside the house, his welcoming smile in place. He still moved slowly but with increasing confidence. It was sometimes hard to remember that he was recovering from major surgery.</p><p>\u201cSteffie, Charles is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d she said with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the stable, waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and, with her heart racing, walked up the steps and past her father.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to change my clothes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo talk? But...\u201d He hesitated, then reluctantly nodded.</p><p>By the time Steffie was in her bedroom, she was trembling. Her emotions were so confused that she wasn\u2019t sure if she was shaking with anger or with nervousness. But she did know she wasn\u2019t ready to face him, wasn\u2019t ready to deal with his accusations or his reproach. For several minutes she sat on her bed, trying to decide what to do.</p><p>\u201cSteffie.\u201d Norah stood in the doorway, watching her. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I\u2014no, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk to Charles yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing says you have to talk to him if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll make up some excuse and send him packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d For pride\u2019s sake, she didn\u2019t want him to know how badly she\u2019d been hurt by their latest confrontation.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to burst into tears.\u201d</p><p>Steffie squared her shoulders and met her sister\u2019s worried eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give him the satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttagirl,\u201d Norah said approvingly.</p><p>Changing into jeans and a sweatshirt, Steffie went down the back stairs into the kitchen. She didn\u2019t expect to find Charles sitting at the table chatting with her father. What unsettled her most was that he gave no outward sign of their quarrel. Steffie slowed her pace as she entered the room.</p><p>Charles stopped talking and his eyes narrowed briefly. \u201cHello, Stephanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two alone,\u201d her father said before Steffie could answer Charles\u2019s greeting. He rose, a bit stiffly, and made his way to the door. \u201cI guess you\u2019ve got plenty to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Steffie wanted to argue, but knew there wasn\u2019t any point. She merely shrugged and remained where she was, standing a few steps from the back stairs. She didn\u2019t look at Charles. The silence between them lengthened, until she couldn\u2019t endure it any longer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come,\u201d she said in a harsh voice. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to go riding and I don\u2019t imagine you are, either.\u201d In other words, she wasn\u2019t in the mood to go riding with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Charles didn\u2019t have the answer because he got to his feet and walked over to the window. Whatever he saw must have fascinated him because he stood there for several minutes without speaking.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked a second time, on the verge of requesting him to leave.</p><p>He finally turned around to face her. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I couldn\u2019t sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>Steffie refused to admit that she\u2019d fared no better, so she made no response.</p><p>\u201cI kept going over the things your father said and the things you told me,\u201d Charles went on.</p><p>\u201cDid you come to any conclusions?\u201d Pride demanded that she not look at him, or reveal how much his answer meant to her.</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Steffie tensed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She had to look at him now.</p><p>His eyes finally met hers. Although nearly the entire kitchen separated them, Steffie felt as though he was close enough to touch.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d he began, \u201cthat since your father\u2019s so anxious to marry you off, and you seem to be just as eager, then fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine?\u201d she repeated, wondering if this was some joke and she\u2019d missed the punch line.</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Charles returned shortly, \u201cI\u2019m willing to take you off his hands.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ten</p><p>\u201cWhat? Take me off Dad\u2019s hands?\u201d Steffie echoed. Surely he wasn\u2019t serious. No woman in her right mind would accept such an insulting proposal.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p> <p>Charles shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more serious in my life. You want to marry me, then so be it. I\u2019m willing to go along with this, provided we understand each other....\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case I withdraw the offer\u2014not that I ever made an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d Charles argued, looking surprised. \u201cYour father thinks we should get married and, after giving it some thought, I agree with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, since I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Charles laughed softly. \u201cWe both know that\u2019s not true. You\u2019ve been crazy about me for years.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie whirled around and crossed her arms, as though to fend off his words. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you, Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I know you love me. You said so yourself before you left for Italy, and I know that hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I am. And recently you showed me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she demanded, trying to recall the conversations they\u2019d had since her return to Orchard Valley.</p><p>\u201cThe afternoon we met at Del\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Steffie cast her mind back to that day. They\u2019d met by accident as they\u2019d gone in to pay for their gas. Steffie remembered how glad she\u2019d been to see him, how eager to set things straight. But she couldn\u2019t remember saying one thing that would lead Charles to believe she still loved him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in so many words, true, but with everything you did. The same holds true for the night I dropped off the azalea and you asked me to dinner. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA whole lot, as a matter of fact. You were continually making excuses for us to be together.\u201d</p><p>Steffie\u2019s face flooded with color. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>He ignored her question. \u201cWe had fun that night, touring Orchard Valley. Didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded. She wasn\u2019t likely to forget that evening. For the first time in her relationship with Charles, she\u2019d felt a stirring of real promise. Not the kind of hope she\u2019d fabricated earlier, but one based on genuine companionship. Charles had enjoyed her company and they\u2019d laughed and talked as though they\u2019d been friends for years.</p> <p>\u201cYou told me that when you lived in Italy you were too busy with your studies to date much,\u201d Charles reminded her.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that led me to conclude that you hadn\u2019t fallen in love with anyone else while you were away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father came right out and told me on several occasions that he was concerned about you because you didn\u2019t seem to be dating anyone seriously.\u201d</p><p>Steffie glared at him, feeling trapped. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand what this has to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. You loved me then, and you love me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got some nerve, Charles Tomaselli.\u201d She glowered fiercely, hoping he\u2019d back off. \u201cWhat makes you so sure I\u2019m in love with you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you better than you realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d She managed a light laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all, otherwise you\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cOtherwise what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have believed the things she\u2019d told him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time we stopped playing games with each other?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cWhat games?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI gave those up years ago.\u201d</p><p>Charles frowned as though he wasn\u2019t sure he should believe her.</p><p>Hurt and angry, Steffie raised her hand and pointed at him. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason I refuse to marry you,\u201d she cried. Restraining the emotion was next to impossible and her voice quavered with the force of it. \u201cI suppose I should be flattered that you\u2019re willing to take me off Dad\u2019s hands,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cEvery woman dreams of hearing such romantic words. But I want far more in a husband, Charles Tomaselli, than you\u2019d ever be capable of giving me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Before she had a chance to reply he muttered, \u201cOh, I get it. You\u2019re afraid I\u2019m going to be financially strapped with the newspaper, aren\u2019t you? You think I won\u2019t be able to afford you.\u201d</p><p>Steffie was stunned by his remark. Stunned and insulted. \u201cYou know me so well, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked him, her voice heavy with scorn. \u201cThere\u2019s just no pulling the wool over your eyes, is there?\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI think it would be best if you left.\u201d She walked across the kitchen and held open the back door. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Charles shook his head. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave.\u201d He pulled out a chair and threw himself down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk this out, once and for all,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d make a terrible couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make a good team.\u201d</p><p>Steffie didn\u2019t know why she was fighting him so hard\u2014especially when he was saying all the things she\u2019d always dreamed of hearing.</p><p>\u201cI realize I\u2019ve made some mistakes with this,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cIt might have sounded callous, offering to marry you the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that taking me off Dad\u2019s hands does lack a certain romantic flair,\u201d she agreed wryly. She crossed over to the counter for a coffee mug, filling it from the pot next to the stove. If they were going to talk seriously, without hurling accusations at each other, she was going to need it.</p><p>\u201cI was angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u2019d you come here?\u201d she asked, claiming the chair across from him.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he answered in a tight, angry voice, \u201cI was afraid I\u2019d lose you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLose me?\u201d That made no sense to Steffie.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d he growled. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d return to Italy or take off on a safari, or go someplace equally inaccessible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPortland. I\u2019m moving to Portland, but it isn\u2019t because of what happened with you. I intended to do that from the moment I got home.\u201d She folded her hands around the hot mug. \u201cWhy should you care where I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you leaving again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want me to stay, especially if you believe the things I told you yesterday?\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers. \u201cI don\u2019t believe them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave a good impression of it earlier,\u201d she reminded him. A fresh wave of pain assaulted her and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut the simple fact is I don\u2019t want you to leave again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately you don\u2019t have any say in what I do.\u201d</p><p>Charles frowned. \u201cNow you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that! Did you really think I was so desperate for a husband I\u2019d accept your insulting offer? Is that what you think of me, Charles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, dammit! I have been for years. I had to do something to keep you here. I don\u2019t want to wait another three years for you to come to your senses.\u201d</p><p>His words were followed by silence. Steffie stared down into her coffee, and to her chagrin felt tears well up in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Charles stood abruptly and walked to the window again. Hands clasped behind his back, he gazed outside. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be.\u201d She wiped the tears from her face. \u201cYou were so...so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel,\u201d he supplied. \u201cYou\u2019ll never understand how hard it was not to make love to you that first time in the stable. I\u2019ve never been more tempted by any woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...tempted you?\u201d Her voice was low and incredulous.</p><p>He turned around and smiled, but it was a sad smile, one full of doubts and regrets. \u201cI remember when you started hanging around the newspaper office. I was flattered by the attention. Soon I found myself looking forward to the times you came by. You were witty and generous and you always had an intelligent comment about something in the paper. I quickly discovered you were much more than a pretty face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never worked harder in my life to impress anyone,\u201d she murmured with self-deprecating humor.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t take Steffie long to get back to the point. \u201cIf that was how you felt, then why did you ask me not to come around anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to say something before I gave in and threw caution to the wind. You\u2019d recently lost your mother and you were young, naive and terribly vulnerable. I struggled with my conscience for weeks, trying to decide what I should do about you. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m six years older than you. That made a big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gap in our ages hasn\u2019t narrowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue enough, but you\u2019re not a girl anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was twenty-two,\u201d she argued. \u201cAt least by the time I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but you\u2019d been pretty sheltered. And you were still dealing with your grief. Your entire life had been jolted, and I couldn\u2019t be sure if what you felt for me was love or adolescent infatuation.\u201d</p><p>Steffie closed her eyes and let the warmth of his words revive her. \u201cIt was love,\u201d she told him. A love that had matured, grown more intense, in the years that separated them.</p><p>\u201cIt probably doesn\u2019t mean much to you now, but I want you to know how hard it was for me the night I came home and found you in my bathtub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were so angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either that or take you into my room and make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Steffie still felt confused. \u201cYou laughed at me when I told you how I felt that day in the stable....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said simply. Steffie heard the pain and remorse in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to do anything that\u2019s cost me more. But I never dreamed you\u2019d leave Orchard Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to do? I couldn\u2019t stay\u2014that would\u2019ve been impossible. So I did the only thing I could. I left.\u201d</p><p>Charles\u2019s hand reached for hers, twining their fingers together. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day I learned you\u2019d gone to Europe. I felt as if I\u2019d been hit by a bulldozer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to go,\u201d she repeated unnecessarily. \u201cIt was too painful to stay.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened around hers. \u201cI know.\u201d Slowly he raised her hand to his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve waited three long years to tell you how sorry I was to hurt you. Three years to tell you I was in love with you, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Steffie attempted with little success to blink back the tears.</p><p>\u201cIf it had been at any other time in your life, if I could\u2019ve been sure you weren\u2019t just trying to replace your mother\u2019s love with mine\u2014then everything would\u2019ve been different. But you were so young, so innocent. I couldn\u2019t trust myself around you, feeling the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his agreement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stephanie, for rejecting you. But it was as painful for me as it was for you. Perhaps more so, because I knew the whole truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou never wrote\u2014not once in all that time. Not so much as a postcard. Not even an e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t. I wanted to, but I didn\u2019t dare give in to the impulse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot patiently. I expected you to come home at least once in three years, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dreaded seeing you again. I was thousands of miles away from you and yet I still loved you, I still dreamed about you. It didn\u2019t seem to get any better. Even after three years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA few weeks ago, you\u2019d finished your classes and you were in the process of deciding if you were going to stay on in Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father. He was the only way I had of getting information about you, and I used him shamelessly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me you started coming by for visits shortly after I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t figure out how I felt about you. I don\u2019t think I could have been any more obvious if I\u2019d tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad didn\u2019t have a clue until recently and then only because of the\u2014\u201d She stopped when she realized what she was about to tell him.</p> <p>\u201cOf what?\u201d Charles prodded.</p><p>\u201cI...it would be best if you let Dad explain that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I will.\u201d He looked away from her momentarily. \u201cAlthough you never seriously dated anyone, there was someone in Italy, wasn\u2019t there? A man you cared about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Steffie frowned in bewilderment.</p><p>\u201cA man named Mario?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMario...a man?\u201d He was four now, and the delight of her heart while she\u2019d lived in Italy.</p><p>\u201cHe caused me several sleepless nights. Your father only mentioned him once. Said you \u2018adored\u2019 him. I went through agonies trying to be subtle about getting information on this guy, but your father never brought him up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMario,\u201d Steffie repeated, smiling broadly. \u201cYes, I did adore him.\u201d</p> <p>Charles scowled. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, Steffie said, \u201cThere was a slight discrepancy in our ages. I\u2019m more than twenty years older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what a kid. My landlady\u2019s son. I was crazy about him.\u201d Spending time with a loving, open child like Mario had helped her through a difficult period in her life.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A slow, easy smile slipped into place. \u201cSo you like children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that young man appreciates everything he put me through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t, but I certainly do. I know what it\u2019s like to love someone and have that someone not love you.\u201d</p><p>Charles considered her words for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Stephanie, but I didn\u2019t dare let you know. I couldn\u2019t trust what we felt for each other then\u2014but I can now.\u201d</p><p>She avoided his gaze. She had to ask, although she was afraid to. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, why were you so angry when Dad suggested we get married?\u201d</p><p>Charles sighed. \u201cFrustration, I guess. I\u2019d intended to propose the night we went for dinner. I had everything planned, down to the last detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t, not when the past still came between us. You made it clear you didn\u2019t want to discuss our misunderstandings. So my hands were tied. I hate to admit it, but I was nervous\u2014even if you didn\u2019t seem to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made it one of my wishes\u2014I didn\u2019t want to talk about the past,\u201d she recalled, experiencing an instant twinge of regret.</p><p>\u201cAnd I had to go along with it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t explain why you were so offended when Dad suggested we marry.\u201d His reaction was a mystery in light of the things he was telling her now.</p><p>\u201cA man prefers to propose himself,\u201d Charles offered as a simple explanation. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve made my intentions any plainer if I\u2019d hired a skywriter. Then to have first your father and then you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday I suddenly felt so afraid that you weren\u2019t lying about why you\u2019d stopped by the house. To deliver the finishing blow, to get me to admit I loved you and then laugh at me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I made that part up! I was so mad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s just that I had to say something. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d believe all those ridiculous lies, and then you seemed to and that made everything a thousand times worse. I was just beginning to hope we might have a future together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, too. That\u2019s why it hit me so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never intentionally hurt you, Charles. Not without hurting myself.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers, and everything around Steffie faded into insignificance. She was on the verge of disclosing her love when there was a knock at the kitchen door, followed by her father poking his head inside. \u201cIs it safe yet? You two looked like time bombs about to explode twenty minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe,\u201d Charles answered, smiling at Steffie.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ve got everything worked out because I\u2019m tired of waiting. The way I figure it, you should be married by the end of the summer. Your oldest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Steffie cut in. \u201cI don\u2019t think Charles is interested in discussing it right now. Why don\u2019t you leave all of that to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur oldest?\u201d Charles asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cChild, of course. A girl, then a son and then another daughter. Sweethearts, all three of them. The boy will be the spitting image of you, Charles\u2014same dark brown eyes, same facial features.\u201d</p><p>Charles glanced at Steffie as though he was questioning her father\u2019s sanity.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better tell Charles about the dream, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you haven\u2019t?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want to frighten him out of marrying into the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Charles\u2019s eyes roved from Steffie to her father and back.</p><p>\u201cYou may have trouble accepting this,\u201d David said, pulling out a chair and settling himself. He grinned, happy as Steffie could ever remember seeing him. \u201cBut I got a glimpse of the future. It was a gift from Grace. She wanted to be sure I had a reason to live and so she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t Grace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in heaven, but then so was I, briefly. It was what they call a near-death experience. You can ask Colby if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColby?\u201d Charles repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced he believes me one hundred percent, but time will prove me right. Look at what\u2019s happened with Valerie and Colby, just like I said it would. And with you two. You\u2019re going to marry this little girl of mine, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a heartbeat,\u201d Charles confirmed.</p><p>Her father\u2019s grin practically split his face. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was counting on. You love him, don\u2019t you, Princess?\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded. \u201cMore than I thought possible,\u201d she said in a hushed voice.</p><p>David smiled knowingly and stood up from his chair. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll leave you two to discuss the details of your wedding. I\u2019d like to suggest midsummer, but as I said, I\u2019ll leave that up to you.\u201d He sauntered out of the room.</p><p>\u201cMidsummer?\u201d Steffie shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me. Does that give you enough time?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cSure, and I\u2019ll be able to register for my courses, according to plan\u2014if that\u2019s okay with you?\u201d At his enthusiastic agreement, she added, \u201cUh...what do you think about Dad\u2019s dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boy and two girls, he says.\u201d</p><p>Steffie nodded shyly.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood, very good.\u201d</p><p>Charles reached for her then, taking her in his arms with the strength of a man who\u2019d been too long without love. He buried his face in the curve of her neck and breathed deeply. \u201cI nearly lost you for the second time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never have lost me, Charles. I\u2019ve loved you for so long, I don\u2019t know how not to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Stephanie. Give me a chance to prove it.\u201d</p><p>In her eyes, he\u2019d proved it when he hadn\u2019t laughed at her father\u2019s dream. She knew what he was thinking, perhaps because she was thinking the same thing herself. They were in love and had already decided to marry, so it didn\u2019t matter what her father had predicted after his supposed sojourn in the afterlife. It was the course they\u2019d willingly set for themselves.</p><p>He kissed her then, and her heart seemed to overflow with love, just as her eyes overflowed with tears.</p><p>\u201cStephanie,\u201d Charles whispered, his lips against hers. \u201cWe have a lot of time to make up for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take at least fifty years, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the very least,\u201d he murmured, kissing her again with a need that left her breathless.</p><p>David Bloomfield relaxed in his rocker on the front porch, his smile one of utter contentment. It was all coming to pass, just as he\u2019d known it would. Just as Grace had told him. First Valerie, and now Steffie. His grin widened.</p><p>My goodness, he thought. Norah\u2019s in for one heck of a surprise. </p> </body></html>"]
