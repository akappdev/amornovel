Apollo, or more likely Mars, the bringer of war, having taken human form and struck down from the heavens to be found by a maiden on her way home. Except that gods rarely bled.</p> <p>Or died, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cMr. Hedge,\u201d Lucy called over her shoulder.</p><p>She glanced around the lonely lane leading from the town of Maiden Hill to the Craddock-Hayes house. It appeared the same as it had been before she\u2019d made her find: deserted, except for herself; her manservant, puffing a ways behind her; and the corpse lying in the ditch. The sky hung low and wintry gray. The light had already begun to leak away, though it was not yet five o\u2019clock. Leafless trees lined the road, silent and chill.</p><p>Lucy shivered and drew her wrap more closely about her shoulders. The dead man sprawled, naked, battered, and facedown. The long lines of his back were marred by a mass of blood on his right shoulder. Below were lean hips; muscular, hairy legs; and curiously elegant, bony feet. She blinked and returned her gaze to his face. Even in death he was handsome. His head, turned to the side, revealed a patrician profile: long nose, high bony cheeks, and a wide mouth. An eyebrow, winging over his closed eye, was bisected by a scar. Closely cropped pale hair grew flat to his skull, except where it was matted by blood. His left hand was flung above his head, and on the index finger was the impression where a ring should have been. His killers must\u2019ve stolen it along with everything else. Around the body the mud was scuffed, the imprint of a boot heel stamped deep beside the dead man\u2019s hip. Other than that, there was no sign of whoever had dumped him here like so much offal.</p><p>Lucy felt silly tears prick at her eyes. Something about the way that he\u2019d been left, naked and degraded by his murderers, seemed a terrible insult to the man. It was so unbearably sad. Ninny, she chided herself. She became conscious of a muttering, drawing steadily closer. Hastily, she swiped at the moisture on her cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cFirst she visits the Joneses and all the little Joneses, snotty-nosed buggers. Then we march up the hill to Old Woman Hardy\u2014nasty biddy, don\u2019t know why she hasn\u2019t been put to bed with a shovel yet. And is that all? No, that\u2019s not all by half. Then, then she must needs call round the vicarage. And me carting great jars of jelly all the while.\u201d</p><p>Lucy suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. Hedge, her man, wore a greasy tricorne smashed down over a shock of gray hair. His dusty coat and waistcoat were equally disreputable, and he\u2019d chosen to highlight his bowlegs with scarlet-clocked stockings, no doubt Papa\u2019s castoffs.</p><p>He halted beside her. \u201cOh, gah, not a deader!\u201d</p><p>In his surprise, the little man had forgotten to stoop, but when she turned to him, his wiry body decayed before her eyes. His back curved, the shoulder bearing the awful weight of her now-empty basket fell, and his head hung to the side listlessly. As the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, Hedge took out a checkered cloth and laboriously wiped his forehead.</p><p>Lucy ignored all this. She\u2019d seen the act hundreds, if not thousands, of times in her life. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I would have described him as a deader, but he is indeed a corpse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, best not stand here gawping. Let the dead rest in peace, I always say.\u201d Hedge made to sidle past her.</p> <p>She placed herself in his path. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He was here before you trotted past. Wouldn\u2019t never have seen him, neither, if we\u2019d\u2019ve taken the shortcut through the common like I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, we did find him. Can you help me carry him?\u201d</p><p>Hedge staggered back in patent disbelief. \u201cCarry him? A great big bloke like that? Not unless you want me crippled for sure. My back\u2019s bad as it is, has been for twenty years. I don\u2019t complain, but still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Lucy conceded. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get a cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just leave him be?\u201d the little man protested. \u201cSomeone\u2019ll find him in a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hedge . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stabbed through the shoulder and all over bloody. It\u2019s not nice, that.\u201d Hedge screwed up his face until it resembled a rotted pumpkin.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean to be stabbed, through the shoulder or not, so I don\u2019t think we can hold that against him,\u201d Lucy chided.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s begun to go off!\u201d Hedge waved the handkerchief in front of his nose.</p><p>Lucy didn\u2019t mention that there hadn\u2019t been any smell until he\u2019d arrived. \u201cI\u2019ll wait while you go fetch Bob Smith and his cart.\u201d</p><p>The manservant\u2019s bushy gray eyebrows drew together in imminent opposition.</p><p>\u201cUnless you would prefer to stay here with the body?\u201d</p><p>Hedge\u2019s brow cleared. \u201cNo, mum. You knows best, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019ll just trot on over to the smithy\u2014\u201d</p><p>The corpse groaned.</p><p>Lucy looked down in surprise.</p><p>Beside her, Hedge jumped back and stated the obvious for both of them. \u201cJaysus Almighty Christ! That man ain\u2019t dead!\u201d</p><p>Dear Lord. And she\u2019d been standing here all this while, bickering with Hedge. Lucy swept off her wrap and threw it across the man\u2019s back. \u201cHand me your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Lucy didn\u2019t bother giving Hedge a look. She rarely used a sharp tone of voice, making it all the more effective when she did employ it.</p><p>\u201cAwww,\u201d the manservant moaned, but he tossed the coat to her.</p><p>\u201cGo fetch Doctor Fremont. Tell him it\u2019s urgent, and he must come at once.\u201d Lucy gazed sternly into her manservant\u2019s beady eyes. \u201cAnd, Mr. Hedge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease run.\u201d</p><p>Hedge dropped the basket and took off, moving surprisingly fast, his bad back forgotten.</p><p>Lucy bent and tucked Hedge\u2019s coat around the man\u2019s buttocks and legs. She held her hand under his nose and waited, barely breathing, until she felt the faint brush of air. He was indeed alive. She sat back on her heels and contemplated the situation. The man lay on the half-frozen mud and weeds of the ditch\u2014both cold and hard. That couldn\u2019t be good for him, considering his wounds. But as Hedge had noted, he was a big man, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could move him by herself. She peeled back a corner of the wrap covering his back. The slit in his shoulder was crusted with dried gore, the bleeding already stopped to her admittedly inexperienced eyes. Bruises bloomed across his back and side. Lord only knew what the front of him looked like.</p><p>And then there was the head wound.</p><p>She shook her head. He lay so still and white. No wonder she\u2019d mistaken him for dead. But all the same, Hedge could\u2019ve already been on his way to Doctor Fremont in the time they\u2019d taken to argue over the poor man.</p><p>Lucy checked again that he was breathing, her palm hovering above his lips. His breath was light but even. She smoothed the back of her hand over his cold cheek. Almost invisible stubble caught at her fingers. Who was he? Maiden Hill was not so big that a stranger could pass through it without notice. Yet she had heard no gossip about visitors on her rounds this afternoon. Somehow he\u2019d appeared here in the lane without anyone noticing. Then, too, the man had been obviously beaten and robbed. Why? Was he merely a victim, or had he somehow brought this fate upon himself?</p><p>Lucy hugged herself on the last thought and prayed Hedge would hurry. The light was fading fast and with it what little warmth the day had held. A wounded man lying exposed to the elements for Lord knows how long . . . She bit her lip.</p><p>If Hedge didn\u2019t return soon, there would be no need of a doctor.</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S DEAD.\u201d</p><p>The harsh words, spoken at Sir Rupert Fletcher\u2019s side, were much too loud in the crowded ballroom. He glanced around to see who stood near enough to overhear, then stepped closer to the speaker, Quincy James.</p><p>Sir Rupert gripped the ebony cane in his right hand, trying not to let his irritation show. Or his surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I said.\u201d James smirked. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I sent my men to do it.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert frowned, trying to comprehend this information. James had settled on a course of action by himself, and it had succeeded? \u201cHow many?\u201d he abruptly asked. \u201cYour men.\u201d</p><p>The younger man shrugged. \u201cThree. More than enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly this morning. I had a report just before I left.\u201d James flashed a cocky grin that gave him boyish dimples. Seeing his light blue eyes, regular English features, and athletic form, most would think him a pleasant, even attractive, young man.</p><p>Most would be wrong.</p><p>\u201cI trust the matter cannot be traced back to you.\u201d Despite his efforts, an edge must\u2019ve crept into Sir Rupert\u2019s voice.</p><p>James lost the smile. \u201cDead men can\u2019t tell tales.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d What an idiot. \u201cWhere did they do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside his town house.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert swore softly. To waylay a peer of the realm outside his own home in broad daylight was the work of a half-wit. His bad leg was giving him the very devil tonight and now this nonsense from James. He leaned more heavily on the ebony cane as he tried to think.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get worked up.\u201d James smiled nervously. \u201cN-n-no one saw them.\u201d</p><p>The elder man arched an eyebrow. Lord save him from aristocrats who decided to think\u2014let alone act\u2014on their own. There\u2019d been too many generations of leisure for the typical lordling to easily find his own prick to piss with, never mind something more complicated like planning an assassination.</p><p>James was blithely unaware of Sir Rupert\u2019s thoughts. \u201cBesides, they stripped the body and dumped it half a day\u2019s ride outside London. Nobody\u2019ll know him there. By the time it\u2019s found, there won\u2019t be much to recognize, will there? P-p-perfectly safe.\u201d The younger man\u2019s hand crawled up to poke a finger into his golden-yellow hair. He wore it unpowdered, probably as a vanity.</p><p>Sir Rupert took a sip of Madeira as he contemplated this latest development. The ballroom was a stifling crush, redolent of burning wax, heavy perfume, and body odor. The French doors leading into the garden had been thrown open to let in the cool night air, but they had little effect on the room\u2019s heat. The punch had given out a half hour before, and there were several hours yet before the midnight buffet. Sir Rupert grimaced. He didn\u2019t hold out much hope for the refreshments. Lord Harrington, his host, was notoriously stingy, even when entertaining the cream of society\u2014and a few upstarts such as Sir Rupert.</p><p>A narrow space had been cleared in the middle of the room for the dancers. They swirled in a rainbow of colors. Lasses in embroidered gowns and powdered hair. Gentlemen turned out in wigs and their uncomfortable best. He didn\u2019t envy the young people the pretty movements. They must be dripping sweat under their silks and lace. Lord Harrington would be gratified at the massive turnout so early in the season\u2014or rather, Lady Harrington would. That lady had five unmarried daughters, and she marshaled her forces like an experienced campaigner readying for battle. Four of her daughters were on the floor, each on the arm of an eligible gentleman.</p><p>Not that he could stand in judgment with three daughters under the age of four and twenty himself. All of them out of the schoolroom, all of them in need of suitable husbands. In fact . . . Matilda caught his eye from some twenty paces away where she stood with Sarah. She arched a brow and looked meaningfully at young Quincy James, who was still standing beside him.</p><p>Sir Rupert shook his head slightly\u2014he\u2019d rather let one of his daughters marry a rabid dog. Their communication was well developed after nearly three decades of marriage. His lady wife turned smoothly away to chat animatedly with another matron without ever revealing that she had exchanged information with her husband. Later tonight she might quiz him about James and ask why the young man wasn\u2019t up to snuff, but she wouldn\u2019t dream of badgering her husband right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If only his other partners were so circumspect.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re worried.\u201d James apparently couldn\u2019t stand the silence anymore. \u201cHe never knew about you. Nobody knew about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I prefer to keep it that way,\u201d Sir Rupert said mildly. \u201cFor all of our sakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wager you would. You left m-m-me and Walker and the other two for him to hunt in your stead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe would\u2019ve found you and the others in any case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s s-s-some who would still like to know about you.\u201d James scratched at his scalp so violently he nearly dislodged his queue.</p><p>\u201cBut it would not be in your best interest to betray me,\u201d Sir Rupert said flatly. He bowed to a passing acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I would let it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You profited as much as I from the business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen all\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for y-y-you to s-s-say.\u201d James\u2019s stutter was growing more frequent, a sign the man was agitated. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see Hartwell\u2019s body. He was skewered through the throat. Must\u2019ve bled to death. His seconds said the duel lasted only two minutes\u2014two minutes, mind you. A-a-awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better swordsman than Hartwell ever was,\u201d Sir Rupert said.</p><p>He smiled as his eldest, Julia, started a minuet. She was wearing a gown in a becoming shade of blue. Had he seen it before? He thought not. It must be new. Hopefully it hadn\u2019t beggared him. Her partner was an earl past his fortieth year. A mite old, but still, an earl . . .</p><p>\u201cP-p-peller was an excellent swordsman, too, and he was k-k-killed first.\u201d James\u2019s hysterical voice interrupted Sir Rupert\u2019s thoughts.</p> <p>He was too loud. Sir Rupert tried to calm him. \u201cJames\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenged at night and d-d-dead before breakfast the next morn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost three f-f-fingers trying to defend himself after the s-s-sword was wrenched from his hand. I had to search the g-g-grass for them afterward. G-g-god!\u201d</p><p>Nearby heads swiveled their way. The younger man\u2019s tone was growing louder.</p><p>Time to part.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Sir Rupert turned his head to meet James\u2019s gaze, holding and quelling him.</p><p>There was a tic under the other man\u2019s right eye. He inhaled to begin speaking.</p> <p>Sir Rupert got there first, his voice mild. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. You\u2019ve just told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-b-but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherefore, we have nothing further to worry about.\u201d Sir Rupert bowed and limped away. He badly needed another glass of Madeira.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019 LL NOT HAVE HIM IN MY HOUSE,\u201d Captain Craddock-Hayes pronounced, arms crossed over his barrel chest, feet braced as if on a rolling deck. His bewigged head was held high, sea-blue eyes pinned on a distant horizon.</p><p>He stood in the entrance hall to Craddock-Hayes house. Usually the hall was quite large enough for their needs. Right now, though, the hall seemed to have shrunk in proportion to the amount of people it held, Lucy thought ruefully, and the captain was right in the center of it.</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa.\u201d She dodged around him and waved the men carrying her stranger farther in. \u201cUpstairs in my brother\u2019s bedroom, I think. Don\u2019t you agree, Mrs. Brodie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, miss.\u201d The Craddock-Hayes housekeeper nodded. The frill of her mobcap, framing red cheeks, bobbed in time with the movement. \u201cThe bed\u2019s already made, and I can have the fire started in a tick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lucy smiled in approval. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Brodie.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper hurried up the stairs, her ample bottom swaying with each step.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even know who the blighter is,\u201d her father continued. \u201cMight be some tramp or murderer. Hedge said he was stabbed in the back. I ask you, what sort of a chap gets himself stabbed? Eh? Eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Lucy answered automatically. \u201cWould you mind moving to the side so the men can carry him past?\u201d</p><p>Papa shuffled obediently nearer the wall.</p><p>The laborers panted as they wrestled the wounded stranger inside. He lay so terribly still, his face pale as death. Lucy bit her lip and tried not to let her anxiety show. She didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t even know the color of his eyes; and yet it was vitally important that he live. He\u2019d been placed on a door to make it easier to carry him, but it was obvious that his weight and height still made the maneuver difficult. One of the men swore.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t have such language in my house.\u201d The captain glared at the offender.</p><p>The man flushed and mumbled an apology.</p><p>Papa nodded. \u201cWhat kind of a father would I be if I allowed any sort of gypsy or layabout into my home? With an unmarried gel in residence? Eh? A damned rotten one, that\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa.\u201d Lucy held her breath as the men negotiated the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the blighter must be taken somewhere else\u2014Fremont\u2019s house. He\u2019s the doctor. Or the poorhouse. Maybe the vicarage\u2014Penweeble can have a chance to show some Christian kindness. Ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re quite right, but he\u2019s already here,\u201d Lucy said soothingly. \u201cIt would be a shame to have to move him again.\u201d</p><p>One of the men on the stairs gave her a wild-eyed look.</p><p>Lucy smiled back reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cProbably won\u2019t live long in any case.\u201d Papa scowled. \u201cNo point ruining good sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure the sheets survive.\u201d Lucy started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about my supper?\u201d her father grumbled behind her. \u201cEh? Is anyone seeing to that while they rush about making room for scoundrels?\u201d</p><p>Lucy leaned over the rail. \u201cWe\u2019ll have supper on the table just as soon as I can see him settled.\u201d</p><p>Papa grunted. \u201cFine thing when the master of the house waits on the comfort of ruffians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being most understanding.\u201d Lucy smiled at her father.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>She turned to go up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cPoppet?\u201d</p><p>Lucy stuck her head back over the rail.</p><p>Her father was frowning up at her, bushy white eyebrows drawn together over the bridge of his bulbous red nose. \u201cBe careful with that fellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d her father muttered again behind her.</p><p>But Lucy hurried up the stairs and into the blue bedroom. The men had already transferred the stranger to the bed. They tramped back out of the room as Lucy entered, leaving a trail of mud.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in here, Miss Lucy.\u201d Mrs. Brodie gasped and pulled the sheet over the man\u2019s chest. \u201cNot with him like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him in far less just an hour ago, Mrs. Brodie, I assure you. At least now he\u2019s bandaged.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie snorted. \u201cNot the important parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not,\u201d Lucy conceded. \u201cBut I hardly think he poses any risk, the condition he\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, poor gentleman.\u201d Mrs. Brodie patted the sheet covering the man\u2019s chest. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky that you found him when you did. He\u2019d\u2019ve been frozen by morn for sure, left out there on the road. Who could\u2019ve done such a wicked thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody from Maiden Hill, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d The housekeeper shook her head. \u201cMust be riffraff down from London.\u201d</p><p>Lucy didn\u2019t point out that riffraff could be found even in Maiden Hill. \u201cDoctor Fremont said he\u2019d be around again in the morning to check his bandages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Mrs. Brodie looked doubtfully at the patient, as if assessing his odds of living to the next day.</p><p>Lucy took a deep breath. \u201cUntil then, I suppose we can only make him comfortable. We\u2019ll leave the door ajar in case he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d best be seeing to the captain\u2019s supper. You know how he gets if it\u2019s late. As soon as it\u2019s on the table, I\u2019ll send Betsy up to watch him.\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded. They only had the one maid, Betsy, but between the three women, they should be able to nurse the stranger. \u201cYou go. I\u2019ll be down in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, miss.\u201d Mrs. Brodie gave her an old-fashioned look. \u201cBut don\u2019t be too long. Your father will be wanting to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Lucy wrinkled her nose and nodded. Mrs. Brodie smiled in sympathy and left.</p><p>Lucy looked down at the stranger in her brother, David\u2019s, bed and wondered again, who was he? He was so motionless that she had to concentrate to see the slight rise and fall of his chest. The bandages about his head only emphasized his infirmity and highlighted the bruising on his brow. He looked so terribly alone. Was anyone worried about him, perhaps anxiously awaiting his return?</p><p>One of his arms lay outside the covers. She touched it.</p><p>His hand flashed up and struck at her wrist, capturing and holding it. Lucy was so startled she only had time for a frightened squeak. Then she was staring into the palest eyes she\u2019d ever seen. They were the color of ice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d he said distinctly.</p><p>For a moment, she thought the grim words were for her, and her heart seemed to stop in her breast.</p><p>His gaze shifted past her. \u201cEthan?\u201d The man frowned as if puzzled, and then he shut his weird eyes. Within a minute, the grip on her wrist grew slack and his arm fell back to the bed.</p><p>Lucy drew a breath. Judging from the ache in her chest, it was the first breath she\u2019d taken since the man had seized her. She stepped back from the bed and rubbed her tender wrist. The man\u2019s hand had been brutal; she\u2019d have bruises in the morning.</p><p>Whom had he spoken to?</p><p>Lucy shuddered. Whoever it was, she did not envy him. The man\u2019s voice held not a trace of indecision. In his own mind, there was no doubt that he would kill his enemy. She glanced again at the bed. The stranger was breathing slowly and deeply now. He looked like he was slumbering peacefully. If not for the pain in her wrist, she might have thought the whole incident a dream.</p><p>\u201cLucy!\u201d The bellow from below could only be her father.</p><p>Gathering her skirts, she left the room and ran down the stairs.</p><p>Papa was already seated at the head of the dinner table, a cloth tucked in at his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t like a late supper. Puts my digestion off. Can\u2019t sleep half the night because of the gurgling. Is it too much to ask for dinner to be on time in my own home? Is it? Eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Lucy sat in her chair at the right of her father. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie brought in a steaming roast beef crowded with potatoes, leeks, and turnips.</p><p>\u201cHa. That\u2019s what a man likes to see on his dinner table.\u201d Papa positively beamed as he picked up his knife and fork in preparation for carving. \u201cA good English beef. Smells most delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d The housekeeper winked at Lucy as she turned back to the kitchen.</p><p>Lucy smiled back. Thank goodness for Mrs. Brodie.</p><p>\u201cNow, then, have a bite of that.\u201d Papa handed her a plate heaped with food. \u201cMrs. Brodie knows how to make a fine roast beef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTastiest in the county. Need a bit of sustenance after gallivantin\u2019 all over the place this afternoon. Eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow have your memoirs gone today?\u201d Lucy sipped her wine, trying not to think of the man lying upstairs.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Excellent.\u201d Papa sawed enthusiastically at the roast beef. \u201cPut down a scandalous tale from thirty years ago. About Captain Feather\u2014he\u2019s an admiral now, damn him\u2014and three native island women. D\u2019you know these native gels don\u2019t wear any\u2014Ahurmph!\u201d He suddenly coughed and looked at her in what seemed like embarrassment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d Lucy popped a forkful of potato into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Never mind.\u201d Papa finished filling his plate and pulled it to where his belly met the table. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it\u2019ll light a fire under the old boy after all this time. Ha!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow delightful.\u201d Lucy smiled. If Papa ever did finish his memoirs and publish them, there would be a score of apoplectic fits in His Majesty\u2019s navy.</p><p>\u201cQuite. Quite.\u201d Papa swallowed and took a sip of wine. \u201cNow, then. I don\u2019t want you worrying over this scoundrel you\u2019ve brought home.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy\u2019s gaze dropped to the fork she held. It trembled slightly, and she hoped her father wouldn\u2019t notice the movement. \u201cNo, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done a good deed, Samaritan and all that. Just as your mother used to teach you from the Bible. She\u2019d approve. But remember\u201d\u2014he forked up a turnip\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve seen head wounds before. Some live. Some don\u2019t. And there\u2019s not a blessed thing you can do about it either way.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart sink in her chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019ll live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Papa barked impatiently. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. He might. He might not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lucy poked at a turnip and tried not to let the tears start.</p> <p>Her father slammed the flat of his hand down on the table. \u201cThis is just what I\u2019m warning you about. Don\u2019t get attached to the tramp.\u201d</p><p>A corner of Lucy\u2019s mouth twitched up. \u201cBut you can\u2019t keep me from feeling,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI\u2019ll do it no matter if I want to or not.\u201d</p><p>Papa frowned ferociously. \u201cDon\u2019t want you to be sad if he pops off in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my very best not to be sad, Papa,\u201d Lucy promised. But she knew it was too late for that. If the man died tonight, she would weep on the morrow, promises or no.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Her father returned to his plate. \u201cGood enough for now. If he survives, though, mark my words.\u201d He looked up and pinned her with his azure eyes. \u201cHe even thinks about hurting one hair on your head, and out he goes on his arse.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>The angel was sitting by his bed when Simon Iddesleigh, sixth Viscount Iddesleigh, opened his eyes.</p><p>He would\u2019ve thought it a terrible dream, one of an endless succession that haunted him nightly\u2014or worse, that he\u2019d not survived the beating and had made that final infinite plunge out of this world and into the flaming next. But he was almost certain hell did not smell of lavender and starch, did not feel like worn linen and down pillows, did not sound with the chirping of sparrows and the rustle of gauze curtains.</p><p>And, of course, there were no angels in hell.</p><p>Simon watched her. His angel was all in gray, as befit a religious woman. She wrote in a great book, eyes intent, level black brows knit. Her dark hair was pulled straight back from a high forehead and gathered in a knot at the nape of her neck. Her lips pursed slightly as her hand moved across the page. Probably noting his sins. The scratch of the pen on the page was what had woken him.</p><p>When men spoke of angels, especially in the context of the female sex, usually they were employing a flowery fillip of speech. They thought of fair-haired creatures with pink cheeks\u2014both kinds\u2014and red, wet lips. Insipid Italian putti with vacant blue eyes and billowy, soft flesh came to mind. That was not the type of angel Simon contemplated. No, his angel was the biblical kind\u2014Old Testament, not New. The not-quite-human, stern-and-judgmental kind. The type that was more apt to hurl men into eternal damnation with a flick of a dispassionate finger than to float on feathery pigeon wings. She wasn\u2019t likely to overlook a few flaws here and there in a fellow\u2019s character. Simon sighed.</p><p>He had more than just a few flaws.</p><p>The angel must have heard his sigh. She turned her unearthly topaz eyes on him. \u201cAre you awake?\u201d</p><p>He felt her gaze as palpably as if she\u2019d laid a hand on his shoulder, and frankly the feeling bothered him.</p> <p>Not that he let his unease show. \u201cThat depends on one\u2019s definition of awake,\u201d he replied in a croak. Even the little movement of speaking made his face hurt. In fact, his entire body seemed aflame. \u201cI am not sleeping, yet I have been more alert. I don\u2019t suppose you have such a thing as coffee to hasten the awakening process?\u201d He shifted to sit up, finding it more difficult than it should be. The coverlet slipped to his abdomen.</p><p>The angel\u2019s gaze followed the coverlet down, and she frowned at his bare torso. Already he was in her bad graces.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we don\u2019t have any coffee,\u201d she murmured to his navel, \u201cbut there is tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. There always is,\u201d Simon said. \u201cCould I trouble you to help me sit up? One finds oneself at a distressing disadvantage flat on one\u2019s back, not to mention the position makes it very hard to drink tea without spilling it into the ears.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him doubtfully. \u201cPerhaps I should get Hedge or my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise not to bite, truly.\u201d Simon placed a hand over his heart. \u201cAnd I hardly ever spit.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched.</p><p>Simon stilled. \u201cYou\u2019re not really an angel after all, are you?\u201d</p><p>One ebony brow arched ever so slightly. Such a disdainful look for a country miss; her expression would\u2019ve fit a duchess. \u201cMy name is Lucinda Craddock-Hayes. What is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Matthew Raphael Iddesleigh, viscount of, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He sketched a bow, which came off rather well in his opinion, considering he was prostrate.</p><p>The lady was unimpressed. \u201cYou\u2019re the Viscount Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not from around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere would be . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town of Maiden Hill in Kent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Kent? Why Kent? Simon craned his neck to try and see out the window, but the gauzy white curtain obscured it.</p><p>She followed his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re in my brother\u2019s bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of him,\u201d Simon muttered. Turning his head had made him realize something was wrapped about it. He felt with one hand, and his fingers encountered a bandage. Probably made him look a right fool. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever been to the lovely town of Maiden Hill; although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s quite scenic and the church a famous touring highlight.\u201d</p><p>Her full, red lips twitched again bewitchingly. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always are in the nicest towns.\u201d He looked down\u2014ostensibly to adjust the coverlet, in reality to avoid the strange temptation of those lips. Coward. \u201cI spend most of my wasted time in London. My own neglected estate lies to the north in Northumberland. Ever been to Northumberland?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her lovely topaz eyes watched him with a disconcertingly level stare\u2014almost like a man. Except Simon had never felt stirred by a man\u2019s glance.</p><p>He tsked. \u201cVery rural. Hence the appellative neglected. One wonders what one\u2019s ancestors were thinking, precisely, when they built the old pile of masonry so far out of the way of anything. Nothing but mist and sheep nearby. Still, been in the family for ages; might as well keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow good of you,\u201d the lady murmured. \u201cBut it does make me wonder why we found you only a half mile from here if you\u2019ve never been in the area before?\u201d</p><p>Quick, wasn\u2019t she? And not at all sidetracked by his blather. Intelligent women were such a bother. Which was why he should not be so fascinated by this one.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t the foggiest.\u201d Simon opened his eyes wide. \u201cPerhaps I had the good fortune to be attacked by industrious thieves. Not content to leave me lie where I fell, they spirited me off here so I might see more of the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. I doubt they meant for you to see anything ever again,\u201d she said quellingly.</p><p>\u201cMmm. And wouldn\u2019t that\u2019ve been a shame?\u201d he asked in false innocence. \u201cFor then I wouldn\u2019t have met you.\u201d The lady raised a brow and opened her mouth again, no doubt to practice her inquisition skills on him, but Simon beat her to it. \u201cYou did say there was tea about? I know I spoke of it disparagingly before, but really, I wouldn\u2019t mind a drop or two.\u201d</p><p>His angel actually flushed, a pale rose wash coloring her white cheeks. Ah, a weakness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Here, let me help you sit up.\u201d</p><p>She placed cool little hands on his arms\u2014an unsettlingly erotic touch\u2014and between them they managed to get him upright; although, by the time they did so, Simon was panting, and not just from her. His shoulder felt like little devils, or maybe saints in his case, were poking red-hot irons into it. He closed his eyes for a second, and when he opened them again, there was a cup of tea under his nose. He reached for it, then stopped and stared at his bare right hand. His signet ring was missing. They\u2019d stolen his ring.</p><p>She mistook the reason for his hesitation. \u201cThe tea is fresh, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost kind.\u201d His voice was embarrassingly weak. His hand shook as he grasped the cup, the familiar clink of his ring against the porcelain absent. He hadn\u2019t taken it off since Ethan\u2019s death. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll hold it for you.\u201d Her tone was soft, low and intimate, though she probably didn\u2019t know it. He could rest on that voice, float away on it and let his cares cease.</p><p>Dangerous woman.</p><p>Simon swallowed the lukewarm tea. \u201cWould you mind terribly writing a letter for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d She set the cup down and withdrew safely to her chair. \u201cTo whom would you like to write?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy valet, I think. Bound to be teased if I alert any of my acquaintances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we certainly wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d There was laughter in her voice.</p><p>He looked at her sharply, but her eyes were wide and innocent. \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand the problem,\u201d he said dryly. Actually, he was more worried that his enemies would learn that he was still alive. \u201cMy valet can bring down miscellaneous things like clean clothes, a horse, and money.\u201d</p><p>She laid aside her still-open book. \u201cHis name?\u201d</p><p>Simon tilted his head, but he couldn\u2019t see the book\u2019s page from this angle. \u201cHenry. At 207 Cross Road, London. What were you writing before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d She didn\u2019t look up.</p><p>Irritating. \u201cIn your book. What were you writing?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, the pencil immobile on the letter, her head still bent down.</p><p>Simon kept his expression light, though he grew infinitely more interested.</p><p>There was a silence as she finished scratching out the address; then she laid it aside and looked up at him. \u201cI was sketching, actually.\u201d She reached for the open book and placed it on his lap.</p><p>Drawings or cartoons covered the left page, some big, some small. A little bent man carrying a basket. A leafless tree. A gate with one hinge broken. On the right was a single sketch of a man asleep. Himself. And not looking his best, what with the bandage and all. It was an odd feeling, knowing she had watched him sleep.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Glad to be of some use.\u201d Simon turned back a page. Here, some of the drawings had been embellished by a watercolor wash. \u201cThese are quite good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Simon felt his lips curve at her sure reply. Most ladies feigned modesty when complimented on an accomplishment. Miss Craddock-Hayes was certain of her talent. He turned another page.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d The sketches on this page were of a tree changing with the seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall.</p><p>The rose tinted her cheeks again. \u201cThey\u2019re practice sketches. For a small book of prayers I want to give Mrs. Hardy in the village. It\u2019s to be a present on her birthday.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you do this often?\u201d He turned another page, fascinated. These weren\u2019t the pallid drawings of a bored lady. Her sketches had a kind of robust life to them. \u201cIllustrate books, that is?\u201d His mind was furiously working.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo, not often. I only do it for friends and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I can commission a work.\u201d He looked up in time to see her open her mouth. He continued before she could point out that he didn\u2019t fall under the heading friends. \u201cA book for my niece.\u201d</p><p>She closed her mouth and raised her eyebrows, waiting silently for him to continue.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind humoring a wounded man, of course.\u201d Shameless. For some reason it was important that he engage her.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of a book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a fairy tale, I think. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She took back her book and settled it on her lap, slowly turning to a blank page. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Oh, Christ, now he was on the spot, but at the same time he felt like laughing aloud. He hadn\u2019t felt this lighthearted in ages. Simon glanced hurriedly around the little room and caught sight of a small, framed map on the opposite wall. Sea serpents frolicked around the edges of the print. He smiled into her eyes. \u201cThe tale of the Serpent Prince.\u201d</p> <p>Her gaze dropped to his lips and then hastily up again. His smile grew wider. Ah, even an angel could be tempted.</p><p>But she only arched a brow at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised,\u201d he lied easily. \u201cIt was quite a favorite of my youth. Brings back fond memories, that, of bouncing on my old nurse\u2019s knee by the fire while she thrilled us with the tale.\u201d In for a penny, in for a pound.</p><p>She gave him a patently skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cNow let me see.\u201d Simon stifled a yawn. The pain in his shoulder had died to a dull throb, but his headache had increased as if to make up for it. \u201cOnce upon a time\u2014that\u2019s the prescribed way to begin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>The lady didn\u2019t help. She merely sat back in her chair and waited for him to make a fool of himself.</p> <p>\u201cThere lived a poor lass who made a meager living tending the king\u2019s goats. She was orphaned and quite alone in the world, except, of course, for the goats, who were rather smelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoats?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoats. The king was fond of goat cheese. Now hush, child, if you want to hear this.\u201d Simon tilted his head back. It was aching terribly. \u201cI believe her name was Angelica, if that\u2019s of any interest\u2014the goat girl, that is.\u201d</p><p>She merely nodded this time. She\u2019d picked up a pencil and had begun sketching in her book, although he couldn\u2019t see the page, so he didn\u2019t know if she was illustrating his story or not.</p><p>\u201cAngelica toiled every day, from the first light of dawn until the sun had long set, and all she had for company were the goats. The king\u2019s castle was built on top of a cliff, and the goat girl lived at the foot of the cliff in a little stick hut. If she looked far, far up, past the sheer rocks, past the shining white stone of the castle walls to the very turrets, sometimes she could just catch a glimpse of the castle folk in their jewels and fine robes. And once in a very great while, she would see the prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Serpent Prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head, her eyes still on her drawing. \u201cThen why is the fairy tale called The Serpent Prince if he isn\u2019t the Serpent Prince?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe comes later. Are you always this impatient?\u201d he asked sternly.</p><p>She glanced up at him then as her lips slowly curved into a smile. Simon was struck dumb, all thought having fled from his mind. Her fine, jeweled eyes crinkled at the corners, and a single dimple appeared on the smooth surface of her left cheek. She positively glowed. Miss Craddock-Hayes really was an angel. Simon felt a strong, almost violent, urge to thumb away that dimple. To lift her face and taste her smile.</p><p>He closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t want this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he heard her say. \u201cI won\u2019t interrupt again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right. I\u2019m afraid my head hurts. No doubt from having it bashed in the other day.\u201d Simon stopped babbling as something occurred to him. \u201cWhen, exactly, was I found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo days ago.\u201d She rose and gathered her book and pens. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to rest. I can write the letter to your valet in the meantime and post it. Unless you would like to read it first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d Simon sank into the pillows, his ringless hand lax on the coverlet. He kept his voice casual. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>She paused, halfway out, and shot him an enigmatic look over her shoulder. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any when I found you.\u201d She closed the door quietly.</p><p>Simon blinked. Usually he didn\u2019t lose his clothes until at least the second meeting with a lady.</p><p>\u201cTHE VICAR\u2019S HERE TO SEE YOU, MISS.\u201d Mrs. Brodie poked her head into the sitting room the next morning.</p><p>Lucy sat on the blue damask settee, darning one of Papa\u2019s socks. She sighed and glanced at the ceiling, wondering if the viscount had heard her visitor below his window. She didn\u2019t even know if he was awake yet; she hadn\u2019t seen him this morning. Something about his amused gray eyes, so alert and alive, had flustered her yesterday. She was unaccustomed to being flustered, and the experience wasn\u2019t pleasant. Hence her cowardly avoidance of the wounded man since leaving him to write his letter.</p><p>She laid aside her mending now. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Brodie.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper gave her a wink before hurrying back to the kitchen, and Lucy rose to greet Eustace. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Eustace Penweeble, the vicar of Maiden Hill\u2019s little church, nodded his head at her as he had every Tuesday, barring holidays and bad weather, for the past three years. He smiled shyly, running his big, square hands around the brim of the tricorne he was holding. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day. Would you care to come with me as I make my rounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Good,\u201d he replied.</p><p>A lock of brown hair escaped from his queue and fell over his forehead, making him look like an immense little boy. He must have forgotten the powdered, bobbed wig of his station again. Just as well. Lucy privately thought he looked better without it. She smiled at him fondly, gathered her waiting wrap, and preceded Eustace out the door.</p><p>The day was indeed beautiful. The sun was so bright it nearly blinded her as she stood on the granite front step. The ancient orange brick of Craddock-Hayes House looked mellow, the light reflecting off the mullioned windows in front. Old oak trees lined the gravel drive. They\u2019d already lost their leaves, but their crooked branches made interesting shapes against the crisp, blue sky. Eustace\u2019s trap waited near the door, Hedge at the horse\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cMay I assist you in?\u201d Eustace asked politely as if she might actually turn him down.</p><p>Lucy placed her hand in his.</p><p>Hedge rolled his eyes and muttered under his breath, \u201cEvery blamed Tuesday. Why not a Thursday or Friday, for Jaysus\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>Eustace frowned.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice overrode the manservant\u2019s, drawing Eustace\u2019s eyes away from him. She made a production out of settling herself.</p><p>The vicar got in next to her and took the reins. Hedge retreated to the house, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d drive around to the church, if that meets with your approval.\u201d Eustace chirruped to the horse. \u201cThe sexton has alerted me that there may be a leak in the roof over the vestry. You can give me your opinion.\u201d</p><p>Lucy just refrained from murmuring an automatic how delightful. She smiled instead. They bowled out of the Craddock-Hayes drive and into the lane where she\u2019d found the viscount. The road looked innocent enough in the light of day, the empty trees no longer menacing. They topped a rise. Dry stone walls rolled over the chalk hills in the distance.</p><p>Eustace cleared his throat. \u201cYou visited Mistress Hardy recently, I understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy turned to him politely. \u201cI brought her some calf\u2019s foot jelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did you find her? Has her ankle healed from the tumble she took?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still had it up, but she was feisty enough to complain that the jelly was not as tasty as hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, good. She must be getting better if she can complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought myself.\u201d</p><p>Eustace smiled at her, coffee-brown eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful help to me, keeping track of the villagers.\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded and tilted her face into the wind. Eustace frequently made similar comments. In the past they\u2019d been comforting, if dull. Today, though, she found his complacency slightly irritating.</p><p>But Eustace was still talking. \u201cI wish some of the other ladies of the village would be so charitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you mean?\u201d</p><p>A wash of red stained his cheekbones. \u201cYour friend Miss McCullough, for one. She spends most of her time gossiping, I think.\u201d</p><p>Lucy raised her eyebrows. \u201cPatricia does like a good gossip, but she\u2019s really quite kind underneath.\u201d</p><p>He looked skeptical. \u201cI will accept your word on the matter.\u201d</p><p>A herd of cows crowded the road, milling stupidly. Eustace slowed the trap and waited while the cowherd followed his charges off the thoroughfare and into a field.</p><p>He shook the reins to start the horse again and waved to the man as they passed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard you had an adventure the other day.\u201d</p><p>Lucy was unsurprised. Probably the whole town had news of her find within minutes of Hedge summoning Doctor Fremont. \u201cIndeed. We discovered the man right over there.\u201d She pointed and felt a shudder run up her spine as she saw the spot where she\u2019d found the viscount so close to death.</p><p>Eustace dutifully looked at the ditch. \u201cYou should be more careful in the future. The fellow might\u2019ve been up to no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was unconscious,\u201d Lucy said mildly.</p><p>\u201cStill. It\u2019s best not to wander about by yourself.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cWouldn\u2019t do to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Did Eustace think her a complete wigeon? She tried not to let annoyance show. \u201cI was with Mr. Hedge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Of course. But Hedge is a small man and getting on in years.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked at him.</p><p>\u201cRight. Just to keep in mind for the future.\u201d He cleared his throat again. \u201cDo you have any idea who the fellow you found is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe woke yesterday,\u201d Lucy said carefully. \u201cHe says his name is Simon Iddesleigh. He\u2019s a viscount.\u201d</p><p>Eustace twitched the reins. The horse, an aging gray, shook its head. \u201cA viscount? Really? I suppose he\u2019s a gouty old boy.\u201d</p><p>She remembered the quick eyes and quicker tongue. And the expanse of bare chest she\u2019d seen when the coverlet had slipped. The viscount\u2019s skin had been smooth and taut, long muscles running underneath. The dark brown of his nipples had contrasted quite explicitly with the pale surrounding skin. Really, she shouldn\u2019t have noticed such a thing.</p><p>Lucy cleared her throat and turned her gaze to the road. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s much over thirty.\u201d</p><p>She felt Eustace shoot a glance at her. \u201cThirty. Still. A viscount. A bit rich for Maiden Hill blood, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>What a depressing thought! \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what he was doing here anyway.\u201d</p><p>They had reached Maiden Hill proper now, and Lucy nodded to two elderly ladies haggling with the baker. \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Both ladies smiled and waved at them. As they drove past, the gray heads bent together.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, here we are.\u201d Eustace pulled the trap alongside the little Norman church and jumped down. He crossed around and carefully helped her descend. \u201cNow, then. The sexton said the leak was in the nave. . . .\u201d He strode to the back of the church, commenting on its general shape and the needed repairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy had heard all of this before. In the three years they\u2019d been courting, Eustace had often brought her by the church, perhaps because that was where he felt most in command. She listened with half an ear and strolled behind him. She couldn\u2019t imagine the sardonic viscount going on and on about a roof, especially a church roof. In fact, she winced to think what he would say about the matter\u2014something sharp, no doubt. Not that the viscount\u2019s probable reaction made church roofs unimportant. Someone had to look out for the details that kept life running, and in a small village, the matter of a church roof leaking was rather large.</p><p>The viscount most likely spent his days\u2014and nights\u2014in the company of ladies like himself. Frivolous and witty, their only care the trimming on their gown and the style of their hair. Such people had very little use in her world. Still . . . the viscount\u2019s banter was amusing. She\u2019d suddenly felt more awake, more alive when he\u2019d started bamming her, as if her mind had caught a spark and was lit.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go look inside. I want to make sure the leak hasn\u2019t worsened the mold on the walls.\u201d Eustace turned and entered the church, then popped his head back out. \u201cThat is, if you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Lucy said.</p> <p>Eustace grinned. \u201cGood girl.\u201d He disappeared back inside.</p><p>Lucy followed slowly, trailing her hands over the weathered tombstones in the churchyard. The Maiden Hill church had stood here since shortly after the Conqueror had landed. Her ancestors hadn\u2019t been here that long, but many Craddock-Hayes bones graced their small mausoleum in the corner of the cemetery. As a girl, she\u2019d played here after church on Sundays. Her parents had met and married in Maiden Hill and spent their entire life here, or at least Mama had. Papa had been a sea captain and had sailed around the world, as he liked to tell anyone who would listen. David was a sailor as well. He was on the ocean at this very moment, perhaps nearing an exotic port of call. For a moment Lucy felt a stab of envy. How wonderful it would be to choose one\u2019s own destiny, to decide to become a doctor or artist or sailor on the open seas. She had a fancy that she wouldn\u2019t be half bad as a sailor. She\u2019d stand on the poop deck, the wind in her hair, the sails creaking overhead, and\u2014</p><p>Eustace looked round the church door. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>Lucy blinked and conjured a smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>SIMON EXTENDED HIS RIGHT ARM at shoulder height and very carefully lifted it. Flames of pain pulsed across his shoulder and down the arm. Damn. It was the day after he\u2019d woken to find Miss Craddock-Hayes sitting beside him\u2014and he hadn\u2019t seen her since. A fact that irritated him. Was she avoiding him? Or worse\u2014did she just not feel inclined to visit him again? Maybe he\u2019d bored her.</p> <p>He winced at that depressing thought. His head was better, and they\u2019d removed the ridiculous bandages, but his back still felt like it was on fire. Simon lowered the arm and breathed deeply while the pain subsided to a dull ache. He looked down at his arm. His shirtsleeve ended six inches short of his wrist. This was because the shirt he was wearing belonged to David, the absent brother of the angel. Judging from the length of the garment, which made rising from the bed embarrassing, the brother was a midget.</p><p>Simon sighed and glanced around the little room. The one window had begun to darken with night. The room was large enough to hold the bed\u2014which was rather narrow for his taste\u2014a wardrobe and dresser, a single table by the bed, and two chairs. That was all. Spartan by his standards, but not a bad place to convalesce in, especially since there was no other choice. At the moment, the fire was dying, making the room chill. But the cold was the least of his worries. He needed his right arm to hold a sword. Not just to hold it, but to parry, riposte, and repel. And to kill.</p><p>Always to kill.</p><p>His enemies may not have murdered him, but they\u2019d certainly disabled his right arm, at least for a while\u2014maybe permanently. Not that it would stop him in his duty. They\u2019d killed his brother after all. Nothing but death could stop him in his pursuit of vengeance. Nevertheless, he must be able to defend himself when next they attacked. He gritted his teeth against the pain and raised the arm again. He\u2019d dreamed last night of fingers again. Fingers blooming like bloody buttercups in the green grass at Peller\u2019s feet. In his dream, Peller had tried to pick up his severed digits, horribly scrabbling in the grass with his mutilated hands. . . .</p><p>The door opened and the angel entered, carrying a tray. Simon turned to her gratefully, glad to push aside the madness in his mind. Like the last time he\u2019d seen her, she was dressed in nun gray with her dark hair pulled into a simple knot at the back of her neck. Probably she had no idea how erotic a woman\u2019s nape could be when exposed. He could see little wisps of hair curling there and the beginning of the delicate slope of her white shoulders. Her skin would be soft, vulnerable, and if he ran his lips along that angle where shoulder met neck, she would shiver. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at the thought, like a half-wit given a cherry pie.</p><p>She frowned austerely at him. \u201cShould you be doing that?\u201d</p> <p>Most likely she was referring to his exercise, not the fatuous expression on his face. \u201cUndoubtedly not.\u201d He lowered his arm. This time it felt like only a thousand bees were stinging it.</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest you stop and have some supper.\u201d She put the tray down on the table by his bed and went to the hearth to stir the fire, returning with a taper to light the candles.</p><p>He raised his arm. \u201cAh. What delectable dishes do you have there? Pap in warm milk? A cup of beef tea?\u201d Such had been the menu for the last two days. Hard, dry bread was beginning to sound downright delicious.</p><p>\u201cNo. A slice of Mrs. Brodie\u2019s beef and kidney pie.\u201d</p><p>He lowered the arm too fast and had to bite back a groan. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now stop that.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head in a teasing half-bow. \u201cAs my lady commands.\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrow at him but didn\u2019t comment. Simon watched her remove the dish cover. Praise whatever saints would listen, the lady did not lie. A thick slab of meat pie reposed on the plate.</p> <p>\u201cBlessed, blessed lady.\u201d He broke off a piece of crust with his fingers and almost wept when it touched his tongue. \u201cLike the ambrosia of the gods. You must tell the cook that I am overwhelmed with devotion and will die if she won\u2019t run away with me at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her that you thought the pie very good.\u201d She placed a slice of pie on a plate and handed it to him.</p><p>He settled the plate on his lap. \u201cYou refuse to convey my offer of marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention marriage the first time. You only offered to disgrace poor Mrs. Brodie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe love of my life is named Mrs. Brodie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s because she\u2019s married to Mr. Brodie, who is away at sea at present.\u201d She sat in the chair by his bedside and looked at him. \u201cYou might be interested to know that he is considered the strongest man in Maiden Hill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? And by that remark, I suppose you wish to cast aspersions on my strength?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze wandered over his form, and his breath quickened.</p><p>\u201cYou are lying in bed recovering from a near-fatal beating,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cA mere technicality,\u201d he said airily.</p><p>\u201cBut a decisive one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He forked up some of the pie. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there is red wine as well?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a chiding look. \u201cWater for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much to hope for, I agree.\u201d He swallowed a meat-filled bite. \u201cYet the wise men do counsel us to be content with what we have and so I shall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re torturing yourself by exercising your arm?\u201d</p><p>He avoided her topaz eyes. \u201cBoredom, simple boredom, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten how quick she was. He smiled charmingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t get very far with my fairy tale last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really have a niece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. Would I lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think, yes. And you don\u2019t seem the kind of man who would be a doting uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. What kind of man do I seem to you?\u201d he asked without thinking.</p><p>She cocked her head. \u201cOne who tries too hard to hide his soul.\u201d</p><p>Good God. For the life of him he didn\u2019t know how to reply to that.</p><p>Her lips twitched in that bewitching way she had. \u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYes, now as to my fairy tale, where was I?\u201d What a spineless ass he was! Next he would be fleeing toddlers with sticks. \u201cPoor Angelica, the goat maid, the tall, white castle, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prince who wasn\u2019t the Serpent Prince.\u201d She conceded defeat and picked up a charcoal stick. She\u2019d brought a different book this time\u2014one bound in sapphire blue\u2014and she opened it now, presumably to draw his story.</p><p>A great feeling of relief came over him that she wouldn\u2019t pursue her questions, wouldn\u2019t find him out\u2014at least not yet. Maybe never, if he was lucky.</p><p>He tucked into the pie, speaking between bites. \u201cQuite. The prince who wasn\u2019t the Serpent Prince. Need I mention that this prince was a fine, handsome fellow with golden curling hair and sky-blue eyes? In fact, he was almost as beautiful as Angelica herself, who rivaled the sparkle of the stars with her midnight tresses and eyes the color of treacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTreacle.\u201d Her voice had a disbelieving, flat tone, but her mouth pursed as if she fought back a smile.</p><p>How he wanted to make her smile. \u201cMmm, treacle,\u201d he said softly. \u201cEver noticed how pretty treacle is when light shines through it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only noticed how very sticky it is.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cNow, although poor Angelica was as beautiful as a celestial orb, there was no one about to notice. She had only the goats to keep her company. So imagine her thrill when she did catch a glimpse of the prince. He was a person far, far above her, both literally and figuratively, and she longed to meet him. To gaze into his eyes and watch the expressions on his face. Merely that, for she dared not hope to even speak to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Miss Craddock-Hayes murmured the question.</p><p>\u201cTo be frank, it was the goats,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cAngelica was rather conscious of the odor she\u2019d picked up from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her lips twitched, reluctantly forming a curving smile.</p><p>And a strange thing happened. His cock twitched as well, although what it formed was definitely not a curve\u2014or a smile, for that matter. Good Lord, how gauche to become blue-veined over a girl\u2019s smile. Simon coughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d She\u2019d lost the smile\u2014thank God\u2014but now she was looking at him with concern, which was not an emotion he usually elicited in the fairer sex.</p><p>His pride would never recover from this low. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He took a drink of water. \u201cWhere was I? Ah, yes, so it seemed that Angelica would spend the rest of her days mooning about for the golden-haired prince, doomed to never even be on the same level as he. But one day something happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope so; otherwise, this would be a terribly short fairy tale,\u201d Miss Craddock-Hayes said. She\u2019d turned back to her sketchbook.</p><p>He chose to disregard her interruption. \u201cLate one evening, Angelica went to herd her goats home, and as she did every night, she counted them. But on this night the count was one short. The smallest of her goats, a black nanny with one white foot, was missing. Just then she heard a very faint bleat that seemed to come from the cliff on which the castle was built. She looked but saw nothing. Again the bleat came. So Angelica climbed as close as she could to the cliff, always following the bleating, and imagine her surprise when she discovered a crack in the rock.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused to take a sip of water. She didn\u2019t glance up. Her face looked so serene in the firelight, and even though her hand moved swiftly over the page, she seemed to have a stillness within her. Simon realized that he felt comfortable with this woman he hardly knew at all.</p><p>He blinked and began his story again. \u201cThere seemed to be a flickering light coming from the crack. The space was narrow, but Angelica found that if she turned sideways, she could just slip in, and when she did, she saw an astonishing thing. A very strange man\u2014or at least he seemed to be a man. He was tall and lean and had long silver hair, and he was quite, quite nude. He stood in the light of a small, blue-flamed fire that was burning in a brazier.\u201d</p><p>Her brows arched.</p><p>\u201cBut what was strangest of all, was that as Angelica watched, he seemed to vanish. When she went to look where he had stood, there lay a giant silver snake, coiled around the base of the brazier.\u201d He absently rubbed his index finger, running his thumb against the place his ring should be. Suddenly he was very tired.</p> <p>\u201cAh, at last we come to the infamous Serpent Prince.\u201d She looked up and must have caught the weariness in his expression. Her own face sobered. \u201cHow does your back feel?\u201d</p><p>Like hell. \u201cPlucky, just plucky. I think the knife wound may\u2019ve actually improved it.\u201d</p><p>She watched him for a moment. And for the life of him, even with all his years of studying women, he\u2019d not a clue as to what she thought.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever serious?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot ever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought not.\u201d Her eyes were intent on him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looked away. He could not sustain that intense, too-perceptive regard. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAs to whether or not it matters . . . Well, that isn\u2019t for me to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d It was his turn to stare at her, pressuring her to admit . . . what? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He opened his mouth to argue further, but some belated sense of self-preservation stopped him.</p> <p>She inhaled. \u201cYou should rest, and I\u2019ve been keeping you up.\u201d His angel shut her book and rose. \u201cI sent the letter to your valet yesterday. He should receive it soon.\u201d</p><p>He let his head fall back against the pillows and watched her as she gathered the empty dishes. \u201cThank you, beautiful lady.\u201d</p><p>She paused by the door and looked back at him. The candlelight flickered over her face, turning it into a Renaissance painting, most fitting for an angel. \u201cAre you safe here?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was soft, and he had begun to drift into dreams, so he wasn\u2019t sure of the words\u2014hers or his.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cIddesleigh. Iddesleigh.\u201d Papa frowned as he chewed his gammon steak, his chin jerking up and down. \u201cKnew an Iddesleigh in the navy when I sailed The Islander five and twenty years ago. Midshipman. Used to get terribly seasick right out of port. Always hanging over the middeck rail looking green and heaving up his accounts. Any relation?\u201d</p><p>Lucy suppressed a sigh. Papa had been twitting the viscount all through supper. Normally, her father enjoyed entertaining new guests. They were a fresh audience for his hoary sea stories, retold countless times to his children, neighbors, servants, and anyone else who would hold still long enough to listen. But something about Lord Iddesleigh had gotten her father\u2019s back up. This was the first meal the poor man had been able to come down for after spending the last four days bedridden. The viscount sat at the table appearing urbane and at ease. One had to look closely to notice he still favored his right arm.</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t blame him if he hid in his room after tonight. And that would disappoint her terribly. Even though she knew, deep in her soul, that she should stay away from the viscount, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from thinking about him. All the time. It was really rather irritating. Perhaps it was merely the novelty of a new person in her narrow circle of acquaintances. After all, she\u2019d known the people she saw every day since infancy. On the other hand, maybe it was the man himself, and wasn\u2019t that an uncomfortable thought?</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe so.\u201d Lord Iddesleigh answered her father\u2019s question as he helped himself to more boiled potatoes. \u201cAs a rule, the members of my family avoid anything resembling work. Much too taxing, and it has an unfortunate tendency to lead to sweat. We much prefer to idle our days away eating cream cakes and discussing the latest gossip.\u201d</p><p>Then again, Lucy reflected, the younger man did seem to be holding his own with her father. Papa\u2019s eyes narrowed ominously.</p><p>She picked up a basket and waved it under her parent\u2019s nose. \u201cMore bread? Mrs. Brodie baked it fresh this morning.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her ploy. \u201cOld landed gentry, are they?\u201d Papa sawed vigorously at his meat while he spoke. \u201cLet others toil on their land, eh? Spend all their time in the sinful fleshpots of London instead?\u201d</p><p>Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake! Lucy gave up and set the bread basket down. She would enjoy the meal even if no one else did. Their dining room was hopelessly out of date, but it was cozy for all that. She tried to focus on her surroundings rather than on the distressing conversation. She turned to her left, noting in approval the cheerfully burning fire.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes, I quite like a fleshpot now and then,\u201d Lord Iddesleigh said, smiling benignly. \u201cThat is, when I can find the energy to get myself out of bed. Have since I was but a tiny lad in leading strings accompanied by my nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally\u2014\u201d she began, only to be cut off as Papa snorted. She sighed and looked to the other end of the room where a single door led into the hall and then the kitchen. It was so nice that the room wasn\u2019t cursed by a draft.</p><p>\u201cAlthough,\u201d the viscount continued, \u201cI must confess I\u2019m a bit hazy on what exactly constitutes a fleshpot.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s gaze dropped to the table\u2014the only safe thing to look at in the room at the moment. The old walnut dining table wasn\u2019t long, but that made meals all the more intimate. Mama had chosen the striped burgundy and cream wallpaper before Lucy\u2019d been born, and Papa\u2019s collection of sailing ship prints graced the walls\u2014</p><p>\u201cI mean, flesh and pot, how did the two come together?\u201d Lord Iddesleigh mused. \u201cI trust we are not discussing chamber pots\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dangerous territory! Lucy smiled determinedly and interrupted the awful man. \u201cMrs. Hardy told me the other day that someone let Farmer Hope\u2019s pigs out. They scattered for half a mile, and it took Farmer Hope and his boys a whole day to get them back.\u201d</p><p>No one paid attention.</p><p>\u201cHa. From the Bible, fleshpot is.\u201d Papa leaned forward, apparently having scored a point. \u201cExodus. Have read the Bible, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear. \u201cEveryone thought it might be the Jones boys that let them out,\u201d Lucy said loudly. \u201cThe pigs, I mean. You know how the Joneses are always up to mischief. But when Farmer Hope went round to the Jones place, what do you think? Both boys were in bed with fever.\u201d</p><p>The men never took their gaze from each other.</p><p>\u201cNot recently, I confess.\u201d The viscount\u2019s icy silver eyes sparkled innocently. \u201cToo busy idling my life away, don\u2019t you know. And fleshpot means . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrumph. Fleshpot.\u201d Papa waved his fork, nearly spearing Mrs. Brodie as she brought in more potatoes. \u201cEveryone knows what fleshpot means. Means fleshpot.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie rolled her eyes and set the potatoes down hard at Papa\u2019s elbow. Lord Iddesleigh\u2019s lips twitched. He raised his glass to his mouth and watched Lucy over the rim as he drank.</p><p>She could feel her face warm. Must he look at her like that? It made her uncomfortable, and she was sure it couldn\u2019t be polite. She grew even more warm when he set the glass down and licked his lips, his eyes still holding hers. Wretch!</p><p>Lucy looked away determinedly. \u201cPapa, didn\u2019t you once tell us an amusing story about a pig on your ship? How it got out and ran around the deck and none of the men could catch it?\u201d</p><p>Her father was staring grimly at the viscount. \u201cAye, I\u2019ve got a story to tell. Might be educational for some. About a frog and a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting,\u201d Lord Iddesleigh drawled. \u201cDo tell us.\u201d He leaned back in his chair, his hand still fiddling with the glass stem.</p><p>He wore David\u2019s old clothes, none of which fit him, her brother being shorter and broader in the torso. The scarlet coat\u2019s sleeves let his bony wrists stick out and at the same time the coat hung about his neck. He had gained some color in his face in the last days to replace the awful dead white he\u2019d sported when she\u2019d first found him, although his face seemed to be naturally pale. He should have looked ridiculous, yet he did not.</p><p>\u201cOnce there was a little frog and a great big snake,\u201d Papa began. \u201cThe snake wanted to cross a stream. But snakes can\u2019t swim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d the viscount murmured. \u201cDon\u2019t some types of vipers take to the water to catch their prey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis snake couldn\u2019t swim,\u201d Papa amended. \u201cSo he asked the frog, \u2018Can you take me across?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lucy had stopped even pretending to eat. She switched her gaze back and forth between the men. They were engaged in a conflict with multiple layers that she was powerless to influence. Her father leaned forward, red-faced under his white wig, obviously intent. The viscount was bare-headed, pale hair glinting in the candlelight. On the surface he was relaxed and at ease, maybe even a little bored, but below that surface she knew he was just as focused as the older man.</p><p>\u201cAnd the frog says, \u2018I\u2019m not a fool. Snakes eat frogs. You\u2019ll gobble me down, sure as I\u2019m sitting here.\u2019\u201d Papa paused to take a drink.</p><p>The room was silent, save for the snap of the fire.</p><p>He set down his glass. \u201cBut that snake, he was a sly one, he was. He said to the little frog, \u2018Never fear, I\u2019d drown if I ate you crossing that big stream.\u2019 So the frog thinks things over and decides the snake is right; he\u2019s safe while he\u2019s in the water.\u201d</p><p>Lord Iddesleigh sipped his wine, his eyes watchful and amused. Betsy began clearing the dishes, her fat, red hands quick and light.</p><p>\u201cThe snake creeps on the little frog\u2019s back, and they start into the stream, and halfway across, do you know what happens?\u201d Papa glared at their guest.</p><p>The viscount slowly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat snake sinks his fangs into the frog.\u201d Papa slapped the table to emphasize his point. \u201cAnd the frog, with his last breath, calls, \u2018Why did you do that? We\u2019ll both die now.\u2019 And the snake says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the nature of snakes to eat frogs.\u201d Lord Iddesleigh\u2019s voice mingled with her father\u2019s.</p><p>Both men stared at each other for a moment. Every muscle in Lucy\u2019s body tightened.</p><p>The viscount broke the tension. \u201cSorry. That story made the rounds several years ago. I just couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d He drained his glass and set it carefully by his plate. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s in my nature to spoil another man\u2019s tale.\u201d</p><p>Lucy let out a breath she didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been holding. \u201cWell. I know Mrs. Brodie has made apple tart for dessert, and she has a lovely cheddar cheese to go with it. Would you care for some, Lord Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and smiled, his wide mouth curving sensuously. \u201cYou tempt me, Miss Craddock-Hayes.\u201d</p><p>Papa slammed his fist on the table, rattling the dishes.</p><p>Lucy jumped.</p><p>\u201cBut as a lad, I was warned many times against temptation,\u201d the viscount said. \u201cAnd although, sadly, I\u2019ve spent a lifetime disregarding the warnings, tonight I think I shall be prudent. If you will excuse me, Miss Craddock-Hayes. Captain Craddock-Hayes.\u201d He bowed and left the room before Lucy could speak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cImpudent young bounder,\u201d Papa growled, pushing his chair back from the table suddenly. \u201cDid you see the insolent look he gave me as he left? Damn his eyes. And fleshpots. Ha, London fleshpots. I don\u2019t like that man, poppet, viscount or no viscount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Papa.\u201d Lucy closed her eyes and wearily laid her head in her hands. She felt the beginnings of a migraine.</p><p>\u201cThe entire house knows that,\u201d Mrs. Brodie proclaimed, banging back into the room.</p><p>CAPTAIN CRADDOCK-HAYES HAD IT RIGHT, the old bombastic bore, Simon reflected later that evening. Any man\u2014especially a shrewd, eagle-eyed father\u2014would do well to guard an angel as fine as Miss Lucinda Craddock-Hayes against the devils in the world.</p> <p>Such as himself.</p><p>Simon leaned against the window frame in his borrowed bedroom, watching the night outside. She was in the dark garden, apparently strolling in the cold after that delicious but socially disastrous supper. He followed her movements by the pale oval of her face, the rest of her lost to the shadows. It was hard to tell why she fascinated him so, this rural maiden. Perhaps it was simply the draw of dark to light, the devil wanting to despoil the angel, but he thought not. There was something about her, something grave and intelligent and harrowing to his soul. She tempted him with the perfume of heaven, with the hope of redemption, impossible as that hope was. He should leave her alone, his angel entombed in the country. She slumbered innocently, doing good works and managing with a steady hand her father\u2019s house. No doubt she had a suitable gentleman who called upon her; he\u2019d seen the trap and horse pull away the other day. Someone who would respect her position and not test the iron that he sensed lay underneath her facade. A gentleman entirely unlike himself.</p><p>Simon sighed and pushed away from the window frame. He\u2019d never dealt very well with the shoulds and shouldn\u2019ts of his life. He left his temporary room and stole down the stairs, moving with ridiculous care. Best not to alert the protective papa. An angle on the dark landing caught him on the shoulder and he swore. He was using his right arm as much as possible, trying to exercise it, but the damn thing still felt like the very devil. The housekeeper and maid were working in the kitchen when he passed through. He smiled and walked swiftly.</p><p>He was already through the back door when he heard Mrs. Brodie\u2019s voice. \u201cSir\u2014\u201d</p><p>He gently shut the door.</p> <p>Miss Craddock-Hayes must have heard it. Gravel crunched beneath her feet as she turned. \u201cIt\u2019s cold out here.\u201d She was only a pale shape in the dark, but her words floated toward him on the night breeze.</p><p>The garden was perhaps a quarter acre. What he\u2019d seen of it in daylight from his window was very neat. A low-walled kitchen garden, a small lawn with fruit trees, and beyond, a flower garden. Gravel walks connected the different parts, all of them properly put to bed for the winter, no doubt the work of her hands as well.</p><p>By the light of the dim sickle moon, though, it was hard to get his bearings. He\u2019d lost her again in the dark, and it bothered him inordinately. \u201cDo you think it cold? I hadn\u2019t noticed, really. Merely brisk.\u201d He shoved his hands in his coat pockets. It was bloody freezing in the garden.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out so soon after being ill.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cWhat are you doing here on a chilly winter night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking at the stars.\u201d Her voice trailed back to him as if she were walking away. \u201cThey\u2019re never so bright as they are in winter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d They all looked the same to him, whatever the season.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Do you see Orion over there? He glows tonight.\u201d Her voice dropped. \u201cBut you should go in, it\u2019s too cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do with the exercise\u2014as I\u2019m sure your father would point out\u2014and winter air is good for a decrepit fellow like myself.\u201d</p><p>She was silent.</p><p>He thought he moved in her direction, but he was no longer sure. Shouldn\u2019t have mentioned the father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about Papa at supper.\u201d</p><p>Ah, farther to the right. \u201cWhy? I thought his story quite clever. A trifle long, of course, but really\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not usually so stern.\u201d</p> <p>She was so close he could smell her scent, starch and roses, curiously homey and yet arousing at the same time. What an ass he was. The crack to his head must have addled his wits.</p><p>\u201cAh, that. Yes, I did notice the old boy was a bit testy, but I put it down to the fact that I\u2019m sleeping in his house, wearing his son\u2019s clothes, and eating his very fine food without a proper invitation.\u201d</p><p>He saw her face turn, ghostly in the moonlight. \u201cNo, it\u2019s something about you.\u201d He could almost feel her breath brushing against his cheek. \u201cAlthough you could have been nicer, too.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. It was that or weep. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He shook his head, though she couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cNo, I\u2019m certain. I definitely can\u2019t be any nicer. It\u2019s simply not in me. I\u2019m like that snake in your father\u2019s story, striking when I shouldn\u2019t. Although in my case, it\u2019s more that I quip when I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The treetops moved in the wind, raking arthritic fingers against the night sky.</p><p>\u201cIs that how you ended up nearly dead in the ditch outside Maiden Hill?\u201d She\u2019d crept closer. Lured by his studied frankness? \u201cDid you insult someone?\u201d</p><p>Simon caught his breath. \u201cNow why do you think the attack was any fault of mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Was it?\u201d</p><p>He settled his rump against the kitchen garden wall, where it promptly started freezing, and crossed his arms. \u201cYou be my judge, fair lady. I shall set my case before you, and you may pronounce sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not qualified to judge anyone.\u201d</p><p>Did she frown? \u201cOh, yes, you are, sweet angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. Listen. I got up that morning at a horribly unfashionable hour, dressed, after a small argument with my valet over the advisability of red-heeled pumps, which he won\u2014Henry absolutely terrorizes me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I very much doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Simon placed a hand over his heart, even though the movement was wasted in the dark. \u201cI do assure you. Then I descended my front steps, magnificently arrayed in a dashing blue velvet coat, curled and powdered wig, and the aforementioned red-heeled pumps\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cStrolled down the street less than a quarter mile and was there set upon by three ruffians.\u201d</p><p>She caught her breath. \u201cThree?\u201d</p><p>Gratifying.</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d He made his voice light. \u201cTwo I might have bested. One, assuredly. But three proved to be my downfall. They relieved me of everything I had on, including the pumps, which put me in the embarrassing position of having to meet you for the first time both in the nude and\u2014even more shockingly\u2014unconscious. I don\u2019t know if our relationship will ever recover from the initial trauma.\u201d</p><p>She declined the bait. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know your attackers?\u201d</p><p>Simon started to spread wide his arms, then winced and lowered them. \u201cOn my honor. Now, unless you consider red-heeled pumps to be an unbearable temptation to London robbers\u2014in which case I was certainly asking for a drubbing going out in broad daylight wearing them\u2014I think you will have to pardon me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d So soft, the wind nearly bore the words away.</p><p>Such a cautious flirt. Yet even this little hint of laughter caused his loins to tighten. \u201cThen, lady, best call my name no more. For Simon Iddesleigh will be naught but a wisp, an exhalation. I will expire and disappear utterly, were you to denounce me.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Perhaps the exhalation bit was overdone.</p><p>Then she laughed. A loud, joyful sound that made something in his breast leap in reply.</p><p>\u201cDo you feed the ladies in London this poppycock?\u201d She was literally gasping for breath. \u201cIf you do, I think they would all go about with grimaces on their powdered faces to keep from giggling.\u201d</p><p>He felt unaccountably put out. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, I am considered quite a wit in London society.\u201d Good Lord, he sounded like a pompous ass. \u201cThe great hostesses vie to have me on their invitation lists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Imp!</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help it; the words came out sounding disgruntled. Oh, that would impress her. \u201cA dinner party can be proclaimed a success when I attend. Last year a duchess fainted dead away when she heard I couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor, poor London ladies. How sad they must be at the moment!\u201d</p><p>He winced. Touch\u00e9. \u201cActually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet they survive without you.\u201d The laughter still lurked. \u201cOr perhaps not. Perhaps your absence has caused a rash of hostess faintings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cruel angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call me that? Is that a name you give many of your London ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And suddenly he realized that she was closer than he\u2019d thought. Within reach, in fact.</p><p>\u201cNo, only you.\u201d He touched a fingertip to her cheek. Her skin was warm, even in the night air, and soft, so soft.</p><p>Then she stepped away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Did she sound breathless? He grinned like a demon in the dark but didn\u2019t answer. God, he wished he could simply pull her into his arms, open her sweet lips beneath his, feel her breath in his mouth and her breasts against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy angel?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m not particularly angelic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there you are wrong. Your eyebrows are most stern, your mouth curved like a Renaissance saint. Your eyes are wondrous to look upon. And your mind . . .\u201d He stood and ventured a step toward her, until they almost touched, and she had to turn her pale face up to his.</p><p>\u201cMy mind?\u201d</p><p>He thought he felt the warm puff of her breath. \u201cYour mind is an iron bell that rings beautiful, terrible, and true.\u201d His voice was husky, even to his own ears, and he knew he\u2019d revealed too much.</p><p>A lock of her hair bridged the scant inches between them and caressed his throat. His cock came painfully erect, its beat echoing the one in his heart.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what that means,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s just as well.\u201d</p><p>She reached her hand out, hesitated, then touched his cheek lightly with one fingertip. He felt the contact sizzle throughout his body down to his very toes.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think I know you,\u201d she murmured so low he almost didn\u2019t catch the words. \u201cSometimes I think that I\u2019ve always known you, from the very first moment you opened your eyes, and that, deep inside your soul, you know me, too. But then you make a joke, play the fool or the rake, and turn aside. Why do you do that?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to shout his fear or say something else entirely, but the kitchen door opened, spilling an arc of light into the garden. \u201cPoppet?\u201d</p><p>The guardian father.</p><p>She turned so that her face was silhouetted against the light from the kitchen. \u201cI must go in. Good night.\u201d She withdrew her hand, and it brushed across his lips as she retreated.</p><p>He had to steady his voice before he could speak. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward the kitchen door, emerging into the light. Her father took her elbow and searched the shadows of the garden over her head before closing the door behind her. Simon watched her go, choosing to stay in the dark rather than confront Captain Craddock-Hayes. His shoulder ached, his head pounded, and his toes were frozen.</p><p>And he played a game he could not possibly win.</p><p>\u201cI D-D-DON\u2019T BELIEVE YOU.\u201d Quincy James paced to Sir Rupert\u2019s study window and back, his strides quick and jerky. \u201cThey t-t-told me he was bleeding from the head. They stabbed him in the b-b-back and left him in the freezing cold, naked. How c-c-could a man survive that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sir Rupert sighed and poured himself a second whiskey. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he survived, but he did. My information is impeccable.\u201d</p><p>The third man in the room, Lord Gavin Walker, stirred in his armchair by the fire. Walker was built like a navvy, big and broad, his hands the size of hams, his features course. If not for the costly clothes and wig he wore, one would never guess he was an aristocrat. In fact, his family line dated back to the Normans. Walker withdrew a jeweled snuffbox from his coat pocket, deposited a pinch of snuff on the back of his hand, and inhaled it. There was a pause; then he sneezed explosively and employed a handkerchief.</p><p>Sir Rupert winced and looked away. Filthy habit, snuff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand, James,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFirst you say Iddesleigh is dead and we have no further worries, and then he resurrects himself. Are you sure your men got the right gentleman?\u201d</p> <p>Sir Rupert leaned back in his desk chair and looked at the ceiling as he waited for the inevitable outburst from James. His study walls were a masculine deep brown, broken at waist height by a cream chair rail. A thick black and crimson carpet lay underfoot, and old-gold velvet curtains muffled the street noise from without. A collection of botanical engravings hung on the walls. He\u2019d started the collection with a small study of a Chrysanthemum parthenium\u2014feverfew\u2014that he\u2019d found in a bookshop over thirty years ago now. The print was not a good one. It had a water stain in the corner, and the engraved Latin name of the plant was smudged, but the composition was pleasant, and he\u2019d bought it at a time when it meant going without proper tea for a month. It hung between two much larger, more expensive prints. A Morus nigra\u2014mulberry\u2014and a rather elegant Cynara cardunculus. Cardoon.</p><p>His wife, children, and servants knew never to disturb him in his study unless it was the most dire of emergencies. Which made it all the more galling to give up his personal domain to James and Lord Walker and the troubles they brought with them.</p><p>\u201cSure? Of c-c-course I\u2019m sure.\u201d James whirled and tossed something to Walker. It glittered as it flew through the air. \u201cThey brought that back to me.\u201d</p><p>Walker, usually a slow, lumbering fellow, could move quickly when he wanted to. He caught the object and examined it, and his eyebrows rose. \u201cIddesleigh\u2019s signet ring.\u201d</p><p>The hairs on the back of Sir Rupert\u2019s neck stood up. \u201cDammit, James, what the hell did you keep that for?\u201d He was working with dangerous idiots.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t matter, d-d-did it, with Iddesleigh d-d-dead.\u201d James looked petulant.</p><p>\u201cExcept that he\u2019s not dead anymore, is he? Thanks to the incompetence of your men.\u201d Sir Rupert tossed back a healthy swallow of his whiskey. \u201cGive it to me. I\u2019ll get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-s-see here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Walker interrupted. \u201cIt\u2019s evidence we don\u2019t want.\u201d He crossed the room and set the ring on Sir Rupert\u2019s desk.</p><p>Sir Rupert stared at the ring. The Iddesleigh crest was shallow, the gold eroded with age. How many generations of aristocrats had worn this ring? He covered it with his hand and palmed it, transferring it to his waistcoat pocket.</p><p>Covertly, he massaged his right leg under the table. His father had been an import merchant in the city. As a boy, Sir Rupert had worked in the great storehouse his father had maintained, carrying sacks of grain and heavy crates of merchandise. He didn\u2019t remember the accident that had crushed his leg\u2014not entirely, at least. Only the smell of the cod packed in salt that had spilled from the broken barrel. And the pain of the smashed bone. Even now, the smell of salted fish was enough to turn his stomach.</p> <p>Sir Rupert looked at his partners and wondered if they\u2019d ever worked a day in their lives.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d James was facing the bigger man now. \u201cYou haven\u2019t done anything to help so far. I was the one who seconded Peller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more fool you. Should never have put Peller up to killing Ethan Iddesleigh. I advised against it.\u201d Walker took out his snuffbox again.</p><p>James looked close to weeping. \u201cYou d-d-did not!\u201d</p><p>The big man was unperturbed as he ritually measured out the snuff on his hand. \u201cDid. Thought we should do it more covertly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked the plan from the beginning, damn your eyes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Walker sneezed. He shook his head slowly as he again withdrew his handkerchief from a waistcoat pocket. \u201cThought it foolish. Too bad you didn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ass!\u201d James lunged at Walker.</p> <p>The bigger man stepped aside, and James stumbled past comically. His face reddened, and he turned to Walker again.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen!\u201d Sir Rupert rapped his cane against the desk to draw their attention. \u201cPlease. We are wandering from the point. What do we do with Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we certain he is alive?\u201d Walker insisted. The man was slow but dogged.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sir Rupert continued rubbing his aching leg. He would have to put it up after this conference, and it would be no good to him for the remainder of the day. \u201cHe\u2019s in Maiden Hill, a small village in Kent.\u201d</p><p>James frowned. \u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He didn\u2019t want them looking too closely there. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that Iddesleigh is well enough to send for his valet. Once he\u2019s recovered sufficiently, no doubt he\u2019ll return to London. And we all know what he\u2019ll do then.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert looked from James, who was scratching at his scalp so hard that he must be drawing blood underneath the sunny blond hair, to Walker, who was staring thoughtfully back.</p><p>It was the bigger man who stated the obvious conclusion. \u201cThen we had best make sure Iddesleigh doesn\u2019t return, hadn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Sometimes I think I know you. The words seemed engraved on Simon\u2019s brain. Simple words. Frank words. Words that scared the hell out of him. Simon shifted in his armchair. He was in his room, resting before a small fire in the grate and wondering where Miss Craddock-Hayes was. She\u2019d not been at luncheon, and the captain had spoken\u2014when he\u2019d spoken\u2014only in monosyllables. Damn her. Didn\u2019t she know such simplicity was embarrassingly gauche? Didn\u2019t she know she was supposed to bat her eyelashes and say meaningless things to a gentleman? To flirt and banter and always, always hide her true thoughts? Not say aloud words that had the potential to rip at a man\u2019s soul.</p><p>Sometimes I think I know you. What an appalling thought, if she could truly know him. He was a man who had spent the last months ruthlessly hunting Ethan\u2019s killers. He sought them out one by one, challenged them to duels, and then slaughtered them with a sword. What would an angel make of such a man? She would cringe in horror if she really knew him, back away and flee screaming.</p><p>Pray she never truly saw into his soul.</p><p>He became aware of some type of commotion going on downstairs. He could hear Captain Craddock-Hayes\u2019s rumbling voice, Mrs. Brodie\u2019s higher tones, and underneath, the constant mutter of that odd manservant Hedge. Simon levered himself out of his armchair and limped to the stairs. He was paying for his foray into the cold garden last night in pursuit of the angel. The muscles in his back had rebelled at being used too soon and had stiffened overnight. As a result, he moved like an old man\u2014a recently beaten and stabbed old man.</p><p>Simon neared the first floor, and the voices became distinct.</p><p>\u201c. . . carriage half the size of a whaler. Ostentatious, that\u2019s what it is, plain ostentation.\u201d</p><p>The captain\u2019s baritone.</p><p>\u201cWill they be wanting tea do you think, sir? I\u2019ll need to see to my scones. I\u2019ve made just enough to go around.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie.</p><p>And finally, \u201c. . . have a bad back, I do. Four horses, and great big beasts they are, too. I\u2019m not getting any younger. May just kill me, it might. And does anyone care? No, \u2019course they don\u2019t care. Just another pair of arms, I am to them.\u201d</p><p>Hedge, naturally.</p><p>Simon smiled as he finished descending the stairs and walked to the front door where the others were gathered. Funny how the rhythm and tone of this house had so easily seeped into his bones.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Captain,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s all the fuss about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuss? Ha. Great big vehicle. Wonder it could turn into the drive at all. Why anyone has need of such a thing, I don\u2019t know. When I was a young man . . .\u201d</p><p>Simon caught sight of the carriage out the open front door, and the captain\u2019s complaint faded. It was his traveling coach, all right, with the Iddesleigh coat of arms in gilt on the doors. But instead of Henry, his valet of five years, another, younger man climbed down from inside, folding himself nearly double to clear the carriage door frame. He was old enough to have reached his full height\u2014thank God, otherwise he would have ended a giant\u2014but his body had not yet filled the impressive frame it had produced. Thus, his hands were overlarge, and raw-knuckled to boot; his feet like a puppy\u2019s, too big for the thin shanks above; and his shoulders wide but bony.</p><p>Christian straightened, his orangey-red hair blazing in the afternoon sun, and grinned when he caught sight of Simon. \u201cRumor has it you\u2019re either close to death or dead already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumor, as always, manages to exaggerate the matter.\u201d Simon sauntered down the steps. \u201cHave you come to attend my funeral or were you merely passing by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it only right to see if you really were dead. After all, you might\u2019ve left me your sword and scabbard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlikely.\u201d Simon grinned. \u201cI believe my will has you down for an enamel piss-pot. I\u2019m told it\u2019s an antique.\u201d</p><p>Henry emerged from behind the young aristocrat. In an exquisite white wig with two tails, violet and silver coat, and silver-clocked black stockings, Henry was far and away better dressed than Christian, who wore dull brown. But then Henry always was more superbly turned out than almost any other man near him, servant or aristocrat. Simon sometimes found himself hard-pressed to not fall in the shadow of his own valet. Add to that the fact that Henry had the face of a dissolute Eros\u2014all golden hair and full, red lips\u2014and the man became an absolute menace where the fairer sex was concerned. It was a wonder, really, why Simon kept him around.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m most glad in this case that rumor was exaggerated.\u201d Christian took Simon\u2019s hand in both of his, almost embracing him, watching his face with concern. \u201cYou really are well?\u201d</p><p>Simon felt unaccountably embarrassed. He wasn\u2019t used to others worrying over his welfare. \u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this, may I ask?\u201d The captain had caught up to him.</p><p>Simon half turned to the older man. \u201cMay I introduce Christian Fletcher, sir? A friend and fencing partner. Christian, this is my host, Captain Craddock-Hayes. He has shown me every hospitality, selflessly turning over his son\u2019s unused bedroom, his housekeeper\u2019s excellent food, and his daughter\u2019s exquisite company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaptain. An honor to meet you, sir.\u201d Christian bowed.</p><p>The captain, who had been eyeing Simon as if there might be a double meaning to company, switched his gimlet gaze to Christian. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll be wanting a room as well, young man.\u201d</p><p>Christian looked startled. He glanced at Simon as if for help before replying, \u201cNo, not at all. I was thinking of staying at the inn we passed in town.\u201d Christian gestured vaguely over his shoulder, presumably in the direction of the inn.</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d The captain was momentarily stymied. Then he rounded on Simon. \u201cBut your servants, Lord Iddesleigh, they\u2019ll be staying at my house, whether we have the room or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Captain Craddock-Hayes,\u201d Simon said cheerfully. \u201cI had thought of putting them up at the inn as well, but I knew your fine sense of hospitality would be insulted at the idea. So, rather than engage in one of those awkward tugs-of-war over propriety, I conceded the battle before it was ever fought and had my men come here.\u201d He ended this blatant pack of lies with a little bow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a moment the captain was speechless. He frowned thunderously, but Simon knew when he had scored a point.</p><p>\u201cHa. Well. Ha.\u201d The older gentleman rocked back on his heels and glanced at the coach. \u201cJust what I\u2019d expect from city toffs. Ha. Have to tell Mrs. Brodie, then.\u201d</p><p>He turned in time to nearly collide with Hedge. The manservant had come outside and was stopped dead in his tracks, gaping at Simon\u2019s liveried coachman and footmen.</p><p>\u201cGor. Would you look at that,\u201d Hedge said with the first hint of reverence Simon had ever heard in his voice. \u201cNow that\u2019s the way a man oughter be dressed, silver braid and purple coats. \u2019Course, gold braid would be even better. But still, it\u2019s a lot finer than some dress their staff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStaff?\u201d The captain looked outraged. \u201cYou\u2019re not staff. You\u2019re the odd-jobs man. Now help them with the boxes. Good God, staff.\u201d And with that he stomped into the house, still muttering.</p><p>Hedge headed in the opposite direction, also muttering.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he likes me,\u201d Christian whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe captain?\u201d Simon started to the house with the younger man. \u201cNo, no. The man positively adores you. That\u2019s just his way, really. Did you see the puckish twinkle in his eye?\u201d</p><p>Christian half smiled, as if uncertain whether to take Simon\u2019s words at face value or not. Simon felt a momentary pang. To be so young in the world, like a new-hatched chick, its feathers still wet from the shell, surrounded by larger, less benign fowl and the threat of the foxes lurking just out of sight.</p> <p>But then Simon frowned at a thought. \u201cWhere did you hear these rumors of my imminent demise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was talk about it at the Harrington\u2019s ball the other evening and again the next afternoon at my coffeehouse. But I didn\u2019t take it very seriously until I heard it at Angelo\u2019s.\u201d Christian shrugged. \u201cAnd, of course, you didn\u2019t show for our regular match.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded. Dominico Angelo Malevolti Tremamondo\u2014known simply as Angelo to his patrons\u2014was the fashionable fencing master of the moment. Many aristocratic gentlemen attended the Italian\u2019s lessons or came to his school of arms in Soho simply to practice and exercise. Simon had actually met Christian at the master\u2019s establishment several months ago. The younger man had openly admired Simon\u2019s technique. Somehow the admiration had turned into a weekly fencing match with Simon giving his acolyte pointers on form.</p><p>\u201cWhat did happen to you?\u201d They entered the hall, dark after the sun outside. Christian\u2019s strides were long and quick as he talked, and it was an effort for Simon to pace him without showing weakness. \u201cHenry didn\u2019t seem to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStabbed.\u201d The captain was already in the sitting room and must have overheard the question as they entered. \u201cThe viscount was stabbed in the back. Hit the shoulder blade. Farther to the left and the knife would\u2019ve pierced a lung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess he was lucky.\u201d Christian stood as if uncertain how to proceed.</p> <p>\u201cDamn right, he was lucky.\u201d The captain made no move to welcome the other men. \u201cEver see a man die from a lung wound? Eh? Can\u2019t breathe. Suffocates in his own blood. Nasty way to end.\u201d</p><p>Simon sat down on a settee and leisurely crossed his legs, ignoring the pain in his back. \u201cYour description fascinates me strangely, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d The captain settled in an armchair, a grim smile on his face. \u201cWhat fascinates me is why you were attacked in the first place. Eh? Jealous husband? Insulted someone?\u201d</p><p>Christian, left standing by himself, looked around and found a wooden chair by the settee. He lowered himself, only to freeze as the chair creaked ominously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve insulted many, many men over the course of my lifetime, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Simon smiled back at the captain. He mustn\u2019t underestimate the older man\u2019s perception. \u201cAs for jealous husbands, well, discretion forbids I say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Discretion\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the captain was interrupted by the entrance of his daughter, followed by Mrs. Brodie carrying a tea tray.</p><p>Simon and Christian stood. The captain made it to his legs and almost immediately sat back down again.</p> <p>\u201cMy dearest lady,\u201d Simon said, bending over her hand. \u201cI am overwhelmed by the radiance of your presence.\u201d He straightened and tried to tell if she\u2019d been avoiding him today, but her eyes were veiled, and he could not discern her thoughts. He felt a surge of frustration.</p><p>The angel\u2019s lips curved. \u201cYou had better be careful, Lord Iddesleigh. One day my head may be quite turned by your flowery compliments.\u201d</p><p>Simon clapped his hand to his chest and staggered back. \u201cA hit. A direct hit.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then at his antics but turned her golden eyes to Christian. \u201cWho is your guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is but the poor son of a baronet and red-haired to boot. Hardly worth your divine notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor shame.\u201d She sent him a chiding glance\u2014oddly effective\u2014and held out her hand to Christian. \u201cI like ginger hair. And what is your name, poor son of a baronet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian Fletcher, Miss . . . ?\u201d The younger man smiled charmingly and bowed.</p><p>\u201cCraddock-Hayes.\u201d She curtsied. \u201cI see you\u2019ve already met my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Christian raised her hand to his lips, and Simon was forced to resist the urge to throttle him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of Lord Iddesleigh?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Simon had had enough of her attention elsewhere. \u201cChristian is everything I hold dear in a fellow man.\u201d For once he didn\u2019t know if he spoke the truth or lied.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her face was solemn again.</p><p>Damn her for taking him so seriously; no one else did, not even himself.</p><p>She sat gracefully on the settee and began to pour the tea. \u201cHave you known Lord Iddesleigh long, Mr. Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>The younger man smiled as he accepted his teacup. \u201cOnly a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do not know why he was attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her eyes met Simon\u2019s as she proffered his tea.</p><p>Simon smiled and deliberately stroked a finger across her hand as he accepted the cup. She blinked but didn\u2019t drop her gaze. Brave little angel. \u201cI wish I could assuage your curiosity, Miss Craddock-Hayes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrumph!\u201d The captain exploded on the settee beside his daughter.</p><p>Christian selected a scone from the tray and sat back. \u201cWell, whoever attacked Simon must\u2019ve known him.\u201d</p><p>Simon stilled. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>The younger man shrugged. \u201cIt was three men, wasn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they knew you were\u2014are\u2014a master swordsman.\u201d Christian sat back and munched on his scone, his face as open and innocent as it\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cA master swordsman?\u201d Miss Craddock-Hayes looked between Simon and Christian. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d Her eyes seemed to search his.</p><p>Damn. Simon smiled, hoping he gave nothing away. \u201cChristian overstates\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come! I have never known you to be modest, Iddesleigh.\u201d The younger man was all but laughing in his face. \u201cI assure you, ma\u2019am, bigger men quake in their boots when he walks by and none dare call him out. Why, only this fall\u2014\u201d</p><p>Good God. \u201cSurely that tale isn\u2019t for a lady\u2019s ears,\u201d Simon hissed.</p><p>Christian flushed, his eyes widening. \u201cI only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I enjoy hearing things not meant for my delicate ears,\u201d Miss Craddock-Hayes said softly. Her gaze challenged him until he could almost hear her seductive siren\u2019s call: Tell me. Tell me. Tell me who you truly are. \u201cWill you not let Mr. Fletcher continue?\u201d</p><p>But the protective papa stirred, saving him from further folly. \u201cI think not, poppet. Leave the poor fellow be.\u201d</p><p>His angel flushed, but her gaze did not waver, and Simon knew if he stayed here much longer, he would drown in those topaz eyes and bless the gods for his fortune even as he went down for the third time.</p><p>\u201cNUDE? ALTOGETHER NUDE?\u201d Patricia McCullough leaned forward on the ancient settee, nearly upsetting the plate of lemon biscuits on her lap.</p><p>Her round face with its peaches-and-cream complexion, plump ruby lips, and golden curls gave her the look of a vapid shepherdess in a painting. A look that actually was at odds with her personality, which was more like that of a housewife intent on bargaining down the local butcher.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Lucy popped a biscuit into her mouth and smiled serenely at her childhood friend.</p><p>They sat in the little room at the back of the Craddock-Hayes house. The walls were a cheerful rose color with apple-green trim, invoking a flower garden in summer. The room wasn\u2019t as big or as well furnished as the sitting room, but it\u2019d been Mama\u2019s favorite and was cozy for entertaining a dear friend like Patricia. And the windows overlooked the back garden, giving them a nice view of the gentlemen outside.</p><p>Patricia sat back now and knit her brows as she studied the viscount and his friend out the window. The younger man was in his shirtsleeves, despite the November chill. He held a sword in his hand and was lunging about with it, no doubt practicing fencing in a serious way, although the steps looked rather silly to Lucy. Lord Iddesleigh sat nearby, either giving helpful encouragement or, more likely, searing his friend with his criticism.</p><p>What was the story that Mr. Fletcher had so nearly blurted out yesterday? And why had the viscount been so determined that she not hear it? The obvious answer was some kind of scandalous love affair. That was the sort of thing usually deemed too sordid for a maiden\u2019s ears. And yet, Lucy had the feeling that Lord Iddesleigh wouldn\u2019t mind overmuch shocking her\u2014and her father\u2014with his bedroom exploits. This was something worse. Something he was ashamed of.</p><p>\u201cNothing like that ever happens to me,\u201d Patricia said, bringing her back to the present.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding naked gentlemen beside the road whilst walking home.\u201d She pensively bit into a biscuit. \u201cI\u2019m more likely to find one of the Joneses drunk in the ditch. Fully clothed.\u201d</p><p>Lucy shuddered. \u201cI should think it would be better that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUndoubtedly. Still, it does give one something to tell the grandchildren on a cold winter\u2019s night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was the first time it happened to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Was he facing up or down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>Both ladies turned back to the window. The viscount lounged on the stone bench under one of the apple trees, long legs stretched before him, shorn hair glinting in the sun. He grinned at something Mr. Fletcher said, his wide mouth curving. He looked like a blond Pan; all he needed was the hooves and horns.</p><p>Pity.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose he was doing in Maiden Hill?\u201d Patricia asked. \u201cHe\u2019s as out of place here as a gilded lily on a dung heap.\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call Maiden Hill a dung heap.\u201d</p><p>Patricia was unmoved. \u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he was attacked and left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Maiden Hill?\u201d Patricia\u2019s eyes widened in exaggerated disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. Unless he was attacked by particularly backward robbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Privately, of course, Lucy had been wondering the same thing. \u201cMr. Fletcher seems a nice enough gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Makes you wonder how he became friends with Lord Iddesleigh. They go together like crushed velvet and burlap.\u201d</p><p>Lucy tried to repress a snort and wasn\u2019t entirely successful.</p><p>\u201cAnd red hair is never entirely satisfactory on a man, is it?\u201d Patricia scrunched her freckle-covered nose, making herself look even more adorable than usual. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re being mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being overly kind.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fletcher made a particularly showy slash.</p><p>Patricia eyed him. \u201cAlthough I have to admit he is tall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTall? That\u2019s the only nice thing you have to say about him?\u201d Lucy poured her more tea.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Patricia took her cup. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t disparage height.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I, and I am no Amazon.\u201d</p><p>Patricia waved a biscuit, nearly entangling it in her gold curls. \u201cI know.

After all, you\u2019ve already taken the only eligible bachelor in Maiden Hill who isn\u2019t a Jones or hopelessly simple.\u201d Patricia paused to sip her tea. \u201cSpeaking of which\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should ring for more hot water,\u201d Lucy cut in hastily.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of which.\u201d Patricia trundled right on over her. \u201cI saw you out driving with Eustace yesterday. Well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t play stupid with me,\u201d Patricia said, looking like an irate marmalade kitten. \u201cHas he said anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he said something.\u201d Lucy sighed. \u201cHe discussed at length the repairs to the church roof, Mrs. Hardy\u2019s ankle, and whether or not it might snow.\u201d</p><p>Patricia narrowed her eyes.</p><p>She gave in. \u201cBut nothing about marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take back what I said.\u201d</p><p>Lucy raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cI think we shall have to place Eustace into the hopelessly simple category.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Patricia\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree years!\u201d Her friend thumped a settee cushion. \u201cThree years he\u2019s been driving you up and down and all around Maiden Hill. His horse can find the way in its sleep by now. He\u2019s made actual ruts in the roads he takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd has he proposed?\u201d</p><p>Lucy grimaced.</p><p>\u201cNo, he has not,\u201d Patricia answered herself. \u201cAnd why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Lucy shrugged. It honestly was a mystery to her as well.</p><p>\u201cThe man needs a fire lit under his feet.\u201d Patricia jumped up and started trotting back and forth in front of her. \u201cVicar or no vicar, you\u2019re going to be gray-haired by the time he brings himself to the point. And what\u2019s the good of that, I ask you? You won\u2019t be able to bear children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>She thought she\u2019d spoken too quietly to be heard over her friend\u2019s diatribe, but Patricia stopped short and stared. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucy said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to marry Eustace anymore.\u201d</p><p>And she realized it was true. What just days ago had seemed inevitable and good in a predictable way, now seemed old and stale and nearly impossible. Could she spend the rest of her life having settled for the best of what Maiden Hill had to offer? Wasn\u2019t there so much more in the wider world? Almost involuntarily, her eyes were drawn to the window again.</p><p>\u201cBut that leaves only Jones men and the truly . . .\u201d Patricia turned to follow her gaze. \u201cOh, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Her friend sat back down.</p><p>Lucy felt a flush start. She quickly drew her eyes away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you like Eustace, despite\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Patricia shook her head, curls bouncing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Eustace, and you know it. It\u2019s about him.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the viscount got up to demonstrate a move, his arm outstretched, one elegant hand on a hip.</p><p>Lucy sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Patricia\u2019s voice cut in. \u201cI know he\u2019s handsome, and those gray eyes are enough to make the average virgin faint, not to mention that form, which apparently you got to see nude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a London gentleman. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s like one of those crocodile creatures they have in Africa that waits until some unfortunate person gets too close to the water and then eats them up. Snip! Snap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to eat me up.\u201d Lucy reached for her teacup again. \u201cHe\u2019s not interested in me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m not interested in him.\u201d</p><p>Patricia raised an eyebrow, patently dubious.</p><p>Lucy did her best to ignore her. \u201cAnd besides, he\u2019s out of my sphere. He\u2019s one of those worldly gentlemen who live in London and have affairs with stylish ladies and I\u2019m . . .\u201d She shrugged helplessly. \u201cI\u2019m a country mouse.\u201d</p><p>Patricia patted her knee. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lucy chose another lemon biscuit. \u201cAnd someday Eustace will propose to me and I\u2019ll accept him.\u201d She said it firmly, a smile fixed on her face, but somewhere inside her, she felt a building pressure.</p><p>And her eyes still strayed to the window.</p><p>\u201cI HOPE I\u2019M NOT DISTURBING YOU?\u201d Simon asked later that evening.</p><p>He had prowled into the little room at the back of the house where Miss Craddock-Hayes hid herself. He was curiously restless. Christian had retired to his inn, Captain Craddock-Hayes had disappeared on some errand, Henry was fussily arranging his clothes, and he should probably be in bed, continuing his recovery. But he wasn\u2019t. Instead, after grabbing one of his own coats and dodging Henry\u2014who\u2019d wanted to put him through a full toilet\u2014Simon had tracked down his angel.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She looked at him warily. \u201cPlease, have a seat. I had begun to think you were avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>Simon winced. He had. But at the same time, he couldn\u2019t stay away from her. Truth be told, he felt well enough to travel, even if he wasn\u2019t fully recovered. He should pack up and quit this house gracefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sketching?\u201d He sat beside her, too close. He caught a whiff of starch.</p><p>She mutely turned her enormous book so he could see. A charcoal Christian danced across the page, lunging and feinting at an imaginary foe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very good.\u201d Immediately he felt a fool for so pedestrian a compliment, but she smiled, which had its now- predictable effect on him. He leaned back and flicked the skirt of his coat over his groin, then stretched out his legs. Carefully.</p><p>She frowned, her straight eyebrows drawing together terribly. \u201cYou\u2019ve strained your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to notice a gentleman\u2019s infirmity. Our manly pride may become irreparably damaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly.\u201d She got up and brought a pillow to him. \u201cLean forward.\u201d</p><p>He complied. \u201cAlso, you shouldn\u2019t call us silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially if we are.\u201d She positioned the pillow behind his back. \u201cAbsolutely devastating to the manly pride.\u201d God, that felt better.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Her hand trailed lightly across his shoulder; then she went to the door and called for the housekeeper.</p><p>He watched her move to the fireplace and stir the embers into flame. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d have supper in here, if that agrees with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever agrees with you, agrees with me, fairest lady.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper appeared, and they conferred before Mrs. Brodie bustled out again.</p><p>\u201cPapa is dining with Dr. Fremont tonight,\u201d his angel said. \u201cThey like to argue politics together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed? Is that the same doctor who saw to my wound?\u201d The good doctor must be a formidable debater to take on the captain. He had Simon\u2019s best wishes.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie and the one maid returned with laden trays. They took some time setting up the meal on the side table and then left.</p><p>\u201cPapa used to have wonderful discussions with David.\u201d Miss Craddock-Hayes sliced a game pie. \u201cI think he misses him.\u201d She handed the plate to him.</p><p>Simon had an awful thought. \u201cAre you bereaved?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him blankly for a second, her hand hovering over the pie; then she laughed. \u201cOh, no. David is away at sea. He\u2019s a sailor like Papa. A lieutenant on the New Hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d Simon said. \u201cI suddenly realized that I didn\u2019t know anything of your brother, despite using his room.\u201d</p><p>She looked down as she selected an apple for herself. \u201cDavid\u2019s two and twenty, two years younger than I. He\u2019s been away at sea eleven months now. He writes often, although we get his letters in clumps. He can only post them when they make port.\u201d She settled the plate on her lap and glanced up. \u201cFather reads them all at once when we get a packet, but I like to save the letters and read one or two a week. It makes them last longer.\u201d She smiled almost guiltily.</p><p>Simon had an urgent wish to find this David and make him write a hundred letters more to his sister. Letters Simon could give her so he could sit at her feet and watch that smile on her lips. More fool, he.</p><p>\u201cHave you a brother or sister?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>He looked down at his pie. This was what came of being beguiled by dark, level brows and a serious mouth. One let one\u2019s guard down. \u201cI am deficient in sisters, alas.\u201d He cut into the friable crust. \u201cI always thought it would be nice to have a little sister to tease, although they have a tendency to grow up and tease back, I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd brothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne brother.\u201d He picked up his fork and was surprised to find his fingers trembling, damn them. He willed the shaking to stop. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her voice was nearly a whisper.</p><p>\u201cJust as well.\u201d Simon reached for his wineglass. \u201cHe was the elder, so I would never have attained the title had he not seen fit to shuffle off this mortal coil.\u201d He took an overlarge sip of the red wine. It burned all the way down his throat. He set the glass down and rubbed at his right index finger.</p><p>She was silent, watching him from too-intense topaz eyes.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201che was rather an ass, Ethan was. Always worried about the right thing and whether I was living up to the family name, which of course I never was. He\u2019d call me down once or twice a year to the family estate and look at me with lugubrious eyes as he enumerated my many sins and the size of my tailor\u2019s bill.\u201d He stopped because he was babbling.</p><p>He glanced at her to see if he\u2019d finally shocked her into sending him away. She merely gazed back, compassion in her face. Dreadful, dreadful angel.</p><p>He transferred his gaze to the pie, although his appetite had fled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I finished my fairy tale the other day. About poor Angelica and the Serpent Prince.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, she nodded. \u201cYou\u2019d got as far as the magical cave and the silver snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He breathed deeply, trying to rid himself of the tightness in his chest. He took another swallow of the wine and marshaled his thoughts. \u201cThe silver snake was much larger than any Angelica had seen before; its head alone was as big as her forearm. As she watched, the serpent uncoiled itself and swallowed her poor little goat whole. Then it slowly slithered away into the darkness.\u201d</p><p>Miss Craddock-Hayes shuddered. \u201cIt sounds awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d He paused to take a bite of pie. \u201cAngelica crept from the crack in the rock as quietly as she could and returned to her small stick shack to think things over, for she was quite frightened. What if the giant serpent continued to eat her goats? What if it decided to try a more tender meat and eat her?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow thoroughly disgusting,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. What could she do, after all, against a giant snake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, surely she\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cocked a stern eyebrow at her. \u201cAre you going to keep interrupting me?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together as if to quell a smile and started peeling her apple. He felt warmth spread through him. This was so comfortable, sitting here with her and bantering. A man could relax to the point that he forgot all his cares, all his sins, all the butchery he had yet to do.</p><p>He took a breath and shook the thoughts away. \u201cAngelica\u2019s flock of goats began disappearing one by one, and she was at her wit\u2019s end. True, she lived alone, but sooner or later the king\u2019s steward would come to take count of the goats, and then how would she explain their depleted numbers?\u201d He paused to take a sip of wine.</p><p>Her straight, solemn brows were drawn together as she concentrated on peeling the apple with a small knife and fork. He could tell by the pinch of her brow that she wanted to object to Angelica\u2019s lack of fortitude.</p> <p>He hid a smile behind the wineglass. \u201cThen late one night, a poor peddler woman came knocking at the stick shack\u2019s door. She displayed her wares: some ribbons, a bit of lace, and a faded scarf. Angelica took pity on the woman. \u2018I haven\u2019t a coin to my name,\u2019 she told her, \u2018but will you take this pitcher of goat\u2019s milk in trade for a ribbon?\u2019 Well, the old woman was glad enough to make the bargain, and she said to Angelica, \u2018Since you have a kind heart, I\u2019ll give you a bit of advice: If you capture the skin of a snake, you\u2019ll have power over the creature. You\u2019ll hold his very life in your hands.\u2019 And with that, the old peddler hobbled away before Angelica could ask her more.\u201d</p><p>The lady had stopped peeling her apple and was looking at him skeptically. Simon raised his eyebrows, sipped the wine, and waited.</p><p>She broke. \u201cThe old peddler woman just appeared out of the blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I have the feeling this story is being fashioned as you tell it.\u201d She sighed and shook her head. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he enquired gravely.</p><p>She gave him a look from under terrifying brows.</p><p>He cleared his throat to cover a laugh. \u201cThat very night, Angelica crept to the cave. She watched as the giant serpent slithered from the dark recesses at the back of the cavern. It circled the blue-flamed fire slowly, and then there appeared the nude silver-haired man. Angelica crawled closer and saw that a great snakeskin lay at the man\u2019s feet. Before her courage could leave her, she leaped forward and snatched the skin in her arms.\u201d Simon ate a bite of the pie, chewing slowly to savor the flavor.</p><p>He looked up to see Miss Craddock-Hayes staring incredulously at him. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He blinked innocently. \u201cWell what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop teasing me,\u201d she enunciated distinctly. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>His cock jumped on the word teasing, and an image formed in his demonic brain of Miss Craddock-Hayes stretched nude upon a bed, his tongue teasing her nipples. Christ.</p> <p>Simon blinked and pasted a smile on his face. \u201cAngelica had the Serpent Prince in her power, of course. She ran to the fire in the brazier, intending to throw the snakeskin into the blaze and thus destroy the creature, but his words stopped her. \u2018Please, fair maiden. Please, spare me my life.\u2019 And she noticed for the first time that he wore a chain\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cWith a small, sapphire crown hanging from it,\u201d he finished in a rush. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a snake before,\u201d she said with exaggerated patience. \u201cWith no shoulders. How could he have worn a necklace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chain. Males don\u2019t wear necklaces.\u201d</p><p>She merely stared at him in patent disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe was enchanted,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt stayed on.\u201d</p><p>She started to roll her eyes, but then caught herself. \u201cAnd did Angelica spare his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Simon smiled sadly. \u201cCelestial beings always do, whether the creature deserves it or not.\u201d</p><p>She carefully set aside what remained of her apple and wiped her hands. \u201cBut why wouldn\u2019t the snake be deserving of salvation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was a snake. A thing of darkness and evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>He barked a laugh\u2014too sharp and too loud. \u201cCome, Miss Craddock-Hayes, I\u2019m sure you read your Bible and know of the snake that deceived Adam and Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, my lord.\u201d She tilted her head mockingly. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know that the world isn\u2019t that simple.\u201d</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Now, inexplicably, she was irritated at him. \u201cBecause I live in the country? Because my circle of friends doesn\u2019t contain the titled and sophisticated? Do you think only those who live in London are intellectual enough to explore beyond the obvious in our world?\u201d</p><p>How had this argument happened? \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and said fiercely, \u201cI think you are the provincial one, to judge me without knowing me at all. Or rather, you think you know me, when in reality, you do not.\u201d</p><p>She stared a moment longer at his dumbfounded face and then got up and hurried from the room.</p><p>Leaving him with a painfully aching erection.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s late!\u201d Papa said the following night. He glared at the clock on the mantelpiece and then turned his glare on the rest of the room. \u201cCan\u2019t tell time in London, eh? Just wander about, showing up whenever a body wants?\u201d</p><p>Eustace tsked and shook his head in sympathy with Lucy\u2019s father\u2014a rather hypocritical gesture since he was known to forget the time on occasion himself.</p><p>Lucy sighed and rolled her eyes. They were all assembled in the front sitting room, waiting for Lord Iddesleigh so they could go into supper. Actually, she wasn\u2019t all that anxious to see the viscount again anyway. She\u2019d made a fool of herself the evening before. She still wasn\u2019t quite sure why her anger had suddenly boiled over; it had been so sudden. But it had been real. She was so much more than daughter and nursemaid; she knew that deep within herself. Yet, in tiny Maiden Hill, she could never become who she wanted to be. She was only dimly aware of who she might become, but stuck here, she knew she\u2019d never discover herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be down presently, sir,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said. Unfortunately, Lord Iddesleigh\u2019s friend didn\u2019t sound sure at all. He cleared his throat. \u201cPerhaps I ought to go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an exquisite company.\u201d Lord Iddesleigh\u2019s voice came from the doorway.</p><p>Everyone swung around, and Lucy almost let her mouth hang open. The viscount was magnificent. That was the only word for it. Magnificent. He wore a silver brocade coat embroidered in silver and black on the turned-back sleeves, skirts, and all down the front. Underneath was a sapphire waistcoat with vining leaves and multicolored flowers lavishly embroidered all over. His shirt had falls of lace at the wrists and throat, and he wore a snow-white wig on his head.</p><p>The viscount strolled into the sitting room. \u201cNever say you have all been waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate!\u201d Papa exploded. \u201cLate for my supper! Sit down promptly at seven o\u2019clock in this household, sir, and if you cannot . . .\u201d Papa trailed off and stared fixedly down at the viscount\u2019s feet.</p><p>Lucy followed his gaze. The viscount wore elegant pumps with\u2014</p><p>\u201cRed heels!\u201d Papa shouted. \u201cGood God, sirrah, think you this is a bordello?\u201d</p><p>The viscount had made Lucy\u2019s side by this time, and he languidly lifted her hand to his lips as her father sputtered. He looked up at her, his head still bowed, and she saw that his eyes were only a few shades darker than his snowy wig. He winked as she stared, mesmerized, and she felt the wet warmth of his tongue insinuate itself between her fingers.</p><p>Lucy inhaled sharply, but the viscount let go of her hand and whirled to face her father as if nothing had happened. She hid her hand in her skirt as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cA bordello, sir? No, I confess that I never mistook your home for a bordello. Now, had you decorated the walls with a few paintings depicting\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go in to supper?\u201d Lucy squeaked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for an assent; the way the conversation was progressing, there would be all-out warfare before supper was ever begun. Instead she seized the viscount\u2019s arm and marched him into the dining room. Of course, she would never be able to physically force Lord Iddesleigh to go where he did not wish to go. Fortunately, he seemed content to let her lead him.</p><p>He bent his head close to hers as they entered the dining room. \u201cHad I known, sweeting, that you desired my company so devoutly\u201d\u2014he pulled out a chair for her\u2014\u201cI would\u2019ve damned Henry and come down in my smallclothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAss,\u201d Lucy muttered to him as she sat.</p><p>His smile widened into a grin. \u201cMy angel.\u201d</p><p>Then he was forced to round the table and sit across from her. As everyone else found their places, Lucy let out a small sigh. Maybe now they could be civil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often wanted to visit Westminster Abbey in London,\u201d Eustace said rather pompously as Betsy began ladling out potato and leek soup. \u201cTo see the graves of the poets and great men of letters, you understand. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve never had the time on the occasions I\u2019ve traveled to our wonderful capital. Always busy with church matters, you know. Perhaps you could give us your impressions of that magnificent abbey, Lord Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>All heads at the dinner table swiveled in the viscount\u2019s direction.</p><p>The lines around his silver eyes deepened as he fingered his wineglass. \u201cSorry. Never had a reason to enter the dusty old mausoleum. It\u2019s not my cup of tea, really. Probably a terrible moral failing on my part.\u201d</p><p>Lucy could practically hear Papa and Eustace agreeing in their minds. Mr. Fletcher coughed and buried his face in his wineglass.</p><p>She sighed. When her father had invited Eustace to sup with them, Lucy had welcomed the diversion another guest would provide. Mr. Fletcher, although pleasant, had not been able to stand up to Papa\u2019s grilling and had looked quite wan by the end of the noon meal on the previous day. And the viscount, while he could withstand her father\u2019s obvious nettling, did it only too well. He drove her father into red-faced incoherence. She\u2019d hoped Eustace would provide a buffer. Obviously, this was not to be the case. To make matters worse, she felt an absolute drab in her dark gray gown. It was well cut but so plain as to be nearly a rag next to the viscount\u2019s finery. Of course, no one she knew dressed so ostentatiously in the country, and Lord Iddesleigh really ought to feel self-conscious to be so out of place.</p><p>On that thought, Lucy raised her glass of wine defiantly and stared at the viscount sitting across from her. A puzzled look flashed across his face before his habitual expression of ennui resettled.</p><p>\u201cI could give you a colorful description of the pleasure gardens at Vaux Hall,\u201d Lord Iddesleigh mused, continuing the topic Eustace had brought up. \u201cBeen there on too many nights to recall, with too many people I\u2019d rather not recall, doing too many things . . . well, you get the picture. But I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a description quite fit for mixed company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Then I suggest you not give it,\u201d Papa rumbled. \u201cNot that interested in the sights of London anyway. Good English countryside is the best place in the world. I should know. Been around the world in my day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI quite agree, Captain,\u201d Eustace said. \u201cNothing is so fine as the English rural landscape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. So there.\u201d Papa leaned forward and fixed a gimlet eye on his guest. \u201cFeeling better tonight, Iddesleigh?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy nearly groaned. Papa\u2019s hints that the viscount should leave were growing more and more explicit.</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir, for inquiring.\u201d Lord Iddesleigh poured more wine for himself. \u201cExcept for the stabbing pain in my back, the unfortunate loss of sensation in my right arm, and a sort of nauseous dizziness when I stand, I\u2019m as fit as a fiddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You look well enough. Suppose you\u2019ll be leaving us soon, eh?\u201d Her father glowered from beneath his furry white brows. \u201cMaybe tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Lucy cut in before her father had their guest out the door tonight. \u201cLord Iddesleigh just said he\u2019s not fully recovered.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Brodie and Betsy came in to remove the soup dishes and serve the next course. The housekeeper took a look around at the uncomfortable faces and sighed. She met Lucy\u2019s eyes and shook her head in sympathy before she left. Everyone started on the roast chicken and peas.</p><p>\u201cI once went in Westminster Abbey,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said.</p><p>\u201cWere you lost?\u201d Lord Iddesleigh inquired politely.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Mother and the sisters were on an architectural binge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had any sisters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do. Three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God. Excuse me, Vicar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo elder,\u201d Mr. Fletcher said chattily, \u201cone younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy felicitations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Anyway, we toured the Abbey about ten years ago now, in between St. Paul\u2019s and the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you but a young and impressionable lad.\u201d The viscount shook his head sorrowfully. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad when one hears about this type of debauchery at the hands of one\u2019s elders. Makes one wonder what England is coming to.\u201d</p> <p>Papa made an explosive sound beside Lucy, and Lord Iddesleigh winked across the table at her. She tried to frown at him as she raised her wineglass, but however awfully he behaved, she found it hard to censor him.</p><p>Next to the viscount\u2019s magnificence, Eustace was a dusty sparrow in his usual brown broadcloth coat, breeches, and waistcoat. Of course, Eustace looked quite well in brown, and one didn\u2019t expect a country vicar to go about in silver brocade. It would be improper, and he\u2019d probably seem merely silly in such splendor. Which made one wonder why the viscount, instead of looking silly, appeared downright dangerous in his finery.</p><p>\u201cDid you know if you stand in the middle of the Westminster nave and whistle, there is quite a nice echo?\u201d Mr. Fletcher said, looking around the table.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely fascinating,\u201d the viscount said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind should I ever have occasion to visit the place and feel an urge to whistle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, try not to do it within sight of a female relative. Got my ears boxed.\u201d Mr. Fletcher rubbed the side of his head, remembering.</p><p>\u201cAh, the ladies do keep us in line.\u201d Eustace elevated his glass and looked at Lucy. \u201cI don\u2019t know what we would do without their guiding hands.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. She wasn\u2019t certain that she\u2019d ever guided Eustace, but that seemed beside the point.</p><p>Lord Iddesleigh toasted her as well. \u201cHere, here. My dearest wish is but to lie prostrate and humble beneath my lady\u2019s iron thumb. Her stern frown makes me tremble; her elusive smile causes me to stiffen and shake in ecstasy.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy\u2019s eyes widened even as her nipples tightened. The wretch!</p><p>Mr. Fletcher started coughing again.</p><p>Papa and Eustace scowled, but it was the younger man who got in the first word. \u201cI say, that\u2019s a bit bold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right\u2014\u201d Lucy attempted, but the men weren\u2019t listening to her, despite their flowery words.</p><p>\u201cBold?\u201d The viscount lowered his glass. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stiffen.\u201d The vicar blushed.</p><p>Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake! Lucy opened her mouth but was interrupted before she could get a word out.</p><p>\u201cStiffen? Stiffen? Stiffen?\u201d Lord Iddesleigh repeated, sounding uncommonly silly. \u201cA perfectly nice English word. Descriptive and plain. Used in all the best houses. I\u2019ve heard the king himself employ it. In fact, it describes exactly what you are doing now, Mr. Penweeble.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fletcher was bent double, his hands covering his reddened face. Lucy hoped he wouldn\u2019t choke to death in his amusement.</p><p>Eustace flushed an alarming shade of puce. \u201cWhat about ecstasy, then? I\u2019d like to see you defend that, sir.\u201d</p><p>The viscount drew himself up and looked down his rather long nose. \u201cI would think that you of all people, Vicar, a soldier in the army of His Majesty\u2019s church, a man of learning and exquisite reasoning, a soul seeking the divine salvation only available through Christ our Lord, would understand that ecstasy is a most righteous and religious term.\u201d Lord Iddesleigh paused to eat a bite of chicken. \u201cWhat else did you think it meant?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the gentlemen around the table goggled at the viscount. Lucy looked from one to another, exasperated. Really, this nightly war of words was getting tiresome.</p><p>Then Papa spoke. \u201cBelieve that may be blasphemy.\u201d And he started chuckling.</p><p>Mr. Fletcher stopped choking and joined in the laughter. Eustace grimaced and then he, too, laughed softly, although he still looked uncomfortable.</p><p>Lord Iddesleigh smiled, raised his glass, and watched Lucy over the rim with his silver eyes.</p><p>He\u2019d been both blasphemous and improper\u2014and Lucy didn\u2019t care. Her lips were trembling, and she felt short of breath just looking at him.</p><p>She smiled back helplessly.</p><p>\u201cWAIT!\u201d SIMON SCRAMBLED DOWN the front steps the next morning, ignoring the pain in his back. Miss Craddock-Hayes\u2019s trap was almost out of sight down the drive. \u201cOy, wait!\u201d He had to stop running, as his back was burning. He bent over, propping his hands on his knees, and panted, head hung down. A week ago he wouldn\u2019t have even been winded.</p><p>Behind him, Hedge was muttering near the entrance to the Craddock-Hayes house. \u201cYoung fool, lord or no. Fool to get stabbed and fool to run after a wench. Even one like Miss Lucy.\u201d</p><p>Simon heartily agreed. His urgency was ridiculous. When had he ever run after a woman? But he had an awful need to talk to her, to explain his ungentlemanly conduct of the night before. Or perhaps that was an excuse. Perhaps the need was simply to be with her. He was conscious that the sands of time were running swiftly through his fingers. Soon he would run out of excuses to stay in tranquil Maiden Hill. Soon he would see his angel no more.</p><p>Thankfully, Miss Craddock-Hayes had heard his shout. She halted the horse just before the drive disappeared into a copse and turned in her seat to look back at him. Then she pulled the horse\u2019s head around.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, running after me?\u201d she asked when the cart had drawn alongside him. She sounded not at all impressed. \u201cYou\u2019ll reopen your wound.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, trying not to look like a decrepit wreck. \u201cA small price to pay for a moment of your sweet time, oh fair lady.\u201d</p><p>Hedge snorted loudly and banged the front door shut behind him. But she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going into town?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cThe village is small. I can\u2019t think what you could find there to interest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised. The ironmonger\u2019s, the cross in the center of the square, the ancient church\u2014all are items of excitement.\u201d He vaulted into the cart beside her, making it rock. \u201cWould you like me to drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can manage Kate.\u201d She chirruped to the sturdy little horse\u2014presumably Kate\u2014and they lurched forward.</p><p>\u201cHave I thanked you for your charity in rescuing me from a ditch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you have.\u201d She darted a glance at him, then turned again to the road so that he couldn\u2019t see her face around the brim of her hat. \u201cDid I tell you we thought you dead when I first saw you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am sorry for your distress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>He wished he could see her face. \u201cAs am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought . . .\u201d Her words trailed away; then she started again. \u201cIt was so strange finding you. My day had been very ordinary, and then I looked down and saw you. At first I didn\u2019t believe my eyes. You were so out of place in my world.\u201d</p><p>I still am. But he didn\u2019t speak the thought aloud.</p><p>\u201cLike discovering a magical being,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThen your disappointment must\u2019ve been severe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo discover me to be a man of earthen clay and not magical at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! I shall have to note this day in my diary.\u201d</p><p>He rocked against her as they bumped over a rut in the road. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDecember the second,\u201d she intoned in a grave voice. \u201cJust after luncheon. The Viscount of Iddesleigh makes a humble statement regarding himself.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her like an idiot. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn her head, but he saw the smile curve her cheek. He had a sudden urge to pull the reins from her hands, guide the horse to the side of the road, and take his angel into his clayish arms. Perhaps she had the spell that could turn the misshapen monster into something human.</p><p>Ah, but that would involve degrading the angel.</p><p>So instead Simon lifted his face to the winter sun, thin though it was. It was good to be outdoors, even in the chill wind. Good to be sitting beside her. The ache in his shoulder had subsided to a dull throb. He\u2019d been lucky and not reopened the wound, after all. He watched his angel. She sat with her back upright and managed the reins competently with very little show, quite unlike the ladies of his acquaintance who were apt to become dramatic actresses when driving a gentleman. Her hat was a plain straw one, tied underneath her left ear. She wore a gray cloak over her lighter gray gown, and it suddenly occurred to him that he\u2019d never seen her in any other color.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you always wear gray?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dress.\u201d He indicated her apparel with his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re always in gray. Rather like a pretty little dove. If you aren\u2019t in mourning, why do you wear it?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was proper for a gentleman to comment on a lady\u2019s attire. Are the social conventions different in London?\u201d</p><p>Ouch. His angel was in fine fettle this morning.</p><p>He leaned against the seat, propping his elbow behind her back. He was so close he could feel her warmth at his chest. \u201cYes, actually they are. For instance, it is considered de rigueur for a lady driving a gentleman in a trap to flirt with him outrageously.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips, still refusing to look at him.</p><p>That served only to egg him on. \u201cLadies not following this convention are frowned upon severely. Very often you will see the elder members of the ton shaking their heads over these poor, lost souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you leave to disregard the rule since we are in the benighted country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenighted?\u201d She slapped the reins, and Kate rattled her bridle.</p><p>\u201cI insist on benighted.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a look.</p><p>He stroked one finger down her ramrod-straight spine. She stiffened even more but didn\u2019t comment. He remembered the taste of her fingers on his tongue the night before, and another less polite part of his anatomy stiffened as well. Her acceptance of his touch was as erotic as a blatant display in another woman. \u201cYou can hardly blame me, since, were we in the city, you would be compelled to say suggestive things to me in my blushing ear.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what you asked me before all this nonsense.\u201d</p><p>He grinned even though it was gauche. He couldn\u2019t recall when he\u2019d last had this much fun. \u201cWhy do you wear only gray? Not that I have anything against gray, and it does lend you an intriguing ecclesiastical air.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI look like a nun?\u201d Her terrifying brows drew together.</p><p>The trap bumped over another rut in the road and jostled his shoulder against hers.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear girl. I am saying, admittedly in a roundabout and rather obscure way, that you are an angel sent from heaven to judge me for my sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wear gray because it is a color that doesn\u2019t show dirt.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cWhat kind of sins have you committed?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned close, as if about to impart a confidence, and caught a whiff of roses. \u201cI contest the word color used in reference to gray and submit that gray is not a color at all, but rather a lack thereof.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed ominously.</p><p>He drew back and sighed. \u201cAs to my sins, my dear lady, they are not the sort that may be spoken of in the presence of an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how am I to judge them? And gray is so a color.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He felt like throwing wide his arms and perhaps breaking into song. It must be the country air. \u201cLady, I concede to the power of your well-thought-out argument, which, I think, would have brought even Sophocles to his knees. Gray, therefore, is a color.\u201d</p> <p>She harrumphed. \u201cAnd your sins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sins are numerous and irredeemable.\u201d The image flashed through his mind of Peller desperately flinging out his hand and his own sword slicing through it, blood and fingers spangling the air. Simon blinked and painted a smile across his lips. \u201cAll who have knowledge of my sins,\u201d he said lightly, \u201cshrink in horror from the sight of me as if I were a leper revealed, my nose falling off, my ears rotting.\u201d</p><p>She regarded him, so grave and so innocent. Brave little angel, untouched by the stink of men. He couldn\u2019t help stroking her back again, cautiously, furtively. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cAnd so they should,\u201d he continued. \u201cFor instance, I have been known to leave my house without a hat.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. He wasn\u2019t wearing a hat at the moment.</p><p>\u201cIn London,\u201d he clarified.</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t worried about hats. \u201cWhy do you think that you\u2019re irredeemable? All men can find grace if they repent of their sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo speaketh the angel of the Lord.\u201d He leaned close to her, under her flat straw hat, and smelled again the scent of roses in her hair. His cock twitched. \u201cBut what if I am a devil from hell itself and not of your world at all, angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an angel.\u201d She tilted her face up.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, you are,\u201d he breathed. His lips brushed her hair, and for a wild moment he thought he might kiss her, might debauch this lady with his foul mouth. But the cart shook as they rounded a curve, and her head turned to mind the horse, and the moment passed.</p><p>\u201cHow independent you are,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cCountry ladies need to be, if we are to get anywhere,\u201d she said somewhat tartly. \u201cDid you think I sit at home doing the mending all day?\u201d</p><p>Ah, this was dangerous ground. They\u2019d been in this territory when she\u2019d grown angry with him two nights before. \u201cNo. I am aware of your many duties and talents, not least of which is to help the less fortunate of the village. I have no doubt you would make an admirable Lady Mayor of London, but that would involve quitting this lovely hamlet, and I am sure that the inhabitants would not survive without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone would survive quite well without me,\u201d she said rather dispassionately. \u201cSome other lady would soon fill my shoes, I am sure.\u201d</p><p>He knit his eyebrows. \u201cDo you value yourself so lightly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s simply that the charities I perform here could be done by anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He considered her beautiful profile. \u201cAnd were you to abandon all who depend on you here in Maiden Hill, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted as she considered his question. He leaned closer. Oh, how he wished to tempt this innocent! \u201cWould you dance upon the stages of London in purple slippers? Sail to far-off Araby in a boat with silken sails? Become a society lady famous for her wit and beauty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d become myself.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cYou already are yourself, beautiful and stern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? No one else notices but you.\u201d</p><p>He stared then into her serious topaz eyes, and he wanted to say something. It was on the tip of his tongue, yet unaccountably he could not speak.</p><p>She glanced away. \u201cWe\u2019re almost to Maiden Hill. See the church tower over there?\u201d She pointed.</p><p>He dutifully looked, trying to regain some calm. It was past time he left. If he stayed, he would only be further tempted to seduce this maiden, and as he had proved his entire life, he was not capable of withstanding temptation. Hell, sometimes he ran toward it. But not this time. Not with this woman. He watched her now, her brow furrowed as she maneuvered her little trap into town. A lock of dark hair had come undone and caressed her cheek like a lover\u2019s hand. With this woman, if he gave in to temptation, he would destroy something honest and good. Something he had never found anywhere else on this wretched earth.</p><p>And he did not think he would survive the devastation.</p><p>LUCY SIGHED AND SANK into the warm water of her bath. Of course, she couldn\u2019t sink very far\u2014it was only a hip bath\u2014but it felt like pure luxury all the same. She was in the little room at the back of the house, her mother\u2019s room. Hedge complained enough as it was, hauling water for her \u201cunnatural\u201d bath, without making him go up the stairs as well. The room was only a few steps away from the kitchen, which made it quite convenient for her ablutions. The water would have to be hauled away again after she was done, but Lucy had told Hedge and Betsy that the chore could wait until morning. They could go to sleep, and she could wallow in the warm water without servants hovering impatiently.</p><p>She rested her neck on the high back of the tub and looked up at the ceiling. The fire cast flickering shadows over the old walls, making her feel quite cozy. Papa had dined with Doctor Fremont tonight and was probably still arguing politics and history. Lord Iddesleigh had gone to see Mr. Fletcher at his inn. She had the house to herself, save for the servants, who had retired for the night.</p><p>The scent of roses and lavender drifted around her. She lifted a hand and watched the water drip from her fingertips. How strange this last week had been, since she had found Lord Iddesleigh. She\u2019d spent more time in the previous days thinking about how she lived her life and what she would eventually do with it than she had in all her prior years. It had never occurred to her before that there might be more to her existence than keeping Papa\u2019s house, doing charitable works here and there, and being courted by Eustace. Why had she not thought beyond being a vicar\u2019s wife? She\u2019d never even realized she yearned for more. It was almost like waking from a dream. Suddenly there was this flamboyant man, like none other she\u2019d ever met. Almost effete, with his airs and pretty clothes, yet so very masculine in his movements and in the way he watched her.</p><p>He poked and prodded her. He demanded more than simple acquiescence. He wanted her reaction. He made her feel alive in a way that she\u2019d never before thought possible. As if she\u2019d merely sleepwalked through everything else in her life prior to his arrival. She woke in the morning wanting to talk to him, wanting to hear his deep voice spilling nonsense that made her smile or made her angry. She wanted to find out about him, what made his silver eyes so sad at times, what he hid behind his blather, how to make him laugh.</p><p>And there was more. She wanted his touch. At night in her narrow bed when she was in that state that is almost but not quite sleep, she would dream he touched her, that his long fingers traced her cheeks. That his wide mouth covered hers.</p><p>She inhaled a shuddering breath. She shouldn\u2019t, she knew that, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. She closed her eyes and imagined what it would feel like if he was here now. Lord Iddesleigh.</p><p>Simon.</p><p>She drew her wet hands from the water, drops splashing softly into the tub, and trailed them across her collarbone, pretending her hands were his. She shivered. Goose bumps chased across her throat. Her nipples, rising just above the warm water, peaked. Her fingers skimmed lower, and she felt how soft her skin was, cool and damp from the water. She circled just the tips of her middle fingers underneath her breasts, which were full and heavy, then brought them up around to the small bumps of her areola.</p><p>She sighed and moved her legs restlessly. If Simon was watching her now, he would see her arousal, the damp prickles on her skin. He would see her nude breasts and erect nipples. The mere thought of being exposed to his eyes made her bite her lip. Slowly, she flicked her fingernails over her nipples, and the sensation made her clench her thighs. If he watched . . . She brought her thumbs and forefingers on either side of her nipples and pinched. Lucy moaned.</p><p>And suddenly she knew. She froze for an eternal second and then slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>He was in the doorway, his gaze locked with hers\u2014hot, hungry, and very, very male. Then he let his eyes drop and deliberately perused her. From her flushed cheeks to her naked breasts, still encircled in her hands like an offering, down to what the water barely hid. She could almost feel his gaze on her naked skin. His nostrils flared and his cheekbones went ruddy. He looked up again and met her eyes, and she saw in his look both salvation and damnation. At that moment she didn\u2019t care. She wanted him.</p><p>He turned and left the room.</p><p>SIMON RAN UP THE STAIRS three at a time, his heart pounding, his breath coming hard and fast and his cock achingly erect. God! He hadn\u2019t felt this primed since he\u2019d been a lad sneaking peeks at a footman groping the giggling downstairs maid. Fourteen, and so full of lust it was all he thought of morning, noon, and night: pussy and how, exactly, he could get it.</p><p>He slammed into his room and shut the door behind him. He leaned his head against the wood and tried to catch his breath as his chest heaved. Absently, he rubbed his shoulder. Since that long-ago day, he\u2019d bedded many women, both high and low, some of them a quick tumble, some longer affairs. He\u2019d learned when a woman\u2019s eyes signaled that she was available. He\u2019d become something of a connoisseur of female flesh. Or so he\u2019d thought. Right now, he felt like that fourteen-year-old boy again, equally excited and afraid.</p><p>He closed his eyes and remembered. He\u2019d come back from sharing a nearly inedible dinner with Christian to find the house quiet. He\u2019d presumed everyone was in bed. Not even Hedge had waited up to greet him; although, knowing Hedge, that hadn\u2019t been a surprise. His foot had actually been on the first tread of the stairs when he\u2019d hesitated. He didn\u2019t know what had drawn him back to the little room. Maybe some male animal sense that knew what he would find there, what he would see. But all the same, he\u2019d been dumbfounded. Turned like Lot\u2019s wife into a pillar of salt.</p><p>Or in his case, a pillar of pure lust.</p><p>Lucy in her bath, the steam dewing her pale skin, curling the wisps of hair at her temples. Her head thrown back, her lips wet and parted . . .</p><p>Simon groaned and unbuttoned the flap of his breeches without opening his eyes.</p><p>Her neck had been arched, and he\u2019d thought he could see the pulse beating at her throat, so white and soft. A drop of water lay pooled like a pearl in an oyster\u2019s shell in the hollow between her collarbones.</p><p>He wrapped his hand around the hard meat between his legs and fisted up, the skin bunching before his fingers.</p><p>Her glorious, naked breasts, white and bell-shaped, and held, held in her small hands . . .</p><p>A faster downstroke, his hand wet with his leaking seed.</p><p>Her fingers encircling red, pointed nipples, as if she had been playing with them, arousing herself in her lonely bath.</p><p>He took his balls in his left hand and rolled them as he fisted rapidly with his right.</p><p>And as he had watched, she\u2019d pinched her nipples between her fingers, squeezing and pulling those poor, sweet nubs until\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhhh, God!\u201d He jerked, his hips pumping mindlessly.</p><p>She\u2019d moaned in pleasure.</p><p>Simon sighed and rolled his head against the wood. Once again he tried to catch his breath. Slowly, he drew out a handkerchief and wiped his hand, trying not to let self-loathing drown his soul. Then he walked to the tiny dresser and splashed water into the basin there. He doused his face and neck and hung his head, dripping, over the basin.</p><p>He was losing control.</p> <p>A laugh burst from his lips, loud in the quiet room. He\u2019d already lost control. God knew what he\u2019d say to her on the morrow, his angel whom he\u2019d ogled in her bath and whose privacy he\u2019d stolen. Simon straightened painfully, dried his face, and lay down on the bed without bothering to undress.</p><p>It was past time to leave.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Lucy pulled her gray woolen cloak more firmly about her shoulders. The wind was sharp this morning. It drove icy fingers under her skirt to wrap around her bones. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have ventured forth, especially on foot, but she needed time to think alone, and the house was full of men. True, there was only Papa, Hedge, and Simon, but she didn\u2019t want to talk to two of them, and Hedge was irritating even in the best of circumstances. Hence a country ramble seemed in order.</p><p>Lucy kicked a pebble in the lane. How did one go about meeting a gentleman across the luncheon table when he\u2019d last seen one nude and caressing one\u2019s own breasts? If she wasn\u2019t so embarrassed, she\u2019d ask Patricia. Her friend would be sure to have some type of answer, even if it wasn\u2019t the right one. And maybe Patricia would get her past this ghastly self-consciousness. It had been so horrible, last night when he\u2019d seen her. Horrible, but also wonderful, in a secret, wicked way. She\u2019d liked him looking at her. If she was honest with herself, she\u2019d admit that she wished he\u2019d stayed. Stayed and\u2014</p> <p>Footfalls, rapid and heavy, came from behind her.</p><p>Lucy suddenly realized she was alone in the road, no cottage in sight. Maiden Hill was usually a sleepy hamlet, but still . . . She whirled to confront whoever was about to overtake her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a footpad.</p><p>No, much worse. It was Simon. She almost turned away again.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His voice was subdued. He opened his mouth again but shut it abruptly as if he didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>That unusual dumbness made her feel a little better. Could he possibly be as embarrassed as she? He\u2019d stopped several paces away. He was bareheaded, without either a hat or a wig, and he stared at her mutely, his gray eyes yearning. Almost as if he needed something from her.</p> <p>Tentatively, Lucy said, \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk over to the chalk downs. Would you like to accompany me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please, most forgiving of angels.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly it was all right. She set off once again, and he measured his stride to hers.</p><p>\u201cIn the spring, these woods are full of bluebells.\u201d She gestured to the surrounding trees. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad you\u2019ve come this time of year when everything is so bleak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall try to be set upon in summer on the next occasion,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cSpring, actually.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her.</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s when the bluebells bloom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was young, Mama used to bring David and me here for picnics in the spring after we\u2019d been cooped up inside all winter. Papa was away at sea most of the time, naturally. David and I would pick as many bluebells as our arms could hold and dump them into her lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds a patient mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she die?\u201d His words were soft, intimate.</p><p>Lucy remembered again that this man had seen her at her most vulnerable. She gazed straight ahead. \u201cEleven years ago now. I was thirteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hard age to lose a parent.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. The only family he\u2019d mentioned was his brother. He seemed more intent on finding out her meager history than revealing his own. \u201cIs your mother alive?\u201d Obviously, his father must already be dead for him to have inherited the title.</p><p>\u201cNo. She died a few years ago, before . . .\u201d He stopped.</p><p>\u201cBefore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Ethan, my brother, died. Thank God.\u201d He tilted his head back and seemed to stare at the leafless branches overhead, although perhaps he looked at something entirely different. \u201cEthan was the shining apple of her eye. Her one greatest accomplishment, the person she loved most in the world. He knew how to charm\u2014both the young and the old\u2014and he could lead men. The local farmers came to him with their squabbles. He never met a soul who didn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>Lucy watched him. His voice was expressionless as he described his brother, but his hands twisted slowly at his waist. She wondered if he was even aware of their movement. \u201cYou make him sound like a paragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. But he was also more. Much more. Ethan knew right from wrong without having to think about it, without any doubts. Very few people can do that.\u201d He looked down and seemed to notice that he was pulling at his right index finger. He clasped his hands behind his back.</p><p>She must\u2019ve made a sound.</p><p>Simon glanced at her. \u201cMy elder brother was the most moral person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned, thinking about this perfect, dead brother. \u201cDid he look like you?\u201d</p><p>He seemed startled.</p><p>She raised her brows and waited.</p><p>\u201cActually, he did a little.\u201d He half smiled. \u201cEthan was a bit shorter than I\u2014no more than an inch or so\u2014but he was broader and heavier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about his hair?\u201d She looked at his nearly colorless locks. \u201cWas he fair as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He ran his palm over his head. \u201cBut more a golden color with curls. He left it long and didn\u2019t wear wigs or powder. I think he was a bit vain about it.\u201d He smiled at her mischievously.</p><p>She smiled back. She liked him like this, teasing and carefree, and suddenly realized that despite Simon\u2019s careless manner, he was very rarely at ease.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes were a clear blue,\u201d he continued. \u201cMother used to say they were her favorite color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I prefer gray.\u201d</p><p>He bowed with a flourish. \u201cMy lady honors me.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied in reply, but then sobered before asking, \u201cHow did Ethan die?\u201d</p><p>He stopped, forcing her to a halt as well. She looked up into his face.</p><p>He seemed to be struggling; his brows were pulled together over those beautiful ice-gray eyes. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>An insect buzzed past her head, followed by a loud shot. Simon grabbed her roughly and pushed her into the ditch. Lucy landed on her hip, pain and astonishment streaking through her, and then Simon landed on her, squashing her into the mud and dead leaves. Lucy turned her head, trying to draw a full breath. It felt like a horse was sitting on her back.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, goddamnit.\u201d He placed his hand over her head and pushed it back down. \u201cSomebody\u2019s shooting at us.\u201d</p><p>She spat out a leaf. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>Oddly, he chuckled in her ear. \u201cWonderful angel.\u201d His breath smelled of tea and mint.</p><p>Another shot. The leaves exploded a few feet from her shoulder.</p><p>He swore rather colorfully. \u201cHe\u2019s reloading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell where he is?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAcross the road somewhere. I can\u2019t pinpoint the exact location. Hush.\u201d</p><p>Lucy became aware that aside from the problem with breathing and the fact that she might die violently at any second, it was rather nice having Simon lying on her. He was wonderfully warm. And he smelled quite nice, not of tobacco like most men, but of some exotic scent. Maybe sandalwood? His arms, bracketing her body, felt comforting.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Simon placed his mouth next to her ear, his lips caressing her with each word. \u201cAt the next shot, we run. He has only the one rifle, and he has to reload. When he\u2014\u201d</p><p>A ball burrowed into the ground inches from her face.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Simon pulled her to her feet and ran before she had time to even register his command. Lucy panted to keep up, expecting any minute to feel the next shot between her shoulder blades. How long did it take to reload a gun? Only minutes, surely. Her breath rasped painfully in her chest.</p><p>Then Simon was shoving her ahead of him. \u201cGo! Into the woods. Keep running!\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to leave him? Dear God, he would die. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s after me.\u201d He glared fiercely into her eyes. \u201cI cannot defend myself with you here. Go now!\u201d</p><p>His last word coincided with the blast of yet another shot. Lucy turned and ran, not daring to look behind her, not daring to stop. She sobbed once and then the woods enveloped her in cool darkness. She ran as best she could, stumbling through the undergrowth, the branches catching on her cloak, tears of fear and anguish streaming down her face. Simon was back there, unarmed, confronting a man with a gun. Oh, God! She wanted to go back, but she couldn\u2019t\u2014with her out of the way, he at least had a chance against their attacker.</p><p>Footsteps sounded heavily behind her.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s heart pounded right into her throat. She turned to face her attacker, her fists raised in puny defiance.</p><p>\u201cHush, it\u2019s me.\u201d Simon clasped her to his heaving chest, his breath panting across her face. \u201cShh, it\u2019s all right. You are so brave, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She laid her head against his chest and heard the pounding of his heart. She clutched the fabric of his coat with both hands. \u201cYou\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. I fear men like me never\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped because she couldn\u2019t keep back a choked sob.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered in a more grave voice. He tilted her face away from his chest and wiped her tears with the palm of his hand. He looked concerned and weary and uncertain. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweeting. I\u2019m not worth it, really I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned and tried to blink away the tears that kept coming. \u201cWhy do you always say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou are very, very important to me, and I\u2019ll cry for you if I want.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth curved up tenderly, but he didn\u2019t mock her silly speech. \u201cI am humbled by your tears.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked away; she couldn\u2019t bear to hold his gaze. \u201cThe shooter, is he . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, I think,\u201d Simon murmured. \u201cA rather rickety farmer\u2019s cart came along the road, drawn by a swaybacked gray. The cart was filled with laborers, and it must\u2019ve scared the shooter off.\u201d</p><p>Lucy puffed out a laugh. \u201cThe Jones boys. They\u2019ve been useful for once in their lives.\u201d Then a sudden thought struck and she leaned back to look at him. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled at her, but she could tell by his eyes that his thoughts were elsewhere. \u201cWe\u2019d better get you home and then . . .\u201d</p><p>She waited, but he\u2019d trailed off again, thinking.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>He turned his head so his lips brushed across her cheek, and she almost missed his words. \u201cThen I need to leave this place. To protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSHOT AT!\u201d CAPTAIN CRADDOCK-HAYES roared an hour later.</p><p>All at once, Simon could see the iron hand that had commanded a ship and men for thirty years. He half expected the diamond segments in the windowpanes to rattle right out of their lead frames. They were in the formal sitting room of the Craddock-Hayes house. It was prettily decorated\u2014puce-and-cream-striped curtains, similarly colored settees scattered here and there, and a rather nice china clock on the mantel\u2014but he preferred Lucy\u2019s little sitting room at the back of the house.</p><p>Not that he\u2019d been given a choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy daughter, a flower of womanhood, a meek and dutiful gel.\u201d The captain paced the length of the room, arm batting the air for emphasis, bandy legs stomping. \u201cInnocent of the ways of the world, sheltered all her life, accosted not half a mile from her childhood home. Ha! Haven\u2019t had a murder in Maiden Hill in a quarter century. Five and twenty years! And then you show up.\u201d</p><p>The captain halted in midpace between the mantel and a table set with naval bric-a-brac. He drew an enormous breath. \u201cScoundrel!\u201d he blasted, nearly taking Simon\u2019s eyebrows off. \u201cRuffian! Cad! Vile endangerer of English, ah, er . . .\u201d His lips moved as he searched for the word.</p><p>\u201cWenches,\u201d Hedge supplied.</p><p>The manservant had brought in the tea earlier, instead of Betsy or Mrs. Brodie, apparently to deny Simon the succor of female sympathy. Hedge still lurked, fiddling with the silverware as an excuse, listening eagerly.</p> <p>The captain glared. \u201cLadies.\u201d He transferred his glower to Simon. \u201cNever have I heard of such villainy, sirrah! What do you have to say for yourself? Eh? Eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say you\u2019re quite right, Captain.\u201d Simon leaned back wearily on the settee. \u201cExcept for the \u2018meek and dutiful\u2019 part. With all due respect, sir, I\u2019ve not noticed Miss Craddock-Hayes to be either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare, sir, after nearly causing my daughter\u2019s death!\u201d The older man shook a fist in his direction, his face purpling. \u201cHa. Have you packed off from this house before the hour\u2019s gone, I will. I\u2019ll not stand for it. Lucy\u2019s the very heart and soul of this community. Many people, not just me, hold her dear. I\u2019ll see you run out of town on a rail, tarred and feathered, if I have to!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCor!\u201d Hedge interjected, his emotions obviously stirred by the captain\u2019s speech; although, it was hard to tell whether from fondness for Lucy or the prospect of seeing a member of the nobility on a rail.</p><p>Simon sighed. His head was beginning to hurt. This morning he\u2019d experienced the most bone-chilling fear he had ever felt, wondering if a bullet would kill the precious creature beneath him, knowing he would go mad if it did, terrified he would be unable to save her. He never wanted to feel that helpless dread for another\u2019s life again. Of course, he hadn\u2019t had much actual contact with the ground since Lucy\u2019s soft limbs interposed themselves between his body and the earth. And hadn\u2019t that been wonderful in a heart-stoppingly god-awful way? To feel what he\u2019d vowed he never would\u2014her face next to his, her rump snug against his groin. Even in the midst of his horror that this was all his fault, that his very presence had put her life in danger, even with layer upon layer of good English cloth between them, even then he\u2019d responded to her. But Simon knew now that his angel could get a rise out of him if he were ten days dead, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t be of the religious variety.</p> <p>\u201cI apologize most profusely for putting Miss Craddock-Hayes in danger, Captain,\u201d he said now. \u201cI assure you, though I know it does little good at this late date, that had I any inkling she would be imperiled, I would\u2019ve slit my own wrists rather than see her harmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFffsst.\u201d Hedge made a derisive sound, oddly effective despite its wordlessness.</p><p>The captain merely stared at him for a very long minute. \u201cHa,\u201d he finally said. \u201cPretty words, but I think you mean them.\u201d</p><p>Hedge looked as startled as Simon felt.</p><p>\u201cStill want you out of this house,\u201d the captain grunted.</p><p>Simon inclined his head. \u201cI already have Henry packing my things, and I\u2019ve sent word to Mr. Fletcher at his inn. We will be out within the hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d The captain took a seat and contemplated him.</p><p>Hedge hurried over with a cup of tea.</p><p>The older man waved him away. \u201cNot that bilge water. Get the brandy, man.\u201d</p><p>Hedge reverently opened a cupboard and brought out a cut-glass decanter half-full with a rich amber liquid. He poured two glasses and brought them over, then stood looking wistfully at the decanter.</p><p>\u201cOh, go ahead,\u201d the captain said.</p><p>Hedge poured himself a scant inch and held the glass, waiting.</p><p>\u201cTo the fairer sex,\u201d Simon proposed.</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d the older man grumbled, but he drank.</p> <p>Hedge tossed back his brandy in one gulp, then closed his eyes and shuddered. \u201cWonnerful stuff, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Know a smuggler on the coast,\u201d the captain muttered. \u201cWill she still be in danger once you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon tilted his head against the back of the settee. The brandy was fine, but it merely made his head worse. \u201cThey\u2019re after me, and like the jackals they are, they\u2019ll follow the scent away from here once I leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou admit you know these murderers?\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cSame ones as left you for dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr their hired thugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this about, eh?\u201d the captain growled. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevenge.\u201d Simon opened his eyes.</p><p>The old man didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYours or theirs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Simon looked into his glass, swirling the liquid, watching it paint the interior. \u201cThey killed my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d The older man drank to that. \u201cThen I wish you luck. Elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you.\u201d Simon drained his glass and stood.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, you know what they say about revenge.\u201d</p><p>Simon turned and asked the question, because it was expected and because the old man had been more lenient than he had any right to hope for. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful with revenge.\u201d The captain grinned like an evil old troll. \u201cSometimes it twists around and bites you on the arse.\u201d</p><p>LUCY STOOD AT HER NARROW BEDROOM window overlooking the drive and watched Mr. Hedge and Simon\u2019s valet load the imposing black carriage. They appeared to be arguing over how to stack the luggage. Mr. Hedge was gesticulating wildly, the valet had a sneer on his uncommonly handsome lips, and the footman actually holding the box in question was staggering. They didn\u2019t look like they would have the project done anytime soon, but the fact remained\u2014Simon was leaving. Although she\u2019d known this day would come, she somehow still hadn\u2019t been expecting it, and now that it was here, she felt . . . what?</p><p>Someone knocked at her door, interrupting her confused thoughts.</p><p>\u201cCome.\u201d She let the gauzy curtain drop and turned.</p><p>Simon opened the door but remained in the hall. \u201cMay I have a word with you? Please.\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cI thought we could take a turn around your garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be proper for her to talk to him alone here. She caught up a woolen shawl and preceded him down the stairs.</p><p>He held the kitchen door for her, and Lucy stepped into the cold sunshine. Mrs. Brodie\u2019s vegetable garden was in a sad state this time of year. The hard earth was crusted with a thin layer of killing frost. Skeleton stalks of kale leaned in a drunken row. Beside them, some thin onion leaves were frozen to the ground, black and brittle. A few shrunken apples, missed at picking time, clung to the bare branches of the pruned trees. Winter overlaid the garden in a sleep that mimicked death.</p><p>Lucy folded her arms about herself and took a steadying breath. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t remain and put you and your family at further risk. This morning was too close, too deadly. If the assassin hadn\u2019t missed his first shot . . .\u201d He grimaced. \u201cIt was my own selfish vanity that let me stay so long as it is. I never should have lingered this past week, knowing what lengths they would go to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you will return to London.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him and remain impassive, so she kept her gaze on the rattling tree branches. \u201cWon\u2019t they find you there?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a harsh sound. \u201cMy angel, it is more a matter of me finding them, I fear.\u201d</p><p>She did glance at him then. His face was bitter. And lonely.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hesitated, appeared to debate, then finally shook his head. \u201cThere is so much you do not know about me, will never know about me. Very few do, and in your case, I prefer it that way.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to tell her, and she felt an unreasoning spurt of rage. Did he still think she was a glass figurine to wrap in gauze? Or did he simply not respect her enough to confide in her?</p><p>\u201cDo you really prefer I don\u2019t know you?\u201d She turned to face him. \u201cOr do you say that to every naive woman you meet so they\u2019ll think you sophisticated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink?\u201d His lips quirked. \u201cYou cut me to the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fobbing me off with blather.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, his head rearing back as if she\u2019d slapped him. \u201cBlather\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, blather.\u201d Her voice trembled with anger, but she couldn\u2019t seem to steady it. \u201cYou play the fool so you won\u2019t have to tell the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only said it to you.\u201d Now he sounded irritated.</p><p>Well, good. So was she. \u201cIs that how you want to live? All alone? Never letting anyone in?\u201d She shouldn\u2019t push, she knew, as this was the last time they would see each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less a matter of wanting as it is . . .\u201d He shrugged. \u201cSome things can\u2019t be changed. And it suits me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds a very solitary existence, and a not entirely satisfactory one,\u201d Lucy said slowly, choosing her words carefully, lining them up like soldiers to do battle. \u201cTo go through life without a true confidant. Someone to whom you can reveal yourself without fear. Someone who knows your faults and weaknesses and who cares for you nonetheless. Someone for whom you don\u2019t have to play a role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou frighten me more than I can say at times.\u201d His silver eyes gleamed as he whispered the words, and she wished she could read them. \u201cDo not tempt a man so long without the bread of companionship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you stayed . . .\u201d She had to stop and catch her breath; her chest felt tight. She gambled so much on these few seconds, and she needed to speak eloquently. \u201cIf you stayed, perhaps we could learn more about each other. Perhaps I could become that confidant for you. That companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not put you at further risk.\u201d But she thought she saw hesitation in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that which you ask for\u201d\u2014he looked away\u2014\u201cI do not think I have it in me to give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lucy stared down at her hands. So this was defeat.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she interrupted, talking quickly and loudly, not wanting to hear his pity. \u201cYou are from the fast city, and I am only a simple gentlewoman living in the country. I understand that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned back and took a step toward her so they stood only a hand\u2019s width apart. \u201cDon\u2019t reduce what is between us to a conflict of rural and urban mores and ways.\u201d</p><p>The wind blew against her and Lucy shivered.</p><p>He shifted so his body shielded hers from the breeze. \u201cIn the past week and a half, I have felt more than I ever have before in my life. You stir something in me. I . . .\u201d He gazed over her head at the cloudy sky.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to express myself. What I feel.\u201d He looked down at her and smiled faintly. \u201cAnd that is very unusual for me, as you know by now. I can only say that I am glad that I\u2019ve met you, Lucy Craddock-Hayes.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes. \u201cAnd I, you.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand and gently uncurled her fingers so that her palm lay cupped between his own like a flower nestled among leaves. \u201cI will remember you all the days of my life,\u201d he murmured so low she almost didn\u2019t hear. \u201cAnd I am not sure whether that is a blessing or a curse.\u201d He bent over their hands, and she felt the warm brush of his lips against her cold palm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked down at the back of his head, and one of her tears fell to his hair.</p><p>He straightened. Without looking at her, he said, \u201cGood-bye.\u201d And walked away.</p><p>Lucy sobbed once and then she had herself contained. She remained in the garden until she could no longer hear the departing carriage wheels.</p><p>SIMON CLIMBED INTO HIS CARRIAGE and settled into the red leather squabs. He rapped on the roof, then leaned back so he could watch the Craddock-Hayes house recede out the window. He couldn\u2019t see Lucy\u2014she\u2019d remained in the garden, still as an alabaster statue when he left\u2014but the house could be her surrogate. They jolted forward.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you stayed in this country village as long as you did.\u201d Christian sighed across from him. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d\u2019ve found it terribly boring. What did you do all day? Read?\u201d</p><p>John Coachman whipped the horses to a trot down the drive. The carriage swayed. Henry, sharing the seat with Christian, cleared his throat and cast his gaze to the ceiling.</p><p>Christian glanced at him uneasily. \u201c\u2019Course, the Craddock-Hayeses were very hospitable and all that. Good people. Miss Craddock-Hayes was nicely solicitous of me during those ghastly dinners. I fancy she thought she was protecting me from her father, the old blowhard. Very kind. She\u2019ll make a good vicar\u2019s wife when she marries that fellow Penweeble.\u201d</p><p>Simon almost winced, but he caught himself in time. Or thought he did. Henry cleared his throat so loudly that Simon feared he\u2019d dislodge some vital organ.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, man?\u201d Christian frowned at the valet. \u201cHave you got some kind of catarrh? You sound like my father in one of his more disapproving moods.\u201d</p> <p>The house was a toy now, a small, bucolic spot surrounded by the oaks of the drive.</p><p>\u201cMy health is quite all right, sir,\u201d Henry said frostily. \u201cThank you for inquiring. Have you thought of what you will do on your return to London, Lord Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d They\u2019d rounded a curve, and he could no longer see the house. He peered for a moment more, but that chapter of his life was gone. She was gone. Best forgotten, really, all of it.</p><p>If he could.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably want to do the rounds,\u201d Christian nattered on blithely. \u201cCatch up on the gossip at Angelo\u2019s and the gambling dens and the soiled doves at the more notorious houses.\u201d</p><p>Simon straightened and closed the window shade. \u201cActually, I\u2019m going on a hunt. I\u2019ll have my nose to the ground, ears flapping, an eager bloodhound racing to find my attackers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut wasn\u2019t it footpads?\u201d Christian looked puzzled. \u201cI mean, pretty hard to do, track down a couple of lowlifes in London. The city\u2019s full of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a fairly good idea who they are.\u201d Simon rubbed his right index finger with the opposite hand. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m almost sure I\u2019ve already made their acquaintance. Or at least the acquaintance of their masters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Christian stared, perhaps realizing for the first time that he was missing something. \u201cAnd what will you do when you have them cornered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, call them out.\u201d Simon bared his teeth. \u201cCall them out and kill them.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201c. . . And I really do think the repairs to the roof over the vestry will last this time. Thomas Jones assured me that he\u2019ll do the work himself instead of letting one of his lads bungle it.\u201d Eustace paused in his dissertation on the church improvements to carefully guide the horse past a rut in the road.</p><p>\u201cHow nice,\u201d Lucy interjected while she had time.</p><p>The sun was out as it had been the previous Tuesday. They drove into Maiden Hill on the road Eustace always took, past the bakery and the same two elderly ladies haggling with the baker. The ladies turned as they had the week before and waved. Nothing had changed. Simon Iddesleigh might never have landed so suddenly in her life only to fly away again.</p> <p>Lucy felt a mad urge to scream.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m not that certain about the nave,\u201d Eustace replied.</p><p>This was new to the catalogue of church problems. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the nave?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, lines etching themselves into his normally smooth brow. \u201cThe roof has begun to leak there as well. Not very much, only enough to stain the ceiling so far, but it will be harder to get to the damage because of the vaulting. I\u2019m not sure even Tom\u2019s eldest will enjoy that job. We may have to pay him extra.\u201d</p><p>Lucy couldn\u2019t help it. She threw back her head and laughed, silly peals that were overloud and seemed to echo in the bright winter air. Eustace half smiled in that embarrassed way one does when one isn\u2019t quite sure of the joke. The two elderly ladies trotted across the green to see what the commotion was about, and the smith and his boy came out of his shop.</p><p>Lucy tried to calm herself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize.\u201d Eustace glanced at her, his coffee-brown eyes shy. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear your mirth. You don\u2019t often laugh.\u201d</p><p>Which only made her feel worse, of course.</p><p>Lucy closed her eyes. She suddenly realized that she should have cut this off ages ago. \u201cEustace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted\u2014\u201d He started talking at the same time as she, and their words collided. He stopped and smiled. \u201cPlease.\u201d He indicated she should continue.</p><p>But Lucy felt awful now and not eager to start what would no doubt be an uncomfortable discussion. \u201cNo, I beg your pardon. What did you mean to say?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath, his wide chest expanding under the coarse brown wool of his coat. \u201cI have wanted to speak to you about an important matter for some time now.\u201d He turned the carriage behind the church, and suddenly they were secluded.</p><p>Lucy had a terrible premonition. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>But for once Eustace didn\u2019t defer to her. He continued speaking right over her. \u201cI wanted to tell you how much I admire you. How much I enjoy spending this time with you. They\u2019re comfortable, don\u2019t you think, our little carriage rides?\u201d</p><p>Lucy tried again. \u201cEustace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t interrupt. Let me get this out. You\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t be so nervous, as I know you so well.\u201d He inhaled and blew out a gust of air. \u201cLucy Craddock-Hayes, will you do me the honor of being my bride? There. That\u2019s over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eustace pulled her to him abruptly, and her voice ended in a squeak. He crushed her gently against his big chest, and it was like being enveloped by a giant, smothering pillow, not unpleasant but not entirely comfortable either. His face loomed above hers before he swooped in to kiss her.</p><p>Oh, for goodness\u2019 sake! A wave of exasperation crashed over her head. Not, she was sure, what one should be feeling when being kissed by a handsome young man. And to be fair, Eustace\u2019s kiss was quite . . . nice. His lips were warm, and he moved them in a pleasing way over her own. He smelled of peppermint\u2014he must have prepared for this kiss by chewing some\u2014and on that thought, Lucy\u2019s impatience changed to fond sympathy.</p><p>He broke away, looking very pleased with himself. \u201cShall we tell your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEustace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGadzooks! I should\u2019ve asked his permission first.\u201d His brow crimped in thought.</p><p>\u201cEustace\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it can\u2019t come as any great surprise, can it? I\u2019ve been courting you for a long time now. \u2019Spect the village considers us already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEustace!\u201d</p><p>He started slightly at the loudness of her voice. \u201cMy dear?\u201d</p><p>Lucy closed her eyes. She hadn\u2019t meant to shout, but he would natter on. She shook her head. Best to concentrate if she was to get through this. \u201cWhilst I am deeply appreciative of the honor you do me, Eustace, I . . .\u201d She made the mistake of looking at him.</p><p>He sat there, a lock of brown hair blowing against his cheek, looking perfectly innocent. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. I really don\u2019t think the captain will object. He would\u2019ve shooed me off long before now if he didn\u2019t approve. And you\u2019re well past the age of consent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He flushed. \u201cI meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you meant.\u201d Lucy sighed. \u201cBut I . . . I really can\u2019t marry you, Eustace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hurt him. \u201cCan\u2019t we just leave it at that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He drew himself up in an oddly dignified manner. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if you\u2019re going to reject me, I think I at least deserve to know the reason why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to lead you on. It\u2019s just that\u201d\u2014she frowned down at her hands as she tried to find the words\u2014\u201cover the years, we fell into a kind of habit, one that I no longer questioned. And I should have.\u201d</p><p>The horse shook its head, jangling the tack.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a habit?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He placed both his big hands on his knees and clenched them. \u201cAll this time I expected that we would marry.\u201d His hands flexed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the expectation of marriage as well; don\u2019t tell me you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you expect me to give this up on a whim of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a whim.\u201d She drew a steadying breath. Crying would be a cowardly way to win his sympathy. Eustace deserved more from her. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking and thinking over the last days. I\u2019ve agonized about what we are to each other. It just isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Eustace asked the question quietly. \u201cWhy should you question what we have, what we are together? It seems nice to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s just it.\u201d Lucy looked into his eyes. \u201cNice isn\u2019t enough for me. I want\u2014I need\u2014more.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment as the wind blew a few leftover leaves against the church door. \u201cIs it because of that Iddesleigh fellow?\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked away, took a deep breath, and let it out in a sigh. \u201cI expect it is, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he isn\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why\u201d\u2014he pounded his thigh suddenly\u2014\u201cwhy can\u2019t you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair to you. You must know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should let me be the judge of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Lucy conceded. \u201cBut then you need to let me be the judge of what is fair to me. And living my life in a compromise, in a nice marriage, is no longer tenable for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Eustace\u2019s voice was husky. He sounded close to tears.</p><p>Lucy felt moisture prick her own eyes. How could she have brought such a good man so low?</p><p>\u201cDo you think you love that fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She closed her eyes, but the tears overflowed nevertheless. \u201cAll I know is that he opened a door into a whole new world I never even knew existed. I\u2019ve stepped through that door, and I can\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She made a slashing motion with her hand. \u201cI know he won\u2019t be coming back, that I\u2019ll never see or speak to him again. But it doesn\u2019t matter, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and, once started, couldn\u2019t seem to stop. His head swung back and forth in a stubborn, bearlike movement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like . . .\u201d Lucy raised her hands in a pleading gesture as she tried to think of the analogy. \u201cLike being blind from birth and then one day suddenly being able to see. And not just see, but to witness the sun rising in all her glory across an azure sky. The dusky lavenders and blues lightening to pinks and reds, spreading across the horizon until the entire Earth is lit. Until one has to blink and fall to one\u2019s knees in awe at the light.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stilled and stared at her as if dumbstruck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Lucy whispered. \u201cEven if one were made blind again in the next instant, one would ever after remember and know what was missed. What could be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t marry me,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucy let her hands drop, deflated and weary. \u201cI won\u2019t marry you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDAMMIT!\u201d EDWARD DE RAAF, the fifth Earl of Swar-tingham, roared as yet another boy whizzed past. The boy somehow managed to avoid seeing de Raaf\u2019s large, waving arm.</p><p>Simon stifled a sigh. He sat in his favorite London coffeehouse, his feet\u2014shod in new red-heeled pumps\u2014propped on a nearby chair, and yet he could not drag his mind away from the little town he\u2019d left over a week ago.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019you think the service is getting worse?\u201d his companion asked as he was passed over again. The boy must be blind. Or willfully not seeing. De Raaf stood a solid six feet and some inches, had a sallow, pockmarked face, and striking midnight black hair worn in a messy queue. His expression at the moment was enough to curdle cream. He didn\u2019t exactly blend into a crowd.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon sipped his own coffee thoughtfully. He\u2019d arrived earlier than the other man and was thus already set up. \u201cIt\u2019s always been this awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do we come here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I come here for the excellent coffee.\u201d Simon glanced around the dingy, low-ceilinged coffeehouse. The Agrarian Society, an eclectic, loose-knit club, met here. The only terms of membership were that the man had to have an interest in agriculture. \u201cAnd, of course, the sophisticated atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf shot him a ludicrously outraged look.</p><p>A fight broke out in the corner between a macaroni in a deplorable pink-powdered, three-tailed wig, and a country squire wearing muddy jackboots. The boy scurried past them again\u2014de Raaf didn\u2019t even get a chance to raise his hand this time\u2014and Harry Pye stole into the coffeehouse. Pye moved like a cat on the hunt, gracefully and without any sound. Add to that his nondescript appearance\u2014he was of average height and looks and favored a dull brown wardrobe\u2014and it was a wonder anyone noticed him at all. Simon narrowed his eyes. With his physical control, Pye would have made a formidable swordsman. But since he was a commoner, no doubt he had never held a sword; only nobility could wear one. Which didn\u2019t stop Pye from carrying a wicked little blade in his left boot.</p><p>\u201cMy lords.\u201d Pye sat in the remaining chair at their table.</p><p>De Raaf let out a long-suffering sigh. \u201cHow many times have I told you to call me Edward or de Raaf?\u201d</p><p>Pye half smiled in acknowledgment at the familiar words, but it was to Simon he spoke. \u201cI am glad to see you well, my lord. We had news of your near murder.\u201d</p> <p>Simon shrugged easily. \u201cA trifle, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard.\u201d</p><p>The boy slammed a full mug of coffee down beside Pye.</p><p>De Raaf\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pye\u2019s gaze lowered to the empty space on the table before the earl. \u201cAren\u2019t you having a cup today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s decided to give up coffee,\u201d Simon cut in smoothly. \u201cHeard it\u2019s not good for the libido. Huntington wrote a treatise on it recently, didn\u2019t you hear? It especially affects those nearing their middle years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Pye blinked.</p> <p>De Raaf\u2019s pale, pockmarked face crimsoned. \u201cWhat a lot of rot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed it affecting me.\u201d Simon smiled blandly and sipped his coffee. \u201cBut then again, de Raaf is considerably older than I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s recently married. Bound to have a slowing-down consequence, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow see here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Pye\u2019s lips twitched. If Simon hadn\u2019t been watching closely, he\u2019d have missed it. \u201cBut I\u2019m newly married as well,\u201d Pye interrupted softly. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve noticed any, ah, problem. Must be the age.\u201d</p><p>Simon felt a strange pang as he realized he was the odd man out. They turned in unison to the earl.</p><p>Who sputtered, \u201cDespicable, lying, caddish\u2014\u201d</p><p>The boy whirled by again. De Raaf frantically waved his arm. \u201cAhhh, damn!\u201d</p><p>The lad disappeared into the kitchen without ever turning his head.</p><p>\u201cGood thing you\u2019ve given up the sacred brew.\u201d Simon smirked.</p><p>A crash came from the brawl in the corner. Heads swiveled. The country squire had the dandy, sans wig, on his back against a table. Two chairs lay broken nearby.</p><p>Pye frowned. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Arlington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Simon replied. \u201cHard to recognize him without that atrocious wig, isn\u2019t it? Can\u2019t think why he chose pink. No doubt that\u2019s the reason the rural chap is pummeling him. Probably overcome with loathing for the wig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were arguing over swine breeding.\u201d De Raaf shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a bit unreasonable about farrowing pens. Runs in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should help him?\u201d Pye asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d De Raaf looked around for the boy, an evil gleam in his eye. \u201cArlington could benefit from a beating. Might knock some sense into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d Simon raised his mug again, but then lowered it as he saw a slight, scruffy character hesitating in the doorway.</p><p>The man scanned the room and spotted him. He started toward them.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d de Raaf exclaimed beside him. \u201cThey\u2019re ignoring me on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to get you a coffee?\u201d Pye asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m going to do it myself or die trying.\u201d</p><p>The man stopped before Simon. \u201cTook me most of the day, Guv, but I\u2019ve found him.\u201d He proffered a dirty scrap of paper.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Simon gave the man a gold coin.</p><p>\u201cTa.\u201d The little man tugged a forelock and disappeared.</p><p>Simon opened the paper and read: The Devil\u2019s Playground after eleven. He crumpled the note and stuffed it in a pocket. And only then realized the other two men were watching him. He raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d De Raaf rumbled. \u201cFound another one to duel?\u201d</p><p>Simon blinked, taken aback. He thought he had kept his dueling secret from de Raaf and Pye. He\u2019d not wanted their interference or their moralizing.</p><p>\u201cSurprised we know?\u201d De Raaf leaned back, endangering the wooden chair he sat in. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that hard to ferret out how you\u2019ve been spending the last couple of months, especially after that sword fight with Hartwell.\u201d</p><p>What was the big man\u2019s point? \u201cNot your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is when you\u2019re risking your life with each duel,\u201d Pye answered for them both.</p><p>Simon stared hard.</p><p>Neither man blinked.</p><p>Damn them. He looked away. \u201cThey killed Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Peller killed your brother.\u201d De Raaf tapped a big finger on the table in emphasis. \u201cAnd he\u2019s already dead. You ran him through more than two years ago. Why start again now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeller was part of a conspiracy.\u201d Simon looked away. \u201cA bloody conspiracy from hell. I only found out several months ago, whilst going through some of Ethan\u2019s papers.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf sat back and folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cI discovered that fact right before I challenged Hartwell.\u201d Simon fingered his index finger. \u201cThere were four of them in the conspiracy. Two are left now, and they\u2019re all culpable. What would you do if it were your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the same as you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf grimaced. \u201cThe chances you\u2019ll be killed increase with every duel you fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve won both duels so far.\u201d Simon looked away. \u201cWhat makes you think I can\u2019t win the next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the best swordsman can slip or be distracted for a moment.\u201d De Raaf looked irritable. \u201cOne moment, that\u2019s all it takes. Those are your words.\u201d</p><p>Simon shrugged.</p><p>Pye leaned forward, his voice lowering. \u201cAt least let us go with you, be your seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I already have someone else in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat lad you\u2019ve been partnering with at Angelo\u2019s?\u201d de Raaf cut in.</p><p>Simon nodded. \u201cChristian Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>Pye\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cHow well do you know him? Can you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d Simon laughed. \u201cYoung, I concede, but quite good with a blade. Almost as good as I, in fact. He\u2019s beaten me in practice once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut would he guard your back in a crisis?\u201d De Raaf shook his head. \u201cWould he even know to look for tricks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides\u201d\u2014Simon looked from one to the other\u2014\u201cthe both of you are in a state of connubial bliss. Think you that I would want to present either of your wives with a dead husband before your first anniversary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d de Raaf began.</p><p>\u201cNo. Leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn you.\u201d The big man stood, his chair nearly toppling over. \u201cYou had better not be dead the next time I see you.\u201d He banged his way out of the coffeehouse.</p><p>Simon frowned.</p><p>Pye silently emptied his cup. \u201cSince you\u2019ve reminded me of my lady, I\u2019d best be leaving as well.\u201d He rose. \u201cIf you have need of me, Lord Iddesleigh, you have only to send word.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded. \u201cThe kindness of friendship is all I ask.\u201d</p><p>Pye touched him on the shoulder and then he, too, was gone.</p><p>Simon looked at his coffee. It was cold, with a ring of greasy scum floating on the surface, but he didn\u2019t order a new cup. At eleven tonight he would track down another of his brother\u2019s murderers and challenge him to a duel. Until then, he had nothing in particular to do. No one waited for his return. No one grew anxious as the time wore on. No one would mourn if he did not turn up.</p><p>Simon swallowed some of the filthy coffee and grimaced. Nothing was as pathetic as a man who lied to himself. It wasn\u2019t that no one would mourn his death\u2014Pye and de Raaf had just now indicated that they would do just that\u2014but that no woman would mourn. No, he still lied. Lucy. Lucy wouldn\u2019t mourn. He mouthed her name and tapped his fingers against the mug. When had he forfeited a normal life, one that included a wife and family? Was it after Ethan had died and he\u2019d suddenly had the title and all the cares it represented thrust on him? Or later, when he\u2019d killed the first one? John Peller. Simon shuddered. His dreams were still haunted by Peller\u2019s fingers, falling disconnected to the dewy grass like gruesome flowers newly bloomed.</p><p>God.</p><p>And he could live with that, could live with the macabre nightmares. After all, the man had killed his only brother. He\u2019d had to die. The dreams had even begun to abate. Until he\u2019d found out there were more men to kill.</p><p>Simon raised the mug to his lips before remembering it was empty. Even after dueling Hartwell, it was Peller and his fingers he still dreamed about at night. Strange. It must be some quirk of the mind. Not a normal quirk, to be sure, because his mind was no longer normal. Some men might be able to kill without changing, but he wasn\u2019t among their number. And that thought brought him around once again. He\u2019d been right to leave Lucy behind. To decide not to cleave unto a wife, no matter the temptation to let go and live like an ordinary man. He couldn\u2019t anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d lost that choice when he\u2019d set his course of revenge.</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T THINK THIS IDDESLEIGH gentleman can be a good acquaintance for you, Christian, viscount or no viscount.\u201d Matilda looked pointedly at their only son as she passed him the bread. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sir Rupert grimaced. His wife\u2019s red hair had mellowed over the years of their marriage, lightening with the addition of gray, but her temper had not. Matilda had been the only daughter of a baronet, an old family now impoverished. Before he\u2019d met her, Sir Rupert had thought all aristocratic women were little more than wilting lilies. Not she. He\u2019d found a will of iron underneath Matilda\u2019s delicate exterior.</p><p>He raised his glass and watched to see how this dinner table confrontation would play out. Matilda was usually a very lenient mother, letting her children choose their own friends and interests. But she had recently gotten a bee in her bonnet about Iddesleigh and Christian.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Mater, what do you have against him?\u201d Christian grinned charmingly at his mother, his hair the same shade of Titian red that hers had been twenty years before.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a rake, and not a nice one either.\u201d Matilda looked over the half-moon spectacles she wore only at home with family. \u201cIt\u2019s said he killed two men in separate duels.\u201d</p> <p>Christian dropped the bread basket.</p><p>Poor lad. Sir Rupert mentally shook his head. He wasn\u2019t yet used to prevarication. Fortunately, he was saved by his elder sister.</p><p>\u201cI think Lord Iddesleigh a perfectly delicious man,\u201d Rebecca said, defiance in her dark blue eyes. \u201cThe rumors only add to his appeal.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. Becca, their second child and the beauty of the family with her classical features, had been at loggerheads with his wife since her fourteenth birthday a decade ago. He\u2019d hoped she would\u2019ve grown out of her spitefulness by now.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear, I know.\u201d Matilda, long used to her daughter\u2019s gambits, didn\u2019t bother rising to the bait. \u201cAlthough I wish you wouldn\u2019t put it in such a crass way. Delicious makes the man sound like a side of bacon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Mama\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see what you find to like about him, Becca.\u201d Julia, the eldest, frowned down at her roast chicken.</p><p>Sir Rupert had long wondered if she\u2019d inherited her mother\u2019s nearsightedness. But despite the fact that she considered herself practical, Julia had a vain streak and would have been outraged at the suggestion of spectacles.</p><p>She continued, \u201cHis humor is not often kind, and he looks at one in such a queer way.\u201d</p><p>Christian laughed. \u201cReally, Julia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t ever seen Viscount Iddesleigh,\u201d Sarah, the youngest and most like her father, said. She surveyed her siblings with analytical brown eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose he\u2019s invited to the same balls as I. What is he like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a jolly fine fellow. Very funny and superb with a sword. He\u2019s taught me a few moves. . . .\u201d Christian caught his mother\u2019s look and found a sudden interest in his peas.</p><p>Julia took over. \u201cLord Iddesleigh is above average height, but not so tall as our brother. A handsome form and face and he is considered an excellent dancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dances divinely,\u201d Becca tossed in.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d Julia cut her meat into precise little cubes. \u201cBut he rarely dances with unmarried ladies even though he himself is unwed and therefore should be looking for a suitable wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can hold his lack of interest in marriage against him,\u201d Christian protested.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes are an unnatural light gray, and he uses them to stare at people in a horrible manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think why anyone would like him.\u201d Julia popped one of the chicken cubes into her mouth and raised her eyebrows at her brother.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I do like him, despite his unnatural eyes.\u201d Christian bulged out his own eyes at his eldest sister.</p><p>Becca giggled behind her hand. Julia sniffed and took a bite of creamed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Matilda studied her son. She looked unswayed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard your father\u2019s opinion of Lord Iddesleigh yet.\u201d</p><p>All eyes turned to him, the head of this little family. How close he\u2019d come to losing this. To ending in a debtor\u2019s prison, his family scattered to the poor sympathy of relatives. Ethan Iddesleigh hadn\u2019t had any understanding of that two years ago. He\u2019d recited moral platitudes as if words would feed and clothe a family or keep a decent roof above his children\u2019s heads and ensure his daughters married properly. That was why Ethan had been removed.</p><p>But that was behind him now. Or should be. \u201cI think Christian is of an age to judge a man\u2019s character.\u201d</p><p>Matilda opened her mouth and then closed it. She was a good wife and knew to defer to his conclusions, even if they did not match her own.</p><p>He smiled at his son. \u201cHow is Lord Iddesleigh faring?\u201d He helped himself to another piece of chicken from the dish a footman held. \u201cYou said he\u2019d been hurt when you left so suddenly for Kent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was beaten,\u201d Christian said. \u201cDamn near killed, though he doesn\u2019t like to say so, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d from Becca.</p><p>Christian frowned. \u201cAnd he knew his attackers, it seems. A strange business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he lost money at the gaming tables,\u201d Sarah said.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord.\u201d Matilda looked sharply at her youngest. \u201cWhat do you know of such matters, child?\u201d</p><p>Sarah shrugged. \u201cOnly what I hear, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Matilda frowned, the soft skin around the corners of her lips crimping. She opened her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he\u2019s better now,\u201d Christian hastily interjected. \u201cHe said, in fact, that he had business tonight.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert choked and took a sip of wine to cover. \u201cReally? I thought the recovery would take longer from your initial description.\u201d</p><p>At least a week, or so he\u2019d hoped. Where were James and Walker tonight? Could he warn them? Damn them anyway\u2014James for fouling up the initial attack on Iddesleigh and Walker for failing to even wing him with his pistol. He glanced at his wife, only to find her looking at him worriedly. Bless Matilda, she didn\u2019t miss a thing, but he could do without her shrewdness at the moment.</p><p>\u201cNo, Iddesleigh\u2019s fit enough,\u201d Christian said slowly. His eyes were puzzled as he watched his father. \u201cI don\u2019t envy whoever it is he\u2019s after.\u201d</p><p>Neither do I. Sir Rupert felt the signet ring in his waistcoat pocket, solid and heavy. Neither do I.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Patricia pronounced.</p><p>Lucy reached for another pink Turkish delight. The candies looked almost inedible, their color was so unnatural, but she was fond of them nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cMad, I tell you.\u201d Her friend\u2019s voice rose, upsetting the gray tiger cat curled on her lap. Puss jumped down and strutted off in a huff.</p><p>They were having tea while Patricia exclaimed over Lucy\u2019s failed romance. She might as well, too. Everyone but Papa was watching her sorrowfully these days. Even Hedge had taken to sighing as she went past.</p><p>The front sitting room of the little two-story cottage Patricia shared with her widowed mother was sunny this afternoon. Lucy knew for a fact that their finances had been in a dire state since the death of Mr. McCullough, but one would never know it from looking at the sitting room. Clever watercolor sketches lined the wall, painted by Patricia. And if there were brighter patches in the yellow-striped wallpaper, few people would remember that oil paintings had once hung there. Black and yellow cushions were piled on the two settees in a way that was careless and elegant at the same time. One wasn\u2019t apt to realize that the furniture beneath the cushions was perhaps a bit worn.</p><p>Patricia ignored her cat\u2019s defection. \u201cThe man has been courting you for three years. Five, if you count the time it took him to work up the nerve to actually speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lucy selected another candy.</p><p>\u201cEvery single Tuesday without fail. Did you know there are some in the village who set their clocks by the vicar\u2019s carriage passing by on the way to your house?\u201d Patricia scowled, pinching her lips into an adorable moue.</p><p>Lucy shook her head. Her mouth was full of sticky sugar.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. How will Mrs. Hardy tell the time now?\u201d</p><p>Lucy shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThree. Long. Years.\u201d A gold curl had worked itself loose from Patricia\u2019s bun and bounced with each word as if in emphasis. \u201cAnd Eustace finally, finally gets around to asking for your hand in holy matrimony and what do you do?\u201d</p><p>Lucy swallowed. \u201cI turn him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou turn him down,\u201d Patricia echoed as if Lucy hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cWhy? What could you have been thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that I couldn\u2019t stand fifty more years of listening to him talk about the church roof repairs.\u201d And that she couldn\u2019t stand the thought of living intimately with any man other than Simon.</p><p>Patricia recoiled as if Lucy had held up a live spider in front of her nose and suggested she eat it. \u201cChurch roof repairs? Haven\u2019t you been paying attention the last three years? He always prattles on about church roof repairs, church scandals\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church bell,\u201d Lucy cut in.</p><p>Her friend frowned. \u201cThe churchyard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tombstones in the churchyard,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThe church sexton and the church pews and the church teas,\u201d Patricia trumped her. She leaned forward, china-blue eyes widening. \u201cHe\u2019s the vicar. He\u2019s supposed to bore everyone stiff about the bloody church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite certain you shouldn\u2019t use that adjective in conjunction with the church, and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all this time?\u201d Patricia looked like an outraged titmouse. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do what I do and think about hats or shoes while he talks? He\u2019s quite happy as long as you interject a \u2018yes, indeed\u2019 every now and again.\u201d</p><p>Lucy picked up yet another Turkish delight and bisected it with her teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you marry Eustace, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly.\u201d Patricia folded her arms and looked away. \u201cI need to marry for money, and he\u2019s as poor as a . . . well, a church mouse.\u201d</p><p>Lucy paused with the remaining half of the confection hovering before her mouth. She\u2019d never considered Eustace and Patricia before. Surely Patricia didn\u2019t actually have a tendre for the vicar? \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not discussing me,\u201d her friend said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing your appalling marriage prospects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Patricia rolled right over her. \u201cYou\u2019ve already wasted your best years on him. You were, what? Five and twenty last birthday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour and twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing.\u201d The other woman waved away a full year with a dimpled hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t start over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Patricia raised her voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll just have to tell him you\u2019ve made a terrible mistake. The only other marriageable male in Maiden Hill is Thomas Jones, and I\u2019m almost certain he lets his pigs in the cottage at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making that up,\u201d Lucy said rather indistinctly because she was chewing. She swallowed. \u201cAnd who, exactly, are you planning to wed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Benning.\u201d</p><p>It was a good thing she\u2019d swallowed the sweet already, because she would\u2019ve choked on it now. Lucy gave a most unladylike shout of laughter before she looked at her friend and realized she was serious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s mad,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHe\u2019s easily old enough to be your father. He\u2019s buried three wives. Mr. Benning has grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He also has . . .\u201d Patricia ticked off her fingers as she spoke. \u201cA fine manor, two carriages, six horses, two upstairs maids and three downstairs ones, and ninety arable acres, most of it tenanted.\u201d She lowered her hands and poured herself more tea in the silence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy gaped at her.</p><p>Patricia sat back on the settee and raised her brows as if they were discussing bonnet styles. \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly frighten me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Patricia looked pleased.</p> <p>\u201cReally.\u201d Lucy reached for another sweet.</p><p>The other woman slapped her hand away. \u201cYou won\u2019t fit in your wedding dress if you keep gobbling those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Patricia.\u201d Lucy sank into the pretty cushions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be married, to Eustace or anyone else. I\u2019m going to become an eccentric spinster and look after all the children you and Mr. Benning will have in his wonderful manor with the three downstairs maids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd two up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd two up,\u201d she agreed. She might as well start wearing a spinster\u2019s mobcap at once.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s that viscount, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Patricia took one of the forbidden Turkish delights and nibbled absently. \u201cI knew he was trouble the moment I saw him eyeing you like Puss does the birds at the window. He\u2019s a predator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA snake,\u201d Lucy said softly, remembering how Simon would smile with just his eyes over his glass at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a serpent, if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever are you gibbering about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Iddesleigh.\u201d Lucy took another candy. She wasn\u2019t getting married anyway, so it didn\u2019t matter if she couldn\u2019t fit into any of her dresses. \u201cHe reminded me of a great silver snake. Sort of shiny and rather dangerous. I think it\u2019s his eyes. Even Papa saw it, although he took it in a less flattering way. For Lord Iddesleigh, that is.\u201d She nodded and ate the sticky confection.</p> <p>Patricia eyed her. \u201cInteresting. Undoubtedly bizarre, but still interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d Lucy cocked her head. \u201cAnd you needn\u2019t tell me he\u2019s not coming back, because I already had that discussion with Eustace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d Patricia closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. Eustace brought him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you change the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Eustace deserved to know.\u201d Lucy sighed. \u201cHe deserves someone who can love him, and I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She felt slightly queasy. Maybe that last piece of candy hadn\u2019t been a good idea. Or maybe the realization that she would spend the remaining years of her life never seeing Simon again had finally caught up with her.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Patricia set her teacup down and brushed an invisible crumb from her skirt. \u201cEustace may deserve love, but so do you, my dear. So do you.\u201d</p> <p>SIMON STOOD ON THE STEPS to hell and scanned the crowd of revelers.</p><p>The Devil\u2019s Playground was London\u2019s newest fashionable gaming palace, which was open only for a fortnight. The chandeliers glittered, the paint on the Doric columns was barely dry, and the marble floor still held its polish. In another year, the chandeliers would be blackened with smoke and dust, the columns would show the smears of a thousand greasy shoulders, and the floor would be dull with accumulated grit. But tonight, tonight, the girls were gay and beautiful, and the gentlemen surging around the tables had nearly identical expressions of excitement. Every now and again a whoop of triumph or an overloud, near maniacal laugh rose above the general rumble of dozens of voices speaking at once. The air was a thick miasma of sweat, burning candle wax, spoiled perfume, and the odor men secrete when they\u2019re on the verge of either winning a fortune or putting a pistol to their head before the night is over.</p><p>It had just gone eleven o\u2019clock, and somewhere in this mass of humanity hid his prey. Simon sauntered down the steps into the main room. A passing footman offered a tray of watered-down wine. The libations were free. The more a man drank, the more apt he was to gamble and to stay gambling once started. Simon shook his head, and the footman turned away.</p><p>In the far right-hand corner, a golden-haired gentleman leaned over the table, his back to the room. Simon craned to look, but yellow silk obscured his view. A soft, feminine form bumped against his elbow.</p><p>\u201cPardon moi.\u201d The demimondaine\u2019s French accent was quite good. It almost sounded real.</p><p>He glanced down.</p><p>She had plump rosy cheeks, dewy skin, and blue eyes that promised things she shouldn\u2019t have any knowledge of. She wore a green feather in her hair and smiled artfully. \u201cI shall fetch some champagne in apology, yes?\u201d She couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen, and she looked like she belonged on a farm in Yorkshire, milking the cows.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Her expression revealed her disappointment, but then she\u2019d been trained to show what men wanted. He moved away before she could reply and glanced back at the corner. The golden-haired man was no longer there.</p><p>He felt weary.</p><p>This was irony: only just past eleven o\u2019clock and he wished he was in his bed, asleep and alone. When had he become an old man with a shoulder that ached if he stayed up too late? Ten years ago he would\u2019ve barely begun the night. He would\u2019ve taken the little harlot up on her offer and not even noticed her age. He would\u2019ve gambled half his allowance away and not flinched. Of course, ten years ago he\u2019d been twenty, finally set up in his own establishment, and a hell of a lot closer in age to the harlot than he was now. Ten years ago he hadn\u2019t the sense to be afraid. Ten years ago he hadn\u2019t felt fear or loneliness. Ten years ago he\u2019d been immortal.</p><p>A gilt head to the left. It turned and he saw a wizened old face wearing a wig. Simon pushed through the crowd slowly, making his way to the back room. That was where the truly reckless gamblers congregated.</p><p>De Raaf and Pye seemed to think he had no fear, that he still thought and acted like that stripling lad ten years ago. But it was just the opposite, really. The fear was more intense with each duel, the knowledge that he could\u2014probably would\u2014die more real. And in a way, the fear drove him forward. What kind of a man would he be if he gave in to it and let his brother\u2019s murderers live? No, every time he felt fear\u2019s icy fingers trailing up his spine, every time he heard her siren call to just give up, let it be, he strengthened his resolve.</p><p>There.</p><p>Golden Hair ducked through black-velvet-lined doors. The man wore purple satin. Simon set his course, sure of the scent now.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d find you here,\u201d Christian said from beside him.</p><p>He whipped around, his heart nearly stuttering out of his chest. Ghastly to be caught so flat-footed. The younger man could have slipped a stiletto between his ribs and he would never have known before he died. Another problem of age\u2014the reflexes slowed. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The other man blinked red-tipped eyelashes.</p><p>Simon took a breath to control his voice. There was no point in taking out his temper on Christian. \u201cHow did you know I\u2019d be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, I called \u2019round your place, asked Henry, and voila.\u201d Christian spread his arms like a jester performing a trick.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Simon knew he sounded irritated. It was becoming a habit with Christian to show up unexpectedly, rather like a case of the clap. He took a deep breath. Actually, now that he thought about it, he realized it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to have the younger man as company. Made one feel less alone at least. And it was rather soothing to be idolized.</p><p>\u201cDid you notice that gel?\u201d Christian asked. \u201cThe one with the green feather?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe for you.\u201d</p><p>Simon glared. \u201cAre you coming with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course, \u2019course, old man.\u201d Christian smiled weakly, probably rethinking the advisability of tracking down Simon in the first place.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d Simon started for the black velvet doors.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Christian muttered behind him. \u201cWhere\u2019re we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the doors now, and Simon slowed to adjust his eyes to the dim room. There were only three tables here. Each table had four players seated at it. No one looked around at the newcomers. Golden Hair sat at the farthest table with his back to the door.</p><p>Simon halted and took a breath. It felt like his lungs couldn\u2019t expand enough in his chest to let in the air. Clammy sweat broke out on his back and under his arms. He suddenly thought of Lucy, her white breasts and her serious amber eyes. What a fool he\u2019d been to leave her.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve at least kissed her,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Christian\u2019s ears were good. \u201cThe green feather girl? Thought she was too young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot her. Never mind.\u201d Simon watched Golden Hair. He couldn\u2019t tell from this angle\u2014</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019re you looking for?\u201d Christian at least had the sense to whisper the question.</p><p>\u201cQuincy James,\u201d Simon murmured, and strolled forward.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo call him out.\u201d</p><p>He could feel Christian\u2019s stare. \u201cWhat for? What\u2019d he do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Simon turned his head to meet his companion\u2019s clear gaze.</p><p>The hazel eyes looked honestly puzzled. Simon sometimes wondered nonetheless. Christian had met him at a crucial point in Simon\u2019s life. The younger man had made himself quite friendly in a short period of time, and he didn\u2019t seem to have anything better to do than to tail Simon about. But perhaps Simon was being overly fearful, seeing enemies in every shadowy corner.</p><p>They reached the far table, and Simon stood behind the golden-haired man. Fear was embracing him now, sucking at his mouth with her frosty lips, rubbing her cold breasts against his chest. If he survived tomorrow\u2019s dawn, he was going back for Lucy. What use to play the gallant knight if one died at sunrise without ever tasting the maiden\u2019s lips? He now knew he couldn\u2019t do this alone anymore. He needed her on some basic level to reaffirm and maintain his humanity even as he summoned up the most bestial part of himself. He needed Lucy to keep him sane.</p><p>Simon pasted a smile on his face and tapped the man on the shoulder. Beside him, Christian drew in his breath sharply.</p><p>The man looked around. Simon stared for a second, stupidly, before his brain registered what his eyes had already told him. Then he turned away.</p><p>The man was a stranger.</p><p>LUCY TILTED HER HEAD TO THE SIDE and considered the cartoon she\u2019d begun to draw in her sketchbook. His nose was just a bit off. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d She didn\u2019t need to look up to sense that Hedge, her subject, was trying to sneak away again.</p><p>Hedge hated sitting for her. \u201cAwww. I gots things to do, Miss Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d There, that was better. Hedge really had the most extraordinary nose.</p><p>They were in the little back sitting room. The light was best here during the afternoon, shining in unobstructed through the tall mullioned windows. Hedge perched on a stool in front of the fireplace. He was attired in his usual rumpled coat and breeches with the addition of an oddly spotted purple neckcloth. Lucy couldn\u2019t imagine where he\u2019d gotten it. Papa would have died before wearing such a thing.</p><p>\u201cI gotta feed and groom old Kate,\u201d the manservant groaned.</p><p>\u201cPapa did that this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I should muck out her stall.\u201d</p><p>Lucy shook her head. \u201cMrs. Brodie paid one of the Jones boys to clean Katie\u2019s stall only yesterday. She got tired of waiting for you to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that cheek!\u201d Hedge looked as indignant as if he hadn\u2019t neglected the horse for days. \u201cShe knew I was plannin\u2019 to do it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lucy shaded in his hair carefully. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019ve said the last week. Mrs. Brodie says she could smell the stable from the back door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only \u2019cause she\u2019s got such a great hooter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPeople in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201d She switched pencils.</p><p>Hedge wrinkled his brow. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean, glass houses? I\u2019m talking about her nose.\u201d</p><p>Lucy sighed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p> <p>There was blessed silence for a moment while Hedge regrouped. She started sketching in his right arm. The house was quiet today with Papa gone and Mrs. Brodie busy in the kitchen baking bread. Of course, it always seemed quiet now that Simon had left. The house was almost lifeless. He\u2019d brought excitement and a type of companionship she hadn\u2019t known she was missing until he went away. Now the rooms echoed when she walked into them. She caught herself restlessly wandering from room to room as if she unconsciously searched for something.</p><p>Or someone.</p><p>\u201cHow about that letter to Master David, then?\u201d Hedge interrupted her thoughts. \u201cThe captain asked me to post it.\u201d He rose.</p><p>\u201cSit back down. Papa posted it on the way to Doctor Fremont\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww.\u201d</p> <p>Someone banged on the front door.</p><p>Hedge started.</p><p>Lucy glanced up from the sketch to pin him with her stare before he could make a move. The manservant slumped. Lucy finished the right arm and started on the left. They could hear Mrs. Brodie\u2019s quick footsteps. A murmur of voices, then the footsteps neared. Bother. She was nearly finished with the sketch, too.</p><p>The housekeeper opened the door looking flustered. \u201cOh, miss, you\u2019ll never guess who\u2019s come\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon walked around Mrs. Brodie.</p><p>Lucy dropped her pencil.</p> <p>He picked it up and held it out to her, his ice eyes hesitant. \u201cMay I talk to you?\u201d</p><p>He was hatless, his coat wrinkled, and his boots muddy as if he\u2019d ridden. He\u2019d left off his wig, and his hair was a trifle longer. There were dark circles under his eyes, and the lines bracketing his mouth were deeper. What had he been doing in London this past week to make him look so tired again?</p><p>She took the pencil, hoping he wouldn\u2019t notice how her hand trembled. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>Hedge jumped up. \u201cRight, then, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d He darted out the door.</p><p>Mrs. Brodie looked at Lucy questioningly before following the manservant. She shut the door behind her. Suddenly Lucy was alone with the viscount. She folded her hands in her lap and watched him.</p><p>Simon paced to the window and gazed out as if he didn\u2019t see the garden at all. \u201cI had . . . business to do this last week in London. Something important. Something that\u2019s been preying on my mind for some time now. But I couldn\u2019t concentrate, couldn\u2019t focus on what needed to be done. I kept thinking of you. So I came here, despite vowing I wouldn\u2019t bother you again.\u201d He threw a look at her over his shoulder, part frustration, part puzzlement, part something she didn\u2019t dare interpret. But it made her heart\u2014already laboring from his entrance\u2014stutter.</p><p>She took a breath to steady her voice. \u201cWould you care to sit?\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated as if considering. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He sat across from her, ran his hand over his head, and abruptly stood up again.</p><p>\u201cI should leave, just walk out that door and continue walking until I\u2019ve put a hundred miles between us, maybe an entire watery ocean. Although I don\u2019t know if even that would be enough. I promised myself that I would leave you in peace.\u201d He laughed without humor. \u201cAnd yet, here I am back at your feet, making an ass of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you,\u201d she whispered. This was like a dream. She\u2019d never thought to see him again, and now he was pacing agitatedly in front of her in her own little sitting room. She didn\u2019t dare let herself wonder why he had come.</p><p>He swung around and suddenly stilled. \u201cAre you? Truly?\u201d</p><p>What was he asking? She didn\u2019t know, but she nodded anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not right for you. You\u2019re too pure; you see too much. I\u2019ll hurt you eventually, if I don\u2019t . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou need to be with someone simple and good, and I am neither. Why haven\u2019t you married that vicar?\u201d He was frowning at her, and his statement sounded like an accusation.</p><p>Lucy shook her head helplessly.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t speak, won\u2019t tell me,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cAre you taunting me? You taunt me in my dreams sometimes, sweet angel, when I\u2019m not dreaming of . . .\u201d He sank to his knees before her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me, don\u2019t know what I am. Save yourself. Throw me from your house. Now. While you still can, because I\u2019ve lost my determination, my will, my very honor\u2014what little of it I had left. I cannot remove myself from your presence.\u201d</p><p>He was warning her, she knew it, but she couldn\u2019t tell him to go. \u201cI won\u2019t turn you away. You can\u2019t ask that of me.\u201d</p><p>His hands were at either side of her on the settee. They bracketed her but did not touch her. He bowed his head until all she could see was his crown of shorn pale hair. \u201cI\u2019m a viscount; you know that. The Iddesleighs go back a fair ways, but we only managed to pocket a title five generations ago. I\u2019m afraid we have a tendency to pick the wrong side in royal wars. I have three homes. A town house in London, one in Bath, and the estate in Northumberland, the one I told you about when I woke that first day. I said it was a wilderness, and it is, but it\u2019s also quite beautiful in a savage way, and of course the land\u2019s profitable, but we needn\u2019t ever go there, if you don\u2019t wish. I have a steward and plenty of servants.\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s eyes were blurred with tears. She muffled a sob. He sounded as if he were . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd there are some mines, copper or tin,\u201d he continued, staring at her lap. Was he afraid to look her in the eye? \u201cI can never remember which, and it doesn\u2019t really matter because I have a man of business, but they pay quite well. There are three carriages, but one was my grandfather\u2019s and is getting rather moldy. I can have a new one made, if you want one of\u2014\u201d</p><p>She caught his chin with her shaking hands and tilted his face up so she could see his pale gray eyes, looking so worried, so alone. She placed a thumb over his lips to still the river of words and tried to smile through the tears coursing down her cheeks. \u201cHush. Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>She could feel the beat of his pulse against her fingers, warm and alive, and it seemed to echo the wild fluttering of her own heart. She\u2019d never felt joy such as this, and she had the sudden fierce thought, Make it last, please, Lord. Don\u2019t ever let me forget this moment.</p><p>But he searched her eyes, neither triumphant nor happy, only waiting. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d His lips caressed her thumb with the words.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes as if terribly relieved. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down and kissed him softly on the cheek. But when she would\u2019ve pulled back, he moved his head. His mouth connected with hers.</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>Brushing across her lips, teasing her, tempting her, until she finally opened to him. He groaned and licked the inside of her lower lip. She brought her tongue forward at the same time and tangled with his. She didn\u2019t know if she was doing it right. She\u2019d never been kissed like this before, but her heart beat loudly in her ears, and she couldn\u2019t control the trembling of her limbs. He grasped her head between his hands and held it, angling his face across hers to deepen the embrace. This wasn\u2019t like Eustace\u2019s gentlemanly kiss. This was darker\u2014hungry and almost frightening. She felt as if she were on the verge of falling. Or of breaking apart into so many pieces she\u2019d never be able to put them back together again. He took her lower lip between his teeth and worried it. What should\u2019ve been pain, or at least discomfort, was pleasure that went to her very center. She moaned and surged forward.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>Lucy jerked back. Simon looked over her shoulder, his face taut, a sheen of moisture on his brow.</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d Mrs. Brodie exclaimed. A tray of demolished china, oozing cake, and puddling tea lay at her feet. \u201cWhatever will the captain say?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a good question, Lucy thought.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to pry, Miss Craddock-Hayes,\u201d Rosalind Iddesleigh said nearly three weeks later. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been wondering how you met my brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>Lucy wrinkled her nose. \u201cPlease, call me Lucy.\u201d</p><p>The other woman smiled almost shyly. \u201cHow kind. And you, of course, must call me Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled back and tried to think whether Simon would mind if she told this delicate woman that she\u2019d found him nude and half dead in a ditch. They were in Rosalind\u2019s elegant carriage, and it turned out that Simon did indeed have a niece. Theodora rode in the carriage as well, which was rumbling through the streets of London.</p><p>Simon\u2019s sister-in-law, the widow of his elder brother, Ethan, looked like she should be gazing from a stone tower, waiting for a brave knight to come rescue her. She had gleaming, straight blond hair, pulled into a simple knot at the crown of her head. Her face was narrow and alabaster white with wide, pale blue eyes. If the evidence wasn\u2019t sitting right next to her, Lucy would never have believed she was old enough to have an eight-year-old child.</p><p>Lucy had been staying with her future sister-in-law for the last sennight in preparation for her wedding to Simon. Papa had not been pleased by her match, but after grumbling and shouting for a bit, he\u2019d reluctantly given his blessing. During Lucy\u2019s time in London, she had visited a bewildering variety of shops with Rosalind. Simon was insistent that Lucy get a completely new trousseau. While she was naturally pleased to have so many fine clothes, at the same time it gave Lucy a niggling worry that she would not make a proper viscountess for Simon. She came from the country, and even dressed in lace and embroidered silks, she was still a simple woman.</p><p>\u201cSimon and I met on the lane outside my home in Kent,\u201d Lucy hedged now. \u201cHe\u2019d had an accident, and I brought him home to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic,\u201d Rosalind murmured.</p><p>\u201cWas Uncle Sigh in his cups?\u201d the little girl beside her wanted to know. Her hair was darker than her mother\u2019s, more of a gold, and curly. Lucy remembered Simon\u2019s description of his brother\u2019s curly locks. Theodora obviously took after her dead father in that respect, although her eyes were her mother\u2019s wide blue.</p><p>\u201cTheodora, please.\u201d Rosalind drew her brows together, creasing two perfect lines into her otherwise smooth forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed the use of proper language before. What will Miss Craddock-Hayes think of you?\u201d</p><p>The child slumped in her seat. \u201cShe said we could call her Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. She gave me permission to use her Christian name. It wouldn\u2019t be proper for a child to do so.\u201d Rosalind darted a glance at Lucy. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps since I\u2019ll soon be Theodora\u2019s aunt, she might call me Aunt Lucy?\u201d She smiled at the girl, not wanting to offend her future sister-in-law but feeling sympathy for the daughter as well.</p><p>Rosalind bit the corner of her lip. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Theodora gave a small wiggle in her seat. \u201cAnd you can call me Pocket, because that\u2019s what my uncle Sigh calls me. I call him Uncle Sigh because all the ladies sigh over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheodora!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Nanny says,\u201d the little girl defended herself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to keep servants from gossiping,\u201d Rosalind said. \u201cAnd children from repeating it.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cAnd why does your uncle Sigh call you Pocket? Because you can fit in one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grinned and suddenly resembled her uncle. She glanced at her mother. \u201cAnd because I look in his pockets when he comes to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spoils her terribly,\u201d Rosalind sighed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSometimes he has sweets in his pocket, and he lets me have them,\u201d the child confided. \u201cAnd once he had some lovely tin soldiers, and Mama said that little girls don\u2019t play with soldiers, and Uncle Sigh said then it was a good thing I\u2019m a pocket and not a girl.\u201d She took a breath and glanced at her mother again. \u201cBut he was teasing because he knows I\u2019m really a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Lucy smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s probably things like that that make the ladies sigh over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pocket squirmed again. Her mother laid a hand on her thigh and she stilled. \u201cDid you sigh over Uncle Sigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheodora!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, Mama?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Lucy interjected.</p><p>The carriage had stopped in the middle of a bustling lane, unable to reach the side of the street because of the crush of carriages, dray carts, hawkers, men on horses, and pedestrians. The first time Lucy had witnessed a scene such as this, her breath had been quite taken away. So many people! All of them shouting, running, living. The cart drayers shouting abuses at pedestrians in their path, the hawkers crying their wares, liveried footmen clearing the way for fine carriages, urchins scampering nearly under the hoofs of the horses. She\u2019d not known how to take it all in; her senses were overwhelmed. Now, nearly a week later, she\u2019d become a trifle more used to the city, but even so, she found the constant bustle invigorating to her ears and eyes every time. Perhaps she always would. Could a person ever find London boring?</p><p>One of the footmen opened the door and folded down the step before assisting the ladies to alight. Lucy held her skirts well off the ground as they made their way to the shop. A strong young footman walked ahead, both protection and future parcel-bearer. The carriage pulled away behind them. The coachman would have to find a place to stop farther on or circle back.</p><p>\u201cThis is quite a nice millinery shop,\u201d Rosalind said as they entered the establishment. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like the trimmings they have here.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy blinked and looked at the floor-to-ceiling shelves of multicolored lace, braid, hats, and trim. She tried not to appear as overwhelmed as she felt. This was a far cry from the single shop in Maiden Hill that had but one shelf of trimmings. After she\u2019d lived for years with a few gray gowns, the variety of color almost made her eyes hurt.</p><p>\u201cCan I have this, Mama?\u201d Pocket held up a length of gilt braid and started to wrap it around herself.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear, although perhaps it would be right for Aunt Lucy?\u201d</p><p>Lucy bit her lip. She couldn\u2019t really see herself in gilt. \u201cMaybe that lace.\u201d She pointed.</p><p>Rosalind\u2019s eyes narrowed at the pretty Belgian lace. \u201cYes, I think so. It will go nicely on that rose print sack gown we ordered this morning.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Lucy walked out of the shop, glad that she had Rosalind as a guide. The other woman might look delicate, but she knew her fashions and she bargained like a seasoned housekeeper. They found the carriage waiting in the road, an angry cart driver shouting at the coachman because he couldn\u2019t get past. The ladies hurried into the carriage.</p> <p>\u201cMy.\u201d Rosalind patted her face with a lace handkerchief. She looked at her daughter, lying on the seat in childish exhaustion. \u201cPerhaps we should go back to the house for some tea and refreshments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Pocket said in heartfelt agreement. She curled up on the seat and was soon asleep, despite the jolting of the carriage and the noise from without. Lucy smiled. The little girl must be used to the city and its ways.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t what I expected when Simon said he was to be married,\u201d Rosalind said softly.</p><p>Lucy raised her brows in question.</p><p>Rosalind bit her bottom lip. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to insult you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Simon has always kept company with a certain type of lady.\u201d Rosalind wrinkled her nose. \u201cNot always respectable but usually very sophisticated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m from the country,\u201d Lucy said ruefully.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rosalind smiled. \u201cI was surprised, but nicely, at his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The carriage stopped. There appeared to be some sort of jam in the road. Angry male shouts rose outside.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think it would be easier to walk,\u201d Rosalind murmured.</p><p>\u201cCertainly faster.\u201d Lucy smiled at her.</p><p>They sat, listening to the commotion. Pocket snored softly, unperturbed.</p><p>\u201cActually . . .\u201d The other woman hesitated. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but when I first met them\u2014Ethan and Simon\u2014it was Simon I was attracted to at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lucy kept her features neutral. What was Rosalind trying to tell her?</p><p>\u201cYes. He had that darkness about him, even before Ethan\u2019s death, that I think most women find rather fascinating. And the way he talks, his wit. It can be quite captivating at times. I was enthralled, although Ethan was the more handsome brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Had Simon been equally enthralled by this delicate woman? Lucy felt a stab of jealousy.</p><p>Rosalind gazed out the window. \u201cHe scared me.\u201d</p><p>Lucy caught her breath. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night, at a ball, I came upon him in a back room. It was a study or a sitting room, rather small and simply decorated except for an ornate mirror on one wall. He was all alone and was standing there, just staring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt himself.\u201d Rosalind turned to her. \u201cIn the mirror. Just . . . watching his reflection. But he wasn\u2019t looking at his wig or his clothes like another man might. He was staring into his own eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s strange.\u201d</p><p>The other woman nodded. \u201cAnd I knew then. He wasn\u2019t happy. His darkness isn\u2019t an act; it\u2019s real. There is something that drives Simon, and I\u2019m not sure it will ever let him go. I certainly couldn\u2019t help him.\u201d</p><p>Uneasiness washed over Lucy. \u201cSo you married Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I\u2019ve never regretted it. He was a wonderful husband, gentle and kind.\u201d She looked at her sleeping daughter. \u201cAnd he gave me Theodora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me this?\u201d Lucy asked softly. Despite her calm words, she felt a surge of anger. Rosalind had no right to make her doubt her decision.</p><p>\u201cNot to frighten you,\u201d Rosalind assured her. \u201cI just felt that it would take a strong woman to marry Simon, and I admire that.\u201d</p><p>It was Lucy\u2019s turn to gaze out the window. The carriage had finally started again. They\u2019d soon be back at the town house where there\u2019d be an array of exotic foods for luncheon. She was famished, but Lucy\u2019s mind wandered back to Rosalind\u2019s last words: a strong woman. She had lived all her life in the same, provincial place where she\u2019d never been challenged. Rosalind had seen what Simon was and prudently turned aside. Was there hubris in her own urge to marry Simon? Was she any stronger than Rosalind?</p><p>\u201cSHALL I KNOCK, MA\u2019AM?\u201d the maid inquired.</p><p>Lucy stood with the maid on the front steps of Simon\u2019s town house. It rose five stories tall, the white stone gleaming in the afternoon sunshine. The town house was in the most fashionable part of London, and she was conscious that she must look a fool standing here dithering. But she hadn\u2019t seen Simon alone for ages now, and she felt a desperate need to be with him. To talk and to find out . . . She laughed nervously under her breath. Well, she guessed she needed to find out if he was the same man he\u2019d been back in Maiden Hill. And so she\u2019d borrowed Rosalind\u2019s carriage and come here after their luncheon.</p><p>She smoothed a hand down her new gown and nodded at the maid. \u201cYes, please. Go ahead and knock.\u201d</p><p>The maid lifted the heavy knocker and let it fall. Lucy watched the door expectantly. It wasn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t see Simon\u2014he made sure to dine at least once a day at Rosalind\u2019s town house\u2014but they never had a moment alone. If only\u2014</p><p>The door was pulled open, and a very tall butler looked down a beak of a nose at them. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Lucy cleared her throat. \u201cIs Lord Iddesleigh in?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shaggy eyebrow in an incredibly haughty way; he must practice nights in front of a mirror. \u201cThe viscount is not receiving visitors. If you will leave a card\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled and walked forward so that the man was forced to step back or let her run into his belly. \u201cI am Miss Lucinda Craddock-Hayes, and I am here to see my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>The butler blinked. He was obviously in a quandary. Here was his soon-to-be mistress demanding entry, but he probably had orders not to disturb Simon. He chose to bow to the devil in front of him. \u201cOf course, miss.\u201d</p><p>Lucy gave him a small, approving smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They entered a grand hall. Lucy took a moment to look around curiously. She\u2019d never been inside Simon\u2019s town house. The floor was black marble, polished to a mirror finish. The walls were also marble, alternating black and white in panels bordered in gilt curlicues and vines, and the ceiling . . . Lucy blew out a breath. The ceiling was all gold and white with painted clouds and cherubs that appeared to hold the crystal chandelier that dangled from the center. Tables and statues were set here and there, all of them in exotic marbles and woods, all decorated lavishly in gilt. A black marble Mercury stood nearby to Lucy\u2019s right. The wings on his heels, his helmet, and his eyes were all gold. Actually, grand didn\u2019t quite describe the hall. Ostentatious was the better word.</p><p>\u201cThe viscount is in his greenhouse, miss,\u201d the butler said.</p><p>\u201cThen I will see him there,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cIs there a place my maid might wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have a footman show her to the kitchens.\u201d He snapped his fingers at one of the footmen standing at attention in the hallway. The man bowed and led the maid away. The butler turned back to Lucy. \u201cIf you will come this way?\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded. He led her down the hallway toward the back of the house. The passage narrowed and they went down a short set of stairs; then they came to a large door. The butler started to open it, but Lucy stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go in alone, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>The butler bowed. \u201cAs you wish, miss.\u201d</p><p>Lucy tilted her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNewton, miss.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you, Newton.\u201d</p><p>He held the door open for her. \u201cIf you need anything more, miss, simply call me.\u201d And then he left.</p><p>Lucy peered into the enormous greenhouse. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t looking at it right now with her own eyes, she wouldn\u2019t have believed such a structure could exist, hidden in the middle of the city. Rows of benches disappeared into the darkened end of the greenhouse. Every available surface was crowded with green plants or pots of soil. Underneath her feet was a brick walkway that somehow felt warm. Condensation dewed the glass at her shoulders. The glass began at waist height and vaulted overhead. Above her, the London sky had already begun to darken.</p><p>Lucy took a few steps into the humid air. She didn\u2019t see anyone in here. \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>She listened but heard nothing. Then again, the greenhouse was awfully big. Perhaps he couldn\u2019t hear her. Surely he\u2019d want to keep the hot, moist air in. She pulled the heavy wood door closed behind her and went exploring. The aisle was narrow, and some of the foliage hung over it, forcing her to push through a verdant curtain. She could hear dripping as water condensed and ran off hundreds of leaves. The atmosphere was heavy and still, musty with the smell of moss and earth.</p><p>\u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Finally. His voice came from up ahead, but she couldn\u2019t see him for the obscuring jungle. She pushed aside a leaf larger than her head and suddenly came out into an open space, lit by dozens of candles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stopped.</p><p>The space was circular. The glass walls flew up into a miniature dome, like the ones she\u2019d seen in pictures of Russia. In the center, a marble fountain played softly, and around the outside were more benches with roses. Roses blooming in winter. Lucy laughed. Reds and pinks, creams, and pure whites, the roses\u2019 heavy scent filled the air, topping off the sense of wonder and delight. Simon had a fairyland in his house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found me.\u201d</p><p>She started and looked in the direction of his voice, and her heart fluttered at the sight. Simon stood at a bench in his shirtsleeves. He wore a long green apron over his waistcoat to protect it, and he\u2019d rolled his sleeves up, exposing his forearms, which were dusted with blond hair.</p> <p>Lucy smiled at the thought of Simon in working attire. This was an aspect of him that she\u2019d never seen before, and it intrigued her. Since they\u2019d come to London, he\u2019d always been so polished, so very much a man of the world. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind. Newton showed me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Where\u2019s Rosalind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came alone.\u201d</p><p>He stilled and darted a look at her that she found hard to interpret. \u201cAll alone?\u201d</p><p>So that was his worry. He\u2019d made it very plain when she first came to London that she was never to leave the house by herself. She\u2019d nearly forgotten the injunction in the intervening week, for nothing had happened as far as she could tell. Obviously, he still worried about his enemies. \u201cWell, except for the coachman and footmen and maid\u2014I borrowed Rosalind\u2019s carriage.\u201d She smiled easily at him.</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d His shoulders relaxed, and he started to take off his apron. \u201cIn that case, may I offer you some tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stop because of me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is, if I don\u2019t disturb you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always disturb me, sweet angel.\u201d He retied his apron and turned back to the workbench.</p><p>She saw that he was busy, but they were to be married in less than a week. A thought whispered at the back of her mind, the niggling fear that he\u2019d grown bored of her already, or worse, was having second thoughts. She walked to his side. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to tense, but his voice was normal. \u201cGrafting roses. Not a very exciting chore, I\u2019m afraid, but you\u2019re welcome to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d He stooped over the bench, not looking at her. He had a prickly stick in front of him, presumably part of a rose, and was carefully cutting the end into a point.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t been alone together in several days, and I thought it would be nice just to . . . talk.\u201d She found it hard to speak to him while he was half turned away.</p><p>His back was stiff, as if he were mentally pushing her away, but he made no move. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Lucy bit her lip. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t be calling so late, but Rosalind has me busy all day shopping and finding clothes and such. You wouldn\u2019t believe how crowded the streets were this afternoon. It took us an hour to drive home.\u201d Now she was babbling. Lucy sat on a nearby stool and took a breath. \u201cSimon, have you changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. He looked up, frowning. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She made a jerky gesture of frustration. \u201cYou seem so preoccupied all the time, and you haven\u2019t kissed me since you proposed. I wondered if perhaps you had time to think about it and changed your mind about marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He threw the knife down and leaned straight-armed on the bench, head bowed. \u201cNo, I\u2019m so sorry. I want to marry you, long to marry you, now more than ever, I assure you. I count the days until we are finally wed. I dream of holding you in my arms as my wedded wife and then must distract my mind or go mad waiting for the day. The problem is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problem?\u201d Lucy was relieved but honestly confused. \u201cTell me and we can work on it together.\u201d</p> <p>He blew out a sigh, shook his head, and turned his face to her. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. This problem is all of my own making; dealing with it must be my own cross to bear. Thank God it will disappear in a week when we\u2019re bound by the holy vows of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deliberately talking in riddles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo militant,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI can picture you with a fiery sword in one hand, smiting recalcitrant Hebrews and unbelieving Samaritans. They\u2019d cower before your stern frown and frightening eyebrows.\u201d He laughed under his breath. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m having trouble being around you without touching you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged. You can touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I can\u2019t.\u201d He straightened and picked up the paring knife again. \u201cIf I touch you, I\u2019m not certain I\u2019ll be able to stop.\u201d He bent and peered at the rose as he made another deliberate cut in the stem. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m fairly certain I won\u2019t stop. I\u2019d be intoxicated by your scent and the feel of your white, white skin.\u201d</p><p>Lucy felt warmth in her cheeks. She doubted very much if her skin was so white right now. But he\u2019d hardly touched her at all in Maiden Hill. Surely if he could restrain himself then, he could now. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took a breath and shook his head as if clearing it. \u201cI\u2019d have you on your back, your skirts tossed around your shoulders like a common cull before I could think, be in you before I could reflect, and once started, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t stop before we\u2019d both reached heaven itself. Maybe not even then.\u201d</p><p>Lucy opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Heaven itself . . .</p><p>He shut his eyes and groaned. \u201cJesus. I can\u2019t believe I said that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d She cleared her throat. His words had made her feel shaky and hot. \u201cWell. That\u2019s certainly flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d He glanced at her. He had spots of color high on his cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re taking your fianc\u00e9\u2019s lack of control over his animal nature so well.\u201d</p><p>Oh dear. \u201cMaybe I should go.\u201d She made to rise.</p><p>\u201cNo, stay with me, please. Just . . . just don\u2019t come near me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She sat back straight and folded her hands in her lap.</p><p>His mouth curled down at one corner. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged a smile before he hastily turned away again, but this time she knew the cause and was unperturbed. She watched him set aside the stem and pick up a pot that contained what looked like a small stump. The fountain laughed in the background, and the stars began to fill the sky above the dome.</p><p>\u201cYou never finished telling me about that fairy tale,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Serpent Prince. I won\u2019t be able to finish the illustrations if you don\u2019t tell me the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been making illustrations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember where I stopped.\u201d He frowned over the ugly stump. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d She settled her bottom more firmly on the stool. \u201cAngelica had stolen the Serpent Prince\u2019s skin and threatened to destroy it, but she relented and spared his life in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d He made a careful V-shaped cut in the top of the stump. \u201cThe Serpent Prince said to Angelica, \u2018Fair maid, since you hold my skin, you hold my very life in your hands. You have but to name it and I will grant you a wish.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t sound very bright. Why does he not simply ask for his skin back without telling her what power she has over him?\u201d</p><p>He shot a glance at her from under lowered brows. \u201cPerhaps he was enthralled by her beauty?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cNot unless he was extremely dim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour romantic soul overwhelms me. Now will you let me continue?\u201d</p><p>She clamped her mouth shut and nodded mutely.</p><p>\u201cGood. It occurred to Angelica that here was a very lucky thing. Perhaps she could meet the prince of the land at last. So she said to the Serpent Prince, \u2018There is a royal ball being held tonight. Can you take me to the ramparts of the castle so that I may see the prince and his entourage pass by?\u2019 Well, the Serpent Prince looked at her out of his gleaming silver eyes and said, \u2018I can do better than that, I assure you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, wait,\u201d Lucy interrupted. \u201cIsn\u2019t the Serpent Prince the hero of the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA snake-man?\u201d Simon inserted the pointed end of the stick into the notch he\u2019d made in the stump and began wrapping both with a narrow strip of cloth. \u201cWhatever gave you the idea that he would make a good hero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is all of silver, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he is also quite nude, and usually the hero of the story has something more to his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He frowned censoriously at her. \u201cDo you wish me to continue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said meekly.</p><p>\u201cVery well. The Serpent Prince waved one pale hand, and suddenly Angelica\u2019s drab brown rags had turned to a shimmering dress of copper. In her hair were copper and ruby jewels and on her feet, embroidered copper slippers. Angelica twirled in a circle, delighted at her transformation, and she exclaimed, \u2018Wait until Prince Rutherford sees me!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cRutherford?\u201d Lucy arched an eyebrow.</p><p>He stared at her sternly.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Rutherford, he of the curling golden hair. But the Serpent Prince did not reply, and only then did Angelica notice that he had sunk to his knees beside the brazier and that the blue-flamed fire within burned lower. For in giving the goat girl her wish, he had depleted his own power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly man.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and smiled at her and then seemed to notice the dark sky for the first time. \u201cGood Lord, is it as late as that? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? You need to return to Rosalind\u2019s town house at once.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. For a London sophisticate, her fianc\u00e9 had become lamentably stodgy lately. \u201cAll right.\u201d Lucy stood and dusted off her skirt. \u201cWhen will I see you next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come for breakfast.\u201d He sounded distracted.</p><p>Disappointment shot through her. \u201cNo, Rosalind says we must leave early to go to the glover\u2019s, and we\u2019ll be away for luncheon as well. She\u2019s made arrangements to introduce me to some of her friends.\u201d</p><p>Simon frowned. \u201cDo you ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t a mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have several horses. I\u2019ll come by Rosalind\u2019s town house before breakfast, and then we\u2019ll ride in the park. We\u2019ll be back in time for Rosalind to take you to the glover\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d She looked at him.</p><p>He stared back. \u201cGod, and I can\u2019t even kiss you. Go on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d Lucy smiled as she walked back up the aisle.</p><p>Behind her she could hear Simon cursing.</p><p>\u201cMAY I JOIN YOU?\u201d SIMON COCKED a brow at the cardplayers that night.</p><p>Quincy James, seated with his back to him, swung around and stared. A tic started under his right eye. He wore a deep red velvet coat and breeches, and his waistcoat was an eggshell white, embroidered in red to match the coat. Taken with his clubbed guinea-colored hair, he was a pretty sight. Simon felt his lips curve into a satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course.\u201d A gentleman in an old-fashioned, full-bottomed wig nodded.</p><p>He had the dissipated face of a gambler who\u2019d spent a lifetime at the tables. Simon hadn\u2019t been introduced to him, but he\u2019d seen him before. Lord Kyle. The other three men at the table were strangers. Two were in their middling years, nearly identical in white-powdered wigs and with faces flushed from drink. The last was only a youth, his cheeks still spotty. A pigeon in a den of foxes. His mother ought to have kept him safe at home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that wasn\u2019t Simon\u2019s problem.</p><p>He pulled out the empty chair next to James and sat. Poor bastard. There wasn\u2019t a thing James could do to stop him. Objecting to a gentleman joining an open game simply wasn\u2019t done. Simon had him. He allowed himself a moment of congratulation. After spending the better part of a week haunting the Devil\u2019s Playground, fending off the advances of infant demimondaines, drinking ghastly champagne, and boring himself stiff moving from gambling table to gambling table, James had finally appeared. He\u2019d begun to worry that the trail had gone cold; Simon had put off hunting while he tended to his marriage arrangements, but now he had James.</p><p>He felt an urge to hurry this along, have it over with so that he could get to his bed and maybe be able to greet Lucy for their ride in the morning with a semblance of wakefulness. But that wouldn\u2019t do. His cautious prey had finally ventured forth from hiding, and he must move slowly. Deliberately. It was crucial that all of the pieces be in place, that there was no possibility of escape, before he sprung his trap. Mustn\u2019t let the quarry slip through an overlooked hole in the net at this juncture.</p><p>Lord Kyle flipped cards at each player to see who would deal. The man to Simon\u2019s right caught the first jack and gathered the cards to deal. James snatched each card as it was dealt him, nervously tapping the table\u2019s edges. Simon waited until all five were dealt\u2014they played five-card loo\u2014before picking them up. He glanced down. His hand wasn\u2019t bad, but that didn\u2019t really matter. He anted and made the opening lead\u2014an eight of hearts. James dithered and then flung down a ten. The game went around the table, and the pigeon picked up the trick. The youth led again with a three of spades.</p> <p>A footman entered, holding a tray of drinks. They played in the secluded back room at the Devil\u2019s Playground. The room was dim, the walls and door quilted in black velvet to muffle the revels in the main parlor. The men who played here were serious, gambled high, and rarely spoke beyond the demands of the game. This wasn\u2019t a social occasion for these gentlemen. This was life or death by cards. Only the other night, Simon had watched a baron lose first all the money he\u2019d had on him, then his one unentailed estate, and then his daughters\u2019 dowries. The next morning the man was dead, shot by his own hand.</p><p>James grabbed a glass from the waiter\u2019s tray, drained it, and reached for another. He caught Simon\u2019s gaze. Simon smiled. James\u2019s eyes widened. He gulped from the second glass and set it by his elbow, glaring at him defiantly. The play went on. Simon looed and had to ante. James smirked. He played the Pam\u2014the jack of clubs, the high card in five-card loo\u2014and took another trick.</p><p>The candles guttered, and the footman returned to trim them.</p><p>Quincy James was winning now, the pile of coins to the side of his glass growing. He relaxed in his chair, and his blue eyes blinked sleepily. The youth was down to a couple of coppers and was looking desperate. He wouldn\u2019t last another round if he was lucky. If he wasn\u2019t, someone would stand him the next hand, and that way lay debtor\u2019s prison. Christian Fletcher slipped into the room. Simon didn\u2019t look up, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw Christian find a chair at the side of the room, too far away to see the cards. He felt something inside him relax at the sight of the younger man. Now he had an ally at his back.</p><p>James won a trick. His lips twisted in a triumphant sneer as he gathered the pot.</p> <p>Simon shot out his arm and caught the other man\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d James tried to twist away.</p><p>Simon slammed his arm to the table. A jack of clubs fell from the lace at James\u2019s wrist. The other players around the table froze.</p><p>\u201cThe Pam.\u201d Lord Kyle\u2019s voice sounded rusty from disuse. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing, James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not m-m-mine.\u201d</p><p>Simon leaned back in his chair and rubbed his right index finger lazily. \u201cIt fell from your cuff.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d James jumped up, his chair toppling behind him. He looked like he would strike Simon, but then thought better of it.</p><p>Simon raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou s-s-set me up, slipped me the bloody P-p-pam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been losing.\u201d Simon sighed. \u201cYou insult me, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Simon continued, unperturbed. \u201cI trust swords at dawn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Jesus, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet with your approval?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod!\u201d James clutched his own hair, the beautiful locks coming out of his ribbon. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right. I d-d-didn\u2019t have the bloody Pam.\u201d</p><p>Lord Kyle gathered the cards. \u201cAnother hand, gentlemen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d the boy whispered. He\u2019d gone pale and looked like he might cast up his accounts.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t d-d-do this!\u201d James screamed.</p><p>Simon got to his feet. \u201cTomorrow, then. Better get some sleep, what?\u201d</p><p>Lord Kyle nodded, his attention already on the next game. \u201cGood night, Iddesleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m done as well. If you\u2019ll excuse me, gentlemen?\u201d The pigeon nearly ran from the room.</p><p>\u201cNooo! I\u2019m innocent!\u201d James started sobbing.</p><p>Simon winced and walked from the room.</p><p>Christian caught up with him in the main parlor. \u201cDid you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Simon hissed. \u201cNot here, idiot.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the younger man kept quiet until they reached the street. Simon signaled to his coachman.</p><p>Christian whispered, \u201cDid you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d God, he was weary. \u201cDo you want a ride?\u201d</p><p>Christian blinked. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>They got in and the carriage pulled away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better find his seconds tonight and arrange the duel.\u201d Simon was overcome by a ghastly lethargy. His eyes were full of grit, and his hands were shaking. The morning wasn\u2019t that far away. He\u2019d either kill a man or die himself when it came.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>\u201cQuincy James\u2019s seconds. You need to find out who they are, arrange the meeting place and time. All that. The same as the last times.\u201d He yawned. \u201cYou are going to act as my second, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon closed his eyes. If he lost Christian, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t, I\u2019ve got four hours to find another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, yes,\u201d the young man blurted. \u201cI\u2019ll be your second. Of course I\u2019ll be your second, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence in the carriage, and Simon fell into a doze.</p><p>Christian\u2019s voice woke him. \u201cYou went there to find James, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother opening his eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a woman?\u201d His companion sounded genuinely puzzled. \u201cHas he caused you an insult?\u201d</p><p>Simon almost laughed. He\u2019d forgotten that there were men who dueled for such silly things. \u201cNothing so inconsequential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Christian\u2019s voice was urgent. \u201cWhy do it that way?\u201d</p><p>Jesus! He didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or weep. Had he ever in his life been this naive? He gathered his wits to try to explain the blackness that lived in men\u2019s souls.</p><p>\u201cBecause gambling\u2019s his weakness. Because he couldn\u2019t help himself once I\u2019d joined the game. Because he can\u2019t possibly turn me down or worm his way out. Because he\u2019s the man he is and I\u2019m the man I am.\u201d Simon finally looked at his terribly young friend and gentled his voice. \u201cIs that what you wanted to know?\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s brow was furrowed as if he was working out a difficult mathematical problem. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize . . . This is the first time I\u2019ve been with you when you challenged your opponent. It seems so unfair. Not at all honorable.\u201d Christian\u2019s eyes suddenly widened as if he\u2019d just realized the insult.</p><p>Simon started laughing and found he couldn\u2019t stop. Tears gathered in his eyes from the mirth. Oh God, what a world!</p><p>Finally, he gasped, \u201cWhatever gave you the idea I was honorable?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The predawn mist lay like gray winding sheets, writhing on the ground. It swirled about Simon\u2019s legs as he made his way to the agreed-upon dueling place, seeping through leather and linen to chill his very bones. In front of him, Henry held a lantern to light their way, but the mist veiled the light so they seemed to move in a disquieting dream. Christian walked beside him, strangely silent. He\u2019d spent the night contacting and conferring with James\u2019s seconds, and gotten little, if any, sleep. Up ahead, another light loomed, and the shapes of four men emerged in the dawn. Each had a nimbus of breath cowling his head.</p><p>\u201cLord Iddesleigh?\u201d one of the men hailed him. It wasn\u2019t James, so it must be a second.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His own breath billowed forth and then dissipated into the icy morning air.</p><p>The man walked toward them. He was of middling years and wore spectacles and a tatty wig. A coat and breeches, several years behind the fashion and obviously well worn, completed his dissolute appearance. Behind him, a shorter man hesitated beside another man who must be the doctor, as evidenced by the bobbed wig of his profession and the black bag he carried.</p><p>The first man spoke again. \u201cMr. James offers his sincere apology for any insult he may have inflicted upon you. Will you accept this apology and avoid a duel?\u201d</p><p>Coward. Had James sent his seconds and stayed away? \u201cNo, I will not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-d-d-damn you, Iddesleigh.\u201d</p><p>So he was here. \u201cGood morning, James.\u201d Simon smiled thinly.</p><p>The reply was another curse, no more original than the first.</p><p>Simon nodded to Christian. The younger man and James\u2019s seconds went to mark off the dueling space. Quincy James paced back and forth over the frost-killed earth, either to warm his limbs or from nervousness. He wore the same deep red coat he\u2019d had on the night before, wrinkled and stained now. His hair looked greasy, as if he\u2019d been sweating. As Simon watched, the other man dug his fingers through the locks, scratching. Filthy habit. Did he have lice? James must be tired from the late night, but then again, he was an inveterate gambler, used to staying up to all hours. And he was younger. Simon considered him. He\u2019d never seen James duel, but the word at Angelo\u2019s academy was that his opponent was an expert swordsman. He wasn\u2019t surprised. Despite James\u2019s tics and stutters, the man had the grace of an athlete. He was also the same height. Their reaches would be equal.</p><p>\u201cMay I see your sword?\u201d The spectacled man was back. He held out his hand.</p><p>The other second came over. This one was a shorter, younger man in a bottle-green coat who peered around constantly in a nervous manner. Dueling was, of course, against the law. But the law in this case was rarely enforced. Simon unsheathed his weapon and handed it over to Spectacles. Several paces away, Christian retrieved James\u2019s sword. He and James\u2019s seconds dutifully measured both blades and inspected them before handing them back.</p><p>\u201cOpen your shirt,\u201d Spectacles said.</p><p>Simon arched an eyebrow. The fellow was obviously a stickler for proper form. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m wearing armor under my shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Simon sighed and shrugged out of his silver-blue coat and waistcoat, pulled his neckcloth off, and unbuttoned the top half of his lace-edged shirt. Henry hurried over to catch the items as they fell.</p><p>James loosened his shirt for Christian. \u201cDamn, it\u2019s as cold as a Mayfair whore.\u201d</p><p>Simon pulled apart the edges of his shirt. Goose bumps chased over his bared chest.</p><p>The second nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d His face was wooden, a man without apparent humor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Simon smiled mockingly. \u201cCan we get on with it, then? I haven\u2019t broken my fast yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you w-w-won\u2019t either.\u201d James advanced, sword held ready.</p><p>Simon felt his smile disappear. \u201cBrave words for a murderer.\u201d</p><p>He sensed Christian\u2019s swift look. Did the boy know? He\u2019d never told him about Ethan\u2014about the real reason for these duels. Simon raised his blade and faced his opponent. The mist curled about their legs.</p><p>\u201cAllez!\u201d Christian cried.</p> <p>Simon lunged, James parried, and the swords sang their deadly song. Simon felt his face stretch into a mirthless grin. He stabbed into an opening, but James deflected the blow at the last minute. And then he was on the defensive, retreating even as he parried slash after slash. The muscles in his calves burned under the strain. James was swift and strong, an opponent to take seriously, but he was also desperate, attacking recklessly. The blood pounded in Simon\u2019s veins like liquid fire, making his nerves spark. He never felt so alive and paradoxically so close to death as when he dueled.</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><p>James darted under his guard, aiming a blow at Simon\u2019s chest. He deflected the sword at the last minute. His weapon slid, screeching, against his opponent\u2019s until they were hilt to hilt, breathing into each other\u2019s faces. James pressed against him with all his strength. Simon felt his upper arm bulge. He stood braced, refusing to give ground. He could see the red veins in the other man\u2019s eyes and smell his foul breath, reeking of terror.</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d one of the seconds called, and only then did he feel the burn at his arm.</p><p>\u201cDo you quit?\u201d Christian asked.</p> <p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Simon bunched his shoulders and threw James back, lunging after him. Something dark and animal within him howled, Now! Kill him now! He must be careful. If he only wounded his enemy, James would have the right to stop the duel, and then he\u2019d have to go through all this nonsense again.</p><p>\u201cThere is no need,\u201d one of the seconds was shouting. \u201cGentlemen, throw down your swords. Honor is appeased!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger honor!\u201d Simon attacked, slashing and stabbing, his right shoulder sending needles of pain down his arm.</p><p>The blades clanged as the men stamped across the green. He could feel warmth trickling down his back and had no idea whether it was sweat or blood. James\u2019s eyes widened. He was defending desperately, his face red and gleaming. His waistcoat was stained dark beneath the armpits. Simon feinted high.</p><p>And suddenly James turned, lunged, and slashed behind his legs. Simon felt the sting at the back of his knees. Horror streaked through him. If James succeeded in cutting the tendons at the back of his legs, he would be crippled, unable to stand and defend himself. But in lunging, James had exposed his chest. The other man drew back to slash at his legs again. Simon pivoted. Put the whole force of his arm behind the blow. And ran James through the chest. Simon felt the jar as his blade hit and grated against bone. His shoulder burned just above his armpit. He saw James\u2019s eyes widen in understanding of his own mortality, heard the scream of one of the witnesses, and smelled the acid stink of urine as the dead man lost control of his bladder.</p><p>His enemy sank to the ground.</p> <p>Simon bent for a second, gulping great lungfuls of air. Then he placed his foot on the corpse\u2019s chest and pulled his sword out. James\u2019s eyes were still open, staring at nothing now.</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d Christian drew a hand across his white mouth.</p><p>Simon wiped the blade of his sword. His hands shook slightly and he frowned, trying to control them. \u201cCould you close his eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God. My God. My God.\u201d The short man was nearly jumping up and down in his agitation. Suddenly, he leaned over and vomited, splattering his shoes.</p><p>\u201cCan you close his eyes?\u201d Simon asked again. He didn\u2019t know why it bothered him so. James no longer cared that he stared blindly.</p><p>The little man was still heaving, but Spectacles passed his hand over James\u2019s eyes.</p><p>The physician walked over and stared down impassively. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. You\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Simon shrugged on his coat.</p> <p>\u201cChrist,\u201d Christian whispered.</p><p>Simon motioned to Henry and turned to walk back. They no longer needed the lantern. The sun had risen, evaporating the mist and heralding a new day that Quincy James would never see. Simon\u2019s hands still shook.</p><p>\u201cHE\u2019S OUT? HOW CAN HE BE OUT at this hour?\u201d Lucy stared at Newton.</p><p>The sky had just lost the pinkness of dawn. Street sweepers were trundling their carts home across the cobblestones. At the house next door, a maid slammed the door and began vigorously scrubbing her employer\u2019s steps. Lucy had arrived at Simon\u2019s town house for their early morning ride in the park. She should\u2019ve waited for him at Rosalind\u2019s home, as they\u2019d originally planned. But last night over supper, Rosalind had announced that she would rise unfashionably early to accompany the new cook to the fish market this morning. Cook had served them slightly off fish two nights in a row, and Rosalind thought she needed pointers on selecting a fresh snapper. Lucy had leapt at the chance to ride along and see Simon a little early.</p><p>But now she stood on the front stoop like a poor petitioner before the king. The king, in this case, being Newton the butler. He was splendidly arrayed in silver and black livery and an exquisite wig, despite the hour. He stared back at her down a nose that would have done any ancient Roman proud.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say, miss.\u201d Two spots of red burned in the butler\u2019s otherwise cadaverous cheeks.</p><p>Lucy looked at them suspiciously. Her own face began to heat. Surely Simon wasn\u2019t with another woman? No, of course not. They were to be married in less than a week. But Lucy felt shaken nonetheless. She hardly knew Simon; maybe she had misunderstood. Perhaps when he said dawn it had been a fashionable figure of speech, really meaning ten o\u2019clock. Or maybe she\u2019d confused the day\u2014</p><p>A big black carriage rattled up, interrupting her thoughts. Lucy turned to look. The carriage bore Simon\u2019s crest. A footman jumped down and set the steps. Henry and Mr. Fletcher descended. Lucy frowned. Why . . . ? Simon stepped down. Behind her, Newton exclaimed. Simon was in his shirtsleeves, despite the cold. One sleeve was streaked with blood, and he held a soaked rag to the upper arm. Spatters of red arced delicately across his chest. In strange contrast to the gore, he wore an immaculate white wig.</p><p>Lucy gasped; her lungs wouldn\u2019t fill with air. How badly was he hurt? She stumbled down the steps. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><p>Simon stopped and stared at her, white-faced. He looked as if he didn\u2019t recognize her. \u201cMerde.\u201d</p><p>At least he could talk. \u201cNewton, send for a doctor!\u201d</p><p>Lucy didn\u2019t bother to see if the butler followed her orders. She was afraid if she took her eyes from Simon, he might collapse. She reached him on the street and held out a hand, hesitant to actually touch him lest she harm him further.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hurt? Tell me.\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>He took her hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need of a doctor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed James,\u201d Mr. Fletcher suddenly said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucy looked at the younger man.</p><p>He seemed dazed, as if he\u2019d seen a tragedy. What had happened?</p><p>\u201cNot out in the street for all the pious listening neighbors to gossip about, please,\u201d Simon said. His words dragged as if he were weary to his soul. \u201cWe\u2019ll hash it out, if we must hash it out, in the sitting room.\u201d The fingers clutching her wrist were sticky with blood. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour arm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill be fine as soon as I dose it with brandy\u2014by mouth, preferably.\u201d He marched her up the steps.</p><p>Behind them, Mr. Fletcher called, \u201cI\u2019m going home. Had enough. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Simon paused on the top step and glanced back. \u201cAh, the golden resilience of youth.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fletcher swung around violently. \u201cYou killed him! Why did you have to kill him?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Lucy stared, mute, at Simon\u2019s young friend. She felt dread seep into her chest, paralyzing her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a duel, Christian.\u201d Simon smiled, but his voice was still gritty. \u201cDid you think I meant to dance a pretty gavotte?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus! I don\u2019t understand you. I don\u2019t think I even know you.\u201d Mr. Fletcher shook his head and walked away.</p><p>Lucy wondered if she should echo the sentiment. Simon had just admitted killing a man. She realized\u2014horribly\u2014that the bloodstains on his chest weren\u2019t his own. Relief flooded her, and then guilt that she rejoiced at another\u2019s death. Simon led her through the door into the great receiving hall. The ceiling, three stories overhead, was painted with classical gods lounging about the clouds, unperturbed by the upheaval below. He dragged her down the hallway and through double doors into a sitting room.</p><p>Behind them, Newton groaned. \u201cNot the white settee, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo hell with the settee.\u201d Simon pulled Lucy down beside him on the immaculate piece of furniture. \u201cWhere\u2019s that brandy?\u201d</p><p>Newton splashed brandy into a crystal glass and brought it over, muttering, \u201cBlood. And it\u2019ll never come out.\u201d</p><p>Simon swallowed half the glass and grimaced, laying his head against the settee back. \u201cI\u2019ll have it re-covered, if that\u2019ll make you feel better, Newton. Now get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Henry entered the room, carrying a basin of water and linens.</p><p>\u201cBut, my lord, your arm\u2014\u201d the butler started.</p><p>\u201cGet. Out.\u201d Simon closed his eyes. \u201cYou, too, Henry. You can bandage, dose, and mother me later.\u201d</p><p>Henry raised his eyebrows at Lucy. Silently, he laid the basin and bandages beside her and left. Simon still held her wrist. She reached across him with her free hand and carefully pulled back the ripped sleeve. Beneath, a narrow wound seeped blood.</p><p>\u201cLeave it alone,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s only a shallow cut. It looks worse than it is, believe me. I won\u2019t bleed to death, at least not right away.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m not your butler. Or your valet, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, try to remember in the future that I hold an entirely different role in your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot we were to go riding this morning. Stupid of me. Is that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry. I came early with Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosalind? Where is she?\u201d His words were slurred as if he were so fatigued he could hardly speak.</p><p>\u201cAt the fish market. Hush. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t listen. \u201cI will never be able to forgive myself, but do you think you can?\u201d</p><p>Silly. Her eyes pricked with tears. How could he deflect her anger with such silly words? \u201cFor what? Never mind. I forgive you for whatever it is.\u201d She dipped a cloth in the water one-handed. \u201cThis would be easier if you let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wiped at the blood awkwardly. She really ought to cut the sleeve off altogether. She cleared her throat to steady her voice before she inquired, \u201cDid you really kill a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. In a duel.\u201d His eyes were still closed.</p><p>\u201cAnd he wounded you in return.\u201d She squeezed out the cloth. \u201cWhat did you duel over?\u201d She made sure her tone was even, as if she were asking the time.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She looked at the bandages. There was no way she\u2019d be able to tend to him, shackled as she was. \u201cI\u2019m going to need both arms to bandage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Lucy sighed. \u201cSimon, you\u2019ll have to let me go eventually. And I really think your arm should be cleaned and wrapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSevere angel.\u201d He finally opened his eyes, frost gray and intense. \u201cPromise me. Promise me on your mother\u2019s memory that you won\u2019t leave me if I give you back your wings.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blinked and thought about it, but in the end there was really no other answer. \u201cI promise you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer until she could see the shards of ice in his eyes. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise on my mother\u2019s memory,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat I won\u2019t leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know whether it was a curse or a prayer, but his mouth came down on hers hard. Biting, licking, sucking. It was as if he meant to consume and draw her into himself so that she might never abandon him. She moaned beneath the onslaught, confused and enthralled.</p><p>He angled his head, thrusting his tongue into her mouth. She clutched his shoulders, and then he was pushing her back on the settee, climbing on top of her and shoving her legs apart with his own hard thighs. He settled on her, and even through the multiple layers of her skirt she could feel his hard shaft. She arched against him. Her breath was coming in breathless pants; she couldn\u2019t seem to get enough air. He cupped her breast. His hand was so hot she could feel his heat through her bodice, branding her where no man had ever caressed her before.</p><p>\u201cAngel.\u201d He broke away to whisper against her cheek. \u201cI want to see you, to touch you.\u201d He trailed his open mouth over her cheek. \u201cLet me take down your dress. Let me see you. Please.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. His fingers molded her shape, stroking and massaging. She felt her nipple bud, and she wanted, needed, him to touch it. Naked, with nothing separating their flesh. \u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone opened the door.</p> <p>Simon reared up to glare over the back of the settee at whoever it was. \u201cGet out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord.\u201d Newton\u2019s voice.</p><p>Lucy wished she could dissolve this very instant and become a puddle on the settee.</p><p>\u201cGet out now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister-in-law is here, my lord. Lady Iddesleigh saw your carriage in front and was concerned as to why you and Miss Craddock-Hayes had not yet gone riding.\u201d</p><p>Or, she could simply die of mortification.</p> <p>Simon stilled, breathing heavily. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d the butler replied stonily. \u201cShall I put her in the blue sitting room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn your eyes, Newton! Put her anywhere but here.\u201d</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>Simon sighed and rested his forehead against her own. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything.\u201d He brushed his lips against hers. \u201cI\u2019d better leave before Rosalind gets an eyeful. Stay here; I\u2019ll send Henry with a shawl.\u201d He got up and strode out the door.</p><p>Lucy looked down at herself. There was a bloody handprint on the bodice of her dress.</p><p>\u201cOH.\u201d POCKET STOOD IN THE DOORWAY to the little sitting room on the third floor of Rosalind\u2019s house. She looked at Lucy and placed one foot on top of the other. \u201cYou\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy raised her head from where she\u2019d propped it on a fist and tried to smile. She\u2019d come to this room after luncheon to think about this morning\u2019s events. Rosalind had taken to bed, pleading a headache, and Lucy could not blame her. Rosalind had to have suspected something was wrong when Simon didn\u2019t greet her at his own home. He\u2019d hidden in his rooms so she wouldn\u2019t see his wound. Add to that Lucy\u2019s near silence on the drive back to Rosalind\u2019s town house and the poor woman probably thought they were about to break off the wedding. Altogether, it had been a trying morning.</p> <p>\u201cIs that all right?\u201d Lucy asked Pocket now.</p><p>The little girl frowned as if considering. \u201cI guess.\u201d Voices from farther down the hallway made her look over her shoulder before scooting into the room. She laid down the wooden box she carried and shut the door very carefully.</p><p>Lucy was instantly suspicious. \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be in the schoolroom?\u201d</p><p>The little girl was dressed in a cool blue gown, her hair in perfect ringlets, giving her an angelic appearance, belied by her calculating eyes. \u201cNanny\u2019s napping.\u201d She\u2019d obviously learned her uncle\u2019s trick of not actually answering the question.</p><p>Lucy sighed and watched Pocket carry the box to the tapestry rug, hitch up her skirts, and sit down cross-legged. This little back room had an air of abandonment, despite its recent dusting. It was too small to welcome callers, and, besides, it was on the third floor of Rosalind\u2019s town house. Above the bedrooms and below the nursery. Yet the one window overlooked the back garden and let the afternoon sun in. The armchairs, one brown and missing an arm, the other a balding rose velvet, were large and comfortable. And the faded rose, brown, and green rug was soothing. Lucy had thought it a perfect place to come and think and be alone.</p><p>Clearly, Pocket had, too.</p><p>The little girl opened her box. Inside were rows of painted tin soldiers\u2014Simon\u2019s forbidden gift. Some were standing, others knelt, their rifles at their shoulders, ready to fire. There were soldiers on horses and soldiers with cannons, soldiers with rucksacks, and soldiers holding bayonets. She\u2019d never seen such an array of tin soldiers. Obviously, this was a superior toy army.</p><p>Lucy picked up a little man. He stood at attention, his rifle by his side, a high military hat on his head. \u201cHow clever.\u201d</p><p>Pocket gave her a withering look. \u201cThat\u2019s a Frenchie. The enemy. He\u2019s blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lucy handed her back the soldier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve four and twenty,\u201d the little girl continued as she set up the enemy camp. \u201cI used to have five and twenty, but Pinkie got one and chewed off his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinkie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama\u2019s little dog. You haven\u2019t seen him because he lives in Mama\u2019s rooms mostly.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe smells. And he snuffles when he breathes. He\u2019s got a pushed-in nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care for Pinkie,\u201d Lucy guessed.</p><p>Pocket shook her head vehemently. \u201cSo now this one\u201d\u2014she held up a headless tin soldier with fearsome teeth marks all over the remaining body\u2014\u201cis a Casualty of Battle, Uncle Sigh says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>She laid the mutilated soldier on the carpet, and they both contemplated it. \u201cCannon fire,\u201d Pocket said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannon fire. The ball took his head clean off. Uncle Sigh says he probably didn\u2019t even see it coming.\u201d</p><p>Lucy raised her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cWant to be England?\u201d Pocket asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Pocket looked at her sorrowfully, and Lucy had the sinking feeling that her value might have fallen to the level of Pinkie, the soldier-devouring canine. \u201cWould you like to be England? I\u2019ll play France. Unless you want to be the Frogs?\u201d She asked the last as if Lucy might just be that dim-witted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll be England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You can sit there.\u201d Pocket pointed to a space on the rug opposite her, and Lucy realized she was supposed to sit on the floor for this game.</p><p>She hunkered down and set up her red tin men under the little girl\u2019s critical eye. It was actually rather soothing, and she needed a rest from her thoughts. All day she\u2019d debated whether she should marry Simon. The violent side he\u2019d revealed this morning had been frightening. Not because she thought he might hurt her\u2014she knew, somehow, he would never do that. No, what made her afraid was that her attraction to him remained undimmed, despite what she\u2019d seen. She\u2019d even rolled about with him on that settee while he was covered with the blood of a man he\u2019d killed. It hadn\u2019t mattered. It still didn\u2019t matter. If he walked in the room right now, she\u2019d succumb again. And perhaps that was the real problem. Perhaps she feared what he could do to her: make her throw away all the lessons of right and wrong she\u2019d grown up with, make her lose herself. Lucy shivered.</p><p>\u201cNot there.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour captain.\u201d The little girl pointed to a soldier in a fancy hat. \u201cHe should be at the front of his men. Uncle Sigh says a good captain always leads his men into battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Pocket nodded decisively and moved Lucy\u2019s man forward. \u201cLike that. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . .\u201d Ready for what? \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen, ready your cannon,\u201d the little girl growled. She rolled a tin cannon forward and laid her fist beside it. \u201cFire!\u201d She flicked her thumb, and a marble flew across the carpet and decimated Lucy\u2019s soldiers.</p><p>Pocket hooted.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s war,\u201d Pocket said. \u201cHere come the cavalry to flank your army!\u201d</p><p>And Lucy realized the English were about to lose the war. \u201cMy captain orders his men about!\u201d</p><p>Two minutes later the field of battle was a bloodbath. Not a single tin soldier still stood.</p><p>\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Lucy panted.</p><p>\u201cWe bury them. All brave men deserve proper funerals.\u201d Pocket lined up her dead soldiers.</p><p>Lucy wondered how much of this game was prescribed by Uncle Sigh.</p><p>\u201cWe say the Lord\u2019s Prayer and sing a hymn.\u201d The little girl tenderly patted her soldiers. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did at my papa\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked up. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Pocket nodded. \u201cWe said the Lord\u2019s Prayer and threw dirt on the coffin. But Papa wasn\u2019t really in there, so we don\u2019t have to worry about him drowning in the dirt. Uncle Sigh says he\u2019s in heaven and he watches me.\u201d</p><p>Lucy stilled, imagining Simon comforting this little girl at his brother\u2019s graveside, putting aside his own grief to explain in childish terms that her father wouldn\u2019t suffocate in the ground. What a tender act. And what was she to do with this new side to Simon? It would be so much easier if he was simply a man who killed, someone who was callous and uncaring. But he wasn\u2019t. He was a loving uncle, a man who tended roses all by himself in a glass cathedral. A man who acted like he needed her and made her promise never to leave him.</p><p>Never to leave him . . .</p><p>\u201cWant to play again?\u201d Pocket was looking at her, waiting patiently.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy gathered her soldiers and set them upright.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Pocket set to work on her own soldiers. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re to be my aunt. Uncle Sigh\u2019s the only other one who likes to play soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted a niece who played soldiers.\u201d She looked up at Pocket and smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be sure to invite you to come and play with me when I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded decisively. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d de Raaf asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon paced to the rail, pivoted, and strolled back again.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d Simon angled his head to search down the nave. Where the hell was she?</p><p>\u201cYou do seem nervous.\u201d Now Pye was looking at him queerly.</p><p>Simon deliberately stilled himself and took a deep breath. It was just past ten o\u2019clock on the morning of his wedding day. He stood in the designated sacred church, arrayed in formal wig, black brocade coat, silver-embroidered waistcoat, and red-heeled shoes. He was surrounded by friends and loving family\u2014well, his sister-in-law and niece anyway. Pocket bounced in the front pew while Rosalind tried to shush her. Christian looked distracted in the row behind. Simon frowned. He hadn\u2019t talked to Christian since the duel; there hadn\u2019t been time. He\u2019d have to do it later. The vicar was here, a young man whose name he\u2019d already forgotten. Even de Raaf and Harry Pye had shown. De Raaf looked like a provincial squire in muddy boots, and Pye could have been mistaken for the sexton in plain brown.</p><p>The only thing missing was the bride.</p><p>Simon suppressed an urge to charge down the aisle and peer out the front doors like an anxious cook awaiting the arrival of the fishmonger with her eels. Oh, God, where was she? He hadn\u2019t been alone with her since she\u2019d caught him returning from the duel with James, nearly a week ago now, and while she seemed content, while she smiled at him when in the company of others, he couldn\u2019t shake off this morbid worry. Had she changed her mind? Had he repulsed her, making love to her while his shoulder dripped gore and he wore the stain of a dead man\u2019s blood like a badge of dishonor on his chest? He shook his head. Of course he\u2019d repulsed her, his angel with her strict morals. She must\u2019ve been horrified. Was it enough to make her break her promise? She\u2019d given her word, on her mother\u2019s memory, that she wouldn\u2019t leave him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was that enough?</p><p>Simon walked to a granite pillar that towered to the barrel ceiling fifty feet overhead. A double row of the pink granite columns held aloft the ceiling, decorated with recessed painted squares. Each square was edged in gilt, as if to remind one of the golden afterlife that presumably awaited. Off to the side, he could see into a St. Mary\u2019s chapel with a statue of a pubescent Virgin Mary gazing serenely down at her toes. It was a pretty church, lacking only a pretty bride.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s pacing again,\u201d de Raaf said in a tone he probably thought was quiet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s nervous,\u201d Pye replied.</p> <p>\u201cI am not nervous,\u201d Simon said through gritted teeth. He reached to stroke his ring before remembering it was gone. He turned to saunter back and caught Pye and de Raaf exchanging a significant glance. Wonderful. Now he was considered a case for Bedlam by his friends.</p><p>A screech came from the front of the church as someone opened the big oak doors.</p><p>Simon wheeled. Lucy entered, escorted by her father. She wore a rose-colored gown, pulled back in front to reveal the pale green underskirt. The color made her complexion glow, gave her dusky eyes, brows, and hair a perfect setting, like a rose surrounded by dark leaves. She smiled at him and looked . . . beautiful.</p><p>Simply beautiful.</p><p>He felt like rushing to her and capturing her arm. Instead, he straightened and moved to stand by de Raaf. He watched her approach, patiently waiting. Soon. Soon, she would be his. He would have no need to fear her loss, her desertion. Lucy laid her hand on the crook of his arm. He refrained from clamping down on it with his other hand. The captain scowled at him and slowly released his daughter\u2019s arm. The old man wasn\u2019t happy about this. When he asked for her hand, Simon had known that had Lucy been younger or less loved, he would have been out on his ear in an instant. As it was, his angel had prevailed even against her father\u2019s clear disapproval. Simon smiled at the older man and gave in to his urge to grasp her hand on his arm. She was his now.</p> <p>The captain didn\u2019t miss the gesture. His ruddy face darkened.</p><p>Simon leaned his head close to hers. \u201cYou came.\u201d</p><p>Her face was grave. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you would after the other morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you?\u201d She watched him with unfathomable eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He searched her face but couldn\u2019t read any more there. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we ready?\u201d The vicar smiled vaguely.</p><p>Simon straightened and nodded.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved,\u201d the vicar began.</p><p>Simon concentrated on the words that would bind Lucy to him. Perhaps now his fear of losing her would finally die and be laid to rest. No matter what she found out about him, no matter what ghastly mistakes, what grave sins he committed in the future, his angel would have to remain with him.</p><p>She was his, now and forever.</p><p>\u201cI SHALL SEND UP A MAID TO ASSIST YOU, my lady,\u201d Newton intoned from behind Lucy that evening.</p> <p>She blinked and glanced over her shoulder. \u201cYes. Ah, thank you.\u201d</p><p>The butler closed the door softly behind him. Lucy returned to gawking at the room. Her room. And she\u2019d thought the bedrooms in Rosalind\u2019s town house grand. The walls were covered in rose damask, a warm and soothing color that gave the bedroom the intimate feel of an embrace. Underfoot, the patterned carpet was so thick her heels sank into it. Above, the ceiling was painted with cupids or angels\u2014hard to tell in the dim light of evening\u2014and was edged in gilt. Of course.</p><p>And centered between two long windows was a bed.</p><p>But to call this piece of furniture a bed was like calling St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral a church. This was the gaudiest, the largest, the most sumptuous bed Lucy had ever seen in her life. The mattress was easily three feet off the ground, and on one side were steps, presumably to mount the thing. A massive poster rose from each corner, carved, gilded, and draped with swathes of burgundy velvet. Gold ropes drew back the burgundy drapes to reveal pink gauze underdrapes. The actual bed linens were ecru and made of satin. Lucy hesitantly touched them with one finger.</p><p>Someone tapped at the door.</p><p>Lucy whirled and stared. Would Simon knock? \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>A mobcap peeked around the door. \u201cMr. Newton sent us, my lady. To help you undress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lucy nodded and watched the little woman trot into the room, trailed by a younger girl.</p><p>The older maid immediately began rummaging through the wardrobe. \u201cYou\u2019ll want the lace chemise, I think, don\u2019t you, my lady? On your wedding night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d Lucy felt a flutter in her stomach.</p><p>The maid brought the chemise over and began unhooking the back of Lucy\u2019s dress. \u201cThey\u2019re all talking about the wedding breakfast this morning, my lady, down in the kitchen. How elegant it was. Even that Henry, my lord\u2019s valet, was impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was very nice.\u201d Lucy tried to relax. Even after a fortnight in London, she still wasn\u2019t used to being served quite so intimately. She hadn\u2019t had help with her clothes since she was five. Rosalind had assigned one of her maids to look after her, but it seemed that now that Lucy was Simon\u2019s wife, she required two.</p><p>\u201cLord Iddesleigh has such a wonderful sense of style.\u201d The older maid grunted and bent to undo the last hooks. \u201cAnd then they say he took you ladies on a tour of the capital after the wedding breakfast. Did you enjoy that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy stepped out of her gown. She\u2019d been with Simon for most of the day, but they\u2019d never been alone. Perhaps now that they were finally married and the ceremonies over with, they could spend more time together, learn to know one another.</p><p>The maid quickly gathered the material and handed it to the younger maid. \u201cNow mind you check that over good. Wouldn\u2019t want a stain to set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2019m,\u201d the girl squeaked. She looked no more than fourteen and was obviously in awe of the older woman, although she towered over her.</p><p>Lucy took a deep breath as the maid undid her stays. Her underskirts and shift were whisked off and the lace chemise settled over her head. The maid brushed her hair until Lucy could stand it no longer. All this fussing was giving her too much time to think, to worry about the coming night and what would happen.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need for the night.\u201d</p><p>The maids curtsied as they left, and suddenly she was alone. Lucy sank into one of the chairs by the fire. There was a decanter of wine on the table next to her. She stared thoughtfully at it for a moment. The wine might dull her senses, but she was fairly certain it wouldn\u2019t calm her nerves. And she knew she didn\u2019t want her senses dull tonight, no matter how nervous she was.</p><p>A soft tap came from the door\u2014not the one to the hall but the other one, presumably a connecting door.</p><p>Lucy cleared her throat. \u201cCome.\u201d</p><p>Simon opened the door. He still wore his breeches, hose, and shirt, but he\u2019d removed his waistcoat and coat and he was bareheaded. He paused in the doorway. It took her a moment to place his expression. He was uncertain.</p><p>\u201cIs that your room in there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He frowned and glanced back. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a sitting room. Yours, actually. Would you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Lucy rose, very conscious that she was nude beneath her flowing lace chemise.</p><p>He stepped back, and she saw a rose and white room with several settees and armchairs scattered about. There was a door on the farther wall.</p><p>\u201cAnd is your room beyond that?\u201d She nodded to the far door.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s my sitting room. It\u2019s rather dark, I\u2019m afraid. Decorated by some dead ancestor with a gloomy sensibility and a disapproval of any color but brown. Yours is much nicer.\u201d He tapped his fingers on the door frame. \u201cNext to my sitting room is my dressing room, equally gloomy, and beyond that, my bedroom, which, fortunately, I\u2019ve had redecorated in my own colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood gracious.\u201d Lucy raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat a hike you\u2019ve had to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d He laughed suddenly, covering his eyes with one hand.</p><p>She half smiled, not knowing the joke, not knowing in fact how she was supposed to act with him, now that they were finally man and wife and alone in their own rooms. It was all so awkward. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He dropped his hand so she could see that his cheeks had reddened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the conversation I\u2019d expected to have on our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s nervous. With that realization, a bit of her own anxiety seemed to fall away. She turned and strolled back into her bedroom. \u201cWhat would you rather talk about?\u201d</p><p>She heard him close the door. \u201cI was going to impress you with my romantic eloquence, of course. I\u2019d thought to wax philosophical about the beauty of your brow.\u201d</p><p>Lucy blinked. \u201cMy brow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Have I told you that your brow intimidates me?\u201d She felt his warmth at her back as he moved behind her, but he didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cIt\u2019s so smooth and white and broad, and ends with your straight, knowing eyebrows, like a statue of Athena pronouncing judgment. If the warrior goddess had a brow like yours, it is no wonder the ancients worshiped and feared her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlather,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBlather, indeed. Blather is all I am, after all.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and turned to contradict him, but he moved with her so that she couldn\u2019t quite catch sight of his face.</p><p>\u201cI am the duke of nonsense,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cThe king of farce, the emperor of emptiness.\u201d</p><p>Did he really see himself so? \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlathering is what I do best,\u201d he said, still unseen. \u201cI\u2019d like to blather about your golden eyes and ruby lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe perfect curve of your cheek,\u201d he murmured close.</p><p>She gasped as his breath stirred the hair at her neck. He was distracting her with lovemaking. And it was working. \u201cWhat a lot of talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do talk too much. It\u2019s a weakness you\u2019ll have to bear in your husband.\u201d His voice was next to her ear. \u201cBut I\u2019d have to spend quite a bit of time outlining the shape of your mouth, its softness and the warmth within.\u201d</p><p>Lucy felt a tightening in her middle. \u201cIs that all?\u201d And she was surprised at the low vibration of her voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Then I\u2019d move to your neck.\u201d His hand came around and stroked the air inches from her throat. \u201cHow graceful, how elegant, how much I want to lick it.\u201d</p><p>Her lungs were laboring to fill with air. He caressed her with his voice alone, and she wondered if she would be able to bear it when he used his hands.</p><p>He continued, \u201cAnd your shoulders, so white and tender.\u201d His hand hovered over her.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d want to describe your breasts.\u201d His tone had dipped and roughened. \u201cBut I\u2019d have to see them first.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath. He breathed close to her ear. His presence surrounded her body, but he made no move to touch her. She raised her hand and grasped the ribbon at her throat. Slowly, she pulled it, and the whisper sound of the silk sliding free in the bedroom\u2019s quiet was unbearably intimate. His breathing hitched as the edges of her chemise fell apart, baring the upper slopes of her bosom.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful, so pale,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She swallowed and drew the fabric down her shoulders. Her fingers trembled. She\u2019d never willingly exposed herself to another like this, but the roughened sound of his breathing drove her on.</p><p>\u201cI see the soft mounds, the shadowed valley, but not the sweet tips. Let me see them, angel.\u201d His voice shook.</p><p>Something feminine and primeval leaped within her at the thought that she could make this man tremble. She wanted to expose herself to him, her husband. She closed her eyes and pulled the chemise down. Her nipples peaked in the chilly air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped breathing. \u201cAh, God, I remember them. Do you know what it did to me to turn away from you that night?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her throat clogged. She remembered as well, his hot gaze on her bare breasts, her own wanton craving.</p><p>\u201cIt nearly unmanned me.\u201d His hands hovered over her breasts, tracing her curves without touching. \u201cI wanted to feel you so badly.\u201d</p><p>His palms were so close to her skin that she could feel his heat, but he didn\u2019t touch her. Not yet. She found herself straining toward his hands, anticipating that first contact. She withdrew her arms from the chemise sleeves but clutched the material at her waist so it wouldn\u2019t fall.</p> <p>\u201cI remember you touched yourself here.\u201d His hands cupped the air above her nipples. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She shivered. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>She watched his hands descend and lightly touch her breasts. His warm fingers curved about her. She arched and her breasts thrust themselves into his palms.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he breathed. He stroked in a circle around her breasts.</p><p>She looked down at herself and saw his big, long-fingered hands on her skin. They looked unbearably masculine. They looked unbearably possessive. He brought both hands toward the tips of her nipples and gently but firmly squeezed them between his forefingers and thumbs. She inhaled at the shocking sensation.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it feel good?\u201d he asked, his lips in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She swallowed, unable to answer. It was more than good.</p><p>But that seemed answer enough for him. \u201cLet me see the rest. Please.\u201d His lips skimmed across her cheek, his palms still cradling her breasts. \u201cPlease show me, my wife.\u201d</p><p>She opened her clenched fists, and her chemise fell to the floor. She was naked. He brushed one hand down to her belly and pulled her back against him so her nude buttocks brushed the fabric of his breeches. They were warm, almost hot, from his body. He pressed against her, and she felt his male organ, long and hard. She couldn\u2019t help it. She began to shake.</p><p>He chuckled in her ear. \u201cThere was more I was going to say to you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d He pressed into her again and groaned. \u201cI want you too badly, and I\u2019ve lost the words.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he lifted her into his arms, and she could see his eyes, shining silver. A muscle in his jaw flexed. He set her on the bed and put one knee beside her, making the mattress dip. \u201cIt will hurt the first time; you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d He reached both arms behind him and pulled his shirt over his head.</p> <p>She was so distracted by the sight of his bare chest that she hardly heard the question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go as slowly as possible.\u201d He was lean, the long muscles on his arms and shoulders moving as he climbed into the bed. His nipples stood out in startling contrast to his fair skin, brown and flat and so very naked. A diamond of short, fair hairs grew in the very middle of his chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to hate me afterward.\u201d</p><p>She reached to touch his nipple. He groaned and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hate you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then he was on her, kissing her wildly, his hands at either side of her face. She felt like giggling and would have, if his tongue hadn\u2019t been in her mouth. It was so wonderful to have him want her like this. She cradled the back of his head in her hands and felt the bristles of his shorn hair against her palms. He lowered his hips to hers and all thought spun away. He was hot. His chest slid across her breasts, damp with sweat. His hard thighs, still encased in his breeches, were nudging her legs apart. She opened her legs, welcoming the weight of his body, welcoming him. He settled against her most vulnerable part, and for a moment she was embarrassed. She was wet and the moisture must be staining his breeches. Would he mind? Then he pressed against her with his maleness and she felt . . .</p><p>Wonder.</p><p>It was so extraordinary, better even than when she touched herself. Was it always this good, this physical sensation? She thought not. It must be him\u2014her husband\u2014and she gave thanks that she had married such a man. He pressed again, sliding this time, and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He lifted his mouth from hers, his face tight and without humor.</p> <p>He fumbled between them, and she realized he must be releasing himself. She skewed her head sideways to look. But he was on her before she could see.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, his words sharp and bit off. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise. If only\u201d\u2014something nudged against her\u2014\u201clater. Ahh.\u201d He closed his eyes as if in pain.</p><p>And invaded her. Pushing and widening. Burning.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She bit the inside of her cheek, trying not to cry. At the same time, she was oddly touched by his apology.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Something tore quite explicitly, and she inhaled but didn\u2019t make a sound.</p><p>He opened his eyes, looking stricken and hot and savage. \u201cOh, God, sweetheart. I promise it will be better next time.\u201d He kissed the corner of her mouth softly. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on steadying her breath and hoped he would finish very soon. She didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings, but this was no longer pleasant for her.</p><p>He parted his mouth over hers and licked her bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved between them and caressed her lightly where they were joined. She tensed, unconsciously expecting pain, but instead it was pleasant. And then it was more. Heat began to flow from her center. Slowly her thighs relaxed from the rigid arch they\u2019d assumed when he\u2019d entered her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, his voice deep and lazy.</p><p>His thumb brushed against her nubbin of flesh. She closed her eyes and sighed.</p><p>He circled. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He moved very slowly within her, sliding. It was almost . . . good.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He thrust his tongue into her mouth, and she sucked it.</p><p>She let her legs drop open to give him better access. He groaned into her mouth, incoherent, and suddenly it was beautiful again. She arched her hips to meet that thumb, to demand more pressure and dug her fingers into the hard muscles of his shoulders. He moved faster in reply. He broke their kiss, and she could see his silver eyes, pleading and taking at the same time. She smiled and wrapped her legs about his hips. His eyes widened at her movement and he groaned. His eyelids fluttered closed. Then he was arcing back, the tendons in his arms and neck straining to meet an invisible goal. He shouted and heaved against her. And she watched him, this powerful, articulate man driven to helpless, wordless pleasure by her body. By her.</p><p>He fell to her side, his chest still heaving, his eyes closed, and lay there until his breathing calmed. She thought he\u2019d fallen asleep, but he reached out and gathered her to him.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d The word was so garbled, she wouldn\u2019t have known what he\u2019d said if he hadn\u2019t been repeating it all along.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d She stroked his damp side and smiled secretly. \u201cGo to sleep, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHY DID YOU SUMMON ME HERE?\u201d Sir Rupert glanced uneasily around the park. It was very early morning and cold as the devil\u2019s heart. No one else was in sight, but that didn\u2019t mean Walker hadn\u2019t been followed or that some fashionable lordling might not be out riding. He pulled the brim of his hat lower to be on the safe side.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for him to make the next move.\u201d Lord Walker\u2019s breath steamed as he talked.</p><p>He sat his mount like a man who\u2019d been bred to the saddle, as indeed he had. Six generations of Walkers had led the hunt in his home county. The Walker stable was renowned for the hunters that came out of it. He\u2019d probably sat a horse before he could toddle on leading-strings.</p><p>Sir Rupert shifted on his gelding. He hadn\u2019t learned to ride until he was a young man and it showed. Add to that his crippled leg and he was damned uncomfortable. \u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him before he kills us.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert winced and looked around again. Fool. Anyone listening would have blackmail material at the very least. On the other hand, if Walker could solve this problem for him . . . \u201cWe\u2019ve tried that twice and failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we try it again. Third time\u2019s the charm.\u201d Walker blinked at him with bovine eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not waiting like a cockerel to have its neck wrung for the supper pot.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert sighed. It was a delicate balance. As far as he knew, Simon Iddesleigh still wasn\u2019t aware of his part in the conspiracy. Iddesleigh most likely thought Walker was the last man involved. And if Iddesleigh could be kept from finding out, if he could bring his revenge to its inevitable bloody conclusion with Walker, well, all and good. Walker wasn\u2019t such a very important piece of Sir Rupert\u2019s life, after all. He certainly wouldn\u2019t be missed. And with Walker gone, there would be no one else alive to connect him to the conspiracy that had led to Ethan Iddesleigh\u2019s death. It was a seductive thought. He\u2019d be able to rest, and God knew he was ready for it.</p><p>But if Walker talked before Iddesleigh got to him\u2014or, worse, when Iddesleigh found him\u2014all would be lost. Because, of course, Iddesleigh was really after Sir Rupert, even if he didn\u2019t know it. Hence, Sir Rupert\u2019s indulgence of Walker\u2019s melodrama and this meeting in the park at dawn. The other man must think they were together in this.</p><p>His hand drifted toward his waistcoat pocket where the Iddesleigh signet ring still lay. He should\u2019ve gotten rid of it by now. He had in fact nearly thrown it into the Thames on two occasions. But each time something stopped him. It was illogical, but he fancied that the ring gave him power over Iddesleigh.</p><p>\u201cHe married yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sir Rupert focused on the conversation.</p><p>\u201cSimon Iddesleigh,\u201d Walker said patiently, as if he weren\u2019t the slow one. \u201cMarried some chit from the country. No money, no name. Maybe the man is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not. Iddesleigh is many things, but insane is not one of them.\u201d He squashed an urge to massage his thigh.</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d Walker shrugged and took out his snuffbox. \u201cAny case, she might do.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert stared bemusedly as the other man inhaled a pinch of snuff and sneezed violently.</p><p>Walker flapped his handkerchief and then blew loudly. \u201cTo kill.\u201d He sniffed and wiped his nose before pocketing the handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d He nearly laughed in the other\u2019s face. \u201cRemember, it was the death of his brother that set Simon Iddesleigh off in the first place. Killing his new wife isn\u2019t likely to stop him, now, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if we threaten her, tell him if he doesn\u2019t cease, we\u2019ll kill her.\u201d Walker shrugged again. \u201cI think he\u2019ll stop. Worth a try at any rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Sir Rupert felt his lip curl. \u201cI think it would be like lighting a powder keg. He\u2019ll find you even faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not you, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Lord Walker flicked a speck of snuff from the lace at his wrist. \u201cNot you. Made sure to stay out of this, haven\u2019t you, Fletcher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy anonymity has served our case well.\u201d Sir Rupert met the younger man\u2019s gaze steadily.</p><p>\u201cHas it?\u201d Walker\u2019s heavy-lidded eyes stared back.</p><p>Sir Rupert had always found Walker\u2019s eyes stupidly beastlike, but that was the problem, wasn\u2019t it? It was so easy to discount the intelligence of a big, slow-moving animal. Sweat chilled on his back.</p><p>Walker\u2019s gaze dropped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I plan to do at any rate\u2014and I expect you to back me, should I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Sir Rupert said evenly. \u201cWe\u2019re partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Walker grinned, ruddy cheeks bunching. \u201cHave the bastard over a barrel in no time. Must go now. Left a little dove all cozy in her nest. Wouldn\u2019t want her to fly before I got back.\u201d He winked lewdly and nudged his horse into a trot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sir Rupert watched the mist swallow the other man before turning his own gelding toward home and his family. His leg was giving him the very hell, and he\u2019d pay for this ride by having to put it up for the rest of the day. Walker or Iddesleigh. It didn\u2019t much matter at this point.</p><p>As long as one of them died.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>A soft snoring was the first thing Lucy heard when she woke the day after her wedding. Eyes closed, dreams still drifting in her mind, she wondered who was breathing so sonorously. Then she felt the weight of a hand on her breast and came fully awake. But she didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p> <p>Warm. She couldn\u2019t remember ever feeling this deliciously warm in her life, certainly not in winter. Her legs were tangled with masculine, hairy ones, even her toes, which never seemed to totally thaw between October and March, were toasty. It was like having her own private hearth, with the added bonus that this hearth came with smooth skin, snuggled all along her right side. The warm air rising from the covers had a subtle smell. She recognized her own scent mingled with a foreign one she realized must be his. How very primitive. Their body odor had mated.</p><p>Lucy sighed and opened her eyes.</p><p>The sun was peeking through a crack in the curtains. Was it as late as that? Hard on the heels of that thought was another. Had Simon locked the door? In town, Lucy had become accustomed to a maid drawing the curtains in the morning and stirring the fire. Would the servants have expected Simon to return to his own room last night? She turned her head to frown at the door.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Simon squeezed her breast in reprimand at her movement. \u201cSleep,\u201d he mumbled, and his breathing evened out again.</p><p>Lucy watched him. Fair stubble glinted on his jaw, there were dark circles under his eyes, and his short hair was smashed to one side. He looked so handsome, she nearly caught her breath. She tilted her head until she could see his hand wrapped around her breast. The nipple poked through between his first and second fingers.</p> <p>Her face heated. \u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack . . . sleep.\u201d He brushed a kiss against her bare shoulder without opening his eyes.</p><p>She firmed her mouth. This was a serious matter. \u201cIs the door locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSimon, is the door locked?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lucy squinted at him. He\u2019d started to snore again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d She moved to slide from the bed.</p><p>Simon twisted and suddenly he was lying on her. He opened his eyes finally. \u201cI should have expected this when I married a country miss.\u201d His voice was gravelly with sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucy blinked up at him. She felt very naked beneath him. His organ pressed into the softness of her lower belly.</p><p>\u201cEarly hours.\u201d He frowned sternly and shifted so his weight was off her chest. Which only made his hips bear down harder.</p><p>Lucy tried to ignore the male anatomy impressing itself onto her stomach. It wasn\u2019t easy. \u201cBut the maid\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny maid who comes through that door before we quit this room, I\u2019ll let go without reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was locked.\u201d She tried to frown but was afraid her lips may have curved in the wrong direction. She should\u2019ve been mortified.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d He traced her nipple. \u201cSame thing. No one will interrupt us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his, and Lucy forgot her thought. His lips were warm and gentle in contrast to his bristles scraping her chin. Somehow the two different touches were erotic.</p><p>\u201cSo how will you entertain your new bridegroom,\u201d he murmured in her ear, \u201cnow that you\u2019ve woken me, hmm?\u201d He pressed his hips into hers.</p><p>Lucy shifted restlessly, then stilled with a gasp\u2014a small one, but he heard it nevertheless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Simon leaped off her. \u201cYou must think me a ravenous beast. Does it hurt terribly? Perhaps I should have a maid sent up to tend you. Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucy pressed her hand to his lips. She\u2019d never get a word in otherwise. \u201cShh. I\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d Lucy closed her eyes and contemplated pulling the coverlet over her head. Did all married men speak so frankly to their wives? \u201cI\u2019m just a little sore is all.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her helplessly.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite nice.\u201d She cleared her throat. How to get him back to her? \u201cWhen you were lying next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here, then.\u201d</p><p>She inched closer, but when she would have faced him, he gently turned her so that her back was to his chest.</p><p>\u201cPut your head here.\u201d He stretched out his arm to make a pillow for her.</p><p>She was even warmer than before, cradled and held all around by his body in a comfortable, safe embrace. He brought his legs up behind hers and groaned softly. His erection was against the small of her back, insistent and hot.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He chuckled rustily. \u201cBut I\u2019ll survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>He clasped her breast. \u201cI know I hurt you last night.\u201d His thumb flicked her nipple. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you.\u201d</p><p>Lucy tensed. What, exactly, did showing her entail?</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cIt\u2019ll feel nice. Relax. Let me show you heaven; you\u2019re an angel, after all.\u201d His hand smoothed down her torso, tickling across her belly, and reached the hair below.</p><p>\u201cSimon, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He walked his fingers through her maiden hair. She trembled and didn\u2019t know where to look. Thank goodness he wasn\u2019t facing her. Finally, she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOpen for me, sweetheart,\u201d he rumbled in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so soft here. I want to pet you.\u201d</p><p>Surely he wouldn\u2019t . . .</p><p>He wedged his knee between her thighs, parting them. His hand traced the flanges of her sex. She caught her breath, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kiss you here.\u201d He stroked up. \u201cLick and tongue you, memorize your spice, but I think it\u2019s too soon for that.\u201d</p><p>Her brain froze as she tried to imagine. Her hips shied.</p><p>\u201cShh. Be still. It won\u2019t hurt. In fact\u201d\u2014he reached the top of her cleft-\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll make you feel very, very good.\u201d He circled that bit of flesh there. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. She shouldn\u2019t even be allowing him to do this. Surely this wasn\u2019t what was normally done between man and wife.</p><p>\u201cAngel, look at me,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI want to see your beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she turned her head. Raised her eyelids. He stared at her, silver eyes glittering as he pressed with a finger. Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned. Then he was kissing her, his tongue stroking over hers as his fingers slid more rapidly. She wanted to move her hips, to beg that finger. Instead she arched back, rubbing against him. He mumbled something and bit her bottom lip. She felt her wetness now, seeping, making his fingers slippery.</p><p>He pushed his penis hard against her bottom.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch her breath, couldn\u2019t think. She shouldn\u2019t let this happen. Not in front of him. He thrust his tongue into her mouth and relentlessly circled her below. He was a silver-eyed sorcerer who held her enthralled. She was losing control. She sucked on the thickness of his tongue and suddenly it happened. She arched and felt pleasure shake her. He moved more slowly then, raised his head to watch her, but she no longer cared. Warmth was diffusing through her, spreading from the center of her body. It did indeed feel good.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Her tongue felt thick, as if she were drugged, and her words were a mumble. She closed her eyes and drifted for a bit, but then she thought of something. He was still hard against her back. She wiggled her bottom, and he sucked in a breath. Did it hurt him?</p><p>Well, of course it must. \u201cCan I . . . ?\u201d She felt her face heat. How to phrase the question? \u201cCan I . . . help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Go to sleep.\u201d But his voice was tight, and his male organ was almost burning a hole in her back. Surely that wasn\u2019t good for his health.</p><p>She turned until she could see his face. She knew her own was flushed with shyness. \u201cI\u2019m your wife. I\u2019d like to help you.\u201d</p><p>A tinge of red chased across his cheekbones. Funny, he wasn\u2019t so sophisticated when it came to his own needs.</p><p>The sight strengthened her resolve. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He looked into her eyes, seemed to search them, and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to burn in hell for this.\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows and touched him gently on the shoulder.</p><p>His hand caught hers, and for a moment she thought he would push her away, but he guided her palm under the covers and drew it close to his body. Suddenly she held him. Her eyes widened. He was thicker than she\u2019d imagined. There was no give to his flesh, and strangely his skin was soft. And hot. She wanted very much to look at him but wasn\u2019t sure he could take that right now. Instead, very gently, she squeezed.</p><p>\u201cAh, God.\u201d His eyelids drooped and there was a dazed look on his face.</p><p>It made her feel powerful. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d His fingers delved into her feminine parts and she jumped. Then he was smearing her moisture over himself. \u201cJust . . .\u201d He wrapped his hand over hers and together they slid up the length of him. And back down again.</p><p>And again. This was absolutely fascinating. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Yes.\u201d He blinked and released her hand.</p><p>She smiled, secretly pleased that he\u2019d been reduced to monosyllables. She kept up the pace that he\u2019d showed her and watched his dear face. He closed his eyes. A line had burrowed itself between his eyebrows. His upper lip was curled back from his teeth, and his face shone with sweat. Watching him, she felt warmth returning to her sex. But more than that, there was a feeling of control and, underneath, the realization of intimacy that he was letting her do this. That he\u2019d made himself vulnerable to her.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d he grunted.</p><p>She complied, her fingers slipping over his length, gripping his skin, hot and slick beneath her palm. His hips rose to meet her hand now.</p><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d Suddenly his eyes opened, and she saw his irises had darkened to a steel gray. He looked grim and driven and almost as if he were in pain. Then he sneered and his big body began jerking. Cream spurted into her palm. He convulsed again, his teeth gritted, his eyes still staring into hers. She held his gaze, pressing her thighs together.</p><p>He slumped back into the bed as if terribly weakened, but she knew already from just last night that this was usual. Lucy withdrew her hand from underneath the covers. On it was a whitish substance. She examined it curiously, spreading her fingers. Simon\u2019s seed.</p><p>He sighed beside her. \u201cOh, God. That was unbelievably crass of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d She bent to kiss the corner of his mouth. \u201cIf you can do it to me, surely, then, I can do it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise, my wife.\u201d He turned his head to take control of the kiss, his mouth hard and possessive. \u201cI am the luckiest of men.\u201d</p><p>Moving more slowly than usual, he grasped her wrist and wiped her palm with a corner of the bedding. Then he turned her so her back was once again to his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow\u201d\u2014he yawned\u2014\u201cnow we sleep.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and Lucy did just that.</p><p>\u201cWOULD YOU LIKE TO DRIVE ABOUT TOWN this afternoon?\u201d Simon frowned at his beefsteak and sawed off a bite. \u201cOr perambulate up and down the paths of Hyde Park? Seems boring, but ladies and gentlemen go there every day, so they must find it enjoyable. Once in a while there\u2019s a carriage wreck, which is always exciting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They were pedestrian suggestions, but he was unsure where else to take Lucy. The sad fact was that he\u2019d never spent much time with a lady. He winced. At least out of bed. Where did married men escort their lovely wives? Not to gambling dens or houses of ill repute, certainly. And the Agrarians\u2019 coffeehouse was too grimy for a lady. Which left the park. Or maybe a museum. He cast a glance at her. Surely she wouldn\u2019t want to tour a church?</p><p>\u201cThat would be nice.\u201d She poked a green bean. \u201cOr we could simply stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d He stared. It was too soon to take her to bed again, although the thought beckoned.</p><p>\u201cYes. You could write or mess about with your roses and I could read or sketch.\u201d She pushed the green bean aside and took a bite of the whipped potatoes.</p> <p>He shifted uneasily in his chair. \u201cWon\u2019t you be bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou needn\u2019t think that you must amuse me. After all, I doubt you spent your time driving in parks before you married me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no,\u201d Simon admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m prepared to make some changes now that I\u2019ve a wife. I\u2019ve settled down, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanges?\u201d Lucy set down her fork and leaned forward. \u201cLike giving up red heels?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, then closed it. Was she bamming him? \u201cMaybe not that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr the ornaments on your coats? Sometimes I feel quite a peahen next to you.\u201d</p><p>Simon frowned. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>A mischievous smile twitched at the corner of her mouth. \u201cAre all your stockings clocked? I\u2019m sure your hosiery bill must be enormous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite done?\u201d</p><p>Simon tried to look stern but had an idea he failed miserably. He was glad to see her merry after last night. When he thought of the pain he must\u2019ve caused her, he still winced. And then to top that by showing her this morning how to jack him off like a gin whore, it didn\u2019t put him in a pretty light. He was corrupting his naive young wife. And the sad thing was that were he to have the opportunity to do it over, he knew he\u2019d place her hand on his cock once again. He\u2019d been so hard, he\u2019d ached. And just the thought of Lucy\u2019s cool little hand holding his erection had him aching again. What kind of man became hard at the thought of corrupting the innocent?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want you to change anything at all.\u201d</p> <p>Simon blinked and tried to focus his salacious mind on what his dear wife was saying. He realized that Lucy had become serious.</p><p>Her eyebrows were straight and stern. \u201cExcept for one thing. I don\u2019t want you to duel again.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and brought his wineglass to his lips to buy time. Damn. Damn. Damn. She wasn\u2019t fooled, his angel. She watched him calmly and with no trace of mercy in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour concern is of course commendable, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Newton slithered into the room, holding a silver plate. Thank God. \u201cThe post, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded his thanks and took the letters. \u201cAh, perhaps we are to be invited to a grand ball.\u201d</p><p>There were only three letters, and he was aware of Lucy still watching him. He glanced at the first. A bill. His lips quirked. \u201cOr perhaps not. You may be right about my red-heeled shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my dear?\u201d He laid the bill aside and opened the next. A letter from a fellow rose enthusiast: a new grafting technique from Spain, et cetera. It, too, he tossed aside. The third letter had no crest pressed into the red sealing wax, and he didn\u2019t recognize the handwriting. He opened it with a butter knife. Then sat blinking stupidly down at the words.</p><p>If you have any love for your new bride, stop. Any further duels or threats of duels will be met with her immediate death.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought that they might bypass him and go straight to Lucy. He had focused his attention mostly on keeping her safe whilst in his company. But if they were to attack while he wasn\u2019t there . . .</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide behind that note forever,\u201d Lucy said.</p><p>What if she was hurt\u2014or God forbid killed\u2014because of him? Would he be able to live in a world without her and her terrible eyebrows?</p><p>\u201cSimon, are you all right? What is it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up belatedly. \u201cNothing. Sorry. It\u2019s nothing at all.\u201d He crumpled the note in his fist and stood to toss it in the fire.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ice-skate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He\u2019d caught her off guard. She blinked at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been promising Pocket I\u2019d teach her to skate on the frozen Thames.\u201d He cleared his throat nervously now. What an idiotic idea. \u201cWould you like to ice-skate?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment and then rose suddenly from her chair. She came to him and framed his face with her hands. \u201cYes. I would be delighted to ice-skate with you and Pocket.\u201d She kissed him tenderly.</p><p>The first kiss, he thought suddenly and inconsequentially, that she\u2019d offered on her own. He wanted to grab her by the shoulders, wrap her in his arms, and pack her away in some inner room in his house. Somewhere he could keep her safe for always. Instead, he kissed her back, brushing lightly, softly over her lips.</p><p>And wondered how he would protect her.</p><p>\u201cWHY DON\u2019T YOU TELL ME MORE about the Serpent Prince?\u201d Lucy asked later that evening. She used her thumb to smear the red pastel into a shadow beneath Simon\u2019s ear on her sketch.</p><p>What a wonderful afternoon they had had with Pocket. Simon had shown himself to be an expert ice-skater. Why that had surprised her, Lucy couldn\u2019t tell. He had spun circles around her and Pocket, laughing like a madman. They had skated until the light had begun to dim and Pocket\u2019s nose was quite rosy. Now Lucy was pleasantly weary and happy to simply sit and relax with Simon as she sketched him. This was what she had hoped their life would be like together. She smiled to herself as she looked at him. Although he could make a better model.</p><p>As she watched, Simon shifted in his chair and lost the pose. Again. Lucy caught herself in a sigh. She couldn\u2019t very well order her new husband to be still as she would Mr. Hedge, but it was most difficult to sketch him when he kept twitching. They were in her sitting room, the one next to her new bedroom. It was a lovely room, done all in creams and rosy pinks with chairs scattered about. And it faced south, which made for good light in the afternoon, perfect for sketching. Of course, it was evening now, but Simon had lit at least a dozen candles despite her protests about the waste and expense.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He hadn\u2019t even heard her.</p><p>What was on his mind? Was it the mysterious letter at luncheon or her ultimatum about the dueling? That hadn\u2019t been politic, she knew, for a new wife. But she felt too strongly on the subject to be circumspect.</p><p>\u201cI asked you to tell me more of the fairy tale.\u201d She blocked in his shoulder. \u201cAbout the Serpent Prince. You\u2019d just gotten to the part about Prince Rutherford. I do think you should reconsider that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d His fingers stopped tapping against his knee. \u201cThe name comes with the fairy tale. You wouldn\u2019t want me to tinker with tradition, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She\u2019d wondered for some time now whether Simon was in fact making the whole story up as he went along.</p><p>\u201cHave you been drawing illustrations for the fairy tale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cMay I see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She deepened the shadow on his sleeve. \u201cNot until I\u2019m finished. The story now, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cThe Serpent Prince had dressed Angelica all in gleaming copper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it weigh an awful lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLight as a feather, I assure you. The Serpent Prince waves his hand again and suddenly he and Angelica are standing at the top of the castle, watching the guests to the grand ball process by. \u2018Here,\u2019 the Serpent Prince says. \u2018Wear this and be sure and return by the cock\u2019s first crow.\u2019 And he hands her a copper mask. Angelica thanks him, puts on the mask, and all atremble turns to go into the ball. \u2018Remember,\u2019 the Serpent Prince called after her. \u2018The cock\u2019s first crow and no later!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What would happen if she didn\u2019t return in time?\u201d Lucy frowned as she outlined his ears. Ears were always so difficult.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when people say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear this story?\u201d He looked down his long nose at her. He was teasing her, pretending to be haughty, and she abruptly realized she cherished these moments with him. When he teased her like this, she felt as if they had a secret code, one understood only by the two of them. It was silly, she knew, and yet she couldn\u2019t help caring for him all the more.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied meekly.</p><p>\u201cWell, the king\u2019s ball was a most magnificent affair, as you can imagine. A thousand crystal chandeliers lit the vast hall, and gold and jewels sparkled from the throats of all the beautiful ladies in the land. But Prince Rutherford only had eyes for Angelica. He danced every dance with her and begged her to tell him her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For just as she was about to, the first rays of dawn hit the palace\u2019s windows, and she knew the cock would crow soon. She flew from the ballroom, and as she crossed the doorway, she was instantly transported back to the Serpent Prince\u2019s cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold still.\u201d Lucy concentrated on getting the corner of his eye just right.</p><p>\u201cI obey your every order, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAngelica tended her goats all that day, taking a nap now and then, for she was quite weary after dancing the night away. And that evening she went to visit the Serpent Prince. \u2018What can I do for you now?\u2019 he asked her, because he\u2019d been rather expecting her. \u2018There\u2019s another ball tonight,\u2019 she replied. \u2018Can you not make me a new gown?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s become greedy,\u201d Lucy muttered.</p><p>\u201cPrince Rutherford\u2019s golden hair was most alluring,\u201d he said innocently. \u201cAnd the Serpent Prince agreed to conjure a new dress for her. But in order to do so, he must cut off his right hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it off?\u201d Lucy gaped in horror. \u201cBut he had no need to do so for the first dress.\u201d</p><p>Simon looked at her almost sadly. \u201cAh, but he was only mortal, after all. In order to make another dress for Angelica, he must sacrifice something.\u201d</p><p>A shiver of unease crept down her spine. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I like your fairy tale anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He got up from his chair and sauntered closer, looking impossibly dangerous.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She watched as he stalked toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish only to bring you joy.\u201d He plucked the pastel from her fingers and set it in the box beside her. \u201cBut I can\u2019t ignore the ugly realities of life either.\u201d He bent his head and brushed his lips down her throat. \u201cNo matter how much I\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to ignore reality,\u201d she said softly. She swallowed as she felt his open mouth on the hollow at the base of her throat. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we need dwell on the horrors of life. There are plenty of good things, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo there are,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He swept her suddenly into his arms before she had time to gather her senses. Lucy clutched at his shoulders as he walked with her into the bedchamber next door and set her on the bed. Then he was over her, kissing her almost desperately.</p><p>Lucy closed her eyes at the onslaught of sensation. She couldn\u2019t think while he kissed her so deeply, so ravenously, as if he would devour her. \u201cSimon, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. I know you\u2019re sore, I know I shouldn\u2019t do this, that I\u2019m a rutting animal to even think of it so soon. But, God, I have to.\u201d He raised his head and his eyes were wild. How had she ever thought them cold? \u201cPlease?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could any woman resist such a plea? Her heart warmed and her mouth curved in a sensuous smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She had no time to say more. At her consent, he was pulling at her clothes. She heard cloth tear. Her breasts were bare, and he fastened his mouth on one, sucking strongly. She gasped and clutched at his head, feeling the scrape of his teeth. He moved to her other breast but teased the first nipple with his thumb, rubbing and tweaking. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath, couldn\u2019t assimilate what he was doing to her.</p><p>He reared back and stripped off his waistcoat. His shirt drifted to the floor a moment later.</p><p>She stared at his bared torso. He was pale and taut. Long ropes of muscle shifted on his arms as he moved. He was breathing rapidly, and the fair hairs on his chest sparkled with sweat. He was such a beautiful man, and he was all hers. A ripple of arousal pulsed through her. He stood and shucked his breeches and hose; then he was unfastening the buttons to his smallclothes.</p> <p>She held her breath, watching avidly. She\u2019d never seen a man fully naked, and it seemed long overdue. But he climbed atop her, hiding that most interesting part of himself before she could see. And a strange thought ran through her mind: Was he shy? Or was it that he was afraid of shocking her? She raised her eyes to meet his gaze and opened her mouth to disabuse him of that notion\u2014she had, after all, spent her life in the country, where farm animals abounded\u2014but he spoke first.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me harder, looking at me like that.\u201d His voice was rough, almost hoarse. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as if I need any help to get a cock-stand around you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids drooped at his words. She wanted to taste him, to do things to him that she was only vaguely aware of. More. She wanted more.</p><p>\u201cI want to put myself in you,\u201d he said, guttural. \u201cI want to stay inside you all night, to wake with you around me, to make love to you before you even open your eyes.\u201d He knelt above her. His face was not kind, and she gloried in his savagery. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d place you on my lap, darling angel, and hold you throughout dinner, my cock inside you. I\u2019d feed you strawberries and cream and not move. The footmen would come and serve us and never know that my cock was in your sweet cove all the time. Your skirts would cover us, but you\u2019d have to remain very, very still so they wouldn\u2019t guess.\u201d</p><p>She felt a wild pulse of desire at his carnal words. She squeezed her legs together, helplessly listening as he told her wicked, forbidden things.</p> <p>\u201cAnd after we\u2019d eaten,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019d order the servants away. I\u2019d take down your bodice and suck your nipples until you came, creaming all over my cock. And I\u2019d still not leave you then.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered.</p><p>He kissed her softly on her neck, his caresses at odds with his hard words. \u201cI\u2019d place you on the table. Very carefully, oh, so very carefully, so that we never broke contact, and then I\u2019d make love to you until we both screamed.\u201d His words brushed her skin. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to help myself. I don\u2019t know what to do with these feelings. I want to make love to you in the carriage, in my library, my God, outside in the sunshine, lying in green grass. I spent half an hour yesterday calculating how soon it would be warm enough to do so.\u201d</p><p>His words were so erotic, so dark, it almost frightened her. She\u2019d never thought herself a sensual creature, yet with him her body felt out of control, helpless to feel anything but pleasure. He leaned over her and flipped up her skirts so she was nude below the waist. He looked down at what he\u2019d exposed.</p><p>\u201cI want this.\u201d He placed his hand over the juncture of her thighs. \u201cAll the time. I want to do this\u201d\u2014he parted her legs and lowered his hips until his hardness nestled in her folds\u2014\u201call the time.\u201d</p><p>She moaned. What was he doing to her?</p> <p>\u201cDo you want it, too?\u201d He moved, not entering her but thrusting his erection through her wetness. He was rubbing against her bud.</p><p>She arched helplessly, whimpering.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he whispered into the hair at her temple. He thrust his hips again.</p><p>Pleasure. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d He bit her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cOhhh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t form the words that he wanted. She could only feel.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d He cradled both her breasts in his hands and pinched the nipples as he thrust over her again.</p><p>And she came, grinding her hips against him, seeing stars in the darkness of her eyelids, moaning incoherently.</p> <p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d He positioned himself and pushed.</p><p>She felt a twinge, a slight ache, but she no longer cared. She wanted him inside, as close as possible to her. He wrapped his hand around her knee and hitched up one of her legs and pushed again. She was opening, parting, accepting him. She moaned, listening to his rough breathing. He pushed once more and his entire length came into her.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cDo you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Why wouldn\u2019t he move?</p><p>His expression was strained. He bent his head and kissed her softly, brushing over her lips, barely making contact. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you this time.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her other knee up until she was sprawled open beneath him. Then he ground down on her. She moaned. His pelvis was exactly where it should be, and she was in heaven.</p><p>He circled his hips and grunted, \u201cIs it good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yes.\u201d</p><p>He grinned tightly. And ground down again. Then he kissed her with long, luscious strokes of his tongue, his mouth making love to hers, and always the pressure of his hips, hard and demanding. She was drifting in a sensual haze and didn\u2019t know how long he made love to her. Time seemed to have stopped so they could be wrapped together in a cocoon of physical pleasure and emotional rapport. She held him tightly to her. This was her husband. This was her lover.</p><p>Then he stiffened and his movements became jerkier, faster.</p><p>She gasped and caught his face between her palms, wanting to be connected to him when it happened. He thrust hard against her and she felt his seed, hot inside her, right before her world started swirling. His mouth became slack on hers. She continued kissing him, licking along his bottom lip, tasting his mouth.</p><p>He pushed up from her, but she tightened her arms to hold him. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cStay with me. All night long. Please.\u201d</p><p>His lips quirked in a small smile before he whispered, \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a game for you, is it?\u201d Christian asked several nights later. His voice was low, but Simon glanced uneasily around nonetheless.</p><p>Drury Lane Theater was as crowded as a corpse bloated with maggots. He\u2019d procured a gilt-edged box on the second level for himself, Lucy, Rosalind, and Christian. The box was close enough to see the whites of the actors\u2019 eyes, high enough that any stray vegetables couldn\u2019t reach them, should the play turn sour. The rabble in the stalls below was relatively well behaved. The prostitutes working the floor kept their nipples covered\u2014mostly. The noise was low enough that he could actually hear David Garrick, playing a rather elderly Hamlet, recite his lines. Of course, it helped that the actor had lungs like a fishwife\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cSBLOOD,\u201d Garrick bawled, \u201cdo you think me easier played on than a PIPE?\u201d Spittle glittered in the stage lights.</p><p>Simon winced. He much preferred reading Shakespeare to attending it. This was assuming he had to consume the bard at all. He glanced at Lucy. She was enthralled, his angel, her eyes half-closed, her lips parted as she watched the play. Behind her, the crimson velvet curtains lining the box framed her head, making a foil for her pale profile and her dark hair. She was almost unbearably beautiful.</p><p>He looked away. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Christian scowled. \u201cYou know. The duels. Why are you killing these men?\u201d</p><p>Simon arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p><p>The younger man shook his head. \u201cAt first I thought it was honor of some kind, that they had insulted a lady close to you.\u201d His gaze skittered to Rosalind and away. \u201cI\u2019d heard rumors . . . Well, they were repeated everywhere a couple of years ago, before your brother died.\u201d</p><p>Simon waited.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I thought perhaps you wanted a reputation. The glory of having dueled and killed.\u201d</p><p>Simon repressed a snort. Glory. God, what a thought.</p><p>\u201cBut after James\u201d\u2014Christian looked at him, puzzled\u2014\u201cyou fought with such ferocity, such viciousness. It had to be personal. What did the man do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed my brother.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s jaw dropped open. \u201cEthan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Simon glanced at Rosalind. Although she was obviously less interested in the play than Lucy, her eyes were still on the stage. He turned back to Christian. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss this here.\u201d He frowned impatiently. Why should he bother explaining himself at all?</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re looking for another one.\u201d</p><p>Simon rested his chin in his open hand, half covering his mouth. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Christian shifted impatiently in his velvet and gilt chair.</p><p>Simon glanced at the stage. Hamlet was creeping up on his kneeling uncle. The Danish prince raised his sword, babbled verse, and then sheathed it again, another opportunity for vengeance lost. Simon sighed. He\u2019d always found this particular play tedious. Why didn\u2019t the prince just kill his uncle and have done?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, you know. I\u2019ve followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Simon\u2019s attention swung back to the man sitting beside him.</p><p>\u201cThe last couple of days,\u201d Christian said. \u201cTo the Devil\u2019s Playground and to other sordid places. You go in, don\u2019t drink, roam around the room, question the staff\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon interrupted this laundry list of activities. \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><p>Christian ignored him. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a big man, a titled aristocrat. Someone who gambles, but not as compulsively as James, otherwise you would\u2019ve found him already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Simon grit his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHow could all these men, men of standing and good family, have killed your brother?\u201d</p><p>Simon leaned forward until his face was inches from Christian\u2019s. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Lucy glance around. He didn\u2019t care. \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><p>Christian blinked rapidly. \u201cI\u2019m your friend. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d His words seemed to hang in the air, almost echoing.</p><p>On stage, Hamlet drove his sword through Polonius. The actress playing Gertrude cried shrilly, \u201cO, what a rash and bloody deed is this!\u201d In the next box someone shrieked with laughter.</p><p>\u201cAre you my true friend, Christian Fletcher?\u201d Simon whispered. \u201cDo you guard my back with a loyal eagle eye?\u201d</p><p>Christian looked down and then up again, his mouth grim. \u201cYes. I am your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you second me when I do find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can you keep doing it?\u201d The younger man\u2019s eyes were intent. He leaned forward, drawing Lucy\u2019s gaze again. \u201cHow can you keep killing men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how I\u2019m able.\u201d Simon looked away. James\u2019s open eyes, staring into nothing. \u201cThe only thing that matters is that it\u2019s done. That my brother is avenged. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . yes.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded and leaned back. He smiled for Lucy. \u201cEnjoying the play, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much, my lord.\u201d She wasn\u2019t fooled. Her gaze darted between him and Christian. Then she sighed and looked back to the stage.</p><p>Simon scanned the audience. Across from them, a lady in embroidered scarlet turned her lorgnette on him, posing self-consciously. He looked away. Below, a broad-shouldered gentleman pushed his way through the crowd, elbowing a wench. The woman shrieked and shoved back. The man turned and Simon leaned forward to catch sight of his profile. Another man rose to join the argument, and the first man turned aside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Simon relaxed. Not Walker.</p><p>He\u2019d spent the past few days since he\u2019d received the threatening letter searching everywhere for the last man in the group that had killed Ethan. Christian may have followed him to the gaming halls at night, but the younger man hadn\u2019t seen Simon during the day at the coffeehouses, at horse auctions, or roaming the tailor shops and other establishments for gentlemen. Walker was nowhere to be seen. And yet, he hadn\u2019t gone to ground at his estate in Yorkshire either. Simon had paid ears in that vicinity, and there\u2019d been no reports of Lord Walker. He could, of course, have fled to another county or even overseas, but Simon didn\u2019t think so. Walker\u2019s family was still in his town house.</p><p>On stage, an overlarge Ophelia sang her despair at the desertion of her lover. God, he hated this play. He shifted in his chair. If he could just get it over with. Duel Walker, kill him, put the man in his grave, and let his brother rest at last. Maybe then he could look Lucy in the eye without seeing accusation\u2014imaginary or real. Maybe then he could sleep without fear that he\u2019d wake to the destruction of all his hopes. Because he couldn\u2019t sleep now. He knew he woke Lucy at night with his movements, but there seemed no help for it. His dreams, both waking and sleeping, were filled with images of Lucy. Lucy in danger, or injured or\u2014God!\u2014dead. Lucy finding out his secrets and turning from him in disgust. Lucy leaving him. And when he had respite from those nightmares, there were the older ones to haunt him. Ethan imploring. Ethan needing. Ethan dying. He fingered the place where the Iddesleigh signet ring should have lain. He\u2019d lost it. Another failure.</p><p>The crowd erupted in shouts. Simon looked up and was just in time to see the final bloodbath that ended the play. Laertes\u2019s sword work was particularly egregious. Then the audience applauded\u2014and jeered.</p> <p>Simon got up to hold Lucy\u2019s cloak for her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked him under cover of the noise.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled for her. \u201cI hope you enjoyed the theater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I did.\u201d She squeezed his hand, a secret wifely touch that made the entire tedious evening worth it. \u201cThank you for bringing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d He lifted her palm to his lips. \u201cI shall take you to every one of the bard\u2019s plays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so extravagant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew round and liquid, and she seemed to search his face. Didn\u2019t she know the lengths he would go to for her?</p><p>\u201cI never know what to make of Hamlet,\u201d Christian said behind them.</p><p>Lucy glanced away. \u201cI adore Shakespeare. But Hamlet . . .\u201d She shivered. \u201cIt\u2019s so dark at the end. And I never think he fully realizes the hurt he\u2019s done poor Ophelia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat business when he jumps into the grave with Laertes.\u201d Rosalind shook her head. \u201cI think he felt the most pity for himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps men never do comprehend the wrongs they\u2019ve done to the women in their lives,\u201d Simon murmured.</p><p>Lucy touched her hand to his arm, and then they were moving with the crowd toward the doors. The cold air smacked him in the face as they made the entrance. Gentlemen stood on the wide theater steps, shouting as they ordered footmen to fetch their carriages. Everyone was leaving at once, and naturally there weren\u2019t enough runners to go around. Lucy shivered in the winter wind, her skirts whipping against her legs.</p><p>Simon frowned. She\u2019d catch a chill if she stayed outside much longer. \u201cStay here with the ladies,\u201d he told Christian. \u201cI\u2019ll fetch the carriage myself.\u201d</p><p>Christian nodded.</p><p>Simon shoved through the milling crowd, making slow progress. It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d reached the street that he remembered he shouldn\u2019t leave Lucy. His heart jumped painfully at the thought. He glanced back. Christian stood between Rosalind and Lucy at the top of the stairs. The younger man was saying something that made Lucy laugh. They looked fine. Still. Best to be cautious. Simon started back.</p><p>Which was when Lucy suddenly disappeared.</p><p>LUCY STARED AFTER SIMON as he made his way through the crowd in front of the theater. Something was bothering him, she could tell.</p><p>Rosalind shivered on the other side of Mr. Fletcher. \u201cOh, I do hate these crushes after the theater lets out.\u201d</p> <p>The young man smiled down at her. \u201cSimon will be back soon. He\u2019ll be faster than waiting for one of the footmen to get the carriage.\u201d</p><p>Around them the crowd surged and flowed like the sea. A lady bumped Lucy from behind and muttered an apology. Lucy nodded in reply, still staring after her husband. Simon had disappeared the last couple of nights and had returned late. When she tried to question him, he\u2019d joked, and if she questioned him more, he\u2019d made love to her. Urgently. Relentlessly. As if it was the last time every time.</p><p>And tonight during the play he\u2019d been muttering with Mr. Fletcher. She hadn\u2019t caught the words, but his face had been grim. Why wouldn\u2019t he confide in her? Surely that was part of marriage, for the wife to be a helpmeet to her husband and take some of his cares onto her own shoulders. To provide relief from his worries. She thought when they\u2019d married that she and Simon would become closer. That they would attain that state of harmony that she\u2019d glimpsed in some older couples. Instead they seemed to be growing ever further apart, and she wasn\u2019t sure what to do. How to bridge the gap, or was it even bridgeable? Perhaps her marriage ideal was merely the naive dream of a maiden. Perhaps this distance between them was the reality of marriage.</p><p>Mr. Fletcher leaned down. \u201cShould have tipped Simon better.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled at his silly jest. She turned to reply and felt a shove from her right. She fell to her knees on the hard marble steps, her palms stinging even through the leather of her kid gloves. Someone grabbed her hair and pulled her head back painfully. Shouts. She couldn\u2019t see. Her vision was composed of skirts and the dirty marble beneath her palms. A kick landed on her ribs. She gasped and then her hair was released. Mr. Fletcher was grappling with another man directly over her. She shielded her head as best she could, fearful of being trampled or worse. Rosalind screamed. Another blow to Lucy\u2019s bottom and a weight shoved against her back.</p><p>Then Simon was there. She could hear his furious shouts even from beneath the pile. The weight left her back, and he pulled her up.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d His face looked as pale as death.</p><p>She tried to nod, but he was lifting her into his arms, carrying her down the steps.</p><p>\u201cDid you see where he went?\u201d Mr. Fletcher panted beside them.</p><p>\u201cSimon, he meant to kill her!\u201d Rosalind sounded shocked.</p><p>Lucy was shivering, her teeth chattering together uncontrollably. Someone had tried to kill her. She\u2019d just been standing on the theater steps and someone had tried to kill her. She clutched at Simon\u2019s shoulders, trying to still the violent shaking of her hands.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Simon said grimly. His hands flexed against her back and legs. \u201cChristian, will you escort Rosalind home? I must take Lucy to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The young man nodded, his freckles standing out starkly in his face. \u201cWhatever I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Simon stared intently at the younger man. \u201cAnd, Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Simon spoke low. \u201cYou saved her life.\u201d</p><p>Lucy watched over Simon\u2019s shoulder as Mr. Fletcher\u2019s eyes widened, and a shy smile lit his face before he turned away with Rosalind. She wondered if Simon knew how much the younger man admired him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a doctor,\u201d she tried to protest. Her voice wheezed, which certainly didn\u2019t help her case.</p><p>Simon ignored her. He strode down the steps, shouldering through the mass of people with impatient arrogance. The crowd thinned when they reached the street.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>He quickened his pace.</p><p>\u201cSimon, you can put me down now. I can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you needn\u2019t carry me.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, and she saw to her horror that his eyes were shining. \u201cYes, I do need.\u201d</p><p>She subsided then. He kept up the pace across several streets until they reached the carriage. Simon bundled her inside and rapped on the roof. The carriage jolted forward.</p><p>He held her across his lap and undid her hat. \u201cShould\u2019ve had Christian direct the doctor to the town house.\u201d He swept off her cloak. \u201cI\u2019ll have to summon him when we get back.\u201d He turned her just enough to reach her back and began unbuttoning her bodice.</p><p>Surely he didn\u2019t mean to undress her in a moving carriage? But his face was so serious, so grave, that she asked the question gently. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding where you\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but simply continued working on the buttons. He drew the dress off her shoulders, opened her stays, then stilled, looking at her side. Lucy followed his eyes. A thin line of blood stained her chemise just beside her breast. There was a corresponding tear in the fabric of her dress. Gently, Simon loosened the chemise\u2019s tie and pulled it away. A cut lay underneath. Now that she saw it, Lucy suddenly felt the burn. Somehow in all the confusion, she hadn\u2019t noticed the pain before. She\u2019d been stabbed, but not deeply.</p><p>\u201cHe nearly had you.\u201d Simon traced underneath the cut. \u201cA few inches farther in and he\u2019d have hit your heart.\u201d His voice was calm, but Lucy didn\u2019t like the way his nostrils had flared, making white dents beside his nose.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf his aim hadn\u2019t been off . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Christian hadn\u2019t been there . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>His eyes finally met hers, and she saw that the tears had overwhelmed him. Two trailed unchecked down his cheek. He didn\u2019t seem to be aware of them. \u201cYes, it is. It\u2019s my fault. I nearly got you killed tonight.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d supposed her assailant to be some kind of pickpocket or other thief. Perhaps a madman. But Simon was implying that the attacker had been after her specifically. That he\u2019d wanted to kill her. Simon smoothed his thumb over her lips and tenderly kissed her. Even as she accepted his tongue into her mouth and tasted the salt of his tears, she realized that he hadn\u2019t answered her question. And that scared her more than anything else had that night.</p><p>HE KNEW HE SHOULDN\u2019T.</p><p>Even as he swept Lucy into his arms and carried her into the house, Simon knew he shouldn\u2019t. He shouldered aside Newton, who exclaimed in concern, and bore her up the stairs like a Roman plundering a Sabine maiden. He\u2019d pulled Lucy\u2019s chemise and gown up without fully hooking the back and had thrown her wrap about her to carry her in. She\u2019d convinced him in the carriage that she really didn\u2019t need a physician. The cut over her ribs was the only wound, besides bruising, he could find. Nevertheless, someone had tried to kill her. She was shaken and hurt. Only a cad would demand the rights of a husband now.</p><p>Ergo, he was a cad.</p><p>Simon kicked open the door to his bedroom, bore her across the silver and black carpet, and deposited her on the bed. She lay on his cobalt-blue cover like an offering. Her hair had loosened and was spread over the silk.</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d</p><p>She gazed up at him with calm topaz eyes as he threw off his coat. \u201cWe need to discuss what happened.\u201d</p><p>He toed off his shoes and nearly ripped the buttons from his waistcoat. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry. I need you too much right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes what I feel not matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment?\u201d He tore off his shirt. \u201cFrankly, no.\u201d</p><p>God, couldn\u2019t he stop talking? He seemed to have completely lost the art of prevarication. All his finesse, all his elegant words were gone, and what remained was primitive and essential. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He advanced to the bed, but with a great act of self-control didn\u2019t touch her. \u201cIf you want me to leave, I will.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his for a long minute during which he died several times over, and his cock reached monstrous proportions. Then, without speaking, she pulled open the ribbon on her chemise. That was all he needed. He fell on her like a starving man at the sight of a Yorkshire pudding. But despite his urgency, he was careful. Though his hands shook, he pulled her dress from her shoulders slowly. Tenderly.</p><p>\u201cLift,\u201d he instructed her, and somehow his voice was hushed.</p><p>She raised her hips, and he threw the garment on the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how much that cost?\u201d He didn\u2019t even care that she sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can guess.\u201d He worked at her slippers and stockings. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you a hundred more, a thousand, in every color of rose. Have I told you how much I admire you in rose?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI do. Of course, I admire you even more in nothing. Perhaps I\u2019ll let you wear nothing at all. That would solve the expensive dress problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I object to such a chilly law?\u201d Her brows arched dangerously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your husband.\u201d He took the chemise off her at last, revealing her white breasts. For a moment his eyes caught on the shallow cut on her side, and he felt fear again chill his soul. Then his nostrils flared at the sight of her nude. He wasn\u2019t altogether successful in keeping the possession out of his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ve promised to obey me in all things. For instance, if I bid you kiss me, you must.\u201d</p><p>He bent and brushed his lips across her mouth. She responded dutifully, her lips moving under his erotically. He was conscious all the time of her breasts, white and bare and undefended, beneath him. His lust rose, shaking his muscles, but he reined it in. The last thing he needed was for her to see how out of control he really was. How very base he really was.</p><p>\u201cI bid you open.\u201d His voice was nearly hoarse.</p><p>She parted her lips and he at least had that\u2014the warm, moist hollow of her mouth to feast on. His arms suddenly trembled. He drew back and closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He opened his eyes and tried to smile to hide the demons inside. \u201cI need you very badly.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, she didn\u2019t smile. Instead she looked at him with solemn golden eyes. \u201cThen take me.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled at her simple, explicit offer. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. You\u2019ve\u201d\u2014he looked away, unable to meet her gaze\u2014\u201cbeen hurt too much already tonight.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then she spoke slowly and clearly. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Ah, such trust. It was frightening. If only he could be as confident. He rolled to his back. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Those intelligent eyebrows went up again. \u201cAren\u2019t you wearing too much?\u201d</p><p>His breeches. \u201cI\u2019ll take them off later.\u201d Or merely unbutton them.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d</p> <p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her elbow beside him, and her breasts swung with the movement. His cock jumped. Delicately she began unbuttoning him. He felt each small pull of her fingers. He closed his eyes and tried to think of snow. Frost. Sleet. Ice.</p><p>A soft sigh.</p><p>His eyes popped open. She was leaning over him, her white breasts nearly incandescent in the candlelight. Her gaze was fixed on his ruddy-tipped penis, standing foolishly erect from his breeches. It was the most erotic vision he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d ever let me see him.\u201d She didn\u2019t move her eyes from his groin.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d He nearly squeaked on the last syllable as she touched her forefinger to his crown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him, yes, but never seen him. He\u2019s been very shy, this fellow.\u201d She ran her finger around the rim.</p><p>He nearly came off the bed. She should be shocked, she\u2019d been a naive, country miss. Instead . . .</p><p>\u201cAnd look, here are his companions.\u201d She took his balls into her small palm.</p><p>God\u2019s blood. She was going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cLift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He blinked at her dazedly.</p><p>\u201cLift your hips so I may undress you,\u201d his budding houri said.</p><p>What could he do but obey? She slid off his breeches and made him as naked as she.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Thankfully his voice had returned. He couldn\u2019t stand much more of this.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI bid you come here.\u201d He held out his arms and tried not to groan when the soft inside of her thigh brushed against his erection.</p><p>She climbed over him and carefully sat. His cock bobbed in front of her, touching her belly with each pulse. He wanted nothing more than to bury himself in her, but he had to go slowly.</p><p>\u201cI bid you offer your breasts to me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Good. At least he wasn\u2019t the only one affected. She cupped herself, hesitated, then bent lower. Aphrodite herself couldn\u2019t have been more alluring. He watched her face as he sucked a pink nipple into his mouth. She closed her eyes, her mouth helplessly parted. Her mons was pressed against his cock, which was throbbing between them. She trembled and that darkness within him roared with triumph.</p><p>He let go of the nipple. \u201cMount me.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The word was more an order than a plea, but he was past caring. He needed her pussy around him.</p><p>She raised herself. He steadied her with one hand, held his cock with the other, and she slowly sank onto him.</p><p>\u201cHold yourself open for me,\u201d he murmured. Cad. It made the way easier, but he also had a wonderful view of her coral wetness.</p><p>She gasped and fumbled between their bodies with her fingers. Poor angel. Led into corruption by a selfish devil who cared only for his prick. Ahh. He was half in now, the way tight and warm and soft. He took her hands away, put them on his chest, and used his own fingers to part her folds. To hold her as he worked his way into her tight passage. Paradise. He almost smiled. This was as close as he would ever be to heaven. He knew the thought was blasphemy itself, and he didn\u2019t care. He was making love to his angel. Tomorrow the world might end, but right now he was balls-deep in wet woman. His wet woman.</p><p>He thrust and she cried out.</p><p>He felt a grin, not a nice one, split his face. He looked down and watched his reddened skin slide into her flesh. Lifted her up and pulled almost out. Saw the glistening moisture of her cunny coating his cock. And slammed back into her. Thrusting into her. Filling her. Claiming her. My woman. Always. Never to leave. Stay with me.</p><p>Always.</p><p>She shook her head wildly. He pressed his fingers against her mound to feel it and to find that special pearl. She moaned, but he didn\u2019t relent. He filled her with cock and diddled her clitoris with his thumb, and he knew she couldn\u2019t hold out. The walls of her sheath clenched and she came, raining her sweet pleasure on his prick. He buried himself in her until his balls met her bottom. His body convulsed and he felt the pulse of his seed filling her.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Oh, God!</p><p>Lucy woke with a start, her breath coming in gasps in the dark of the bedroom. The sheets clung to the cold sweat on her skin like a shroud. She froze and tried to calm her breathing, lying as still as a rabbit on sighting the snake. The dream had been vivid. Bloody. But it was already fading with her consciousness. All she recalled was the fear\u2014and the feeling of hopelessness. She\u2019d been screaming in the dream when she\u2019d woken, and she\u2019d been surprised that the sound was as phantom as the images.</p><p>Finally she moved, her muscles aching from being held in tension too long. She reached out to find Simon, to reassure herself that there was life even in the depths of night and nightmare.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d gotten up to use the necessary? \u201cSimon?\u201d</p><p>No answer. She listened to the silence with the irrational fear that only came after midnight: that all life had died. That she was alone in a dead house.</p><p>Lucy shook herself and rose, wincing a bit as the cut on her side pulled. Her bare toes touched the cold carpet, and she patted her hand in the air, searching for a candle on the bedside table before realizing she\u2019d gone to sleep in Simon\u2019s room. The table was on the other side of the bed. She held the bed curtains for a guide and felt with her feet as she rounded the bed. All she remembered of the room from last night was an impression of darkness and the severe colors, an almost black-blue and silver, and that his bed was even bigger than her own. That had amused her.</p><p>She held out a hand blindly, felt a book and then the candle. There were still embers glowing in the fireplace, and she crossed to light the candle. The feeble flame hardly revealed the whole of Simon\u2019s room, but she already knew he wasn\u2019t here. She put on her gown from the theater and pulled a wrap over it to hide the fact that she couldn\u2019t do up the back on her own. Then she shoved her bare feet into slippers.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he\u2019d disappeared. He\u2019d made a habit of it in the last week, leaving in the evening, only to reappear in the early hours of morning. His nightly wandering seemed to have become more common in the last few days. Sometimes he came to her chamber looking so very weary and smelling of smoke and drink. But he\u2019d never left her bed before, not after making love to her, not after holding her until they both gave in to sleep. And the way he\u2019d made love to her only hours before\u2014so intensely, so desperately\u2014as if he\u2019d never have the opportunity again. She\u2019d actually been afraid at certain points. Not that he\u2019d hurt her, but that she\u2019d lose a part of herself in him.</p><p>Lucy shivered.</p><p>Their rooms were on the third floor. She checked her bedroom and sitting room, then descended the stairs. The library was empty. She held her candle high and saw only long, ghostly shadows thrown over the rows of book bindings. A window rattled in the wind from without. She reentered the hallway and debated. The morning room? Highly unlikely, he\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cMay I help you, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Newton\u2019s dirgelike tones behind her made Lucy shriek. Her candle went tumbling to the floor, hot wax burning her instep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most sorry, my lady.\u201d Newton bent and retrieved her candle and lit it with his own.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Lucy accepted the light and held it higher so she could see the butler.</p><p>Newton had obviously just come from bed. A nightcap covered his bald pate, and an old coat was thrown over his nightshirt, pulled taut across his small, round belly. She looked down. He wore rather fancy, curl-toed Turkish slippers on his feet. Lucy rubbed one bare foot over the other and wished she\u2019d thought of stockings.</p><p>\u201cMay I assist you, my lady?\u201d Newton asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Lord Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>The butler averted his eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Lucy raised her eyebrows, surprised he\u2019d answered with the truth. She studied the butler. If Simon\u2019s absence was because of a woman, she was sure Newton would\u2019ve made excuses for his master. But he hadn\u2019t. She felt her shoulders relax from a tension she hadn\u2019t even known was there.</p><p>Newton cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lord Iddesleigh will return before morning, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he always does, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Lucy muttered.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to warm you some milk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Lucy walked to the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Lucy put her foot on the first tread and held her breath. From behind her, Newton\u2019s footsteps receded and a door closed. She waited a moment more, then turned. Quietly she tiptoed back to Simon\u2019s study.</p><p>This room was smaller than the library but more richly appointed. It was dominated by his massive baroque desk, a recklessly beautiful piece of furniture, picked out in gilt and curlicues. She would\u2019ve laughed at any other man owning such a piece, but it suited Simon perfectly. There was an arrangement of wingback chairs before the fireplace, and two bookcases flanked the desk, easily accessible to someone sitting at it. Many of the books were on the subject of roses. Simon had shown her this room only the other day, and she\u2019d been fascinated by the detailed hand-colored illustrations in the big tomes. Each rose an ideal of the flower, each part identified and labeled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So orderly a world.</p><p>Lucy settled herself into one of the wing chairs before the fireplace. With the study door open, she had a view into the hallway and all that happened there. Simon would have to pass her by when he came home. She intended to quiz him on his nocturnal ramblings when he did.</p><p>APHRODITE\u2019S GROTTO WAS A DEN of howling wolves tonight.</p><p>Simon advanced into the main hall of the brothel and looked around. He hadn\u2019t set foot in here since before he\u2019d met Lucy, but the place hadn\u2019t changed. Half-dressed whores paraded their wares, enticing men, some barely old enough to shave, some toothless with age. Minor royalty rubbed shoulders with upstart merchants and foreign dignitaries. Aphrodite didn\u2019t care. As long as the color of the money was gold. In fact, it was rumored that she had just as many female customers as male. Perhaps she charged them both, Simon thought cynically. He looked around for the madam but didn\u2019t see her distinctive gold mask. Just as well. Aphrodite frowned on violence in her house, and that was exactly what he was intent on doing.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d Christian whispered beside him.</p><p>He\u2019d picked up the younger man two\u2014no, three\u2014houses before. Christian still looked fresh-faced after the theater earlier in the evening, the fight outside it, and the three increasingly seedy gambling places they\u2019d visited before this. Simon very much feared that he himself resembled a newly unearthed corpse.</p><p>Damn youth anyway. \u201cDepends.\u201d He started up the stairs, dodging the race going on there.</p><p>Female jockeys wearing only brief corsets and masks rode bare-chested steeds. Simon winced as a jockey drew blood with her quirt. Although, judging by the bulge in the trousers of her mount, he didn\u2019t mind at all.</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d Christian watched wide-eyed as the winning pair galloped up and down the upper hall. The jockey was bare-breasted and bouncing exuberantly.</p> <p>\u201cOn your definition of heaven and hell, I suppose,\u201d Simon said.</p><p>His eyes felt as if a handful of sand were under each lid, his head ached, and he was tired. So very tired.</p><p>He kicked in the first door.</p><p>Christian exclaimed something behind him, but he ignored it. The occupants, two girls and a red-headed gentleman, didn\u2019t even notice the intrusion. He didn\u2019t bother to apologize, just shut the door and moved on to the next. He didn\u2019t have much hope of finding Walker. According to his sources, Walker had never patronized Aphrodite\u2019s Grotto before. But Simon was getting desperate. He needed to find Walker and get this over with. He needed to make Lucy safe again.</p><p>Another door. Shrieks from within\u2014two women this time\u2014and he closed it. Walker was married with a mistress, but he liked the bawdy houses. If Simon visited every single brothel in London, eventually he\u2019d find him, or so he hoped.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we get thrown out doing this?\u201d Christian asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Kick. His knee was beginning to hurt. \u201cBut hopefully not before I find my quarry.\u201d</p><p>He was at the end of the hall now, at the last door, in fact, and Christian was right. It was only a matter of time before the house thugs arrived. Kick.</p><p>He nearly turned away, but he looked again.</p><p>The man on the bed had his cock buried in a saffron-haired wench on her knees. She was naked, save a demi-mask, and had her eyes closed. Her partner hadn\u2019t noticed their interruption. Not that it mattered. He was short and swarthy and black haired. No, it was the second man, the one almost in the shadows observing the show, that made the squawk. And a good thing, too, since Simon had almost overlooked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Good evening, Lord Walker.\u201d Simon advanced and made a bow. \u201cLady Walker.\u201d</p><p>The man on the bed started and swung his head around, although his hips still moved instinctively. The woman remained oblivious.</p><p>\u201cIddesleigh, you bastard, what . . . ?\u201d Walker lurched to his feet, his now-limp prick still hanging from his breeches. \u201cThat\u2019s not my wife!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d Simon cocked his head, examining the woman. \u201cBut she looks like Lady Walker. Particularly that mark there.\u201d He pointed with his stick at a birthmark high on her hip.</p><p>The man humping her opened his eyes wide. \u201cThis \u2019ere your wife, guvnor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I\u2019ve known your fair lady intimately for quite some time, Walker,\u201d Simon drawled. \u201cAnd I\u2019m quite certain this is she.\u201d</p><p>The big man threw back his head suddenly and laughed, although it sounded a bit weak. \u201cI know your game. You\u2019re not going to trick me into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever had quality before,\u201d the stud said from atop the woman. He increased his pace, possibly in appreciation.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy acquaintance with Lady Walker goes back many years.\u201d Simon leaned on his stick and smiled. \u201cBefore the birth of your first child\u2014your heir, I believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The black-haired man gave a yell and bucked his hips into the woman, shuddering as he obviously deposited a load of sperm into her. He sighed and fell off her, revealing a cock that, even half-deflated, was of equine proportions.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Christian said.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d Simon concurred.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did he get that thing in her?\u201d the younger man muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked,\u201d Simon said as if instructing a pupil. \u201cLady Walker is quite talented in that regard.\u201d</p><p>Walker gave a roar and charged across the room. Simon tensed, the blood singing in his veins. Maybe he could finish this tonight.</p><p>\u201cSee, here,\u201d a voice exclaimed from the door at the same time.</p><p>The house bullies had arrived. He stepped aside and Walker ran into their waiting arms. The big man struggled ineffectually in their grasp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Iddesleigh!\u201d Walker panted.</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d Simon drawled. God, he was tired to the bone. \u201cAt dawn, then?\u201d</p><p>The man merely growled.</p><p>The woman on the bed chose that moment to roll over. \u201cWould you like a go?\u201d she asked no one in particular.</p><p>Simon smiled and led Christian away. They passed a new race on the stairs. The male mounts this time had actual bits in their mouths. One man had blood running down his chin and a cock-stand in his breeches.</p><p>He\u2019d have to bathe before he returned to Lucy. He felt like he\u2019d rolled in manure.</p><p>Christian waited until they made the front steps before he asked, \u201cWas that really Lady Walker?\u201d</p><p>Simon caught himself mid-yawn. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea.\u201d</p><p>WHEN LUCY WOKE AGAIN, it was to the sound of Simon entering the study. The room was that gray shade that foretold the dawn of a new day. Simon walked in, carrying a candle. He set it on the corner of his desk and, still standing, pulled out a sheet of paper and began writing.</p><p>He never looked up.</p><p>At the far side of the room, partially hidden by the arms of the wing chair and in shadows, she must\u2019ve been nearly invisible to him. She had meant to accost him on his return, to demand answers. But now she merely studied him, her hands curled beneath her chin. He looked tired, her husband, as if he hadn\u2019t slept in years. He wore his clothes from the night before: a deep blue coat and breeches with a silver waistcoat, creased and stained now. His wig had lost some of its powder and looked dingy. Shocking, because she\u2019d never seen him\u2014at least in London\u2014other than sartorially correct. Deep lines bracketed his mouth, his eyes were red-rimmed, and his lips had thinned, as if he pressed them together to keep them from trembling. He finished whatever he was writing, dusted it with sand, and straightened the paper on the desk. In doing so, he knocked the pen to the floor. He cursed and bent slowly like an old man to pick it up, placed it carefully on the desk, and sighed.</p><p>Then he left the room.</p><p>Lucy waited several minutes before rising, listening to his footfalls on the stairs. She padded over to the desk to see what he\u2019d written. It was still too dark to read. She took the note to the window, parted the curtains, and angled the paper to read the still-damp writing. The dawn was just breaking, but she could make out the first lines:</p><p>In the event of my death, all my worldly possessions . . .</p><p>It was Simon\u2019s will. He was leaving his estate to her. Lucy stared at it a moment longer, then replaced the paper on the desk. From the hallway came the sounds of her husband descending the stairs. She moved to stand beside the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take my horse,\u201d Simon was saying, apparently to Newton. \u201cTell the coachman I won\u2019t have need of him anymore tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The front door closed.</p><p>And suddenly Lucy felt a wave of anger. He hadn\u2019t even tried to wake her, else he would\u2019ve noticed her absence from his bed. She strode into the hall, her skirts swishing about her bare ankles. \u201cNewton, wait.\u201d</p><p>The butler, his back to her, started and whirled. \u201cM-my lady, I hadn\u2019t realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waved his apology aside and came straight to the point. \u201cDo you know where he\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ll simply follow him.\u201d</p><p>Lucy cautiously opened the front door. Simon\u2019s carriage was still sitting out front, the coachman almost asleep on the box. A stable hand was yawning as he returned to the mews.</p><p>And Simon was riding away.</p><p>Lucy closed the door, ignoring Newton\u2019s hissed exclamations behind her, and ran down the steps, shivering in the morning chill. \u201cMr. Coachman.\u201d</p><p>The coachman blinked as if he\u2019d never seen his mistress with her hair undone, as indeed he hadn\u2019t. \u201cMy lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease follow Lord Iddesleigh without letting him know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, my lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Lucy didn\u2019t wait for a footman to place the step but scrambled into the carriage. She stuck her head back out again. \u201cAnd don\u2019t lose him.\u201d</p><p>The carriage lurched forward.</p><p>Lucy sat back and pulled a rug over herself. It was bitterly cold. Scandalous of her to be driving about London not fully dressed and her hair down, but she couldn\u2019t let modesty keep her from confronting Simon. He hadn\u2019t had any decent sleep for days, and he wasn\u2019t that long recovered from the beating. How dare he continue to risk his life and not think she should know about it? Cut her off, in fact, from that part of himself. Did he think she was a doll to be taken out and played with and then packed away again when he had other matters to see to? Well, it was long past time that she discuss with him exactly what she considered came under the duties of a wife. Her husband\u2019s health, for one thing. Not keeping secrets from her, for another. Lucy harrumphed and folded her arms across her chest.</p><p>The December sun had finally dawned, but the light was poor and didn\u2019t seem to affect the cold at all. They turned in to the park, the cobblestones changing to gravel beneath the carriage\u2019s wheels. A mist hung eerily about the ground, shrouding the trunks of trees. From the small carriage window, Lucy couldn\u2019t see any movement and had to trust that the coachman was still following Simon.</p><p>They rolled to a halt.</p><p>A footman opened the door and peered in at her. \u201cJohn Coachman says if he gets any closer, his lordship will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>With the man\u2019s help, Lucy alighted and turned to where he pointed. About a hundred yards away, Simon and another man faced each other like figures in a pantomime. At this distance, she could only tell it was Simon from the way he moved. Her heart seemed to stop dead. Dear Lord, they were ready to begin. She wasn\u2019t in time to persuade Simon to stop this terrible rite.</p><p>\u201cWait for me here,\u201d she ordered the menservants, and walked toward the scene.</p><p>There were six men in all\u2014four others stood apart from the duelists, but none looked in her direction or even seemed to notice her at all. They were too involved in this masculine game of death. Simon had removed his coat and waistcoat, as had his opponent, a man Lucy had never seen before. Their white shirtsleeves were almost ghostly in the gray morning mist. They must be cold, but neither man shivered. Instead Simon stood still, while the other man swooshed his sword about, perhaps in practice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy stopped maybe twenty yards away in the shelter of some bushes. Her bare feet were already frozen.</p><p>Simon\u2019s adversary was a very big man, taller than him, with greater breadth of shoulder. His face was ruddy against his white wig. In contrast, Simon\u2019s face was pale as death, the weariness she\u2019d noticed at the house more pronounced in daylight, even at this distance. Both men stood still now. They bent their legs, raised their swords, and paused like a tableau.</p><p>Lucy opened her mouth.</p><p>Someone shouted. She flinched. Simon and the big man lunged together. Violence sang in the speed of their thrusts, in the awful sneers on their faces. The clatter of their swords rang in the still air. The big man advanced, his sword stabbing, but Simon sprang away, parrying the thrusts. How could he move that fast when he was so tired? Could he keep it up? Lucy wanted to run forward, to shout at the combatants, Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! But she knew that her mere appearance might be enough to startle Simon into dropping his guard and getting killed.</p> <p>The big man grunted and attacked low. Simon stumbled back and repelled the other man\u2019s blade with his own.</p><p>\u201cBlood!\u201d someone cried.</p><p>And only then did Lucy notice the stain on her husband\u2019s middle. Oh, God. She didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d bitten her lip until she tasted copper. He still moved. Surely if he\u2019d been run through he\u2019d fall? But he backed instead, his arm continuing to work as the other man herded him. She felt bile rise in her throat. Dear Lord, please don\u2019t let him die.</p><p>\u201cThrow down your swords!\u201d another man cried.</p><p>Lucy looked and realized one of the men was young Mr. Fletcher. The other three men shouted and gesticulated at the combatants, trying to end the duel, but Mr. Fletcher merely stood, an odd smile on his face. How many of these pointless battles had he attended? How many men had he witnessed her husband kill?</p> <p>Lucy suddenly hated his fresh, open face.</p><p>The bloody stain at Simon\u2019s middle spread. He looked like he wore a scarlet sash about his waist now. How much blood was he losing? The big man grinned and swung his sword with even greater speed and force. Simon was lagging. He turned away the other man\u2019s blade again and again. Then he stumbled and almost lost his footing. Another stain appeared on his shirt, this one above the wrist of the hand that held his sword.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn.\u201d She heard his voice faintly. It sounded so weak, so very weary to her ears.</p><p>Lucy closed her eyes and felt tears leak beneath them. She rocked her body to contain the sobs. Must not make a noise. Must not distract Simon. Another shout. She heard Simon\u2019s husky voice swearing. She almost didn\u2019t open her eyes. But she did. He was on his knees, like a sacrifice to a vengeful god.</p><p>Oh, my sweet Lord.</p><p>The other man wore a look of grotesque triumph on his face. He lunged, his sword flashing, to stab Simon. To kill her husband. No, please, no. Lucy ran forward as if in a dream, not making a sound. She knew she\u2019d never get to them in time.</p> <p>Simon raised his sword at the very last second and impaled the other man through the right eye.</p><p>Lucy bent and vomited, hot bile splattering her bare toes. The big man screamed. Awful, high shrieks that sounded like nothing she\u2019d ever heard before in her life. She heaved again. The other men shouted words she couldn\u2019t comprehend. She looked up. Someone had removed the sword from where the big man\u2019s right eye had been. Black stuff dripped down his cheek. He lay on the ground moaning, his wig fallen from his shaved head. A man with a physician\u2019s black bag was bent over the wounded man, but he merely shook his head.</p><p>Simon\u2019s opponent was dying.</p><p>She choked and heaved once more, the taste of acid on her tongue. Only a yellow thread emerged from her sore throat.</p><p>\u201cIddesleigh,\u201d the dying man gasped.</p><p>Simon had risen, although he seemed to be trembling. Blood was splashed on his breeches. Mr. Fletcher was working at his shirt, trying to bandage him, his face averted from the man on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Walker?\u201d Simon asked.</p><p>\u201cAnother.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband suddenly straightened and pushed Mr. Fletcher away. Simon\u2019s face sharpened, the lines carving ditches into his cheeks. In one stride he stood over the fallen man. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother.\u201d The big man\u2019s body shook.</p><p>Simon dropped to his knees beside him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mouth moved before sound emerged. \u201cFletcher.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fletcher swung around, confusion on his face.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t take his gaze from the dying man. \u201cFletcher is too young. You can\u2019t trick me that easily.\u201d</p><p>Walker smiled, his lips coated with the gore from his destroyed eye. \u201cFletcher\u2019s\u2014\u201d A convulsion of coughing cut off his words.</p><p>Simon frowned. \u201cBring some water.\u201d</p><p>One of the other men proffered a metal bottle. \u201cWhiskey.\u201d</p><p>Simon nodded and took it. He held the flask to his enemy\u2019s lips and the man gulped. Walker sighed. His eyes closed.</p><p>Simon shook him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>The fallen man was still. Was he already dead? Lucy began to whisper a prayer for his soul.</p><p>Simon swore and slapped his face. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Lucy gasped.</p><p>Walker half opened his eyes. \u201cFaa-therrr,\u201d he slurred.</p><p>Simon stood and looked at Christian. The man on the ground sighed again, the breath rattling from his throat.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t even glance down. \u201cYour father? He\u2019s Sir Rupert Fletcher, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Christian shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not taking the word of a man you killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied!\u201d</p><p>Simon simply looked at the younger man. \u201cDid your father help kill my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Christian threw up his hands. \u201cNo! You\u2019re unreasonable. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d He strode away.</p><p>Simon stared after him.</p><p>The other men had moved off.</p><p>Lucy wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and stepped forward. \u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>Her husband turned and met her eyes across the body of the man he\u2019d just killed.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Jesus God.</p><p>Lucy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Simon couldn\u2019t help it; the words came out a hiss.</p><p>Lucy here, her hair undone, her face ghastly white. She clutched her cloak to herself, shoulders hunched, huddling, the fingers under her chin bluish with cold.</p><p>She looked as if she\u2019d seen a horror.</p><p>He glanced down. Walker\u2019s body lay at his feet like a bloody prize. There was a gaping hole where his eye had been, and his mouth sagged open, life no longer holding it shut. The doctor and seconds had backed away as if they were afraid to deal with the corpse while its killer still stood over it. Jesus God.</p><p>She had seen a horror.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him fight for his life, seen him kill a man by running him through the eye, seen the blood spurt. He was covered in gore, his own and the other man\u2019s. Jesus God. No wonder she looked at him like he was a monster. He was. He could hide it no longer. He had nowhere to turn. He\u2019d never wanted her to see this. Never wanted her to know he\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he shouted, to make her back down, to drown out the chant in his mind.</p><p>She stood firm, his angel, even in the face of a screaming, bloodied madman. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Raised his hand, still clutching the sword. There were wet, reddish stains on the blade. \u201cWhat have I . . .\u201d He laughed.</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>His throat was raw, aching with tears, but he laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve avenged my brother.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at Walker\u2019s ruined face. Shuddered. \u201cHow many men have you killed for your brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d He closed his eyes, but he still saw their faces against his eyelids. \u201cI thought four was all. I thought I was done, but I\u2019m told there is a fifth.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he continued. \u201cThere will be another.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together, whether to hold back a sob or to contain her revulsion, he did not know. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this, Simon.\u201d</p><p>He pretended stupidity, though he wanted to sob. \u201cCan\u2019t? I\u2019ve already done it, Lucy. I\u2019m still doing it.\u201d He spread his arms wide. \u201cWho is there to stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can stop yourself.\u201d Her voice was low.</p><p>His arms dropped. \u201cBut I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will destroy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am already destroyed.\u201d And he knew, deep, deep in his blackened soul that he spoke the truth.</p><p>\u201cVengeance is for the Lord.\u201d</p><p>So calm. So sure.</p><p>He sheathed his sword, still bloody. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf vengeance is for the Lord, then why does England have courts of law? Why do we hang murderers every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a court of law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cA court of law wouldn\u2019t touch them.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as if weary. \u201cSimon, you can\u2019t just take it upon yourself to kill men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey murdered Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother, Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have me sit back and let them savor their kill?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Her eyes snapped open, and her voice held a hysterical edge. \u201cDo I even know who you are?\u201d</p><p>He stepped over Walker\u2019s battered corpse and grabbed her by the shoulders, leaned down so that his no-doubt foul breath washed over her face. \u201cI am your husband, my lady.\u201d</p><p>She turned her face away from him.</p><p>He shook her. \u201cThe one you promised to obey always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you said you\u2019d cleave to, forsaking all others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one you make love to at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can live with you anymore.\u201d The words were a whisper, but they rang in his head like a death knell.</p><p>Overwhelming fear froze his gut. He jerked her body tight against his own and ground his mouth down on hers. He tasted blood\u2014either hers or his, it didn\u2019t matter and he didn\u2019t care. He would not\u2014could not\u2014let her go. Simon raised his head and stared her in the eye. \u201cThen it\u2019s too bad you no longer have a choice.\u201d</p><p>Her hand trembled as she wiped a smear of blood from her mouth. He wanted to do it for her, wanted to say he was sorry. But she\u2019d probably bite his fingers right now, and the words wouldn\u2019t come anyway. So he simply watched her. She pulled her soiled cloak together and turned and walked away. He watched as she made her way across the green. She climbed into the carriage and drove off.</p><p>Only then did he pick up his coat and mount his horse. The London streets had filled with people going about their business. Costermongers with carts, urchins on foot, lords and ladies in carriages and riding horses, shopkeepers and whores. A mass of breathing beings starting a new day.</p><p>But Simon rode apart.</p><p>Death had taken him into the company of the damned, and his bond with the rest of humanity was broken.</p><p>THE STUDY DOOR SLAMMED AGAINST THE WALL.</p><p>Sir Rupert looked up to see his son standing in the doorway, pale, disheveled, and his face gleaming with sweat. He started to rise from his desk.</p><p>\u201cDid you do it?\u201d In contrast to his appearance, Christian\u2019s voice was low, almost calm.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you kill Ethan Iddesleigh?\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert sat back down. If he could, he would\u2019ve lied; he made no bones about it. He\u2019d found that deception was often the best way. More often than not, people wanted to be lied to; they didn\u2019t like the truth. How else to explain why they fell for lies so quickly? But his son\u2019s face showed that he already knew the truth. His question was rhetorical. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut the door,\u201d Sir Rupert said.</p><p>Christian blinked, then did as ordered. \u201cMy God. Did you, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>His son slumped into a carved and gilded chair. His ginger hair was matted with sweat, and his face shone greasily. But it was his tired expression that bothered Sir Rupert. When had his son\u2019s face become lined?</p> <p>Sir Rupert spread his hands. \u201cEthan Iddesleigh was a problem. He had to be removed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God,\u201d Christian groaned. \u201cWhy? Tell me why you would kill a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cDo you think your father so foolish? I simply arranged for his death. I was involved in a business venture with Ethan Iddesleigh. It consisted of myself, Lord Walker\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeller, James, and Hartwell,\u201d Christian interrupted. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert frowned. \u201cThen why do you ask, if you know already?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only know what Simon has told me, and that has been precious little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Iddesleigh was no doubt prejudiced in his account, however small it was,\u201d Sir Rupert said. \u201cThe facts are these: We had invested in tea and stood to lose everything. We all agreed to a course of recovery. All, that is, but Ethan. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about money?\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert looked at his son. Christian wore an embroidered silk coat that would provide food and shelter for a laborer\u2019s family for the better part of a season. He sat in a gilt-painted chair a king wouldn\u2019t be ashamed to own, in a house on one of the best streets of London.</p><p>Had he any idea at all? \u201cOf course it\u2019s about money, dammit. What did you think it was about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Sir Rupert slammed the flat of his hand down on his desk. \u201cWhen I was your age, I worked from before the sun rose until past dark of night. There were days that I fell asleep over my supper, my head on a plank table. Do you think I would ever go back to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut to kill a man over gold, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you sneer at gold!\u201d Sir Rupert\u2019s voice rose on the last word. He brought it under control again. \u201cGold is the reason you have no need to labor as your grandfather did. As I did.\u201d</p><p>Christian ran a hand through his hair. He seemed dazed. \u201cEthan Iddesleigh was married with a little daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you I would choose his daughter over mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would\u2019ve lost the house.\u201d</p><p>Christian looked up.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sir Rupert nodded. \u201cIt was as bad as that. We would\u2019ve had to retire to the country. Your sisters would\u2019ve lost their seasons. You would\u2019ve had to give up that new carriage I\u2019d bought you. Your mother would\u2019ve had to sell her jewels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere our finances so dire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. You get your quarterly allowance and never think where it comes from, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely there are investments\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, investments!\u201d Sir Rupert pounded on the desk again. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019m talking about? This was an investment\u2014an investment upon which our entire future depended. And Ethan Iddesleigh, who never had to work a day in his life, who had his entire fortune handed to him on a silver platter when he was but a babe, wanted to stand on principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat principle?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>Sir Rupert breathed heavily. His leg was hurting like the very devil and he needed a drink. \u201cDoes it matter? We were on the brink of destruction. Our family, Christian.\u201d</p><p>His son merely stared at him.</p><p>\u201cI told the others that if we got rid of Iddesleigh, we could go ahead. It was a short step from there to getting Iddesleigh to call out Peller. They dueled and Peller won.\u201d He leaned forward and pinned his son with his gaze. \u201cWe won. Our family was saved. Your mother never even knew how close we\u2019d come to losing it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Christian shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can accept that you saved us this way and left Ethan Iddesleigh\u2019s daughter fatherless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccept?\u201d A muscle in his leg spasmed. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Do you want your mother in rags? Me in the poorhouse? Your sisters taking in washing? Principles are all well and fine, lad, but they don\u2019t put food in your mouth, do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But his son looked doubtful.</p><p>\u201cYou are as much a part of this as I am.\u201d Sir Rupert fumbled in his waistcoat pocket before rolling the ring across the table at his son.</p><p>Christian picked it up. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Iddesleigh\u2019s ring. James had it taken from him when his thugs almost killed him.\u201d</p><p>His son raised incredulous eyes at him.</p><p>Sir Rupert nodded. \u201cKeep it. It will remind you of whose side you stand on and what a man must do for his family.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d raised Christian to be a gentleman. He\u2019d wanted his son to feel at home in the aristocracy, to never fear that he\u2019d make a faux pas and give away his plebeian origins\u2014as he himself had feared as a young man. But in giving him this confidence, this assurance that he need not worry about finances, had he weakened his son?</p><p>Christian stared at the ring. \u201cHe killed Walker this morning.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert shrugged. \u201cIt was only a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now he\u2019ll come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows about you. Walker told him that you were the fifth man.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert swore.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d His son pocketed the ring.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing? What do you mean? He\u2019s tracked down the others and forced them to call him out. He\u2019ll do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d Sir Rupert limped around the desk, leaning heavily on his cane. \u201cNo, I sincerely doubt it.\u201d</p><p>WHEN SIMON ENTERED THE BEDROOM that night, the house was quiet and dark. Lucy had begun to wonder if he was coming home at all. She\u2019d spent the afternoon waiting, futilely trying to read a book she didn\u2019t even remember the title of. When he hadn\u2019t arrived home at their usual dinner hour, she\u2019d supped alone. And then, determined to speak to him when he did return, she\u2019d gone to bed in his rooms. Now she sat up in his big mahogany bed and wrapped her arms around her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d The question was out before she could stop it. She winced. Maybe she didn\u2019t want to hear where he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cDo you care?\u201d He set a candelabra on a table and shrugged off his coat. The blue silk was gray in places, and she saw at least one tear.</p><p>She tamped down her anger. It wouldn\u2019t help right now. \u201cYes, I care.\u201d And it was true. No matter what, she loved him and cared about him and what he did.</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply but sat down on a chair by the fire and removed his boots. He stood again and took off his wig, placing it on a stand. Rubbing both hands vigorously over his head, he made the short hair stand on end.</p><p>\u201cI was about.\u201d He stripped off his waistcoat, throwing it on a chair. \u201cWent \u2019round the Agrarians\u2019. Looked at a bookstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go hunting for Mr. Fletcher\u2019s father?\u201d That had been her fear all this time. That he was off making the arrangements for another duel.</p><p>He glanced at her, then stripped off his shirt. \u201cNo. I like to take a day of rest between my slaughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d In only his breeches, he poured out a basin of water and washed.</p><p>She watched him from the bed. Her heart ached. How could this man, moving so wearily yet gracefully, have killed another human this morning? How could she be married to him? How could she still care for him?</p><p>\u201cCan you explain it to me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He hesitated, one arm raised. Then he washed under his arm and along that side as he spoke. \u201cThey were a group of investors: Peller, Hartwell, James, Walker, and Ethan, my brother.\u201d He dipped the cloth he used in the basin, wrung it out, and rubbed his neck. \u201cAnd apparently Christian\u2019s father as well. Sir Rupert Fletcher.\u201d His eyes met hers as if he expected an objection.</p><p>She made none.</p><p>He continued. \u201cThey bought a shipment of Indian tea together. Not just one, but several shiploads. Hell, a bloody fleet, as if they were merchant princes. The price of tea was rising, and they stood to make a fortune each. Easily. Quickly.\u201d He moved the cloth across his chest in circles, wiping away blood and sweat and dirt.</p><p>She watched him and listened and made no sound, fearful of interrupting this story. But inside she was quaking. She felt pulled to the man washing himself so mundanely, despite the blood, and at the same time, was repelled by the stranger who had killed a man just this morning.</p><p>Simon splashed water on his face. \u201cThe only risk was the ships sinking at sea or wrecking in a storm, but that\u2019s a risk any investor takes. They probably thought about it a minute and discounted it. After all, there was so much money to be made.\u201d He looked at the basin of scummy water, emptied it into a slops jar, and refilled it.</p><p>\u201cBut Ethan, always correct Ethan, talked them into taking out insurance against the ships and the arrival of the tea. It was expensive, but he said it was the smart thing to do. The responsible thing to do.\u201d He ducked his head into the basin and sluiced the water over his hair.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d palmed the water from his hair and straightened. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He shrugged and picked up a cloth and toweled his clean hair. \u201cThe weather was fine, the ships fit, and, I suppose, the crew competent. The first ship arrived in port without problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He spent some time carefully folding the towel before laying it beside the basin. \u201cThe price of tea had fallen in the meantime. Not just fallen, but plummeted. It was one of those quirks of the market that they couldn\u2019t have foreseen. There was a sudden glut of tea. Their tea wasn\u2019t worth the cost of unloading the crates from the ship.\u201d He walked into the next room, his dressing room.</p><p>\u201cSo the investors lost their money?\u201d she called.</p><p>\u201cThey would\u2019ve.\u201d He returned with a razor. \u201cBut then they remembered the insurance. The insurance that Ethan had made them take out. So ridiculous at the time and their only hope now. If they sank the ships, they could recoup their loss.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cBut Ethan . . .\u201d</p><p>He nodded and pointed the razor at her. \u201cBut Ethan was the most honorable man I ever knew. The most honest. The most sure of himself and his morals. He refused. Damn the loss of money, damn their anger, damn the possibility of ruin, he would not take part in a fraud.\u201d He soaped his face.</p><p>Lucy thought about Ethan\u2019s honesty\u2014how naive he must have been and how hard for a man like Simon to live up to. Simon\u2019s voice was flat. Perhaps to someone else he would sound unemotional, but she was the woman who cared for him, and she heard the pain under the words. And the anger.</p><p>Simon set the edge of the razor against his throat and made the first stroke. \u201cThey determined that they must get rid of Ethan. Without him, they could wreck the ships and recover; with him, all was lost. But it\u2019s not so easy to kill a viscount, is it? So they spread bloody, bloody rumors that were impossible to disprove, impossible to fight.\u201d He wiped the lather from his razor onto a cloth.</p><p>\u201cRumors about him?\u201d Lucy whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stared down at the razor in his hand as if he\u2019d forgotten what it was. \u201cAbout Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Rosalind\u2019s virtue. About Pocket\u2019s birth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Pocket looks just like you . . .\u201d She trailed away, the implication hitting her. Oh, dear Lord. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly. Just like me.\u201d His lips twisted. \u201cThey called Rosalind a whore, said I\u2019d debauched her, that Pocket was a bastard and Ethan a cuckold.\u201d</p><p>She must\u2019ve gasped.</p><p>He turned to her, his eyes pained, his voice finally strained. \u201cWhy do you think we haven\u2019t attended any London balls or parties or damned musicales, for God\u2019s sake? Rosalind\u2019s reputation was ruined. Absolutely ruined. She hasn\u2019t been invited anywhere in three years. An impeccably virtuous lady and she was cut dead on the street by married women who\u2019d had too many liaisons to count.\u201d</p><p>Lucy didn\u2019t know what to say. What an awful thing to do to a family, to do to brothers. Poor, poor Rosalind.</p> <p>Simon took a deep breath. \u201cThey left him no choice. He called out Peller, the one they\u2019d chosen to talk the loudest. Ethan had never fought a duel, barely knew how to hold the sword. Peller killed him in less than a minute. Like leading a lamb to slaughter.\u201d</p><p>She drew in her breath. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cItaly.\u201d He raised the razor again. \u201cSeeing the ruins and drinking.\u201d Stroke. \u201cAnd wenching, I\u2019ll admit as well.\u201d Wipe. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until a letter was sent. Ethan, steady, boring Ethan\u2014Ethan the good son\u2014my brother, Ethan had been killed in a duel. I thought it was a joke; I came home anyway.\u201d Stroke. \u201cI\u2019d wearied of Italy by that time. Fine wine or no, there are only so many ruins one can see. I rode to the Iddesleigh family estate and . . .\u201d</p><p>He took some time wiping the blade this time. His gaze was averted from hers, but she could see his Adam\u2019s apple move as he swallowed.</p><p>\u201cIt was winter and they\u2019d preserved his body for my return. Couldn\u2019t hold the funeral without me, it seems. Not that there were many mourners waiting, only Rosalind, nearly prostrate with shock and grief, and Pocket and the priest. No one else was there. They\u2019d been shunned. Ruined.\u201d He looked up at her, and she noticed that he\u2019d cut himself under the left earlobe. \u201cThey did more than just kill him, Lucy, they destroyed his name. Destroyed Rosalind\u2019s reputation. Destroyed Pocket\u2019s hopes of ever marrying well, although she\u2019s too young to know that yet.\u201d He frowned and finished shaving without saying anything else.</p> <p>Lucy watched him. What was she to do? She could understand his reasons for wanting vengeance only too well. If someone had done such a wrong to David, her brother, or to Papa, she, too, would seethe with indignation. But that still didn\u2019t make killing right. And what of the cost to Simon, in both body and soul? He couldn\u2019t have fought all those duels without losing a part of himself. Could she simply sit by while he annihilated himself in vengeance for a dead brother?</p><p>He washed his face and dried it off and then walked to where she sat. \u201cMay I join you?\u201d</p><p>Did he think she\u2019d refuse him? \u201cYes.\u201d She scooted backward to make room.</p><p>He shucked his breeches and blew out the candle. She felt the bed dip as he climbed in. She waited, but he didn\u2019t move toward her. Finally she rolled against him. He hesitated, then put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cYou never finished the fairy tale you were telling me,\u201d she whispered against his chest.</p><p>She felt his sigh. \u201cDo you really want to hear it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, then.\u201d His voice floated to her in the dark. \u201cAs you recall, Angelica wished for another dress even more beautiful than the first. So the Serpent Prince showed her a sharp silver dagger and bade her cut off his right hand.\u201d</p><p>Lucy shivered; she\u2019d forgotten that part.</p><p>\u201cThe goat girl did as he told her, and a silver dress trimmed with hundreds of opals appeared. It looked like moonlight.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cAnd she went off and had a jolly good time at the ball with pretty Prince Rutherford and returned late\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the Serpent Prince?\u201d she interrupted. \u201cWasn\u2019t he in great pain?\u201d</p><p>His hand paused. \u201cOf course.\u201d He resumed stroking. \u201cBut it was what Angelica wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a selfish girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just poor and alone. She couldn\u2019t help demanding beautiful clothes any more than the snake could help having scales. It\u2019s simply the way God made them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Lucy wasn\u2019t convinced.</p><p>\u201cAnyway.\u201d He patted her shoulder. \u201cAngelica returned and told the Serpent Prince all about the ball and pretty Rutherford and how everyone admired her gown, and he listened silently and smiled at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose the next evening she wanted a new dress for silly Rutherford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and she listened to his breathing in the darkness for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut of course it must be even more beautiful than the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her shoulder. \u201cThe Serpent Prince said nothing was easier. He could get her the most beautiful dress she\u2019d ever seen, the most beautiful dress in the world.\u201d</p><p>Lucy hesitated. This didn\u2019t sound good for some reason. \u201cShe must cut off his other hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sighed wistfully in the dark. \u201cHis head.\u201d</p><p>Lucy jerked back. \u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d</p><p>She felt his shrug. \u201cThe most beautiful dress, the ultimate sacrifice. The Serpent Prince knelt before the goat girl and presented his neck. Angelica was appalled, of course, and she did hesitate, but she was in love with Prince Rutherford. How else could a goat girl win a prince? In the end, she did as the Serpent Prince instructed and cut off his head.\u201d</p><p>Lucy bit her lip. She felt like weeping over this foolish fairy tale. \u201cBut he comes alive again, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d His breath brushed across her face. He must\u2019ve turned his head toward her. \u201cDo you want to hear the story or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d She snuggled against him again and was still.</p><p>\u201cThis time the dress was truly magnificent. It was made all of silver with diamonds and sapphires strewn over it so that Angelica looked as if she were wearing light itself. Prince Rutherford was overcome with ardor or perhaps greed when he caught sight of her and immediately fell to his knees and proposed.\u201d</p><p>Lucy waited, but he was silent. She poked him in the shoulder. \u201cThen what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. They married and lived happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be the end. What about the Serpent Prince?\u201d</p><p>She felt him turn toward her. \u201cHe died, remember? I suppose Angelica shed a few tears for him, but he was a snake, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She knew she was foolish to object\u2014it was only a fairy tale\u2014but she felt unreasonably mad at him. \u201cHe\u2019s the hero of the story. He transformed himself into a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he\u2019s still part snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! He\u2019s a prince.\u201d She knew somehow that what they were arguing about had nothing to do with the fairy tale. \u201cThat\u2019s what the story\u2019s called, The Serpent Prince. He should marry Angelica; he loved her, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy.\u201d He gathered her into his arms, and she let him even though she was angry with him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, angel, but that\u2019s the fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to die,\u201d she said. Tears pricked at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone? Whether he deserves it or not is neither here nor there; it\u2019s simply his fate. You can no more change that than you can change the course of the stars.\u201d</p><p>The tears had escaped and were rolling into her hair and, she very much feared, his chest. \u201cBut the fate of a man. That can be changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it?\u201d he asked so low she almost didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer, so she closed her eyes and tried to contain the sobs. And she prayed, Please, God, let a man be able to change his fate.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The dream woke her again in the early hours of the next morning.</p><p>Lucy opened her eyes in the gray light and stared at the embers in the fireplace without moving. This time she recalled fragments. She\u2019d dreamed that Christian had dueled Lord Walker while Simon took tea and looked on. Lord Walker had already lost his eye, and he was quite angry, although it didn\u2019t affect his swordsmanship. Which had made it all the more gruesome. Then Lucy had been there at the table with Simon. She poured the tea and sipped and then looked into her cup. The tea had been made of rose petals. It was red, like blood. And she\u2019d been horrified. Maybe it really was blood. She\u2019d put her cup down and refused to drink any more, although Simon urged her to. But she knew she couldn\u2019t trust him because when she looked down, where his legs should have been there was a tail. A snake\u2019s tail . . .</p><p>Lucy shivered.</p><p>She\u2019d woken covered in sweat, and now her flesh was chilled. Her hand crept across the silk coverlet, and she touched a warm arm. Warm male skin. Despite the fact that they had their own bedrooms, each large enough to house an entire family, Simon had slept with her every night since their wedding, whether in her own room or, as tonight, in his. Lucy had the feeling that this wasn\u2019t quite done in the ton, for a man to sleep with his wife, but she was glad. She liked having his warmth next to her. She liked hearing his deep breathing at night. And she liked the smell of him on her pillows. It was nice.</p><p>\u201cHmmph?\u201d He rolled toward her and flung a heavy arm over her waist. His breathing deepened again.</p><p>Lucy didn\u2019t move. She shouldn\u2019t wake him just for a nasty dream. She snuggled her nose into his shoulder, inhaling his scent.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d His voice was gravelly, low, but more awake than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She ran her hand over his chest, feeling the hairs tickle her palm. \u201cJust a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNightmare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t ask what about. Merely sighed and gathered her into his arms. Her legs slid along his, and she felt his erection bump her hip.</p><p>\u201cPocket used to have nightmares.\u201d His breath blew against the top of her head. \u201cWhen I stayed with them after Ethan\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed his hand down her back and patted her bottom, then settled there, warm and possessive.</p><p>\u201cShe had a nanny, but the woman must\u2019ve slept soundly, because Pocket would slip past her and find her mother\u2019s room.\u201d He chuckled, his voice rusty. \u201cAnd a couple of times she came to me. Scared the wits out of me the first time. Cold little hand touching my shoulder in the middle of the night, a high voice whispering my name. Nearly took a vow to swear off drink before bed.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled against his shoulder. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d He rolled to his back, still holding her, and stretched one arm over his head. \u201cFirst of all, I had to figure out a way to put on my breeches. Then I sat with her in a chair by the fire. Wrapped a blanket about both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she fall back asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she did not, the imp.\u201d He scratched his chest. \u201cMuch like you, she wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI like talking to you like this.\u201d He linked his fingers with hers on his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to think for a bit. Finally, he sighed. \u201cShe told me Ethan used to talk to her when she had a bad dream. He\u2019d tell her about, oh, dolls and puppies and her favorite sweets. Things like that. Things to take her mind off the nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cSo you talked to her about puppies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d She saw his quick grin in the brightening room. \u201cMore like how to drive a phaeton. What to look for in horseflesh. The proper way to brew coffee and where, exactly, it comes from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does coffee come from?\u201d She pulled the coverlet over her shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told her Africa, where Pygmy workers train crocodiles to climb the trees and whack the coffee beans down with their tails.\u201d</p><p>Lucy laughed. \u201cSimon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else was I to say? It was three o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you\u2019ll comfort me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d His fingers flexed against hers. \u201cWe could discuss tea, Chinese versus Indian, and where it grows and whether it\u2019s true that it must be picked only by perfect female children below the age of six wearing crimson silk gloves and working by the light of a blue moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019m not interested in tea and its production?\u201d Lucy drew her foot across one of his calves.</p><p>He cleared his throat again. \u201cThen perhaps you\u2019d be entertained by discussing various breeds of horses. Those best for carriages and those best for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She disengaged her hand from his and stroked down over his belly.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDefinitely, no.\u201d She touched his manhood, running her fingers up its length and smoothing over the head. She loved touching him.</p><p>For a moment he breathed heavily. Then he spoke. \u201cDo you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She gently squeezed.</p><p>\u201cAh, have some other idea in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I think I do.\u201d Holding firmly to his erection, she turned her face and bit his shoulder. He tasted of salt and musk.</p><p>Apparently that was his breaking point. He suddenly rolled toward her. \u201cTurn over.\u201d His voice was husky.</p> <p>She complied, rubbing her bottom against his groin.</p><p>\u201cMinx,\u201d he muttered. He arranged her over his lower arm so she lay in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cI think you should tell me about rose culture,\u201d she murmured solemnly.</p><p>\u201cDo you, indeed?\u201d He draped his upper arm over her and ran his hand across her breasts.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d never tell him, but she found his voice unbearably sensuous sometimes. Feeling him all along her back and hearing him, but not seeing his face, made her shiver with a sudden erotic chill.</p><p>\u201cWell, soil is most important.\u201d He pinched a nipple.</p><p>She watched his elegant fingers against her flesh and bit her lip. \u201cDirt?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed harder, making her gasp with the sharp prick of desire. \u201cWe rose enthusiasts prefer the word soil. It sounds so much more serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is soil different from dirt?\u201d She bumped back against him. His hardness slid over her bottom and lodged in the groove. She felt surrounded by his hot body. It made her feel small. Feminine.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIt just is. Now listen. Manure.\u201d</p><p>She bit back an inappropriate giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s not romantic.\u201d</p><p>He gently pulled her nipple, and she arched in reaction. \u201cThe choice of topic was yours.\u201d His fingers wandered to her other breast and tweaked the tip there.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cEven so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He inserted his leg between her own and rubbed up.</p><p>His thigh caressed her just there, and she closed her eyes. \u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManure is the key to good soil. Some suggest ground cattle bones, but they are heretics fit only for raising turnips.\u201d His hand skimmed over her belly and down. \u201cThe manure must be applied in the fall and allowed to overwinter. Too late application causes burning of the plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cR-really?\u201d All her attention was on that hand.</p><p>He traced one finger delicately through the crease between thigh and mons, almost tickling her. He brushed her maiden hair and came to the other crease, hesitating. She squirmed impatiently. She could feel herself warming, growing wet with just the anticipation of what he would do next.</p><p>\u201cI see you understand the significance of good manure. Now, think of your excitement\u201d\u2014his hand darted down and parted her lips\u2014\u201cwhen I discuss compost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He\u2019d inserted a finger right into her.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She felt him nod behind her but she hardly cared. \u201cYou have the makings of a great rose horticulturist.\u201d</p><p>She tried to tighten her thighs around his hand, but his leg prevented her. \u201cSimon . . .\u201d</p><p>He withdrew the finger and speared her again. She clenched helplessly around him.</p><p>\u201cCompost, according to Sir Lazarus Lillipin, should consist of one part animal manure, three parts straw, and two parts vegetable remains.\u201d</p><p>Another finger found her pearl of flesh and she moaned. It seemed almost decadent that a mere man could bring her such pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThese,\u201d he still nattered on behind her, \u201cto be placed in layers within a pile until said pile reaches the height of a short man. Lillipin makes no mention of how wide the pile should be, a grave omission in my own, rather learned opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy angel?\u201d He flicked his finger, but not quite hard enough.</p><p>She tried to arch into his hand, but he still kept her imprisoned between his legs. She cleared her throat, but her voice still emerged huskily. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about roses anymore.\u201d</p><p>He tsked behind her, although his own breathing had roughened. \u201cIt can be a dull subject, I admit, but you have been a very good pupil. I think you deserve a reward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reward?\u201d She would\u2019ve smiled if she could\u2019ve. Was that how he saw it? Vain man. She had a sudden flash of tender affection that made her want to turn and kiss him.</p><p>But he raised her top leg over both of his. \u201cA reward only given to the best lasses. The ones who listen to their horticultural masters and know their roses well.\u201d</p><p>He was at her entrance. He parted her lips with his fingers and shoved a little in. She gasped and would\u2019ve wriggled if he had let her. She\u2019d forgotten how large\u2014 He pushed again. From this angle, she could feel every inch, widening, invading her.</p><p>\u201cOnly the best?\u201d She hardly recognized her own voice; it was so low she seemed to purr.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes.\u201d Her husband panted behind her.</p><p>\u201cAnd am I the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, Simon?\u201d she asked. A primitive sort of power filled her.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserve more. I want more. I want all of you.\u201d And she did. She wanted both man and mind, his body and his soul, and she was shocked at her own greed.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d he groaned, and shoved his entire length into her.</p><p>She moaned and tried to close her legs. She felt so full of him. He kept her legs splayed open with his own, his clever fingers found that spot on her again, and he started thrusting. So good. She wanted him like this forever, his flesh merged with hers, his attention totally on her. No conflict could trouble them here when they were together. She arched her head back, under his own, and found his mouth. He kissed her deeply as he continued to thrust in and out of her, his flesh rubbing against and invading hers. A wail rose in her throat but he swallowed it. He pinched her gently on that vulnerable peak. And she fell apart, his manhood dragging in and out of her all the while as she gasped and panted.</p><p>Suddenly he withdrew. He flipped her to her belly, raised her hips a little, and thrust in again. Dear Lord. She was almost flat on her belly, and she could feel every inch of him. This position felt primitive, and with her recent release, it almost overwhelmed her senses.</p><p>\u201cLucy,\u201d he groaned above her. He slowly drew himself out until only his tip lodged in her opening, wide and hard. And thrust heavily again. \u201cMy darling Lucy.\u201d He panted against her ear, and then his teeth scraped her earlobe. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t ever leave me.\u201d</p><p>Her heart quaked. He was all around her. His weight against her back, his scent invading her senses as his flesh invaded her flesh. This was domination, pure and simple, and she found it unbearably erotic. A wave of pleasure rose again within her. Oh, let this moment continue. Let us be together forever. She was weeping, her physical ecstasy mixed and confused with a terrible feeling of impending loss she could not control.</p><p>\u201cLucy, I . . .\u201d He thrust more roughly. Faster. He levered off her and pounded into her vulnerable body, and she felt his sweat spray her back. \u201cLucy!\u201d</p><p>He grunted and shook, and she felt the warmth spread in her and couldn\u2019t tell it apart\u2014her climax from his seed planted within her.</p><p>THE FIRST THING SIMON NOTICED about Sir Rupert\u2019s study was the prints on the walls. Botanical prints.</p><p>Behind him, Fletcher\u2019s butler said, \u201cSir Rupert will see you shortly, my lord.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, already advancing on an engraving that depicted a gnarled branch with delicate flowers above and, incongruently, the fruit below. On the bottom of the picture, in archaic script, was the legend, Prunus cerasus. Sour cherry. He looked at the next, framed in gilt: Brassica oleracea. Wild cabbage. The leaves were so ornately curled they might have been exotic bird plumes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard you had an interest in horticulture,\u201d Sir Rupert said from the door.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t move. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had one as well.\u201d He turned to face his enemy.</p><p>Sir Rupert was leaning on a crutch.</p><p>Simon hadn\u2019t expected that. Here only five minutes and he\u2019d been surprised twice already. This wasn\u2019t going as planned. But then he hadn\u2019t really known how to plan this, the final confrontation. He thought he\u2019d already finished everything when he\u2019d faced Walker. He hadn\u2019t dreamed there was another to pursue until the dying man confessed as much. He didn\u2019t dare discuss it with Lucy. After this morning\u2019s sweet lovemaking, he didn\u2019t want to upset their fragile truce. Yet he still had to see that she was safe, which meant eliminating the last man. Please, God, soon. If he could do that without Lucy finding out, perhaps they still stood a chance.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see my conservatory?\u201d Sir Rupert cocked his head, eyeing him like an amused parrot.</p><p>He was older than the other conspirators, had to be in order to have fathered Christian. But still, Simon hadn\u2019t braced himself for the lines on the man\u2019s face, the slight stoop to his shoulders, and the bit of flesh that wobbled under his chin. All proclaimed him a man over fifty years. Otherwise he would make a formidable opponent. Although shorter than he, Sir Rupert\u2019s arms and shoulders were heavy with muscle. Were it not for his age and the cane . . .</p><p>Simon considered the offer. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The older man preceded him from the room. Simon watched Sir Rupert\u2019s painful progress down the marble hall, his crutch echoing each time it hit the floor. Alas, the limp was not faked. They turned down a smaller hall, one that ended in an ordinary oak door.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like this,\u201d Sir Rupert said. He produced a key and inserted it into the lock. \u201cPlease.\u201d His arm swept in front of him, indicating Simon should go first.</p><p>Simon raised his eyebrows and stepped over the threshold. Humid air bearing the familiar smells of loam and rot enveloped him. Above those scents floated a lighter aroma. It was an octagonal room made of glass from the floor upward. Around the edges and in clusters in the middle were every kind of fruiting citrus tree, each in its own enormous pot.</p><p>\u201cOranges, of course,\u201d Sir Rupert said. He limped to his side. \u201cBut also limes and lemons and various subgroups of orangelets. Each has its own particular taste and smell. Do you know, I believe if you blindfolded me and gave me a fruit, I could tell which it was merely by scoring the skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkable.\u201d Simon touched a shiny leaf.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I spend too much time and money on my little hobby.\u201d The older man caressed a fruit, still green. \u201cIt can be consuming. But so, for that matter, can revenge.\u201d Sir Rupert smiled, a kind, fatherly man surrounded by his artificial garden.</p><p>Simon felt a welling of hatred and carefully suppressed the emotion. \u201cYou seize the bull by its horns, sir.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert sighed. \u201cThere seems little point in pretending I don\u2019t know why you\u2019ve come. We\u2019re both too intelligent for that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you admit you conspired to kill my brother.\u201d Simon deliberately broke off the leaf he\u2019d been caressing.</p><p>\u201cTcha.\u201d The older man made an irritated sound. \u201cYou reduce it to the simplicity of a babe knocking over play blocks, when it was nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. We stood to lose a fortune\u2014all the investors, not just I.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoney.\u201d Simon\u2019s lips twisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, money!\u201d The older man thumped his stick. \u201cYou sound like my son, sneering over money like it dirties your hands. Why do you think we all, your brother included, went into the venture in the first place? We needed the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed my brother because of your own greed,\u201d Simon hissed, unable to contain all of his rage.</p><p>\u201cWe killed your brother for our families.\u201d Sir Rupert blinked, breathing heavily, perhaps surprised by his own candor. \u201cFor my family. I\u2019m not a monster, Lord Iddesleigh. Don\u2019t make that mistake. I care for my family. I would do anything for my family, including, yes, removing an aristocrat who would\u2019ve let my family go to the poorhouse so he could stand on his noble principles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it seem like the investment was sure to make money all along, yet it was a gamble from the start. It was hardly Ethan\u2019s fault the price of tea fell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sir Rupert agreed. \u201cNot his fault. But it would\u2019ve been his fault had he kept us from reaping the insurance money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed him to commit a fraud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed him to preserve my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d Simon lifted his lip in a sneer. \u201cI don\u2019t care what excuses you\u2019ve made, what reasons you have in your own mind, what sorrows you seek to win my pity with. You killed Ethan. You\u2019ve admitted the murder yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t care?\u201d The older man\u2019s voice was soft in the still, oppressive air. \u201cYou, who have spent a year avenging your own family?\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s eyes narrowed. A bead of sweat ran down his back.</p> <p>\u201cI think you do understand,\u201d Sir Rupert said. \u201cDo care, in fact, for my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Simon fingered another leaf. \u201cYou tried to have my wife killed. For that alone I will see you dead.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert smiled. \u201cThere you are wrong. The attempt on your wife\u2019s life was not my fault. That was the work of Lord Walker, and you\u2019ve already killed him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Simon stared at the other man, tempting him with this hope of redemption. How easy it would be to just let it go. He\u2019d killed four men already. This one said he wasn\u2019t a threat to Lucy. He could walk away, go home to Lucy, and never have to duel again. So easy. \u201cI cannot let my brother\u2019s death go unavenged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnavenged? You\u2019ve avenged your brother to the tune of four souls. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot while you still live.\u201d Simon tore the leaf.</p><p>Sir Rupert flinched. \u201cAnd what will you do? Make war on a crippled man?\u201d He held up his crutch like a shield.</p><p>\u201cIf need be. I\u2019ll have a life for a life, Fletcher, cripple or no.\u201d Simon turned and walked to the door.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t do it, Iddesleigh,\u201d the old man called behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re too honorable.\u201d</p><p>Simon smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t count on it. You\u2019re the one who pointed out how very similar we are.\u201d He closed the door and walked out of the house, the scent of hothouse citrus following him.</p><p>\u201cYOU NEED TO HOLD STILL, THEODORA DEAR, if you want Aunt Lucy to draw your portrait,\u201d Rosalind chided that afternoon.</p><p>Pocket, in the act of swinging her leg, froze and darted an anxious glance at Lucy.</p><p>Lucy smiled. \u201cAlmost done.\u201d</p><p>The three of them sat in the large drawing room at the front of Simon\u2019s town house\u2014her town house as well, now that they were wed. She must start thinking of it that way. But truthfully, Lucy still considered the house and servants Simon\u2019s. Perhaps if she stayed\u2014</p><p>She sighed. What nonsense. Of course she would stay. She was married to Simon; the time for doubts had long since passed. No matter what he did, she was his wife. And if he didn\u2019t duel anymore, there was no reason why they couldn\u2019t grow ever closer. Just this morning, Simon had made urgent love to her, had even told her he loved her. What more could a woman ask from her husband? She should\u2019ve felt safe and warm. Why, then, did she still have this feeling of impending loss? Why hadn\u2019t she said she loved him as well? Three simple words that he must\u2019ve been expecting, yet she\u2019d been unable to form them.</p><p>Lucy shook her head and concentrated on the sketch. Simon had insisted this room be remade for her, despite her protests. Though she had to admit now that it really was lovely. With Rosalind\u2019s help, she\u2019d chosen the colors of a ripe peach: delicate yellows, sunny pinks, and rich reds. The result was lively and soothing at the same time. And in addition, the room had the best light in the house. That alone would\u2019ve made it Lucy\u2019s favorite. She looked at her subject matter. Pocket was dressed in turquoise silk that provided a beautiful contrast for her flaxen locks, but she sat stiffly hunched as if frozen in mid-wiggle.</p><p>Lucy hastily made a few more strokes with her pencil. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuzzah!\u201d Pocket exploded off the chair she\u2019d been posed on. \u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>Lucy turned her sketchbook.</p><p>The little girl tilted her head first one way and then another, then scrunched her nose. \u201cIs that what my chin looks like?\u201d</p><p>Lucy examined her sketch. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheodora.\u201d</p><p>Brought up short by her mother\u2019s warning tone, Pocket bobbed a curtsy. \u201cThank you, Aunt Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re most welcome,\u201d Lucy replied. \u201cWould you like to see if Cook is finished with her mincemeat pies yet? They\u2019re for Christmas dinner, but she might have one for you to sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Pocket paused only long enough to seek her mother\u2019s approving nod before darting out of the room.</p><p>Lucy began to put away her pencils.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you to indulge her so,\u201d Rosalind said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I enjoy it.\u201d Lucy glanced up. \u201cYou and Pocket will be coming to dine with us on Christmas morning, won\u2019t you? I\u2019m sorry my invitation is so late. I forgot Christmas is only a few days away until Cook started baking pies.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s quite all right. You are newly married, after all. We will be delighted to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lucy watched her hands placing the pencils in a jar. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if I can ask you something personal. Very personal.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>Then Rosalind sighed. \u201cEthan\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked up. \u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt consumes Simon.\u201d Rosalind shrugged. \u201cSooner or later I expected you to ask about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know he\u2019s been fighting duels over Ethan\u2019s death?\u201d Her hands were trembling. \u201cHe\u2019s killed two men that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind gazed out the window. \u201cI\u2019d heard rumors. The gentlemen never like to tell us of their affairs, do they? Even when it involves us. I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever think to stop him?\u201d Lucy grimaced at her own lack of tact. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a natural question. You\u2019re aware that he\u2019s dueling partly for my honor?\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded.</p><p>\u201cI tried after Ethan\u2019s death when I first heard the gossip about duels to talk to him about it. Simon laughed and changed the subject. But the thing is\u201d\u2014Rosalind leaned forward\u2014\u201cit really isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s not even about Ethan, God rest his soul.\u201d</p><p>Lucy stared. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how can I explain?\u201d Rosalind got up to pace. \u201cWhen Ethan was killed, it cut off any way for the brothers to come to terms with each other. For Simon to understand and forgive Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive him? For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m expressing myself badly.\u201d Rosalind stopped and frowned.</p><p>Outside, a cart rumbled by and someone shouted. Lucy waited. She knew somehow that Rosalind held the key to Simon\u2019s single-minded quest for revenge.</p><p>\u201cYou must comprehend,\u201d her sister-in-law said slowly. \u201cEthan was always the good brother. The one everyone liked, the perfect English gentleman. Simon almost by default took the only other role. That of the wastrel, the ne\u2019er-do-well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought him a wastrel,\u201d Lucy said softly.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t, really.\u201d Rosalind looked at her. \u201cI think some of it was merely youth, some of it reaction to his brother and how their parents saw the both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did their parents see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the brothers were very young, their parents seemed to decide that one was good and the other bad. The viscountess was especially rigid in her thinking.\u201d</p><p>How awful to be branded the bad brother at so young an age. \u201cBut\u201d\u2014Lucy shook her head\u2014\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how that affects Simon now.\u201d</p><p>Rosalind closed her eyes. \u201cWhen Ethan let himself be murdered, Simon was forced to assume both roles. Both the good and the bad brother.\u201d</p><p>Lucy raised her eyebrows. Was what Rosalind said possible?</p><p>\u201cJust listen.\u201d Rosalind held out her hands. \u201cI think Simon felt guilty that Ethan had died defending Simon\u2019s name in a way. Remember the rumors were that Simon was my lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucy said slowly.</p><p>\u201cSimon had to avenge him. Yet, at the same time, he must feel terrible anger at Ethan for dying in such a way, for leaving me and Theodora to his care, for being the good brother and martyring himself.\u201d She stared down at her open palms. \u201cI know I do.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked away. This was a revelation. Everything she\u2019d heard about Ethan pointed to how good he\u2019d been. It had never occurred to her that Rosalind might feel anger toward her late husband. And if she did . . .</p><p>\u201cIt took me many months to let Ethan go,\u201d Rosalind said quietly, almost to herself. \u201cTo forgive him for dueling a man he knew was the better swordsman. It\u2019s only been recently that . . .\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her sister-in-law blushed. \u201cI . . . I have been driving with a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, but Simon said your reputation was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuined.\u201d Rosalind\u2019s complexion was quite rosy now. \u201cYes, in the ton it was. My gentleman is a solicitor at the law house that helped settle Ethan\u2019s estate. I hope you don\u2019t think the less of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, of course not.\u201d Lucy caught Rosalind\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>The fair woman smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish,\u201d Lucy whispered, \u201cthat Simon could find such peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s found you. At one time I wasn\u2019t sure he would ever let himself marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I can\u2019t talk to him. He doesn\u2019t listen, won\u2019t admit what he\u2019s doing is murder. I . . .\u201d Lucy looked blindly away, her eyes full of tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>She felt Rosalind\u2019s hand on her shoulder. \u201cMaybe there isn\u2019t anything you can do. Perhaps this is something only he can defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Lucy began, but Pocket charged back into the room at that moment, and she had to turn away to hide her eyes from the little girl.</p><p>The question hung there, unanswered.</p><p>If Simon couldn\u2019t defeat his demons, if he didn\u2019t stop killing other men, he would destroy himself. Maybe Rosalind was right; maybe there truly wasn\u2019t anything she could do to stop his deadly path. But she had to at least try. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Surely there was someone else who felt as she did, someone who didn\u2019t want this duel with Sir Rupert.

Around him the smells of the conservatory floated in the humid air\u2014rotted leaves, earth, and the faint scent of mildew. But the perfume of the rose in front of him overpowered them all. She had four blooms on her, all different, the streaks of white swirling into the crimson on her petals. Rosa mundi was an old rose but a favorite nonetheless.</p><p>The leaf he\u2019d snipped fell to the white-painted table, and he picked it up and threw it in a bucket. Sometimes a dead leaf carried parasites and, if forgotten by the horticulturist, would infect the healthy plants as well. He made it a habit to clean up as he went. Even the smallest of leftovers might later prove the doom of an entire table of plants.</p><p>He moved to the next rose, a Centifolia muscosa\u2014common moss rose\u2014its leaves glossy green with health, its perfume almost cloyingly sweet. The petals in her flowers spilled over themselves, lush and billowy, shamelessly revealing the green sepals at their center. If roses were women, the moss rose would be a tart.</p><p>Sir Rupert was a leftover. Or perhaps the last of a series of labors. Whichever way one looked at it, he had to be dealt with. Clipped and cleaned up. Simon owed it to Ethan to finish the job. And to Lucy, to make sure she was safe from his past and his enemies. But Sir Rupert was also a cripple; there was no getting away from that fact. Simon hesitated, studying the next rose, a York and Lancaster, which bore both pink and white flowers on the same plant. He balked at dueling a man with such uneven odds. It would be a killing, pure and simple. The older man wouldn\u2019t have a chance, and Lucy didn\u2019t want him dueling. She would probably leave him, his stern angel, if she found out he was even contemplating issuing another challenge. He didn\u2019t want to lose her. Couldn\u2019t imagine never waking again with her. His fingers shook at even the thought.</p><p>Four dead, wasn\u2019t that enough? Is it enough, Ethan?</p> <p>He turned over a healthy-looking leaf on the York and Lancaster and found a swarm of aphids, busily sucking the life from the plant.</p><p>The door to the conservatory crashed open.</p><p>\u201cSir, you\u2019re not allowed\u2014\u201d Newton\u2019s voice, outraged and fearful, admonished the intruder.</p><p>Simon turned to confront whoever disturbed his peace.</p><p>Christian charged down the aisle, his face pale and set.</p><p>Newton dithered. \u201cMr. Fletcher, please\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right\u2014\u201d Simon started.</p><p>Christian punched him in the jaw.</p><p>He staggered back, falling against the table, his vision blurred. What?</p><p>Pots crashed to the floor, the shards skittering in the walkway. He straightened and brought his fists up to defend himself as his eyes cleared, but the other man was simply standing there, his chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cWhat the bloody hell,\u201d Simon began.</p><p>\u201cDuel me,\u201d Christian spat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Simon blinked. Belatedly his jaw began to throb with pain. He noticed that the moss rose was in pieces on the floor, two of the main stems broken. Christian\u2019s boot crushed a bloom underfoot, the perfume rising from the dead rose like a eulogy.</p><p>Newton hurried out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cDuel me.\u201d Christian raised his right fist in threat. \u201cDo I have to hit you again?\u201d His expression was without humor, his eyes wide and dry.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Simon felt along his jaw. He couldn\u2019t talk if it was broken, could he? \u201cWhy would I want to duel you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. You want to duel my father. But he\u2019s old and his leg is bad. He can hardly walk. Even you might feel a twinge of guilt at running through a cripple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father killed my brother.\u201d Simon let his hand fall.</p><p>\u201cSo you have to duel him.\u201d Christian nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve seen you kill two men now, remember? I\u2019ve watched you enact your sense of family\u2014of honor, though you refuse to use that word\u2014over the last few weeks. Do you really expect any less from me? Duel me as my father\u2019s surrogate.\u201d</p><p>Simon sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Christian hit him in the face again.</p><p>Simon fell on his arse. \u201cShit! Stop that.\u201d He must look a complete idiot, sitting in mud in his own greenhouse. Pain bloomed across his cheekbone. Now the entire left side of his face felt on fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing it,\u201d the younger man said from above him, \u201cuntil you agree. I\u2019ve seen you badger two men into dueling. I\u2019ve learned well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother was a dockside whore, your father a bastard!\u201d Christian shouted, red-faced.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Was the boy mad? \u201cMy fight is with your father, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll seduce your wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucy! a primitive part of his brain screamed. He shook it away. The boy was playing his own game. \u201cI don\u2019t want to duel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she won\u2019t submit, I\u2019ll kidnap and rape her. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>No. Simon surged to his feet, backing Christian against a bench. \u201cStay away from her.\u201d</p><p>The younger man flinched but kept talking. \u201cI\u2019ll parade her naked through the streets of London.\u201d</p><p>Dimly, Simon saw Newton coming down the aisle, Lucy\u2019s ghost-white face behind him. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll brand her a slut. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon backhanded him, throwing him against another table. \u201cShut your mouth!\u201d</p><p>The table quaked under Christian\u2019s weight. More pots exploded on the floor. Simon flexed his hand. His knuckles stung.</p><p>The younger man shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll sell her for tuppence a pop to any man who\u2019ll have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your bloody mouth, goddamn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d Lucy\u2019s voice, quavering.</p><p>\u201cShut it for me,\u201d Christian whispered, his teeth red with blood. \u201cDuel me.\u201d</p><p>Simon took a slow breath, fighting down his demons. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her, don\u2019t you? Would do anything for her.\u201d Christian leaned close enough that blood-flecked spittle struck him in the face. \u201cWell, I love my father. There is no other way for us.\u201d</p><p>God. \u201cChristian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuel me or I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll have to.\u201d The boy looked him straight in the eye.</p><p>Simon stared at him. Then his gaze traveled over the other man\u2019s head to Lucy\u2019s face. Straight, severe brows, mahogany hair pulled back in a simple knot, lips compressed in a line. Her beautiful topaz eyes were wide, pleading. Absently he noted that she still wore her cloak from an outing. Newton must\u2019ve just caught her as she returned home.</p><p>Impossible to chance her safety.</p><p>\u201cVery well. The morning after tomorrow. That will give you and me enough time to find seconds.\u201d His eyes flicked back to Fletcher. \u201cNow get out.\u201d</p><p>Christian turned and left.</p><p>TOO LATE. LUCY STOOD IN THE GREENHOUSE and watched her world crumble around her, despite all the efforts she\u2019d gone to this afternoon. She\u2019d arrived home from her mission too late.</p><p>Her husband\u2019s face had turned to graven stone. His eyes had lost any color they once might\u2019ve had. They were as cold now as the midnight frost that kills sparrows in their sleep. Mr. Fletcher brushed past her, but Lucy couldn\u2019t tear her gaze from Simon\u2019s expression. She hadn\u2019t heard their conversation, but she\u2019d seen him hit the younger man and seen the blood on Simon\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? What have you done to Mr. Fletcher?\u201d She didn\u2019t mean the words to sound so accusatory.</p><p>Behind her she heard the door close. They were alone in the conservatory. Newton had left as well.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to talk.\u201d Simon rubbed his hands together as if washing away imaginary dirt. They trembled. \u201cI need to find seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. You must talk to me.\u201d She felt almost dizzy from the perfume of the roses smashed on the floor. \u201cI went to meet Lady Fletcher. She and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his expression unchanged, and cut her off. \u201cI\u2019m to duel Christian Fletcher in two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Not again. She couldn\u2019t take another fight, another man dead, another portion of Simon\u2019s soul burned away. Oh, God, no more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He made to walk past her.</p><p>She grabbed his arm and felt it flex beneath her hand. She had to stop him. \u201cSimon, don\u2019t do this. Lady Fletcher has agreed to talk to her husband. She thinks he will see reason, that there might be another way\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off, his head bowed, his eyes not meeting hers. \u201cIt\u2019s Christian I\u2019m dueling, Lucy, no longer his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the hope remains the same,\u201d she insisted. She\u2019d made the effort, come up with a plan, gained Lady Fletcher\u2019s trust. It\u2019d all seemed so close, so possible half an hour before. Why didn\u2019t he understand? \u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I shall.\u201d His eyes were still averted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d They\u2014their marriage\u2014wouldn\u2019t survive this. Couldn\u2019t he see? \u201cI\u2019ll talk again with Lady Fletcher. We\u2019ll find another way to settle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no other way.\u201d He raised his head finally and she saw anger and despair in his eyes. \u201cThis is not your business. Talking to Lady Fletcher will solve nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must at least try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Lucy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just kill people!\u201d She flung his arm away, her mouth twisting bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. Don\u2019t you know that? It\u2019s immoral. Simon, it\u2019s evil. Don\u2019t let evil destroy your heart, your soul. I beg you, don\u2019t do this!\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t understand!\u201d Her chest was constricted. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. The heavy, humid air seemed too thick to inhale. She leaned forward and said fiercely, \u201cI went to church as a little girl. I know that\u2019s considered provincial to a sophisticated man like yourself, but I did. And the church says\u2014the Bible says\u2014that it is a sin to take the life of another.\u201d She had to stop to gasp, tasting the scent of roses on her tongue. \u201cAnd I believe that. It\u2019s a mortal sin, to murder a fellow human being, even if you try to hide it by dueling. It\u2019s murder, Simon. In the end, it\u2019s murder, and it will consume you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m a sinner and a murderer,\u201d he said quietly. He walked past her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your friend,\u201d she called desperately.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stopped at that, his back toward her. \u201cChristian is my friend, but he\u2019s also Fletcher\u2019s son. The son of Ethan\u2019s murderer. He challenged me, Lucy, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself.\u201d She fought against tears. \u201cYou\u2019re planning to kill a friend. A man you\u2019ve eaten with, talked with, laughed with. He admires you, Simon. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know he admires me.\u201d He finally swung around, and she saw a sheen of sweat on his upper lip. \u201cHe\u2019s spent the last month following me around; he apes my clothes and my mannerisms. How could I miss that he admires me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt does not matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he asked through gritted teeth. \u201cRefuse to duel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d She held out her palms, pleading. \u201cYes. Walk away. You\u2019ve already killed four men. Nobody will think the less of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Desperation made her voice quaver. \u201cYou\u2019ve avenged Ethan already. Please. Let\u2019s go to Maiden Hill or to your country estate or anywhere else. It doesn\u2019t matter, just as long as we leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Angry, hopeless tears blurred her vision. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Simon\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe threatened you.\u201d He stared into her eyes, and she saw tears and awful determination in his gaze. \u201cChristian threatened you.\u201d</p><p>She swiped at the wetness on her cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He stepped close and grabbed her upper arms. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m the sort of man to walk away from a threat to my wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe only said it to make you fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will follow you.\u201d She choked and her voice quavered. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you to the dueling place, and I\u2019ll run between you if I have to. I\u2019ll find a way to stop you when you duel. I can\u2019t let you do this, Simon, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush. No,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWe won\u2019t duel at the last place. You\u2019ll have no knowledge of the meeting spot. You can\u2019t stop me, Lucy.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed. He pulled her against his chest, and she felt his heartbeat, so strong under her cheek. \u201cPlease, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to finish this.\u201d His lips were on her forehead, murmuring against her skin.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Simon,\u201d she repeated like a prayer. She closed her eyes, felt the tears burn her face. \u201cPlease.\u201d She clutched his coat, smelled wool and his scent\u2014the scent of her husband. She wanted to say something to persuade him, but she didn\u2019t have the words. \u201cI\u2019ll lose you. We\u2019ll lose each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t change who I am, Lucy,\u201d she heard him whisper. \u201cEven for you.\u201d</p><p>He let her go and walked away.</p><p>\u201cI NEED YOU,\u201d SIMON SAID TO EDWARD DE RAAF an hour later in the Agrarians\u2019 coffeehouse. He was surprised at how rusty his voice sounded, as if he\u2019d been imbibing vinegar. Or sorrow. Don\u2019t think of Lucy. He had to concentrate on what needed to be done.</p><p>De Raaf must\u2019ve been surprised, too. Or maybe it was the words. He hesitated, then waved at the empty chair next to him. \u201cSit down. Have some coffee.\u201d</p> <p>Simon felt bile rise in his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want any coffee.\u201d</p><p>The other man ignored him. He gestured to a boy who, strangely, looked up and nodded. De Raaf turned back to him and frowned. \u201cI said sit down.\u201d</p><p>Simon sat.</p><p>The coffeehouse was nearly empty. Too late for the morning crowd, too early for the afternoon drinkers. The only other patron was an elderly man by the door in a dusty, full-bottom wig. He was mumbling to himself as he nursed a cup. The boy slammed down two mugs, snatched de Raaf\u2019s first, and whirled away before they could even thank him.</p><p>Simon stared at the steam drifting from the cup. He felt oddly cold, although the room was warm. \u201cI don\u2019t want any coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink it,\u201d de Raaf growled. \u201cDo you good. You look as if someone\u2019s kicked you in the bollocks, then told you your favorite rose died while you were still on the ground writhing.\u201d</p><p>Simon winced at the image. \u201cChristian Fletcher has challenged me to a duel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph. You\u2019re probably shaking in your red-heeled shoes.\u201d De Raaf\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat have you done to the boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. His father was in the conspiracy to kill Ethan.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf raised his black eyebrows. \u201cAnd he helped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf looked at him.</p><p>Simon\u2019s lips twisted as he fingered his mug. \u201cHe fights for his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would kill an innocent man?\u201d de Raaf asked mildly.</p><p>Christian was innocent of his father\u2019s crime. Simon took a sip of coffee and swore as it burned his tongue. \u201cHe\u2019s threatened Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you second me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The other man set his own mug down and leaned back in his chair, making it squeak with his weight. \u201cI knew this day would come.\u201d</p><p>Simon raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhen you could get a lad to bring you coffee?\u201d</p><p>De Raaf pretended not to hear. \u201cWhen you would come crawling to me for help\u2014\u201d</p><p>Simon snorted. \u201cI\u2019m hardly crawling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesperate. Your wig unpowdered and full of nits\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wig is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>De Raaf raised his voice to talk over him. \u201cUnable to find any other to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleading, begging, Oh, Edward, help me, do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Simon muttered.</p><p>\u201cThis is indeed a wonderful day.\u201d The other man lifted his cup again.</p><p>Simon\u2019s mouth curved in a reluctant smile. He took a careful sip of his coffee. Hot acid.</p><p>De Raaf grinned at him, waiting.</p><p>Simon sighed. \u201cAre you going to second me?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course. Be happy to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that. The duel isn\u2019t until the morning after tomorrow. You have a full day, but you should get started. You\u2019ll need to go \u2019round Fletcher\u2019s house. Find out who his seconds are and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a reputable physician, one who doesn\u2019t let blood at the drop of a hat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of how to second a duel,\u201d de Raaf interrupted with dignity.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Simon drained the coffee cup. The black liquid burned all the way down. \u201cTry to remember your sword, will you?\u201d</p><p>De Raaf looked insulted.</p><p>He stood.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>He turned back around and raised his brows.</p><p>De Raaf looked at him, all trace of humor gone from his face. \u201cIf you need me for anything else?\u201d</p><p>Simon looked at the big, scarred man for a moment and felt his throat swell. He swallowed before replying. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He strode from the coffeehouse before he started blubbering. The old man in the full-bottomed wig was snoring, facedown on the table, when he passed him. The bright afternoon sun hit Simon as he walked out. Despite the sunlight, the air was so cold his cheeks burned. He swung up on his gelding and guided him into the busy street. I must tell Lucy\u2014</p><p>Simon cut the thought short. He didn\u2019t want to think about Lucy, didn\u2019t want to remember the fear and hurt and rage on her face when he\u2019d left her in the greenhouse, but it was near impossible. Thinking of Lucy was ingrained in his bones now. He turned down a street lined with various small shops. She hated that he was dueling. Perhaps if he had something to give her tonight. He\u2019d never given her a wedding present . . .</p><p>Half an hour later, he exited a shop with a rectangular paper-wrapped parcel in his hand and a larger, bulkier one under his arm. The larger parcel was for his niece. He\u2019d noticed a toy shop on the street and remembered he ought to have something for Pocket on Christmas. His mouth twitched as he thought of what his sister-in-law would think of his present for her daughter. He remounted the horse, carefully juggling the parcels. No doubt Lucy would still be angry, but at least she would know that he was sincerely sorry that he\u2019d caused her distress. For the first time that day, he allowed himself to think about the next days. If he survived the duel, it would finally be over. He\u2019d be able to sleep in peace.</p><p>He could love Lucy in peace.</p><p>Maybe he would agree to her idea of travel. They could go to Maiden Hill for their first Christmas together and visit with the captain. He had no need to see the old coot again so soon, but Lucy might be missing her father by now. After the New Year they could tour Kent, then journey north to his lands in Northumberland, assuming the weather wasn\u2019t too bad. He hadn\u2019t been to the manor there in ages. It probably needed refurbishing, and Lucy could help him with that.</p><p>He looked up. His town house was ahead. For a moment he was disoriented. Had he ridden this far and not even noticed? Then he saw the carriage. His carriage. Footmen carried trunks down the front steps. Others were heaving them onto the back of the carriage, swearing from the weight. The coachman already sat on the box. Lucy appeared at the front door, mantled and hooded like a religious penitent.</p><p>He dismounted the horse ungracefully, hurriedly, panic welling in his chest. The rectangular package fell to the cobblestones and he left it.</p><p>She was descending the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLucy.\u201d He caught her by the shoulders. \u201cLucy.\u201d</p><p>Her face was cold and white beneath the hood. \u201cLet me go, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he hissed, knowing he looked a fool. Knowing the servants, Newton, passing strangers, and the neighbors watched. He didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Papa.\u201d</p><p>A ridiculous spurt of hope. \u201cWait and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Her cold lips barely moved as she mouthed the words.</p><p>Horror fisted around his vitals. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>For the first time she met his eyes. Hers were red-rimmed but dry. \u201cI have to leave, Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was a little boy denied a sweet. He felt like falling down and screaming.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d He half laughed here in the too-bright, cold London sun before his own house. \u201cI\u2019ll die if I do.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. I can\u2019t stay and watch you tear yourself apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Simon. Please.\u201d She opened her eyes, and he saw infinite pain in her gaze.</p><p>Had he done this to his angel? Oh, God. He unclasped his hands.</p><p>She brushed past him and walked down the steps, the wind playing with the hem of her mantle. He watched her climb into the carriage. The footman shut the door. Then the coachman slapped the reins, the horses stepped out, and the carriage pulled away. Lucy didn\u2019t look back. Simon watched until the carriage was lost in the bustle of the street. And still he stared.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Newton spoke beside him, probably not for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold, my lord.\u201d</p><p>So it was.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to go in,\u201d his butler said.</p><p>Simon flexed his hand, surprised that his fingertips were numb. He looked around. Someone had taken away his horse, but the rectangular package still lay on the cobblestones.</p><p>\u201cBest come inside, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Simon started down the steps.</p><p>\u201cThis way, my lord,\u201d Newton called as if Simon were a senile old man in danger of toddling into traffic.</p><p>Simon ignored him and picked up the package. The paper was torn at the corner. Perhaps he could have it rewrapped, this time in pretty paper. Lucy would like pretty paper. Except Lucy wouldn\u2019t ever see it. She\u2019d left him.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Newton still called.</p><p>\u201cYes, all right.\u201d Simon went inside, the package in his hand.</p><p>What else was there to do?</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Papa called from the doorway, his nightcap pulled down almost to his ears. He wore an old coat over his nightshirt and buckle shoes on his feet, wiry ankles poking out. \u201cIt\u2019s past nine o\u2019clock. Decent folk are all in their beds by now, y\u2019know.\u201d</p><p>He held a lantern high to throw light into the gravel drive before the Craddock-Hayes house. Behind him, Mrs. Brodie in mobcap and shawl peered over his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy opened the carriage door. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Papa.\u201d</p><p>He squinted, trying to see her in the gloom. \u201cLucy? What\u2019s Iddesleigh thinking to travel this late at night? Eh? Must\u2019ve gone mad. There\u2019s highwaymen about, or doesn\u2019t he know that?\u201d</p><p>Lucy descended the carriage steps with the help of a footman. \u201cHe isn\u2019t with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad,\u201d her father repeated. \u201cThe man\u2019s mad to let you travel alone, footmen or no. And at night. Bounder!\u201d</p> <p>She felt a contrary urge to defend Simon. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a say in it. I\u2019ve left him.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Brodie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019ll make tea, shall I?\u201d She turned and hurried into the house.</p><p>Papa merely harrumphed. \u201cCome home in a tiff, have you? Smart gel. Keeps a man on his toes when he doesn\u2019t know what a gel will do next. No doubt good for him. You can stay a couple of days and go home after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Lucy sighed. She was tired to her bones, tired to her soul. \u201cI\u2019m not going back to him. I\u2019ve left Simon for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What?\u201d Her father looked alarmed for the first time. \u201cNow see\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJaysus, don\u2019t anybody sleep around here?\u201d Hedge came around the corner, his nightshirt escaping from his breeches, gray hair poking out from a greasy tricorne. He caught sight of Lucy and stopped dead. \u201cIs she back already? Thought we just got her packed off the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see you, too, Mr. Hedge,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cPerhaps we can continue this conversation inside, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Hedge muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve been here nearly thirty years\u2014the best years of my life, too\u2014and does anyone care? No, they do not. I\u2019m still not to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to the horses, Hedge,\u201d Papa ordered as they went inside.</p><p>Lucy heard Hedge groan. \u201cFour big beasties. My back\u2019s not good . . .\u201d Then the door closed behind them.</p><p>Papa led the way into his study, a room that she wasn\u2019t used to entering. Papa\u2019s study was his own domain; even Mrs. Brodie wasn\u2019t allowed to clean it. Not, at least, without a lot of fussing first. Papa\u2019s great oak desk was placed at an angle to the fire, too close really, as was attested by the blackened wood on the leg nearest the hearth. The surface of the desk was obscured by piles of colorful maps. They were held in place by a brass sexton, a broken compass, and a short length of rope. To the side of the desk was an enormous globe of the world on its own stand.</p> <p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d her father started.</p><p>Mrs. Brodie bustled in with a tray of tea and buns.</p><p>Papa cleared his throat. \u201cBest see if there\u2019s some of your good steak and kidney pie left from dinner, Mrs. Brodie, if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Lucy began.</p><p>\u201cLooking pale, poppet. Steak and kidney pie do you good, eh?\u201d He nodded at the housekeeper.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Mrs. Brodie hurried out.</p><p>\u201cNow, then,\u201d Papa began again. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened that you\u2019ve come running home to your father?\u201d</p><p>Lucy felt her cheeks heat. Put like that, her actions sounded childish. \u201cSimon and I have had a difference of opinion.\u201d She looked down as she carefully pulled her gloves off, one finger at a time. Her hands were shaking. \u201cHe is doing something that I cannot agree with.\u201d</p> <p>Papa slammed his hand down on his desk, making her and the papers lying there jump. \u201cCad! Hasn\u2019t been married more than a few weeks and already messing with ladies of low repute. Ha! When I get my hands on that bounder, that scoundrel, that . . . that rake, I\u2019ll see him horsewhipped\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, oh, no.\u201d Lucy felt a bubble of hysterical laughter well up inside her. \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Mrs. Brodie came in again. She looked sharply at the two of them. She must\u2019ve heard their voices in the hall, but she didn\u2019t say anything. She set her tray on a table at Lucy\u2019s elbow and nodded. \u201cHave a bite of that, Miss Lucy. It\u2019ll make you feel better. I\u2019ll have the fire laid in your old bedroom, shall I?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, the housekeeper bustled out.</p><p>Lucy looked at the tray. There was a slice of cold meat pie, a bowl of stewed fruit, a bit of cheese, and some of Mrs. Brodie\u2019s fresh bread. Her stomach rumbled. She\u2019d declined supper at an inn on the way home, and she hadn\u2019t known she was hungry until now. She picked up a fork.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d Mouth full of tender pie, Lucy didn\u2019t want to think about Simon, his danger, or their failed marriage. If she could just go to bed . . .</p><p>But Papa was stubborn when he wanted to be. \u201cWhy\u2019d you leave the man if he wasn\u2019t carrying on with soiled doves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuels.\u201d Lucy swallowed. \u201cSimon has killed four men already. In duels. He calls them out and then kills them, and I can\u2019t take it anymore, Papa. He\u2019s destroying himself slowly, even if he survives the encounters. He won\u2019t listen to me, won\u2019t stop, so I left him.\u201d She looked down at her pie, oozing brown gravy, and suddenly felt nauseous.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Papa scowled. \u201cWhy\u2019s he killing these fellows? Don\u2019t like your husband, never have and, make no bones about it, probably never will. But he doesn\u2019t strike me as a loony. Popinjay, yes; loony, no.\u201d</p><p>Lucy almost smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s killing the men responsible for his brother, Ethan\u2019s, death, and I know what you\u2019re going to say, Papa, but however noble the reason, it\u2019s still murder and a sin in the Bible. My conscience can\u2019t abide it, and I don\u2019t think Simon\u2019s can either in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d her father grumbled. \u201cGlad to know I\u2019m so easily read by my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Lucy bit her lip. This wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d imagined coming home. Her head was beginning to pound, and apparently her father wanted an argument. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know.\u201d He waved away her apology. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to insult your old pater. But the fact is you did. Think all men feel the same, do you, gel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause we don\u2019t.\u201d Papa leaned forward and stabbed a finger at her nose to emphasize the point. \u201cDon\u2019t think killing for revenge is the thing at all. Seen too many men die for too little reason to condone it.\u201d</p><p>Lucy bit her lip. Papa was right; she\u2019d been too hasty in her judgment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand the man, though,\u201d he said over her words. He sat back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>Lucy flipped over the pie crust. The inside was rapidly congealing, white puddles of fat hardening on the surface of the gravy. She wrinkled her nose and set the plate aside. Her head had begun to pound in earnest now.</p><p>\u201cUnderstand and even sympathize,\u201d Papa suddenly said, making her jump. He popped up from his chair and began pacing. \u201cYes, sympathize with the man, damn him. Which is more than you do, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Lucy stiffened. \u201cI think I understand Simon\u2019s reasons for dueling these men. And I can sympathize with the loss of a loved one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can you sympathize with the man? Eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t quite see the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d Papa stared at her a moment, his brows beetling.</p><p>She had the sinking feeling that she\u2019d somehow let her father down. Sudden tears threatened. She was tired, so tired from traveling and the argument with Simon and all of the things that had happened before. Somewhere in the back of her mind she\u2019d thought surely Papa of all people would take her part in this catastrophe.</p><p>Papa stalked to the window and looked out, although he couldn\u2019t have seen anything but his reflection. \u201cYour mother was the finest woman I ever knew.\u201d</p><p>Lucy frowned. What?</p><p>\u201cWas two and twenty when I met her\u2014a very young lieutenant. She was a bonny lass, all dark curls and light brown eyes.\u201d He turned and looked at her over his shoulder. \u201cSame color as yours, poppet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve been told,\u201d she whispered. She still missed Mama\u2014the soft voice, the laughter, and the steady light she\u2019d been to her family. Lucy looked down, her eyes filling. It must be the fatigue.</p><p>\u201cMmph,\u201d Papa grunted. \u201cCould\u2019ve had her pick of any of the gentlemen hereabouts. In fact, it was very close at one point with a dragoon captain.\u201d He snorted. \u201cScarlet uniform. Always turned the ladies\u2019 heads\u2014and the bastard was taller.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mama chose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she chose me.\u201d Papa shook his head slowly. \u201cCould\u2019ve knocked me over with a feather, I was that surprised. But we were wed and we settled down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you lived happily ever after.\u201d Lucy sighed. She\u2019d heard the tale of her parents\u2019 courtship and marriage many times before when she was a girl. It\u2019d been a favorite bedtime story. Why couldn\u2019t her own marriage\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, there you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucy frowned. She couldn\u2019t have understood Papa correctly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife\u2019s not like a fairy tale, my girl.\u201d Papa turned fully around to face her. \u201cIn our fifth year of marriage, I came home from sea to find your mother had taken a lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lover?\u201d Lucy sat up straight in her amazement. Her mother had been kind and gentle and wonderful. Surely . . . \u201cYou must be wrong, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pursed his lips, frowning at his shoes. \u201cShe near threw the fact in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but . . .\u201d She tried to digest this information and failed completely. It was simply unbelievable. \u201cMama was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was the finest woman I ever knew. Already said that.\u201d Papa gazed down at the globe as if he were seeing something entirely different. \u201cBut I was away at sea for months at a time, and she had two small babies to take care of, all alone in this little village.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cShe told me she was lonely. And mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Lucy whispered.</p><p>\u201cGot angry. Stormed about, cursing a blue streak and yelling. You know me.\u201d Papa spun the globe. \u201cBut in the end I forgave her.\u201d He looked up. \u201cNever regretted it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Lucy frowned, groping for the words. \u201cHow could you forgive such an offense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Because I loved her, that\u2019s why.\u201d Papa tapped the globe, skewering Africa with his finger. \u201cAnd because I realized that even the finest of women is only human and can make a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a woman, not an ideal.\u201d Papa sighed now. He looked old, standing there in his nightshirt and cap, but at the same time stern and commanding. \u201cPeople make mistakes. Ideals don\u2019t. Think that\u2019s the first lesson that must be learned in any marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon has murdered.\u201d Lucy drew a deep, shuddering breath. No matter what Papa thought, their cases were very different. \u201cAnd he plans on doing it again. He\u2019s going to duel a dear friend, a man who looks up to him, and Simon will probably kill him. I know he\u2019s not an ideal, Papa, but how do you expect me to forgive that?\u201d How could he expect her to live with a man so bent on destruction?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Papa spun the globe a final time and stumped to the door. \u201cWell past your bedtime, gel. And mine. Get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Lucy stared after him, uncertain, tired, and confused.</p><p>\u201cBut remember this.\u201d He turned at the door to spear her with a look. \u201cI might not expect you to forgive, but God does. Says so right in your Bible. Think on that.\u201d</p><p>IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN INEVITABLE, really, that Lucy should leave him, Simon mused. The only surprise was how long it had taken her to go. He ought to be thankful he\u2019d had the few weeks of their marriage together, the days of happy companionship and the nights of sweet lovemaking. He carefully poured himself a tumbler of brandy. Carefully, because it was his second or perhaps third, and because his hands had begun to shake like a palsied old man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But that was a lie.</p><p>His hands had been shaking ever since Lucy had left yesterday afternoon. He trembled as if he had the ague, as if all the demons inside him had decided to make themselves physically felt. Demons of rage, demons of pain, demons of self-pity, and demons of love. They shook and rattled his frame, demanding acknowledgment. He\u2019d lost the ability to contain them anymore, and they had free rein of his soul now.</p><p>He grimaced to himself and swallowed a gulp of the amber liquor. It burned his throat all the way down. He probably wouldn\u2019t be able to hold his sword on the day of the duel. Wouldn\u2019t that be a surprise for Fletcher? To find him standing there, shaking and trembling, his sword fallen to his feet, useless. Christian would merely have to gut him and go home for breakfast. Hardly worth his time, when you thought about it. And Simon had nothing\u2014nothing at all\u2014to do between now and the duel on the morrow\u2019s dawn.</p><p>He picked up his glass and wandered from his study. The hall was dark and cold, even if it was only afternoon. Couldn\u2019t anyone keep enough fires lit to warm him? He had so many servants; he was a viscount, after all, and he\u2019d be ashamed to have less than fifty souls toiling over his every whim, night and day. He thought to bellow for Newton, but the butler had been hiding the entire day. Coward. He turned down the hall, his footsteps echoing in his big, lonely house. What had made him think for even a second that he and an angel could ever be united? That he\u2019d be able to hide from her the rage in his heart or the stain on his soul?</p> <p>Madness, pure madness.</p><p>Simon reached the doors to his conservatory and paused. Even from without he could smell them. Roses. So serene, so perfect. As a young boy, he\u2019d been mesmerized by the swirl of velvet petals that led to a secret center, hidden and shy, at the flower\u2019s heart. The thing about roses was that even when not in bloom, they required constant care. The leaves must be inspected for blight, mildew, and parasites. The soil must be carefully tended, weeded, and improved. The plant itself should be cut back in autumn, sometimes quite savagely, in order that it might bloom again in the spring. A demanding, selfish flower, the rose, but one that rewarded with spectacular beauty when well cared for.</p><p>He had a sudden memory of himself, young and unmade, sneaking into the rose garden to hide from his tutor. The gardener, Burns, tending to the roses, not noticing the boy stealing behind. Only, of course, the gardener must have noticed. Simon smirked. The old man had merely pretended not to know the boy was in the garden, ducking his studies. In that way both could coexist in the place they loved best without any to blame should they be discovered.</p><p>He laid his hand on the door feeling the cedar wood, imported specially when he\u2019d had this adult refuge made. Even as a grown man he went to the rose garden to hide.</p><p>Simon pushed open the door, and the humid air caressed his face. He could feel the sweat start along his hairline as he took a gulp of brandy. Newton had made sure the greenhouse was tidied again within an hour of Christian\u2019s departure. One would never know that there had been a fight here. He moved farther in and waited for the smell of loam and the sweet perfume of the roses to bring back his serenity. To return his soul to his body and make him whole again\u2014less a demon and more a man. They did not.</p> <p>Simon stared at the long row of benches, at the neatly ordered pots, at the plants, some mere thorny sticks, some flamboyantly in bloom. The colors assaulted his eyes, every shade of white and pink and red and all the imaginable hues in between: flesh pink, cold white, black crimson, and a rose the exact shade of Lucy\u2019s lips. It was a dazzling display that had taken him most of his adult life to collect, a masterpiece of horticulture.</p><p>He looked up to where the glass ceiling came to a perfect angle overhead, protecting the delicate plants within and keeping the chill London wind without. He looked down to the carefully laid bricks beneath his feet, arranged in a herringbone pattern, orderly and neat. The greenhouse was exactly as he\u2019d envisioned it ten years before, when he\u2019d had it built. It was in every way the culmination of all his dreams of refuge, of peace. It was perfect.</p><p>Except that Lucy was not here.</p><p>There would never again be peace for him. Simon tossed back the rest of the brandy, raised his tumbler high, and threw it to the bricks. Glass shattered across the path.</p><p>THE DARK CLOUDS HANGING LOW in the sky threatened rain or maybe even snow. Lucy shivered and chafed her hands together. She should\u2019ve worn mittens. Hoarfrost had delicately entombed the garden this morning, delineating each dead leaf, each frozen stem with white fur. She touched a withered apple and watched the frost melt in a perfect circle under the warmth from her fingertip. The apple beneath was still dead.</p><p>It was really too chill to be outside, but she was restless today, and the house felt confining. She\u2019d tried sitting inside, working on a sketch of a country kitchen still life: big earthen bowl, brown eggs, and Mrs. Brodie\u2019s freshly baked bread. The eggs had turned misshapen under her fingers, and her charcoal had broken against the paper, making a messy blotch.</p> <p>Strange. She\u2019d left Simon because she couldn\u2019t stand his choices. She\u2019d felt herself in turmoil, living with him while he killed or sought death himself. Lucy knit her brows. Perhaps she hadn\u2019t acknowledged it before, that part of her flight was fear\u2014the constant, agonizing worry that he might die in one of his duels. Yet here, in the quiet of her childhood home, the turmoil within herself was much worse. The silence, the very lack of drama, was almost oppressive. At least in London she could flail against Simon, argue his revenge. She could make love to him.</p><p>Here, she was alone. Simply alone.</p><p>She missed Simon. She\u2019d expected that there would be some yearning, the ache of loss when she\u2019d left him. After all, she cared for him very much. What she hadn\u2019t expected was that the ache would be a gigantic hole in the fabric of her life, a hole in her very being. She wasn\u2019t at all sure she could live without him. And while that sounded melodramatic, it was also sadly true. She very much feared that she would return to her husband not because of the morally sound argument put forth by her father\u2014that one should forgive the sinner\u2014but because of a mundane truth.</p><p>She could not live apart from him.</p><p>No matter what he\u2019d done, no matter what he would do in the future, no matter what he was, she still missed him. Still wanted to be with him. How appalling.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, it\u2019s freezing out here. Whatever are you doing, haunting the garden like the ghost of a wronged woman?\u201d</p><p>Lucy swung around at the irritable voice.</p><p>Patricia hopped from one foot to the other behind her. She\u2019d pulled her hood around her face and held a fur muff to her nose, obscuring all but her china-blue eyes. \u201cCome inside right now before you turn to ice.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy smiled at her friend. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>Patricia heaved a sigh of relief and scurried in the back door without waiting for her. Lucy followed behind.</p><p>When she came inside, Patricia already had her cloak and muff off. \u201cRemove that.\u201d The other woman gestured at Lucy\u2019s hood. \u201cAnd let\u2019s go in the sitting room. I\u2019ve already asked Mrs. Brodie for tea.\u201d</p><p>Soon they were seated in the little back room, a steaming pot of tea before them.</p><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d Patricia held her cup before her face, nearly bathing in the warm liquid. \u201cThank goodness Mrs. Brodie knows how to heat the water properly.\u201d She took a sip of tea and set down her cup in a businesslike manner. \u201cNow tell me about London and your new life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very busy,\u201d Lucy said slowly. \u201cLondon, that is. There is so much to see and do. We went to the theater not long ago and I adored it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky.\u201d Patricia sighed. \u201cI\u2019d love to see all the people in their finest clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Lucy smiled. \u201cMy sister-in-law, Rosalind, is quite kind. She\u2019s taken me shopping and shown me her favorite places. I have a niece as well. She plays with tin soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery unique. And your new husband?\u201d Patricia asked in a too-innocent tone. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon is well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I did notice that you came visiting without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn Christmas Eve.\u201d Patricia arched an eyebrow. \u201cYour first Christmas Eve together. And while I am aware that you are a deplorably unsentimental woman, I\u2019m nevertheless somewhat suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Lucy took care while pouring herself a second cup of tea. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s any of your business, Patricia.\u201d</p><p>Her friend looked shocked. \u201cWell, of course it isn\u2019t my business. If I confined my curiosity to matters strictly my business, I should never learn anything. Besides,\u201d Patricia said more prosaically, \u201cI care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lucy looked away to hide the tears that pricked at her eyes. \u201cWe did have a difference of opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA difference of opinion,\u201d Patricia repeated neutrally.</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>Then Patricia thumped the cushion beside her. \u201cDid that bastard take a mistress already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Lucy frowned at her, appalled. \u201cWhy does everyone immediately think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they?\u201d Patricia looked interested. \u201cProbably because he has that air about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat air?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u201d\u2014Patricia circled her hand vaguely\u2014\u201cas if he knows far more than he should about women.\u201d</p><p>Lucy blushed. \u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes him near irresistible.\u201d Patricia sipped her tea. \u201cSo it\u2019s all the more alarming that you were able to part from him. Especially, as I say, at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>A sudden thought struck Lucy. She set her cup down. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished his present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Lucy stared at her friend. \u201cI meant to illustrate a book for him, but it isn\u2019t finished.\u201d</p><p>Patricia looked satisfied. \u201cYou must be expecting to see him tomorrow, then . . .\u201d</p><p>Her friend continued, but Lucy wasn\u2019t listening. Patricia was right. Sometime in the last few minutes, she had made her decision: She would return to Simon, and they would somehow fix this problem between them.</p><p>\u201cAnd that reminds me,\u201d Patricia said. She pulled a small box from her pocket and held it out.</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t anything for you.\u201d Lucy pulled off the lid. Inside was a lady\u2019s handkerchief embroidered with her new initials. The letters were lopsided, it was true, but quite lovely anyway. \u201cHow thoughtful. Thank you, Patricia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you like it. I\u2019m afraid I punctured my fingers as often as the cloth.\u201d Her friend held out her right hand in evidence. \u201cAnd you do, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a present for me.\u201d Patricia withdrew her hand and inspected her fingernails.</p><p>Lucy looked at her, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI recently received an offer of matrimony, and since you had previously declined the gentleman in question and actually gone so far as to marry someone else\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatricia!\u201d Lucy jumped up to hug her friend, nearly knocking over the tea tray in the process. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to Eustace Penweeble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to old Mr. Benning and his ninety arable acres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Patricia pinned a gold curl back into place. \u201cAnd that grand manor. It really is a shame. But I\u2019m afraid that Mr. Penweeble quite overwhelmed all my good sense. I think it must be his height. Or perhaps his shoulders.\u201d She took a pensive sip of tea.</p><p>Lucy nearly giggled, only managing to control the impulse at the last moment. \u201cBut how did you get him to propose so fast? It took him three years with me.\u201d</p><p>Patricia looked demure. \u201cIt might\u2019ve been my fichu.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour fichu?\u201d Lucy glanced at the innocent bit of lace about Patricia\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYes. Mr. Penweeble had taken me for a drive and somehow\u201d\u2014Patricia\u2019s eyes widened\u2014\u201cit came undone. Well, I couldn\u2019t get it tucked back in properly. So I asked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsked him what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, to tuck it back in my bodice for me, naturally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPatricia,\u201d Lucy breathed.</p><p>\u201cFor some reason he felt compelled to propose to me after that.\u201d Patricia smiled like a cat with a saucer of cream. \u201cWe\u2019re to have an engagement party on Boxing Day. You\u2019ll stay for that, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lucy carefully set her teacup down. \u201cI wish I could, dear. But I must get back to Simon. You\u2019re right. I should spend Christmas with him.\u201d</p><p>Now that she had made the decision, she felt an urge to be off at once. It was important somehow to return to Simon as soon as possible. Lucy stilled the impulse and folded her hands in her lap. Patricia was talking about her forthcoming marriage and she should listen. The drive to London took hours.</p><p>Surely a few minutes more would make no difference either way.</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d his wife demanded before Sir Rupert had even crossed his own threshold.</p><p>He frowned, startled, as he handed the sleepy footman his hat and cloak. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d It couldn\u2019t be much past five in the morning.</p><p>With Walker and James gone, his investments had become precarious. He\u2019d spent the night, as he had the last several, working to ensure they wouldn\u2019t topple. But what was Matilda doing up at this hour?</p><p>His wife\u2019s eyes darted to the footman, trying hard not to appear as if he were listening. \u201cMay I speak to you in your study?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He led the way to his sanctuary and immediately sank into the chair behind the desk. His leg ached terribly.</p> <p>His wife closed the door softly behind her. \u201cWhere have you been? You\u2019ve hardly spoken the last several days. You\u2019ve secluded yourself in here. We don\u2019t even see you at meals. That is what I am referring to.\u201d She advanced toward him, back militarily erect, the green batiste of her gown shushing across the carpet. He noticed that the skin around her jawline had softened, sagging a bit, creating a plump pouch under her chin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m busy, my dear. Merely that.\u201d He absently rubbed at his thigh.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cDon\u2019t palm me off. I\u2019m not one of your business cronies. I\u2019m your wife. Lady Iddesleigh called on me two days ago.\u201d She frowned as his curse interrupted her words, but continued. \u201cShe told me a fantastic story about you and the viscount. She said that he was intent on calling you out. Cut line and tell me the problem.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking beneath his rump. It was a good thing Matilda was a female; she would have been a frightening man. He hesitated, considering. He\u2019d spent the time since Iddesleigh had threatened him in contemplation. Pondering how he could eliminate a viscount without being implicated. The problem was that the best way had already been used with Ethan Iddesleigh. That plan had been so simple, so elegant. Distribute rumors, force a man into calling a much better swordsman out . . . death had been inevitable, and it hadn\u2019t been traced back to him personally. Other ways\u2014hiring killers, for instance\u2014were much more apt to be brought home to him. But if Iddesleigh persisted, the risk might have to be taken.</p><p>Matilda lowered herself into one of the armchairs before his desk. \u201cThink on it all you want, but you must at least bestir yourself enough to go look for Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d He looked up. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him in the last two days, have you?\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s been almost as dour as you, moping about the house, snapping at his sisters. And the other day he came home with his lip bloodied\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sir Rupert stood, fumbling for his cane.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d His wife\u2019s eyes widened in exasperation. \u201cHadn\u2019t you noticed? He said he\u2019d stumbled and fallen, but it was quite obvious he\u2019d been in some type of fisticuffs. Not at all what I expect from our son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wasn\u2019t I told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would bother to talk to me . . .\u201d Matilda\u2019s gaze sharpened. \u201cWhat is it? What are you keeping from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIddesleigh.\u201d Sir Rupert took two steps to the door and stopped. \u201cWhere is Christian now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He never came home last night. That is why I\u2019ve waited up for you.\u201d Matilda had stood, clasping her hands before her. \u201cRupert, what\u2014?\u201d</p><p>He swung on her. \u201cIddesleigh did indeed mean to call me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian knew. God, Matilda.\u201d He thrust his hands into his hair. \u201cHe might\u2019ve challenged Iddesleigh to prevent him dueling me.\u201d</p><p>His wife stared at him. The blood slowly left her face, leaving it pasty and crumpled, showing every one of her years. \u201cYou must find him.\u201d Her lips hardly moved. \u201cYou must find him and stop him. Lord Iddesleigh will kill him.\u201d</p><p>He stared for a moment, frozen by the horrible truth.</p><p>\u201cDear husband.\u201d Matilda held out her hands like a supplicant. \u201cI know you have done things. That there are dark actions in your past. I\u2019ve never questioned you before, never wanted to know just what you did. But, Rupert, don\u2019t let our boy die for your sins.\u201d</p><p>Her words were a spur, galvanizing him into action. He limped to the door, his cane knocking loudly against the marble in the hall. Behind him, his wife had begun to sob, but he heard her nonetheless. \u201cDon\u2019t let Christian die for you.\u201d</p><p>A CAT\u2014OR MAYBE A RAT\u2014RAN ACROSS the path of his horse as Simon rode up the street. Not yet dawn, the blackest part of the night, this was the dominion of Hecate, goddess of crossroads and barking dogs. It was that strange place in between night and day when the living felt not quite safe. The only sound in the deserted street was the muffled clop of his gelding\u2019s hoofs. The corner drabs had already taken to their sad beds, the street mongers were not yet up. He could\u2019ve been riding through a necropolis. A frozen necropolis, snowflakes weeping silently from the sky.</p><p>He\u2019d ridden more than half the night away, meandering from the white town houses of Grosvenor Square to the stews of Whitechapel. Strangely, he\u2019d not been accosted, prime pickings though he most obviously was\u2014an aristocrat stinking of drink and not aware of his surroundings. A pity that. He could\u2019ve used the distraction of a nasty robbery, and it might\u2019ve solved all his troubles. But instead, here he was alive just before dawn with a duel to fight.</p><p>De Raaf\u2019s town house was up ahead. Somewhere. Or at least he thought so. He was so exhausted, weary unto death. Sleep no longer comforted him, no longer brought him a measure of peace. He hadn\u2019t slept since Lucy had left him two days before. Perhaps he\u2019d never sleep again. Or sleep forever, after this dawn. Simon smirked at his own small wit. The horse turned in to a mews, and he straightened a bit in the saddle, looking for the back of de Raaf\u2019s town house. As he neared, a shape separated itself from the black shadows by a gate.</p><p>\u201cIddesleigh,\u201d de Raaf murmured, his low voice startling the gelding.</p><p>Simon gentled the horse. \u201cDe Raaf. Where\u2019s your mount?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Round here.\u201d The big man opened the gate and ducked inside.</p><p>Simon waited, noticing for the first time the bite of the winter\u2019s wind. He glanced up. The moon was down, but it would\u2019ve been covered with clouds had it still hung in the sky. The coming day would be bleak. Just as well.</p><p>De Raaf returned, leading his ugly bay. A soft bag was strapped to the back of the beast behind the saddle. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a wig. You look naked without one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Simon ran his hand over his short hair before he remembered. The wig had fallen off in a lane during the night, and he\u2019d not bothered to retrieve it. No doubt it now decorated the head of some urchin. He shrugged. \u201cNo matter.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf eyed him in the dark before mounting his horse. \u201cI can\u2019t think your new bride will approve of you trying to get your gut perforated on Christmas morn of all days. Does she know what you intend to do?\u201d</p><p>Simon raised his eyebrows. \u201cHow does your own lady feel about you attending a duel on Christmas?\u201d</p><p>The big man winced. \u201cNo doubt Anna would hate it. I hope to be home before she wakes and finds me gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Simon turned his horse\u2019s head.</p><p>De Raaf nudged his horse into a walk beside him. They rode abreast back to the lane.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d The big man broke the silence, his breath steaming in the light from a window they passed.</p><p>\u201cLucy\u2019s feelings are moot.\u201d Something inside Simon tore at the thought of his angel. He flexed his jaw before admitting, \u201cShe\u2019s left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Simon scowled. \u201cHow do you know it was my fault?\u201d</p><p>De Raaf simply lifted one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cShe disapproves of dueling,\u201d Simon said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. She disapproves of killing. Of murder.\u201d</p><p>The other man snorted. \u201cCan\u2019t see why.\u201d</p><p>It was Simon\u2019s turn to give a speaking look.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you dueling, man?\u201d de Raaf barked impatiently. \u201cChrist, it isn\u2019t worth losing your wife over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threatened her.\u201d The memory still made his hands clench. Friend or no, Christian had threatened to rape Lucy. He could not be allowed to get away with that offense.</p><p>De Raaf grunted. \u201cThen let me handle Fletcher. You won\u2019t even have to get involved.\u201d</p><p>Simon glanced at him sideways. \u201cThank you, but Lucy is my wife.\u201d</p><p>The big man sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Simon squeezed the gelding into a trot, forestalling any further conversation.</p><p>They wound their way through more dingy streets. The wind whistled its remorse around corners. A cart passed, rumbling on the cobblestones. Simon finally saw movement on the sidewalk. Silent shapes, still infrequent, that slunk or scurried or loped. The denizens of the day had begun their rounds, careful in the dark that still concealed the dangers of night. Simon looked at the sky again. It had barely lightened to a nasty gray-brown. The snow lay in a thin, white layer on the street, covering filth and foul odors, giving it the illusion of purity. Soon the horses would stir it into muddy slush and the illusion would be gone.</p><p>\u201cDamn, it\u2019s cold,\u201d de Raaf huffed from behind.</p><p>Simon didn\u2019t bother replying. They entered the path into the green. Here, the landscape was quiet. No human had disturbed the pristine snow yet.</p><p>\u201cAre his seconds here?\u201d De Raaf broke the quiet.</p><p>\u201cThey must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. Whatever\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Simon glanced at the other man. \u201cBe still, Edward. It\u2019s past the time for that.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf grunted, frowning.</p><p>Simon hesitated. \u201cIf I\u2019m killed, you\u2019ll look after Lucy, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist\u2014\u201d De Raaf bit off whatever he was going to say and glared. \u201c\u2019Course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. She\u2019s with her father in Kent. You\u2019ll find her direction and a letter on my desk. I\u2019d appreciate it if you could deliver the letter to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she doing in Kent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRepairing her life, I hope.\u201d Simon\u2019s mouth quirked sadly. Lucy. Would she mourn for him? Would she wear the dingy weeds of a widow and weep sweet salt tears? Or would she forget him soon and find consolation in the arms of the country vicar? He found to his surprise that he could still feel jealousy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucy, my Lucy.</p><p>Two lanterns flickered against dim figures ahead. They were actors in an inevitable drama. The boy, who until a few days ago he\u2019d regarded as a friend, the men who would watch him kill or be killed, the doctor who would pronounce a man dead.</p><p>Simon checked his sword, then nudged his horse into a trot. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMY LADY.\u201d NEWTON\u2019S FACE RELAXED almost into a smile before he recovered and bowed, the tassel of his nightcap flopping over his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve returned.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Lucy pulled back her hood and stepped over the threshold into her town house. Good Lord, did all the servants know her\u2014their\u2014business? Silly question. Of course they did. And, judging from Newton\u2019s hastily covered surprise, they hadn\u2019t expected her to come back to Simon. Lucy leveled her shoulders. Well. Best put that notion out of their heads. \u201cIs he here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady. His lordship left not half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>Lucy nodded, trying not to show her disappointment. She had come so close to seeing him before he did this thing. She would\u2019ve liked to wish him luck at least. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for him in the study.\u201d</p><p>She laid the blue leather-bound book she carried on the hall table next to a rather battered brown paper package and gave it a small pat.</p><p>\u201cMy lady.\u201d Newton bowed. \u201cMay I wish you merry Christmas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you.\u201d She\u2019d set out late from Kent, despite Papa\u2019s protests, and made the last leg of the journey through the dark of night, thankful for the hired footmen clutching the back of the carriage. In all the whirl, she\u2019d almost forgotten what day it was. \u201cA merry Christmas to you as well, Mr. Newton.\u201d</p><p>Newton bowed again and glided away in his Turkish slippers. Lucy picked up a candelabra from the hall table and entered Simon\u2019s study. As she crossed to a chair before the fireplace, the candle flames lit two small prints in the corner that she hadn\u2019t noticed before. Curious, she wandered over to inspect them.</p><p>The first was a botanist\u2019s rendition of a rose, full-blown and pink, its petals spread shamelessly wide. Underneath the rose was its dissection, showing the various parts, all properly labeled, as if to bring decorum to the sprawl of the flower above.</p><p>The second print was medieval, probably one of a series that would have illustrated the Bible. It depicted the story of Cain and Abel. Lucy held the candelabra up to study the horrible little etching. Cain\u2019s eyes were wide, his muscles bulging bestially as he struggled with his brother. Abel\u2019s face was calm, unalarmed as his brother killed him.</p><p>She shivered and turned away. It was horrible to have to wait for him like this. She\u2019d never known before what he was doing. But now . . . She\u2019d vowed to herself that she would not argue with him, even if she hated what he was about to do, even if he killed a friend, even if she was in terror for his very life. When he returned, she would welcome him as a loving wife should. She would get him a glass of wine, she would rub his shoulders, and she would make it clear that she was staying with him forever. Whether he dueled or not.</p><p>Lucy shook herself. Best not to think of the duel at all. She set her candelabra on the desk and went to one of the elegant rosewood bookcases to look at the titles. Perhaps she could distract herself with reading. She scanned the spines: horticulture, agriculture, roses, and more roses, with a single treatise, probably valuable, on fencing. She selected a large volume on roses and placed it on the edge of the desk. She was about to open it, perhaps learn enough to be able to discuss the flower with her husband, when she glanced at the blotting paper before the desk chair. There was a letter on it. Lucy angled her head.</p> <p>Her name was scrawled across the top.</p><p>She stared for a moment, her neck still crooked; then Lucy straightened and walked around the desk. She hesitated a second longer before snatching up the letter, ripping it open and reading:</p><p>My Dearest Angel,</p><p>Had I known what despair I would bring you, I swear I would\u2019ve done my damnedest not to be left half dead almost at your doorstep that afternoon, so long ago now. But then I wouldn\u2019t have met you\u2014and already I am forsworn. For even knowing the pain I\u2019ve brought you, I do not regret loving you, my angel. I am a selfish, uncaring cad, but there it is. I cannot unmake myself. Meeting you was the most wondrous thing that has ever happened to me. You are the closest I will ever come to heaven, either here on Earth or in the afterlife, and I will not regret it, not even at the cost of your tears.</p><p>So I go to my grave an unrepentant sinner, I\u2019m afraid. There is no use in mourning one such as I, dearest. I hope you can resume your life in Maiden Hill, perhaps marry that handsome vicar. De Raaf has my business papers and will look after you as long as you need him.</p><p>\u2014Your Husband, Simon</p><p>Lucy\u2019s hands were shaking so badly the paper cast wild shadows against the wall, and it took her a moment to see the postscript at the bottom:</p><p>P.S. Actually, there is one thing I regret. I would\u2019ve very much liked to have made love to you one more time. Or three. \u2014S</p> <p>She laughed, horribly, through the tears blurring her vision. How like Simon to make salacious jokes even while writing a farewell love letter. For that was what the note was: a good-bye in case he died. Had he written letters like this before all of his duels? There was no way of telling; he would\u2019ve destroyed them on his return.</p><p>Oh, God, she wished she\u2019d never entered the room.</p><p>Lucy dropped the letter back on the desk and hurried out the door, snatching up the candelabra on her way out. Somehow reading Simon\u2019s words as if he were already dead made the waiting far worse. It was just another duel, she tried to reassure herself. How many had he fought now? Three? Five? She\u2019d lost count and he must have, too. He\u2019d won each before. He\u2019d returned to her bloodied but alive. Alive. Any argument, any problem they had, could be resolved if he just returned to her alive. Lucy looked up and found that her feet had taken her to Simon\u2019s conservatory. She placed her palm against the wooden door, so solid and comforting, and pushed. Perhaps if she strolled the greenhouse with its rows of pots\u2014</p><p>The door swung open and she froze. Broken glass glittered everywhere.</p><p>Simon\u2019s conservatory had been destroyed.</p><p>\u201cIF YOU DON\u2019T MIND, MY LORD?\u201d one of Christian\u2019s seconds asked. The man was narrow-chested with large, bony hands springing strangely from the delicate wrists of a girl. He blinked nervously in the lantern light and almost shied when Simon turned to him.</p><p>Oh, grand. The end of his life would be presided over by a boy hardly old enough to shave. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Simon muttered impatiently. He tore open the neck of his shirt, popping a button off. It landed in the fluff of snow at his feet and sank, creating a short tunnel. He didn\u2019t bother retrieving it.</p><p>The second peered at his chest, presumably to confirm that he wasn\u2019t wearing chain mail under his shirt.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get on with it.\u201d Simon swung his arms, trying to keep warm. There was no point in donning his waistcoat and coat again. He\u2019d be sweating soon enough, even in shirtsleeves.</p><p>Twenty feet away, he could see de Raaf. The big man grunted and gave Christian back his sword. The younger man nodded and walked toward Simon. Simon studied him. Christian\u2019s face was white and set, his ginger hair like a dark flame. The boy was tall and handsome. No lines marred his cheeks. Only months ago at Angelo\u2019s academy, Christian had walked toward him as he did now. Simon\u2019s regular sparring partner had reneged, and Angelo had sent him Christian to practice against instead. On that occasion, the young man\u2019s face had betrayed nervousness, curiosity, and a little awe. Now his face was expressionless. He\u2019d learned well in just a few months.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Christian\u2019s voice was without inflection.</p><p>The thin-wristed second approached to give Simon back his sword. \u201cOught we to wait until it\u2019s brighter? The sun isn\u2019t even up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon took his sword and pointed with the tip. \u201cPut the lanterns to either side of us.\u201d</p><p>He watched as de Raaf and the other seconds followed his directions.</p><p>Simon flexed his knees and raised his left hand behind his head. He caught de Raaf\u2019s eye. \u201cRemember Lucy.\u201d</p><p>De Raaf nodded grimly.</p><p>Simon turned to face his opponent. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllez!\u201d</p><p>Christian sprang like a fox\u2014healthy, young, and feral. Simon brought his sword up just in time, swearing under his breath. He parried the blow and retreated, his rear foot sliding in the crust of snow. He stabbed under the other man\u2019s guard, almost catching him in the side, but Christian was too fast. Steel rang as his sword was deflected. Simon\u2019s breath rasped loudly in his own ears. The air bit his lungs with cold on each inhale. He grunted and parried another attack. Strong and swift, Christian moved like an athlete of old. Simon grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou find this amusing?\u201d the younger man panted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Simon coughed as the cold air seemed to drive too deeply into his lungs and fell back again under a flurry of slashes. \u201cI merely admire your form.\u201d His wrist ached and the muscle on his upper arm was beginning to burn, but it was important to make a good show.</p><p>Christian looked at him suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cReally. You\u2019ve improved enormously.\u201d Simon smiled and darted at an opening.</p><p>Christian leaned back. The tip of Simon\u2019s sword grazed his left cheek, leaving a scarlet line behind. Simon\u2019s smile widened. He hadn\u2019t thought he would make contact.</p><p>\u201cBlood!\u201d Christian\u2019s second called.</p><p>De Raaf didn\u2019t even bother. Both duelists ignored the shout.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d the younger man said.</p><p>Simon shrugged. \u201cSomething to remember me by.\u201d</p><p>Christian struck at his flank.</p><p>Simon pivoted, his feet slipping again in the icy snow. \u201cWould you have hurt Lucy?\u201d</p><p>Christian sidestepped, his arm still moving easily despite the blood painting half his face. \u201cWould you have killed my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The younger man ignored his answer and feinted, drawing Simon\u2019s blade down. Fire slashed across his brow.</p><p>\u201cDamn!\u201d Simon jerked his head back. The blood was already running into his right eye, blinding it. He blinked, his eye stinging. He heard de Raaf swearing in a low, steady monotone.</p><p>\u201cSomething to remember me by.\u201d Christian repeated his words without smiling.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have long.\u201d</p><p>Christian stared, then lunged forward violently. Simon blocked the blow. For a second they were locked together, Christian bearing down, Simon holding him off with the strength of his shoulder. Then, slowly\u2014incredibly\u2014Simon\u2019s arm gave. The sword point slid, screeching, toward him. De Raaf shouted hoarsely. The sword point stabbed into Simon, high on his right chest. He gasped and felt the steel scrape against his collarbone, felt the jar as the point hit his shoulder blade and stopped. He brought his own sword up between their sweating, surging bodies and saw Christian\u2019s eyes widen as he understood the peril. The younger man jumped back, the hilt of his sword slipping out of his grasping hand. Simon cursed as the buried sword tip pulled like a damned viper, but remained steadfastly planted in his flesh.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t time yet.</p><p>Simon ignored the agony in his shoulder and slashed at Christian, keeping the man away from the bobbing hilt. Sweet heaven, he must look like a puppet with a stick jutting from his shoulder. What an ignoble way to die. His opponent stared at him, out of reach but unarmed. The sword in his chest sagged, dragging on his muscle. Simon tried to reach the hilt. He could just grasp it but hadn\u2019t the leverage to pull it from his own body. Blood soaked his shirt, growing colder with each passing minute. Christian\u2019s second was standing shocked in the bloody, churned snow. Christian himself seemed nonplussed. Simon understood the other man\u2019s dilemma. To win the duel, Christian must pull his sword from Simon\u2019s shoulder. But in order to reach his sword, he must first face Simon\u2019s sword unarmed. And yet what could Simon do with the damn thing sticking out in front of him? He couldn\u2019t pull it out, and he couldn\u2019t really fight with it weaving and bobbing before him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Impasse.</p><p>De Raaf had grown silent, but now he spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Simon hissed. He kept his eyes on the younger man. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Christian eyed him warily\u2014as well he should.</p> <p>Meanwhile, de Raaf still pleaded. \u201cHe was your friend. You can end this, Fletcher.\u201d</p><p>Christian shook his head. Blood from the cut on his cheek already stained his collar. Simon wiped the gore from his eye and smiled. He would die today; he knew it. What point in living without Lucy? But he would have an honorable death. He would make the boy work for his kill. Despite the blood soaking his shirt, despite the fire eating at his shoulder, despite the weariness weighing down his soul, he would have a real fight. A real death.</p><p>\u201cTake it,\u201d he repeated softly.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The light from Lucy\u2019s candles shone on the conservatory floor. Glass shards sparkled there like a carpet of diamonds. Lucy stared dazedly at them a moment before she noticed the chill. She looked up. The wind was whistling through what had once been a glass roof, making her candle flames flicker and threaten to go out. She held the candelabra higher. Every pane in the greenhouse was jagged and broken. The sky, graying with the threat of day, hung too low.</p> <p>Who . . . ?</p><p>She moved into the greenhouse almost without volition. The glass crunched beneath her boots, scraping against the brick walk. Terra-cotta pots were in drifts on the tables, broken and crushed, as if a great, angry wave had tossed them there. Lucy stumbled down the aisle, the bits of glass sliding beneath her shoes. Upturned roses in various states of bloom were scattered everywhere. One ball of roots hung from a windowpane overhead. Pink and red blooms bled petals on the floor, their familiar perfume curiously absent. Lucy touched a flower and felt it melt and shrivel beneath the warmth of her hand. It was frozen. The bitter winter air had been let in to savage the sheltered blooms. Dead. All the roses were dead.</p><p>Dear God.</p><p>Lucy reached what had been the dome in the middle of the conservatory and stopped. Only a skeleton, bits of glass skin still clinging here and there, remained. The marble fountain was chipped and cracked as if a giant hammer had been taken to it. A frozen plume of ice stood in the fountain, stilled in mid-splash. More ice spilled from a crack in the fountain and widened into a frozen lake around it. Beneath the ice, shards of glass glittered, horribly beautiful.</p><p>Lucy swayed in shock. A gust of wind moaned through the conservatory and blew out all but one of her candles. Simon must have done this. He\u2019d destroyed his fairyland conservatory. Why? She sank to her knees, huddled on the cold floor, her one remaining flame cradled in her numb palms. She\u2019d seen how tenderly Simon had cared for his plants. Remembered the look of pride when she\u2019d first discovered the dome and fountain. For him to have smashed all this . . .</p><p>He must have lost hope. All hope.</p> <p>She\u2019d left him, even though she\u2019d promised not to on her mother\u2019s memory. He loved her and she\u2019d left him. A sob tore at her throat. Without hope, how could he survive the duel? Would he even try to win? If she knew where he would duel, she might stop him. But she had no idea where this duel would take place. He\u2019d warned her that he would hide the dueling rendezvous from her and he had. She couldn\u2019t stop him, she realized achingly. He was going to duel; he might be there already, preparing to fight in the cold and dark, and she couldn\u2019t stop him. She couldn\u2019t save him.</p><p>There was nothing for her to do.</p><p>Lucy looked around the ruined conservatory, but there was no answer here. Dear God, he would die. She would lose him without ever having the chance to tell him how much he meant to her. How much she loved him. Simon. Alone in the dark, destroyed greenhouse she wept, her body shaking with sobs and the cold, and she finally acknowledged what she had kept hidden deep in her heart. She loved her husband.</p><p>She loved Simon.</p><p>Her last candle flickered and went out. She drew a breath and wrapped her arms about herself, bent as if broken. She lifted her face to the gray sky as silent, ghostly snowflakes dropped and melted on her lips and eyelids.</p><p>Above her, the dawn broke on London.</p><p>DAWN WAS BREAKING ON LONDON. The expressions on the faces of the men around Simon were no longer in shadow. Daylight filtered across the dueling green. He could see the desperation in Christian\u2019s eyes as he darted forward, his teeth clenched and bared, his red hair matted with sweat at the temples. Christian grabbed the sword in Simon\u2019s shoulder and wrenched at it. Simon gasped as the blade sawed at his flesh. Scarlet drops fell to the snow at his feet. He leveled his own sword and swung blindly. Violently. Christian ducked to the side, almost losing the hilt of his sword. Simon slashed again, felt the blade connect. A spray of blood decorated the snow, then was trampled underfoot, mixing with Simon\u2019s scarlet drops until all was a muddy mess.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d Christian moaned.</p> <p>His breath blew in Simon\u2019s face, foul with fear. His face was white and scarlet, the wash of blood on his left cheek only a shade darker than the freckles underneath. So young. Simon felt an absurd urge to apologize. He shivered; his blood-soaked shirt was freezing. It had begun to snow again. He looked at the sky over Christian\u2019s head and thought, ridiculously, I shouldn\u2019t have to die on a gray day.</p><p>Christian sobbed hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>The shout came from behind him. Simon ignored it, bringing his sword up one last time.</p><p>But then de Raaf was there, his own sword drawn. \u201cStop, Simon.\u201d The big man interposed his blade between them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Simon panted. He was dizzy and only just kept from reeling.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to the man,\u201d de Raaf growled.</p><p>Christian froze. \u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert limped slowly through the snow, his face nearly as white as his son\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t kill, him, Iddesleigh. I concede. Don\u2019t kill my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcede what?\u201d Was this a trick? Simon glanced at Christian\u2019s horrified face. Not on the son\u2019s part, at least.</p><p>Sir Rupert was silent, using his breath to laboriously walk closer.</p><p>\u201cJesus. Let\u2019s get this skewer out of you.\u201d De Raaf placed a fist on Simon\u2019s shoulder and tugged Christian\u2019s sword out with one swift motion.</p><p>Simon couldn\u2019t keep a moan from escaping his lips. His vision darkened for a second. He blinked fiercely. Now wasn\u2019t the time to faint. He was vaguely aware that blood was pouring from the wound on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d de Raaf muttered. \u201cYou look like a butchered pig.\u201d He opened the bag he\u2019d brought with him and took out a handful of linens, wadding and shoving them into the wound.</p><p>God\u2019s balls! The pain was near unbearable. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get a doctor?\u201d Simon asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>De Raaf shrugged. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find one I trusted.\u201d He pressed harder.</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d Simon inhaled a hissing breath. \u201cGoddamnit. So I have you to physic me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Aren\u2019t you going to thank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Simon grunted. He looked at Sir Rupert, refusing to flinch as de Raaf tended his shoulder. \u201cWhat do you concede?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Christian began.</p><p>Sir Rupert made a slashing motion with his hand, cutting him off. \u201cI concede I am responsible for your brother\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder,\u201d Simon growled. He gripped his sword tighter, although de Raaf stood between him and the others, blocking the movement of his blade. The big man chose that moment to put his other hand at his back and press his palms together, squeezing the shoulder. Simon bit back an oath.</p><p>De Raaf looked pleased. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert nodded. \u201cYour brother\u2019s murder. I am to blame. Punish me, not my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Christian shouted. He lurched forward, limping like his father.</p><p>Simon saw the other man\u2019s right leg was blood-soaked below the thigh. His sword had found its mark. \u201cKilling your son would punish you most satisfactorily,\u201d Simon drawled.</p><p>Edward, facing him, lifted his eyebrow so only he could see.</p><p>\u201cKilling Christian also takes an innocent life,\u201d Sir Rupert said. He leaned forward, both hands on the head of his cane, his eyes fixed on Simon\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ve never killed an innocent before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment no one spoke. The snow fell silently. Simon stared at his brother\u2019s murderer. The man admitted it\u2014all but crowed the fact that he\u2019d arranged Ethan\u2019s death. He felt hatred rise in him like bile at the back of his throat, nearly overwhelming reason. But however much he might loathe Sir Rupert, he was right. Simon had never killed an innocent man.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Simon asked finally.</p><p>Sir Rupert took a breath. He thought he\u2019d won a concession, damn him. And he had. \u201cI will pay you the price of your brother\u2019s life. I can sell my London home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christian burst out. Snowflakes had melted on his eyelashes like tears.</p><p>But Simon was already shaking his head. \u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>His father ignored Christian, intent on persuading Simon. \u201cOur country estates\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mother and my sisters?\u201d Christian\u2019s thin-wristed friend approached and tried to tend his wound, but Christian waved him away impatiently.</p><p>Sir Rupert shrugged. \u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t done any wrong,\u201d his son said. \u201cMother adores London. And what of Julia, Sarah, and Becca? Will you beggar them? Make it impossible that they ever marry well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Sir Rupert shouted. \u201cThey are women. What other avenue would you have me consider?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would sacrifice their futures\u2014their very happiness\u2014to prevent me dueling Simon?\u201d Christian stared incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYou are my heir.\u201d Sir Rupert held out a shaking hand to his son. \u201cYou are the most important. I cannot chance your death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d Christian pivoted away from his father, then gasped and wavered. His second hurried to him and offered his support.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Simon interrupted. \u201cYou cannot pay for my brother\u2019s death. His life has no price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d Sir Rupert drew a sword from his cane. \u201cWill you duel a crippled man, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Christian pulled away from his second.</p><p>Simon raised his hand, stopping the younger man\u2019s surge forward. \u201cNo, I will not duel you. I find that I have lost my taste for blood.\u201d</p><p>Long lost it, if the truth were known. He had never liked what he\u2019d had to do, but now he knew: He could not kill Christian. He thought of Lucy\u2019s fine, topaz eyes, so serious, so right, and almost smiled. He could not kill Christian because it would disappoint Lucy. So small a reason, but a crucial one nevertheless.</p><p>Sir Rupert lowered his sword, a smirk forming on his lips. He thought he\u2019d won.</p><p>\u201cInstead,\u201d Simon continued, \u201cyou will leave England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The smile died from the older man\u2019s face.</p><p>Simon raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou prefer a duel?\u201d</p><p>Sir Rupert opened his mouth, but it was his son who replied. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Simon looked at his former friend. Christian\u2019s face was as white as the snow falling around them, but he stood straight and tall. Simon nodded. \u201cYou will accept banishment from England for your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sir Rupert blustered.</p><p>Christian turned savagely on his father. \u201cHe has offered you\u2014us\u2014an honorable way out, without bloodshed or loss of fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut where would we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica.\u201d The young man turned to Simon. \u201cThat meets with your approval?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian!\u201d</p><p>Christian kept his eyes on Simon, ignoring his father. \u201cI will see it done. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Simon said.</p> <p>For a moment, the two men stared at each other. Simon watched an emotion\u2014regret?\u2014chase across the other\u2019s eyes. He noticed for the first time that Christian\u2019s eyes were almost the same shade as Lucy\u2019s. Lucy. She was still gone from his life. That made two souls he had lost in as many days.</p><p>Then Christian straightened. \u201cHere.\u201d He held out his open palm. On it lay the Iddesleigh signet ring.</p><p>Simon took it from him and screwed the ring on his right index finger. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Christian nodded. He hesitated for a moment, looking at Simon as if he wanted to say more, before he limped away.</p><p>Sir Rupert frowned, white lines etching themselves between his brows. \u201cYou\u2019ll accept my banishment in return for Christian\u2019s life?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Simon nodded curtly, his lips thinning as he wavered on his feet. A few seconds more, that was all he needed. \u201cYou have thirty days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty days! But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it or leave it. If you or any member of your family is still in England after thirty days, I will challenge your son again.\u201d Simon didn\u2019t wait for a reply; the other\u2019s defeat was already etched in his face. He turned away and walked toward his horse.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you to a physician,\u201d de Raaf rumbled sotto voce.</p><p>\u201cSo he can bleed me?\u201d Simon almost laughed. \u201cNo. A bandaging will suffice. My valet can do it.\u201d</p><p>The other man grunted. \u201cCan you ride?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Course.\u201d He said it carelessly, but Simon was relieved when he actually pulled himself atop his horse. De Raaf shot him an exasperated glance, but Simon ignored it, turning toward home. Or what had once been home. Without Lucy there, the town house became merely a building. A place to store his neckcloths and shoes, nothing more.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to accompany you?\u201d de Raaf asked.</p><p>Simon grimaced. He held his horse to a gentle walk, but the movement still jarred his shoulder. \u201cIt would be nice to have someone here, should I fall ignominiously from my mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd land on your arse.\u201d De Raaf snorted. \u201cNaturally, I\u2019ll ride you to your town house. But I meant when you go after your lady.\u201d</p><p>Simon turned painfully in the saddle to stare at him.</p><p>De Raaf raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou are going to bring her back, aren\u2019t you? She\u2019s your wife, after all.\u201d</p><p>Simon cleared his throat while he pondered. Lucy was very, very mad at him. She might not forgive him.</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d de Raaf burst out. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re just going to let her go?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say that,\u201d Simon protested.</p><p>\u201cMope about in that great house of yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay with your flowers while you let your wife get away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is too good for you, granted,\u201d de Raaf mused. \u201cBut still. Principle of the thing. Ought to at least try to bring her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d Simon nearly shouted, causing a passing fishmonger to look at him sharply and cross to the other side of the street.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d de Raaf said. \u201cAnd do pull yourself together. Don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve seen you looking worse. Probably need a bath.\u201d</p><p>Simon would have protested that as well, except he did indeed need a bath. He was still thinking of a suitable reply when they arrived at his town house. De Raaf dismounted his gelding and helped Simon swing down from his horse. Simon bit back a groan. His right hand felt leaden.</p><p>\u201cMy lord!\u201d Newton ran down the front steps, wig askew, pot belly jiggling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Simon muttered. \u201cJust a scratch. Hardly bled at\u2014\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his employment, Newton interrupted his master. \u201cThe viscountess has returned.\u201d</p><p>HER FINGERS WERE SPREAD OVER HER CLOSED EYES. Dear Lord. A shudder racked her frame. Protect him. Her knees were numb from the cold. I need him. The wind whipped against her wet cheeks.</p><p>I love him.</p><p>A scrape came from the end of the aisle. Please, God. Footsteps, slow and steady, crunched on the broken glass. Were they coming to tell her? No. Please, no. She curled within herself, huddled on the ice, her hands still shielding her eyes, blocking out the dawning day, blocking out the end of her world.</p><p>\u201cLucy.\u201d It was a whisper, so low she should not have been able to hear it.</p><p>But she did. She dropped her hands, raised her face, hoping, but not daring to believe. Not yet. He was bareheaded, ghastly white, his shirt covered in gore. Blood was crusted down the right side of his face from a cut on his brow, and he cradled one arm. But he was alive.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>\u201cSimon.\u201d She clumsily wiped her eyes with the heels of her hands, trying to get rid of the tears so she could see, but they kept coming. \u201cSimon.\u201d</p><p>He stumbled forward and dropped to his knees before her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d she started, and then realized she was speaking over his words. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d He\u2019d grasped her shoulders with both hands, squeezing as if he couldn\u2019t believe her solid. \u201cStay with me. I love you. God, I love you, Lucy. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her heart seemed to expand with his words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you,\u201d he was saying, his lips skimming her face. \u201cI tried. There isn\u2019t any light without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI become a creature with a blackened soul\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Simon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout hope of redemption\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my salvation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He finally seemed to hear her through his own confession. He stopped still and stared at her. Then he cradled her face in his hands and kissed her, his lips moving tenderly over hers, wanting, comforting. She tasted tears and blood and didn\u2019t care. He was alive. Her sob was caught in his mouth as he opened it over hers. She sobbed again and ran her hands across the back of his head, feeling his short hair tickle her palms. She\u2019d nearly lost him.</p><p>Lucy tried to pull back, remembering. \u201cYour shoulder, your forehead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he murmured over her lips. \u201cChristian pricked me, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s already bandaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>He suddenly lifted his head, his ice eyes staring into hers, melting. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill him, Lucy. We dueled, it\u2019s true, but we stopped before anyone was killed. Fletcher and his family will go to America and never return to England.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. He hadn\u2019t killed, after all. \u201cAre there more duels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s over.\u201d He blinked and seemed to hear what he\u2019d said. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Lucy laid a hand on his cold, cold cheek. \u201cDarling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d His voice broke. He bowed his head until his forehead rested on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s over and Ethan is dead. Oh, God, my brother is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Gently she stroked his hair, feeling the sobs that he would not let her see shake his frame.</p><p>\u201cHe was such a pompous ass, and I loved him so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did. He was your brother.\u201d</p><p>Simon choked on a laugh and raised his face from her shoulder. \u201cMy angel.\u201d His gray eyes swam with tears.</p><p>Lucy shivered. \u201cIt\u2019s cold here. Let\u2019s go inside and get you into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a practical woman.\u201d He struggled to rise.</p><p>Lucy stood stiffly and put her arm about him to help him up. \u201cAnd I insist on a physician this time. Even if I have to drag him away from his Christmas breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas.\u201d Simon stopped short, nearly knocking her down. \u201cIs it Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lucy smiled up at him. He looked so confused. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know? It\u2019s all right. I don\u2019t expect a present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have one for you, and one for Pocket as well,\u201d Simon said. \u201cA toy naval ship complete with sailors and officers and rows of little cannons. It\u2019s really quite clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is. Pocket will adore it, and Rosalind will not approve, and I expect that\u2019s your intention.\u201d Lucy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh, my goodness, Simon!\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited Pocket and Rosalind to Christmas breakfast. I forgot.\u201d Lucy stared up at him horrified. \u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll inform Newton and Cook and leave it to them.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cRosalind is family, after all. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Lucy said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let them see you like this. We\u2019ll at least have to get you cleaned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bow to your every wish, my angel. But humor me and open your present now, please.\u201d He shut the conservatory door behind them and slowly made his way to the hall table where she\u2019d earlier set the blue book. \u201cAh, it\u2019s still here.\u201d He turned with the battered rectangular package and held it out, looking suddenly uncertain.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least lie down?\u201d</p><p>He offered the package mutely.</p><p>Her mouth curved in a smile that she could not suppress. Impossible to be stern with him while he stood in front of her like an earnest child. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d She took the package. It was rather heavy, so she laid it on the hall table again to unwrap it.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>She began working at the string.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve given you a wedding present before now,\u201d he said beside her. She could feel his hot breath on her neck.</p><p>Lucy\u2019s mouth twitched. Where was her sophisticated London aristocrat now? Funny that Simon would be so nervous about giving her a Christmas present. She unwound the string.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a viscountess, now, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Simon was muttering. \u201cI should\u2019ve bought you jewels. Emeralds or rubies. Sapphires. Definitely sapphires and maybe diamonds.\u201d</p><p>The paper fell away. A flat, cherrywood box lay before her. She looked at him questioningly. He raised his brows back at her. She opened the box and froze. Inside were rows of pencils, plain and colored, as well as charcoal, pastels, a tiny ink bottle, and pens. A smaller box held watercolors, brushes, and a little bottle for water.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it or if something is missing, I can have the art supplier make another,\u201d Simon said very rapidly. \u201cMaybe a bigger one. And I\u2019ve ordered several bound sketchbooks to be made, but they aren\u2019t ready yet. Of course, I\u2019ll be giving you jewels as well. Lots of jewels. A treasure trove of jewels, but this is just something small\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucy blinked back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d She wrapped her arms about his shoulders and hugged him close, glorying in the familiar smell of him.</p><p>She felt Simon\u2019s arms lift to embrace her, but she remembered then. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you as well.\u201d She handed him the blue book.</p><p>He opened it to the title page and smiled widely. \u201cThe Serpent Prince. However did you finish it so fast?\u201d He began leafing through the pages, studying her watercolor pictures. \u201cI suppose I ought to give this to Pocket. It was for her that I commissioned it, after all, but\u2014\u201d He choked as he reached the last page.</p><p>Lucy glanced at it, admiring the handsome silver-haired prince she\u2019d painted next to the pretty goat girl. It really was a fine piece of work, even if she did say so herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed the ending!\u201d Simon sounded outraged.</p><p>Well, she didn\u2019t care. \u201cYes, it\u2019s much better now that Angelica marries the Serpent Prince instead. I never did like that Rutherford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, angel,\u201d he protested. \u201cShe\u2019d chopped off his head. I don\u2019t see how he could recover from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilly.\u201d She pulled his face down to hers. \u201cDon\u2019t you know true love heals all?\u201d</p> <p>He paused just before their lips met, his eyes a silvery gray misted with tears. \u201cIt does, you know, your love for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel whole when I\u2019m with you.

But you swept into my life and redeemed me, ransomed my very soul from the devil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being blasphemous again,\u201d she whispered as she stood on tiptoe to reach his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo, but really\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHush. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>And he did. </p>  </body></html>"]
