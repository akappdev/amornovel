Rowdy could feel it.</p><p>It was like a chill chasing up his spine. It was a premonition of hell. It was a certainty that perhaps they should have just shot his ass when he interfered the last time.</p><p>But that last time hadn\u2019t been with one of the Mackays, just a friend, and not an old and dear one at that. The brother of an old and dear friend wasn\u2019t exactly the same.</p> <p>Standing in the marina office and staring out the heavy glass door, he wondered what the little bastard was up to this time. His eyes narrowed against the bright summer sun as the fat little bastard, a.k.a. Timothy Cranston, stood at the open back passenger door of the black Ford Excursion, his attention on the occupants he was obviously speaking to. He was apparently debating something with them, Rowdy thought. The tension in Cranston\u2019s shoulders was a sure indication that his frustration level was rising.</p><p>There were times Rowdy and his cousins might like the former Homeland Security agent, but other times he was more trouble than he was worth.</p><p>Rowdy had a feeling he was about to become more trouble than he was worth again.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fu\u2014hell is he up to?\u201d Natches murmured as he paced to the door to stand beside Rowdy.</p><p>Rowdy didn\u2019t miss the word his cousin had almost used instead. A grin quirking his lips, he slid Natches an amused, knowing look.</p> <p>\u201cBliss said the F-word the other day.\u201d Natches sighed in disgust. \u201cChaya\u2019s of course blaming it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never hear it slipping past her lips, I have to admit,\u201d Dawg drawled from behind them. \u201cWarned you about that, cuz.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy glanced behind him where his cousin Dawg sat back in the easy chair next to the desk, his long legs stretched out, a newspaper in hand as he read an article on a story he\u2019d been following for a few weeks now.</p><p>He seemed unusually interested in the reporter\u2019s far-fetched evidence that there was some conspiracy brewing in the mountains of Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania where homeland militias were concerned. The article was being written by a reporter that had somehow managed to infiltrate one of those militias.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it doesn\u2019t slip around Bliss. I don\u2019t want her to hear me talking like that,\u201d Natches bit out in frustration, his arms crossing over his chest as he glared at each of his cousins before turning back to Cranston.</p><p>Normally, Rowdy would have agreed, because Natches was normally not one to slip up once he put his mind to something.</p> <p>\u201cYou say it often enough when you think she\u2019s not around,\u201d Dawg said, glancing around the side of the newspaper.</p><p>Natches just shook his head.</p><p>As he caught the tight-lipped scowl on Natches\u2019s face, Rowdy knew it would do little good to argue with his cousin over it. He was convinced he hadn\u2019t said the word around his daughter, therefore, as far as he was concerned, he hadn\u2019t said it. Until they actually managed to catch him and point it out, then he\u2019d continue to fight against the idea that he\u2019d let it drop. Rowdy was more inclined to think it had happened out of Bliss\u2019s sight, just not out of her hearing. The three of them usually managed to hold back the words they didn\u2019t want their daughters to hear, whether the girls were around or not. They were all too aware of the fact that their girls were growing up and prone to be present whether they could be seen or not.</p><p>As far as Rowdy knew, he himself hadn\u2019t said that word since the last time he\u2019d suspected Cranston was up to something.</p><p>It never failed that the F-word slipped out whenever that little bastard was messing in their lives.</p><p>Holding his hand up in a \u201cwait\u201d gesture to the driver, Cranston closed the passenger door to the Excursion and began walking quickly to the marina offices.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t as fat as he was the last time they\u2019d seen him, Rowdy noted to himself. Not that he\u2019d been overly round, but he had been a bit portly.</p><p>His brown hair was still a little thin in the front, though, cut short everywhere else and standing on end as the wind whipping off the lake only made it worse.</p> <p>The tan suit he wore was rumpled and wrinkled, as though he\u2019d slept in it for more than a few days. Beneath the suit, it appeared he might have been working out just a little.</p><p>Frowning, Rowdy glanced to Natches, wondering whether he\u2019d noticed.</p><p>Natches wasn\u2019t saying anything if he had.</p><p>Giving an irritated snort, Natches turned and paced back to the desk and the chairs Rowdy had placed behind it for his cousins. Cranston\u2019s chair sat all by its lonesome in front of the desk.</p><p>Stepping back from the door and crossing his arms over his chest, Rowdy scowled as Cranston pushed into the office, his hand moving to smooth his hair back rather than running his fingers through the normally disheveled strands.</p><p>And he looked more harried than usual.</p><p>If Rowdy wasn\u2019t mistaken, the former Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge of Investigations looked downright worried and possibly even a little uncertain.</p><p>\u201cRowdy, damned good to see you.\u201d Cranston frowned as he stepped into the office and extended his hand. \u201cYou ignored my invitation to the party last week, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his hand, Rowdy raised his brows in surprise. \u201cThat was really from you? I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was afraid it was a trick to get us all in one place to kill us all at once.\u201d</p><p>Cranston\u2019s frown turned suspicious, and evidently the innocent smile Rowdy gave him did nothing to alleviate the suspicion.</p><p>Cranston\u2019s jaw tightened.</p><p>Turning to Dawg and Rowdy, he sighed deeply.</p><p>Dawg was still engrossed in his newspaper, and now Natches had a part of it\u2014the comics, no less\u2014and appeared just as involved in it.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be?\u201d Cranston muttered, sounding strangely disappointed.</p><p>The look he shot Rowdy had a curl of shame rearing its head that only managed to piss Rowdy off. Hell, he had no reason to feel ashamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Rowdy asked as he walked to the desk and took his seat behind it. \u201cCome on, Cranston; we know you. When you make one of your infamous requests that we all meet you together, it means you\u2019re going to pull us into one of your schemes, get us shot at, and piss our wives off. We\u2019re not playing this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here you all are.\u201d Timothy waved his hands out to encompass the room, that glimmer of somber disappointment still gleaming in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOut of curiosity,\u201d Rowdy assured him as both Dawg and Natches lowered their papers with a snap.</p><p>The other man sighed\u2014tiredly?\u2014 before moving to the desk, though he didn\u2019t sit down.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no scheme,\u201d he assured them, his voice matching the resignation in his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cSure there\u2019s not,\u201d Dawg expressed doubtfully. \u201cYou\u2019re still breathing; that means there\u2019s a scheme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe party was thrown, Dawg\u201d\u2014he singled Dawg out, and it wasn\u2019t missed by any of them, especially Dawg\u2014\u201cto allow you to meet four young women and their mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not bodyguards; nor are we in the market for a woman,\u201d Dawg snapped.</p><p>At this point, Cranston sat down. Slowly.</p><p>His brows lowered, his brown eyes darker and flickering with what Rowdy had always said were the fires of hell. It was actually the green coming out in the dark hazel of his eyes.</p><p>They just appeared brown until he was pissed.</p><p>He was pissed now.</p><p>He watched the three of them silently, his jaw clenched and granite hard.</p><p>\u201cAt what point have you failed to miss the fact that I am completely besotted by your wives and children? And since you acquired those wives and children, at what time have I asked you to do anything dangerous?\u201d he asked them then, and Rowdy had to admit he hadn\u2019t expected to hear that edge of some emotion akin to hurt in the agent\u2019s tone.</p><p>Dawg and Natches both put their papers aside as Rowdy tensed. They\u2019d seen Cranston in a lot of different moods, but they rarely saw him pissed off at them. And they had certainly never seen him give the impression that his feelings were hurt.</p><p>They had seen him pissed at others, often\u2014 But he\u2019d never seemed to care enough about anyone that they could actually prick emotions they\u2019d never known he had.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not trying to draw us into one of your damned operations,\u201d Natches growled, clearly missing the fact that Cranston didn\u2019t get pissed at them for saying no to a mission.</p><p>\u201cNatches.\u201d Rowdy said his name softly, warningly, his gaze locked on the former agent. \u201cLet\u2019s see what he has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dawg grunted. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously out to cause trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr to alleviate some,\u201d Cranston stated softly, the cool smile that crossed his lips sending that chill racing up Rowdy\u2019s spine again.</p><p>Cranston stood slowly, the expression on his face hinting at not just anger, but also that inner disappointment that had Rowdy confused as hell. \u201cHad I known this would be my reception, I would have just told you over the phone,\u201d he stated. \u201cRather than believing we had been friends for the past four years.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s shoulders tightened as Cranston focused his complete attention on Dawg.</p><p>Natches and Dawg had stiffened as well, the undercurrents suddenly whipping through the room finally piercing their suspicious anger.</p><p>\u201cTold us what?\u201d Rowdy growled.</p><p>He knew Cranston. It was too late to repair whatever insult he\u2019d perceived. Better to just get this meeting over with and find out what the hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cThree months ago, Homeland Security received an alert from the Louisville Office of Vital Statistics,\u201d he stated coolly. \u201cSomeone was requesting information on Chandler Mackay\u2019s heirs.\u201d</p><p>Dawg stiffened further as Rowdy shot him a warning look. They needed to hear what he had to say.</p><p>\u201cI thought you resigned from Homeland Security,\u201d Natches reminded him mockingly.</p><p>Timothy shook his head, his expression pitying. \u201cSon, you never officially retire from Homeland Security. One of these days you\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never part of it,\u201d Natches reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Dawg was.\u201d He nodded to Dawg. \u201cAnd because you\u2019ll stand with him, no matter the danger, that means you\u2019ll be there to realize it as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Dawg growled. \u201cBut DHS and Chandler Mackay are not one and the same. He\u2019s dead, and his heir doesn\u2019t give a fuck, remember?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy\u2019s head whipped to Dawg. Hell, Dawg hadn\u2019t said the word \u201cfuck\u201d since his daughter was still crawling.</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Cranston nodded. \u201cBut tell me, Dawg, would you turn your back on Janey if she needed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJaney is family.\u201d Dawg came out of his chair, causing Rowdy and Natches both to stand with him, as Timothy had always said they would do.</p><p>\u201cSo are the four young girls sitting in that vehicle outside,\u201d Cranston stated. \u201cThey\u2019re your younger sisters. Four girls, Dawg, still in their teens with no place to go because DHS found the property your father had bought for them, and because he hadn\u2019t changed the title over to the mother, they seized the property as well as the bank accounts their mother was using to help support the girls. They\u2019re homeless, without resources, and Mercedes never allowed the girls to work. She wants them to get an education. Now, are you going to turn your back on them as well? Let me know if you are, so I can have DHS drive them to the nearest corner and put them and their few belongings out. There might be some room left under a bridge somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Dawg sat down slowly, at the same time Rowdy and Natches found themselves sitting as well. Rowdy\u2019s knees felt damned weak, and his senses in chaos. God only knew what Natches, and even more so, Dawg, were feeling themselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowdy stared at Cranston, shock warring with the resurging shame. Hell, they should have known that invitation to dinner that they had ignored a few days before\u2014Cranston never invited a soul to dinner\u2014was more than some ruse.</p><p>\u201cChandler Mackay has been dead for thirteen years.\u201d Dawg shook his head, obviously trying to reject the information. \u201cThat can\u2019t be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe youngest girl is sixteen.\u201d Cranston nodded. \u201cNot one of them is more than one year younger than the sister born before her. When their mother lost the little boy she\u2019d been carrying, the year your father was killed, he never returned to the Texas home he\u2019d bought, though payments on it were sent from a Cayman account until DHS was able to shut the account down and trace the payments. Now, what do I do with them?\u201d</p> <p>Dawg shook his head.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Cranston nodded his head. \u201cI\u2019ll tell the driver to take them to Somerset and drop them off.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Rowdy stepped forward, desperation and surging disbelief making it hard to think. \u201cThe Nauti Buoy is empty right now. Put them there.\u201d</p><p>Cranston turned back, his lip curling in a disapproving sneer. \u201cSon, their mother, Mercedes, is as proud as they come. She\u2019s not going to just unload her daughters on a bachelor barge and consider herself lucky. If she had been that sort of mother, then I would have handled this far differently. She wants to meet you. She wants to be accepted, not pushed to the side until forced to come begging.\u201d</p> <p>There was something in Cranston\u2019s tone that Rowdy had never heard before: an edge of bafflement as well as respect.</p><p>There weren\u2019t many people Timothy Cranston respected.</p><p>From the corner of his eye Rowdy watched a muscle jump in Dawg\u2019s jaw.</p><p>\u201cHow old are the girls?\u201d Dawg finally snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe eldest girl, Eve, turned nineteen on New Year\u2019s Day. Piper turned eighteen in February. Lyrica turned seventeen in March, and little Zoey just turned sixteen this month.\u201d Timothy gave them all a hard look. \u201cHell of an age to live under a bridge, don\u2019t you think? Ever been there, Dawg? Ever seen what it was like? What it\u2019s going to be like for four teenage girls that I\u2019m betting my pensions are still virgins?\u201d</p><p>They all had. They\u2019d had nightmares for weeks.</p> <p>Timothy sighed heavily. \u201cTheir mother, Mercedes, was only fourteen when she gave birth to her first child. She would have had five children if she hadn\u2019t lost the boy she conceived only weeks after Zoey was born. Her body was just too weak for another child. She developed an infection that forced the doctors to do a hysterectomy. She\u2019s thirty-three years old with four girls to raise, and she\u2019s not lazy any day of the week, but neither does she have family and only very few friends. Those friends are not in a position to help her. The only education she\u2019s had since she was fourteen was what she\u2019s taught herself. How do you go to college with four babies?\u201d</p><p>Dawg was slowly shaking his head. \u201cShe was a baby herself,\u201d he whispered hoarsely, his eyes filled with horror. \u201cShe was just a baby. Fuck me. God, she\u2019s younger than I am.\u201d</p><p>She was almost seven years younger than Dawg, and she had four children by his father. It was unthinkable, even knowing the depraved bastard Chandler Mackay had been.</p><p>It was all Rowdy could think. All any of them could think, he imagined.</p><p>\u201cHe raped a baby.\u201d Dawg\u2019s voice sounded like a wheeze.</p><p>\u201cNot much more than.\u201d Timothy sighed, the compassion he felt in this moment making his shoulders droop as he watched the three men, wishing he could hide this part from them. \u201cChandler bought her from her parents in Guatemala. She was pregnant with his child when he slipped her into Texas and procured papers for her. She knew no English, had no way of supporting herself, and she didn\u2019t have the option of running. If she ran, he told her the police would find her, and they would then send her back to Guatemala without her babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe babies of a rapist?\u201d Dawg whispered as he stared back at Timothy in shock. \u201cAnd she stayed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves those girls, Dawg,\u201d Timothy assured him, the sorrow he felt at this moment more than he wanted to deal with. \u201cShe\u2019s given everything to her daughters, and survived at less than poverty level with the funds Chandler had arranged for her to receive along with the few jobs she had working under the table. He didn\u2019t provide her a car; he didn\u2019t provide her a means of supporting herself. And he paid others to ensure she didn\u2019t date, have lovers, or dare to marry. If she attempted to have a lover, he promised her, then he would take the children, have them split up and placed in foster homes, and have Mercedes sent back to Guatemala. Then he proceeded to describe to her in graphic detail a horror story of what American foster families did to the little girls given to them.\u201d He said the last with a sneer. \u201cYou can imagine the nightmares he gave her. The one time she dared to assert her independence and attempt to acquire her GED to enable her to acquire a better job, he had her babies stolen as she slept. She was a month getting them back and they all still have nightmares of those weeks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was a monster,\u201d Rowdy whispered, his stomach roiling at the thought of what his uncle had done to another innocent child.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Timothy agreed. \u201cHell is what she has lived in for quite a while. Then the money that paid the bills was suddenly cut off, the house taken, and with it the vehicle she busted her ass for years to buy because she\u2019d been forced to forge Chandler\u2019s name to it to acquire it. She was thrown on the streets and taken in by one of the Texas-based Homeland Security officers there that day. The woman called me immediately. She knew I\u2019d worked the Mackay case here, and that I was still in the area. They were ready to fucking deport her, Dawg, and do just as Chandler warned her, take her children and put them in foster homes. I went after them, had them set up in a safe house until I could verify everything and run DNA tests on the girls.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t give any of them a chance to deny the girls or their mother. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely Chandler\u2019s daughters,\u201d he told them. \u201cAnd considering the fact that I made damn certain the majority of what Chandler had, that I knew of, was very illegally placed in your name and backdated far enough that it couldn\u2019t be taken, I thought perhaps you could help Mercedes and her daughters. Because if you don\u2019t, then she doesn\u2019t have a chance of remaining in the States with those girls.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he wasn\u2019t so certain that Dawg would help wasn\u2019t lost on Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cYou said she worked.\u201d Natches looked as dazed as Timothy had felt as Mercedes told him what her life had been.</p><p>\u201cShe did, at a restaurant. She worked cleaning homes, or whatever she could do and still take her kids, until Eve was old enough to help with them, allowing her to take on additional house cleaning jobs to provide a little more for her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have made much,\u201d Rowdy whispered. \u201cNot with four girls to care for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to have made friends.\u201d Dawg seemed more in shock than anything.</p><p>\u201cWould you have, if it meant your children would be placed in foster care if your so called friends or employers ever learned the truth of your presence in America, or the life you were being forced to live?\u201d Timothy asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy keep the kids?\u201d Natches questioned. \u201cShe had to have hated Chandler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer daughters are her heart and soul. Never doubt that.\u201d Timothy sighed, wondering whether he had been wrong all these years about the honor and integrity of the three men he was facing.</p><p>As he opened his lips to say something more, Rowdy\u2019s gaze jerked to the door.</p><p>Timothy felt his stomach drop as the door was pushed open, and the tiny, delicate little bundle of fire, Zoey Mackay, burst into the office.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want us, do they?\u201d Pain radiated in her face, her voice.</p><p>She could have been Dawg\u2019s daughter, so much did the kid look like his own kid, Laken: delicate and fragile, long black hair falling down her back, celadon eyes filled with tears, her face sculpted into lines of such beauty it made a grown man want to weep.</p><p>Timothy rushed to her, bending to one knee as he placed his hands lightly on her fragile shoulders and stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cZoey, I told you to stay in the vehicle until I finished,\u201d Timothy reminded her, his tone gentling.</p><p>Hell, he couldn\u2019t yell at her; he couldn\u2019t get mad at her. She knew the hell her mother and sisters faced if Dawg turned them away.</p><p>Dawg rose slowly to his feet, causing her to flinch as she followed the movement.</p><p>\u201cIf they wanted us, it wouldn\u2019t take this long,\u201d she accused him, her voice rough, big tears filling her eyes as she turned back to Timothy. \u201cThey would have wanted to meet us by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just asking some questions.\u201d Dawg could feel something inside his soul bleeding.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought Chandler Mackay could do more to make him hate him. That it was possible for the bastard to make him despise him more than he already did.</p><p>Until he stared at the girl glaring back at him.</p><p>She looked like an older version of his precious Laken.</p><p>His baby was only three, and already, her delicate, too fragile body was forced to keep up with the fire that burned in her soul.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of questions can\u2019t we answer?\u201d Zoey propped her little fists on her hips angrily, demanding that he take her into consideration, that he make a choice and he make it now.</p><p>\u201cZoey, Mr. Mackay and his cousins might have liked a few minutes to process everything,\u201d Timothy chastised her gently as he straightened and stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think Momma has time for him to process anything,\u201d she cried out, her voice trembling as the tears that filled her eyes suddenly spilled down her cheeks as fear and anger filled her expression. \u201cHe\u2019ll either help us or he won\u2019t. Either way, Momma\u2019s sick again\u2014\u201d</p><p>Timothy moved.</p><p>Rushing past the little girl, aware Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches were moving quickly to follow behind him, Timothy ran for the Excursion at a run.</p><p>Racing to the passenger-side door opposite the office he saw the young Homeland Security agent standing next to Mercedes Mackay, his expression concerned.</p><p>\u201cAgent Rickers,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cranston.\u201d Agent Rickers straightened quickly and moved back, his young face pale. \u201cShe\u2019s weak again, sir. I was trying to make her more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>The other girls had moved farther back to the third row of seats, watching their mother fearfully as she breathed heavily, her pale face reddened, perspiration pouring from it.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Mercedes promised weakly. \u201cYou know how frightened they get.\u201d</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t be fine, and Timothy knew it. Not if she didn\u2019t get the help she needed.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, you should have sent one of the girls for me before you became so ill,\u201d he chastised her as he took the damp cloth the other agent had been using to wipe the perspiration from her. It did little to cool her skin. Few things did when such attacks occurred. They came with a suddenness that couldn\u2019t be predicted, and often left just as quickly.</p><p>\u201cTimothy, get her in the office; we\u2019ll call for Doc,\u201d Rowdy ordered from the other side of the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Mercedes.\u201d The gentleness in the leprechaun\u2019s voice shocked not just Rowdy, but his cousins as well, though the young women in the vehicle didn\u2019t seem surprised at all.</p><p>Cranston picked her up as though she weighed nothing, and she had to be three inches taller, at least, than the former agent.</p><p>Pick her up he did, though, and carried her quickly into the office, all the girls at his heels.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Rowdy questioned the older man as he laid her on the office couch, the girls hovering around her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cranston sighed heavily. \u201cThe doctors aren\u2019t certain, but she\u2019s refused to see the specialists she\u2019s been referred to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Cranston\u2019s jaw tightened, a muscle ticking at the side furiously. \u201cNo insurance and no money, Rowdy. I told you, once Homeland Security found that Cayman account two years ago, they\u2019ve had to live on what she had saved and the money she made working three jobs. She refused to let the girls work. The girls weren\u2019t even aware Mercedes was no longer receiving the money until DHS showed up at the house and threw them out.\u201d</p> <p>Rowdy started to say more, but the sight of three concerned women moving quickly across the parking lot had a grimace pulling at his lips before he turned to his cousins. \u201cShopping trip\u2019s over,\u201d he announced, nodding toward their wives as they moved purposefully for the office.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell were they?\u201d Natches rubbed his jaw in confusion.</p><p>\u201cMy guess, close enough to see why the hell we tried to push them into going shopping this morning.\u201d Rowdy sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of practice, boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought someone was calling a doctor.\u201d The little powerhouse who had interrupted the meeting earlier stood from where she had been kneeling next to her mother.</p><p>\u201cZoey, enough,\u201d Mercedes chastised her. \u201cWhere are your manners?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey promised, Momma.\u201d Pleading with her eyes, clearly afraid for her mother\u2019s health.</p><p>\u201cI sent the text,\u201d Rowdy promised her. \u201cHis nurse just texted back.\u201d</p><p>He handed the girl the phone.</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour.\u201d She murmured the nurse\u2019s reply before handing the phone back to him and staring up at him with eyes the same pale, intense green of Dawg\u2019s, yet in this child\u2019s eyes lurked a deep, haunting fear he knew he\u2019d see in his nightmares.</p><p>Her celadon eyes were surrounded by a wealth of long, heavy black lashes, he noticed. She was a beauty already, and keeping the wild hearts and even wilder men away from her for the rest of her life wouldn\u2019t be easy, Rowdy thought in resignation.</p><p>And there was no doubt she was a Mackay.</p> <p>If he had seen any of the four girls on the street at any time, he would have known he was looking at the daughter of a Mackay. The dark looks were simply unmistakable.</p><p>As Rowdy pushed the phone back into the holster at his side, the door to the office was pushed inward and three concerned, though borderline furious Mackay wives were moving into the room.</p><p>Kelly, whose gentle features had matured in the past five years since her daughter\u2019s birth, though she still looked far too young for her husband Rowdy\u2019s experienced features.</p><p>Chaya, Natches\u2019s wife, whose brows were drawn into a frown, her brown eyes going between Eve, Piper, Lyrica, and Zoey in suspicion before dropping to Mercedes Mackay.</p><p>But Dawg\u2019s wife, Christa, was stark pale, so white-faced Dawg moved for her instantly.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no.\u201d He shook his head desperately as her eyes began to fill with tears. \u201cOh, hell, no, baby. Sisters. They\u2019re my sisters, not my kids. I swear. Sisters, Christa.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to him slowly, reluctantly. She frowned deeply, though her face was still stark white as she slowly shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThis is all Timothy\u2019s fault.\u201d He glared at Timothy before pointing his finger at the not-so-fat little bastard as Timothy stared back at him in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my fault?\u201d Timothy glared back at him, obviously offended by the accusation.</p><p>The four girls and their mother were staring at him as though he had dropped into the room from outer space, while Rowdy and Natches simply watched him warily.</p><p>Christa swallowed tightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re your daughters,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re as white as a damned sheet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and turned back to the four girls again. \u201cOh, my God, Dawg, what did Chandler Mackay do? They could be, your twins,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAs though they were cloned from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, just shoot me now,\u201d Zoey spat in disgust.</p><p>\u201cMomma, I don\u2019t think I can ever forgive you.\u201d Eve sighed.</p><p>\u201cAt least it\u2019s him we looked cloned from and not one of the other two,\u201d Lyrica said with a grunt. \u201cThat would have sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still sucks,\u201d Piper assured her younger sister.</p><p>\u201cBrats,\u201d Rowdy murmured, though there was no heat in his tone; he actually seemed rather amused.</p><p>\u201cBrats? Try bitches.\u201d Natches grunted, his gaze carefully shuttered, though Dawg could detect the amusement. \u201cAnd that little one works at it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not very hard.\u201d Zoey slid him an arch, cool look. \u201cIf I had, trust me, you\u2019d know it.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s comment had Kelly\u2019s, Christa\u2019s, and Chaya\u2019s gazes moving then to Timothy. Then they shifted instantly to the woman stretched out on the couch.</p><p>Hell, Dawg thought, this woman didn\u2019t look old enough to be the mother of the four obvious hellions staring back at the Mackay wives.</p><p>\u201cNatches, sweetheart, what\u2019s Cranston doing here?\u201d Chaya, one of Cranston\u2019s former agents, stepped to her husband and let him pull her close to his side.</p><p>As she did so, Kelly stepped to Rowdy, while Christa moved to Dawg\u2019s side and gave him a gentle kiss on the cheek. It was the look on his face, Rowdy thought, that look of blank devastation in his gaze that had Christa bestowing a kiss to assure him there was nothing for him to worry about.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear we\u2019ve added to the family,\u201d Natches told his wife softly. \u201cMeet Dawg\u2019s sisters. I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll introduce themselves as soon as Doc gets here to check out their mother.\u201d</p><p>Timothy wiped Mercedes\u2019s face again. Rowdy could have sworn the leprechaun\u2019s hand was shaking.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do, Mercedes?\u201d he asked her gently. \u201cDidn\u2019t you rest last night?\u201d</p><p>Mercedes\u2019s lush lips almost tilted into a smile. \u201cWhat do you think, Tim?\u201d she asked, forcing her eyes open.</p><p>Tim?</p><p>No one, but no one, had ever been allowed to call Timothy Cranston \u201cTim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you were up all night pacing and worrying.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI told you there was nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there not?\u201d she asked him sorrowfully. \u201cChandler\u2019s son is suddenly besieged by four young females he knew nothing of, and a sick mother to boot? Ah, Tim, do you not know human nature far better than this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the Mackays far better than this,\u201d he assured her, praying he was right. \u201cAnd the Mackays do not turn their backs on family.\u201d</p><p>The look he slid them assured the Mackays that they\u2019d better not start now.</p><p>\u201cIs Doc on his way, then?\u201d Christa asked Dawg as his hand tightened on her hip, his need to draw her closer evident.</p><p>\u201cHalf hour, his nurse said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty minutes then.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>Dawg watched the young woman; hell, she had four grown daughters and she was younger than he was. He watched her, watched her daughters, and in their eyes he saw pure, raw fear.</p><p>\u201cCranston, what do the doctors who have suggested a specialist say could be wrong with her?\u201d Dawg asked; the low rasp of the tone wasn\u2019t lost on the former agent.</p><p>Cranston swallowed tightly, the action at first almost unnoticed. But the slight flinch of his facial muscles wasn\u2019t missed by Dawg.</p><p>\u201cThey think she could have an advanced form of chemical poisoning that\u2019s slowly weakening her lungs. One of the jobs she had was at an industrial chemical processing plant that\u2019s since been shut down for its unsafe working conditions.\u201d Clearing his throat of obvious emotion, he lifted his gaze to Dawg\u2019s, and no one missed the plea in his eyes. \u201cThe treatments she needs are expensive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimothy, no.\u201d Pride was evident in Mercedes\u2019s weak voice as she laid her hand on his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk of this. Let the girls and their brother talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercedes, I won\u2019t let you lie here and suffer,\u201d he snarled, his voice hoarse and filled with emotion. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Timothy Cranston was in love.</p><p>Dawg lifted his gaze from Cranston, only to realize the four girls were watching him suspiciously, fearfully. There wasn\u2019t one of them who didn\u2019t expect him to turn them away.</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s here,\u201d Christa stated as a vehicle pulled up in front of the door. \u201cHe\u2019s early. He must have already left the office.\u201d</p><p>Dawg nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get your mother taken care of,\u201d he told the girls. \u201cOnce we have her checked out, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d His gaze dropped to Cranston\u2019s again before lifting back to the girls. \u201cBut have no doubt: You\u2019re family. And we stick by family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of you killed your cousin,\u201d the eldest stated. \u201cI heard one of the agents talking about it after we arrived at Tim\u2019s. Is that how you take care of family?\u201d</p><p>She might have resembled Dawg enough to be his kid, but it was Natches\u2019s emerald eyes she stared at him from.</p><p>\u201cEve.\u201d Her mother gasped, obviously shocked by her daughter\u2019s rudeness.</p><p>Dawg just gave Eve a mocking smile as his hand tightened at Christa\u2019s hip once again. \u201cOnly those who betray us and have a gun trained on the someone we love,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThen, Eve, trust me, it didn\u2019t matter who he was then; Johnny was dead.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s nostrils flared before she finally relaxed enough to simply nod her head.</p><p>\u201cMackays don\u2019t betray one another.\u201d Cranston tore his gaze from their mother long enough to stare back at each girl with a glint of steel in his eyes. \u201cRemember that, girls. You stand for who you are, what you are, and for family. That\u2019s what your mother\u2019s taught you, and that\u2019s what you live by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you stand for us first,\u201d Lyrica spoke up warily.</p><p>Dawg nodded. \u201cUnderstandable. And we\u2019ll show you our good faith.\u201d He glanced to Natches and Rowdy. Each of his cousins nodded in turn. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you and your mother, because you\u2019re family, and that\u2019s what families do. Whatever treatments your mother needs, whatever care, she\u2019ll have it. Just as you\u2019ll return to school and do your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn return for what?\u201d the other girl asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIn return for being part of the family,\u201d Dawg growled back at her. \u201cI just told you that. Loyalty begins somewhere, and I\u2019ll make that first step. From here on out it\u2019s up to you. But betray us or yourselves, hurt us, yourselves, or another of the family, and you\u2019ll risk all of it. Come to us, talk to us, and we\u2019ll help you the best way we can. But you don\u2019t lie to us, you don\u2019t cheat us, and you don\u2019t dare betray one of us.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was he supposed to do with four sisters?</p><p>Each girl nodded before the door opened, heralding the doctor and his nurse. Within an hour an ambulance arrived and, with Cranston riding with her, whisked Mercedes Mackay to the hospital and left four clearly suspicious, frightened, and exhausted young women in his keeping.</p><p>And Dawg would soon learn, along with Rowdy and Natches, just what they might have to face in another decade or so.</p><p>With their own daughters.</p><p>ONE</p><p>It was after two in the morning before Eve Mackay stepped into her bedroom and closed the door behind her quietly. Staring around the small suite, it was damned hard to believe how her life had changed in five short years. From destitution to security. From paralyzing fear of what the future would bring, to looking forward to each day as it arrived.</p><p>From losing the meager roof over their heads to partial ownership in the business her mother now owned.</p><p>Luckily, her room was on the more private side of the large house her mother had turned into Mackay\u2019s Bed-and-breakfast Inn. The two-story sprawling farmhouse had been completely renovated and redecorated with the private residence on the second floor, the eight guest suites, large chef\u2019s kitchen, and open television and game room on the main floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A wide porch wrapped around the house, allowing guests easy access to the balcony doors into their rooms when the main entrance was locked after midnight.</p><p>Eve had taken the smallest guest room at the back of the house for herself, rather than one of the bedrooms in the upstairs residence, as her sisters had done. She\u2019d needed the privacy, whereas her sisters had still needed the closeness the upstairs rooms provided to their mother.</p><p>Now she was thankful for it. Arriving home after two in the morning and going through the main residence would be guaranteed to alert her mother, and her mother\u2019s lover, that she\u2019d arrived home.</p> <p>Living upstairs would have enabled her mother to keep tabs on her, too, and as much as she loved her mother, she had no wish for that.</p><p>Opening her eyes and drawing in a deep breath, Eve reached back and rubbed the tense muscles of her neck before moving to the bathroom and a hot shower.</p><p>Releasing the heavy weight of her long, straight black hair and massaging at her scalp with her fingertips, she wondered why she had gotten none of the curls that her younger sisters had in abundance. Zoey\u2019s hair fell to her waist in soft corkscrew curls that Eve used to threaten to cut off out of pure jealousy.</p><p>No matter how hard she\u2019d tried, Eve had rarely been able to get her hair to take curl for more than a few hours. A few days at the most only after a trip to the salon when she had a chemical wave put in it.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been worth it.</p> <p>She\u2019d learned to live without the curl her other sisters had in varying amounts. Piper\u2019s hair was wavy. It fell to her shoulders, thick and heavy as it framed her aristocratic features and gave her exotic sea green eyes a lush shimmer.</p><p>Lyrica kept her hair to a length that fell just below her shoulder blades. The deeper waves in her hair bounced and gleamed with a blue-black sheen that went perfectly with her summer green gaze.</p><p>Zoey\u2019s hair fell below her waist, clear to her hips in those long, corkscrew curls that were impossibly soft and silky and made other women want to kill for them. Her hair was just as exotic as her eyes, which were the same celadon as their brother Dawg\u2019s, that pale, ethereal color that always drew second and third looks.</p><p>Eve\u2019s hair was more like Natches\u2019s: straight and thick. It was impossible for her to do much in the way of styling it. She pinned it up, put it in a ponytail as she had tonight, or just left it long to the middle of her shoulders.</p><p>Her eyes were the same emerald green as Natches\u2019s, but her looks, like her sisters\u2019, were closer to Dawg\u2019s.</p><p>Big, bold, and as familiar in Pulaski County, Kentucky, as the mountains themselves, Dawg and his cousins\u2014her cousins\u2014Rowdy and Natches had been all that had saved her and her family at a time when they\u2019d been certain life as they\u2019d known it was over.</p> <p>It had been, she guessed, but Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches had made it better. They\u2019d taken her, her sisters, and her mother under their wings and gave them a life.</p><p>Her mother was given the house that had once been taken away from Dawg by the cousin that had betrayed his country and his family and had nearly killed Dawg\u2019s wife, Christa. The same cousin Eve had heard agents accusing Natches of having killed. After Johnny Grace\u2019s death the property had reverted back to Dawg, and had been sitting empty for nearly three years before Eve and her family showed up.</p><p>He\u2019d had the renovations done under her mother\u2019s direction, agreeing to allow her to sign a promissory loan for the amount it had taken to renovate it. Mercedes Mackay had then opened the bed-and-breakfast she\u2019d always dreamed of having.</p><p>Her sisters were in college, and Eve had graduated from the local technical college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration.</p><p>As she stepped from the shower, wrapped her hair in a towel, and quickly dried off, she grimaced at the paleness of her skin.</p><p>It was June; by now she usually had a nice golden tan over her body, and instead of coming in at two in the morning from a job, she\u2019d been sneaking in after a night of carousing herself.</p><p>When had the fun and good times started leaving a bad taste in her mouth? she wondered as she brushed her teeth.</p><p>She\u2019d been in Somerset for five years now, and the past three years the nightlife she had once sworn by had quickly become boring, with a heavy air of immaturity.</p> <p>Quickly applying a moisturizing facial cream, she then lotioned her body and spritzed a toasted-vanilla body spray over herself.</p><p>It was a lot of work to go through just to go to bed, but after eight hours at the bar where she worked, Walker\u2019s Run, and waiting on tables in the outside smokers\u2019 patio, she smelled of old tobacco smoke, the sweaty bodies that had brushed against her, sawdust, and the greasy food she\u2019d served.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of going to bed smelling like the bar.</p><p>Mackay\u2019s Fine Dining, previously Mackay\u2019s Restaurant and Cafe, the restaurant Natches\u2019s sister Janey owned, wasn\u2019t as bad, but it still called for a shower. Maybe she\u2019d go work for Dawg at the lumber store for a while. Natches would readily let her work at the garage as well, but Eve wasn\u2019t ready for the oil baths she had experienced the few times she\u2019d worked there. His redneck mechanics thought it was funny to find ways to upend the pails of old oil in ways that left her covered in the nasty sludge. And though Natches always fired the responsible party when they could be identified, after the first firing, Eve was always careful to ensure no one was identified.</p><p>She had just been there temporarily because she liked working on cars. It wasn\u2019t a job she needed to feed her family and she wasn\u2019t going to be responsible for having a man with a family fired because he was offended by a \u201cgirl,\u201d as they called her, doing their job.</p><p>Pulling on one of the summer-thin camisole-and-shorts pajamas she preferred, Eve moved to the balcony doors she\u2019d slipped through earlier and opened one side quietly. The bed-and-breakfast had a full house for the next few weeks, though several of the rooms had been rented for more than two years now by three guests who often gave their free time to Mercedes to do odd jobs around the inn. Her mother greatly reduced the amount of their stay in return, and one to two days a week the three men took care of repairs needed in and outside the inn as well as yard work.</p><p>The one beside her was one of them.</p><p>Stepping outside, she moved to the oval wicker chair hanging from beneath the second floor wraparound balcony, with its thick, fluffy cushions and curled into it with a weary sigh.</p><p>She was exhausted, but she\u2019d never go to sleep easily if she went to bed now.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she be one of those people that dropped right off to sleep? Instead, she spent far too long staring up at the ceiling or with her eyes closed, fighting for peace. Or far too many sensations raced through her body, demanding satisfaction, as they were tonight.</p><p>As they had been since the first hour on the job that night, when Brogan Campbell had walked into the bar.</p><p>It was that arrogant swagger that made him so tempting. Or maybe it was that slightly tilted curve to his lips. As though he saw beneath the facades of those he talked to and was amused by the deceptions they practiced.</p><p>It sure couldn\u2019t be that red-gold hair with all the sunlit and burnished brown highlights it held that framed his hard-hewn face and tempted her to touch it to see if it was as warm as it looked. And it couldn\u2019t be the arrogance in those icy gray-blue eyes, or the subtle darkening that always affected them whenever she caught his gaze.</p><p>Whatever it was, the second he\u2019d entered the bar that night she\u2019d known it.</p><p>She\u2019d known it and responded to him.</p><p>Her breasts had swelled, her nipples becoming hard and peaked as her skin seemed to sensitize. She became so aware of the sensitive folds between her thighs that she felt them dampening, felt the slick juices as they made their way along the tender tissue of her vagina to ease out along the lips beyond.</p><p>She had become so horny so fast she\u2019d almost dropped the tray of drinks she\u2019d been carrying.</p><p>That was the effect Brogan had on her. And knowing he was sleeping in the suite next to hers didn\u2019t help matters, because she knew\u2014knew beyond a shadow of a doubt\u2014that he wanted her as well.</p><p>That was the reason she was working the job that would bring her home at the latest possible hour and work her the hardest. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t working her hard enough, evidently.</p><p>\u201cEve. Hey, Eve, you there?\u201d</p><p>Eve glanced up at the bottom of the balcony at the sound of her sister Lyrica\u2019s voice hissing from above.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be asleep, Lyrica.\u201d She grinned, keeping her voice soft as she answered her.</p><p>\u201cOh, great, that was you I heard drive up.\u201d Her sister\u2019s loud whisper was followed by the sight of a slender foot bracing on the outside of the balcony railing.</p><p>A second later the other foot joined it; then her sister was reaching for the thick post next to her and shimmying down it like a pro. Hell, she was a pro. All three of Eve\u2019s sisters were. They\u2019d learned early how to slip from the house and make the most of a perfectly good summer night.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t fooled their mother, though. It never failed that their brother, Dawg, or one of their cousins, Rowdy or Natches, or one of their friends would find them after an hour or so and escort them home. They were never out long enough to get into trouble, but always long enough to satisfy the thrill of escaping for a while.</p><p>Lyrica dropped from the lower balcony railing, barefoot, dressed as Eve was in a pair of shorty pajama bottoms and a snug camisole.</p><p>Her long black hair was twisted into a braid behind her as she leaned back against the rail she had just jumped from, her hands gripping the vinyl-covered railing.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to be helping Mom with breakfast in the morning?\u201d she asked her sister.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of what I wanted to talk to you about.\u201d Lyrica tucked a stray strand of black hair behind her ear as she shifted on her feet and smiled back at Eve brightly. \u201cI was hoping I could get you to cover for me.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s brow lifted in doubtful surprise. \u201cDid you even notice what time I came in tonight, or what time it is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you came in at two thirty and it\u2019s now ten after three.\u201d She waved the time away. \u201cCome on, Eve; it\u2019s really important. I know you won\u2019t get much sleep\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry no sleep,\u201d Eve reminded her. \u201cWhat would be the point of going to sleep if I just have to get up again in less than two hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know; that will so suck.\u201d Lyrica pouted as she brushed another strand of hair back and shifted on her bare feet again. \u201cSo you\u2019ll do it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Eve laughed. \u201cI said what would be the point of going to sleep if I were to do that? And I have to be back at the bar at six tomorrow evening. I\u2019m closing with Matteo, so I\u2019ll be even later getting home. I\u2019ll need some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eve; you can get to bed before noon, and that will easily give you five hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I easily need eight,\u201d Eve pointed out. \u201cWhat\u2019s so important on a Saturday that you can\u2019t help Mom and Piper with breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Lyrica blew out a heavy breath, her head tilting to the side as she gazed down at the boards of the porch. A second later, her gaze lifted as she stared back at Eve. And Eve knew that look. Her younger sister was considering the best way to work her oldest sister to get what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cTell me why,\u201d Eve bargained. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019m going to bed. Like I said, I have to help Matteo close the bar, and I need my sleep if this isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just important to me.\u201d Lyrica shrugged. \u201cI was invited to go with some friends to Louisville for a spa day.\u201d</p><p>Her expression became animated, her voice filling with excitement. \u201cMassages, a mani and a pedi, and being spoiled and rubbed and oiled for hours and hours.\u201d Lyrica was all but jumping in anticipation. \u201cPlease, Eve, pretty please cover for me. I can\u2019t just slip off and leave Momma a hand short. Piper would kill me if I did that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because then Piper would have the majority of the work in the kitchen as their mother fixed coffee, set the long dining room table, and made fresh-squeezed orange juice and the fruit bowls for the guests who came down early to catch the news, read the paper, or just socialize as they checked e-mail before breakfast.</p><p>Piper would get together the individual orders that were turned in the night before, prepare all the ingredients as well as the plates and silverware. She would have to do all the cooking and carry all the food out as well if her mother didn\u2019t finish early to help her. And normally it was impossible to finish one job early to help someone else with another when all the rooms were rented out. Lyrica wasn\u2019t even lucky enough that most of the rooms only held a single guest. With the exception of the three long term guests, it was couples.</p><p>Eve\u2019s suite didn\u2019t count. It was a smaller suite. The other side was a pantry connected to the kitchen and the large laundry room with two heavy-duty stacking washers and dryers that were used by guests as well as their mother to wash the bedcoverings in.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to give up eight hours of sleep so you can go have a girls\u2019 day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eve. The invitation came from Kyleene Brock. I\u2019ve been trying to make friends with her for months now.\u201d</p><p>Eve rolled her eyes. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve been trying to get close to her brother for months now,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cSame thing.\u201d Lyrica waved the protest away. \u201cIf I have to back out because of breakfast, then it\u2019s going to be just horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust horrible, huh?\u201d Eve tucked her feet up in the chair and knew she was just making her sister wait before giving in to her. Because she knew she was going to do it.</p> <p>Lyrica had had a crush on Graham Brock for years. She\u2019d been plotting just as long to get into that inner circle of friends Kyleene was so careful before making.</p><p>As one of the larger land owners in the area, and one of the few influential bachelors since the Mackay cousins\u2019 marriages, Graham was well sought after. Because of his popularity, Kyleene was extremely careful of the friends she made.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eve, please,\u201d her sister asked again, this time quietly, and with much more restraint. \u201cKyleene has invited all of us back to the house for a late lunch after we\u2019re finished at the spa, and Graham is home on leave.\u201d</p><p>Graham was serving his second tour in the Middle East, and Eve knew her sister had been watching for him to come home for months.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Eve agreed impatiently. \u201cI\u2019ll do it. But you owe me big-time, Lyrica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Eve, thank you so much.\u201d Lyrica jumped across the short distance, reached into the chair, and wrapped her arms around Eve\u2019s neck tightly. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d</p> <p>Drawing back, Lyrica threw her fist into the air in a silent victory shout before gripping the porch post and pulling herself up the railing again.</p><p>\u201cYou can use my door to get to the stairs, Lyrica.\u201d Eve laughed quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to risk life and limb climbing like a damned monkey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the fun in that? Love you, Eve.\u201d Her sister blew her a swift kiss before her gaze swung to the side of Eve\u2019s patio door. \u201cMorning, Mr. Campbell, I hope we didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d</p><p>Eve tensed with a silent groan of frustration.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly, Ms. Mackay,\u201d he drawled. The spicy sweet scent of his cigar reached her nostrils and had her body reacting to the sensual smell.</p><p>She pretended to hate the scent of it, but during those times when she forced herself to be honest, Eve admitted, to herself anyway, that the evocative scent would always be associated with wanting this man.</p><p>\u201cNight, sis,\u201d Lyrica whispered again before gripping the post and hauling herself up as she used her feet to push herself the short distance to allow her to grab hold of the railing overhead and pull herself up.</p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s related to apes, or she\u2019s missing a hell of a career in the circus.\u201d Brogan chuckled as she disappeared over the upper balcony railing.</p> <p>\u201cProbably a little of both,\u201d Eve agreed, swallowing nervously as he moved to the railing in front of her, where Lyrica had stood moments before.</p><p>\u201cShe knew you\u2019d agree,\u201d he drawled, clenching the slim cigar between his teeth for a moment before removing it and holding it negligently between his thumb and forefinger as he tapped the ash from the tip.</p><p>\u201cShe probably did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGraham Brock\u2019s too old for her.\u201d He frowned at the sound of the door closing above. \u201cIf he even deigned to notice her, he\u2019d break her heart and grind it in the dust without realizing it.\u201d</p><p>Eve sighed heavily. \u201cYou can\u2019t convince her of that.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she thought he\u2019d say something more before he brought the cigar to his lips and muttered something that sounded strangely like, \u201cSomeone needs to talk to him \u2019bout that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it alone,\u201d Eve warned him. \u201cIf everyone keeps padding her falls she\u2019ll never learn how to handle the bruises.\u201d</p><p>Eve watched him carefully, as if he were a wild animal that could attack at any moment.</p><p>Or maybe one she wished would attack?</p><p>She kept that amusing thought to herself as she crossed her arms over her breasts and prayed he couldn\u2019t see her hardened nipples beneath the thin camisole.</p><p>He made her ache so badly. Just looking at him, seeing the danger and the steel hardness inside him, all she wanted to do was touch him and feel it for herself.</p><p>With Brogan standing across from her, his six-foot-four frame wasn\u2019t overly wide or muscle-bound. He had that natural muscled look, iron hard and powerful without being overblown.</p><p>The dark shirt he wore was unbuttoned several inches past the collar. The long sleeves were rolled to his elbows, the hem tucked into jeans that fit his thighs perfectly. A leather belt cinched his tight hips, the fit of the shirt hinting at the powerful abs beneath.</p><p>A male animal.</p><p>That was the thought that drifted through her mind every time she saw him.</p><p>\u201cI tried to catch up with you while you were on break at the bar earlier,\u201d he stated, his voice quiet, the early morning silence of the land around them lending itself to discreet whispers rather than a normal tone of voice that would carry through the night.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Tucking the damp strands of hair falling over her face behind her ear, Eve stared up at him curiously. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dance.\u201d His lips quirked into a smile as he lifted the cigar and drew in the fragrant smoke before exhaling, all the while watching her between narrowed, red-gold lashes.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t dance with customers.\u201d She stood abruptly. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late now; I have to go.\u201d</p><p>She turned to rush back into her room, then froze, completely still, like prey suddenly aware of the predator lounging lazily just behind it.</p><p>His fingers were curved around her lower arm, not really gripping or holding her in place, but the knowledge that he could was clear.</p><p>Eve turned her head, glanced at the hand on her arm, then lifted her gaze to his.</p><p>He was once again amused. His lips were tilted to the side just a bit. That knowing look on his face had her wondering exactly what it was he knew, and was amused by.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep running from me, Eve?\u201d He moved closer, his head bent, his lips settling at her ear as he asked the question. \u201cEvery time I think I can get close enough to touch, you jump and run like a scared little rabbit.\u201d</p><p>Her skin was tingling where he was touching her. Sensitivity radiated from his touch, spreading through her body and making her nipples, her clit, throb in protest. Why should he be touching her arm, when the rest of her body hurt to be touched?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have the same instincts for when danger is near,\u201d she suggested with attempted lightness. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for dangerous men.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at that, and the sound sent a rush of sensation washing down her spine.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t calm her breathing. It was deep and heavy, rougher than before as her breasts lifted and fell with a quicker rhythm. And no doubt from his position he could see her nipples pressing\u2014</p><p>His hand caressed up her arm, the calloused palm and fingertips making direct contact and stimulating already too-sensitive nerve endings.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she whispered breathlessly.</p><p>Something warm and incredibly soft rasped against the top of her shoulder then.</p><p>Eve trembled at the realization that it was his beard. He was stroking the skin of her upper shoulder with nothing but the closely cropped growth of his facial hair.</p><p>The sensation was incredible. It was lashing heat and a cold storm. It was laying a banquet in front of a starving woman and daring her to eat.</p><p>Eventually, she was going to take a bite.</p><p>His lips brushed against her shoulder then as he curved his arm around her waist, holding her close to him, warming her back as his lips against the bare skin of her shoulder sent flames chasing over her body.</p><p>Nothing should feel this good. Nothing should destroy her defenses and her self-control this quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this, Brogan?\u201d Her hands gripped his arm; her head fell back against his chest. \u201cWhy this and why now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m damned tired of chasing after you, Eve Mackay,\u201d he growled before delivering a heated little nip against her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m tired of watching you avoid me, of always being one step behind you and never close enough to touch. Maybe you should have stood still for a second at some point so I could have prepared you.\u201d</p><p>Prepared her for that electrical current that zigzagged through her body and struck at areas so sensitive that the heightened sensations were bordering on pain.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve been avoiding you for a reason,\u201d she suggested breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cAvoiding me while you stare at me with all that heat and need for my touch in your eyes?\u201d he asked, his lips moving against the side of her neck as she tilted her head to allow him access to the oversensitive nerve endings she possessed there.</p><p>And there seemed to be a lot of them.</p><p>His arm tightened around her waist, pulling her closer against him. She felt his hips at her lower back, the heavy wedge of his erection unmistakable.</p><p>What the hell was she doing?</p><p>Lifting her arm and curving it around the back of his neck to hold his lips at that supersensitive spot his beard was brushing against, Eve\u2019s lashes fluttered in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cLike oil and fire,\u201d he said in a groan. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be like, Eve. Once it starts, we\u2019re going to burn down the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have fire insurance on my heart, Brogan,\u201d she whispered, forcing herself to protest what she knew would happen. \u201cThis is a really bad idea. Burning down the night can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart, burning down the night is the best.\u201d His hand flattened against her waist as he pushed beneath the camisole, his calloused palm rasping over the rapidly rising area of her upper stomach as she fought to breathe.</p><p>She quivered at the feel of his broad palm, long, strong fingers. They stroked up, lifted, then cupped the underside of one swollen breast.</p><p>\u201cFor over two years I\u2019ve watched those little nipples harden every time I\u2019ve come around you,\u201d he revealed. \u201cI\u2019ve tortured myself wondering if the honey was dripping along your pussy. Every time I see you leave that spa in town I wondered if you had your pussy waxed. If it was all bare, or if you left just a few curls for me to play with. I\u2019ve wondered, Eve, how the hell I was going to keep my head when I finally got close enough to touch you.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking.</p><p>Eve could feel herself trembling like a schoolgirl finally getting that first kiss from the guy she\u2019d daydreamed about all year. But it wasn\u2019t the captain of the basketball team or the football team, or the most popular guy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was that guy from the wrong side of the tracks, and she had fantasized that she was the pampered princess who had no idea how to handle him, how to tame him, but was desperate to try.</p><p>The problem was, she was, in reality, also the one from the wrong side of the tracks, as well as the wrong side of the blanket. She wasn\u2019t pampered or spoiled, and he was far too dangerous.</p><p>His thumb raked over her nipple, suddenly shocking her with the burning pleasure that lanced from the sensitive peak to the swollen, saturated bud of her clitoris.</p> <p>Her vagina clenched.</p><p>Her juices were spilling along the sensitive channel, slicking the bare lips, because yes, she did wax. The dampness gathered and built, preparing her for his touch, for his possession.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t stop it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop him.</p><p>He began turning her in his arms, eroticism filling the night, the scent of dark cherry and spice from the cigar he had been smoking wrapping around her senses. One hand slid into her hair, clenched in the damp strands, while the other wrapped around her back and dragged her to him.</p> <p>She stared up at him, watching the usually icy gray-blue gaze darken and flame and swirl with heat as her lips parted.</p><p>In that second, just as she was certain she was going to feel his lips against hers, feel the kiss she\u2019d ached for, dreamed of, fantasized about, the harsh, strident buzz of his cell phone suddenly shocked her back into awareness.</p><p>Eve jerked away from him, her breathing harsh, staring at him in disbelief as something dangerous, something dark and sensual flashed across his expression a second before that tilted smile curled one side of his lips.</p><p>\u201cRun, little lamb,\u201d he whispered. \u201cHurry and escape before the big, bad wolf gobbles you up.\u201d</p><p>She turned and did just that.</p><p>Rushing into her room and quickly closing and locking the door, she glimpsed the light of his cell phone suddenly flaring on as he answered the call, casting his expression in sharp relief.</p> <p>A chill raced over her body.</p><p>As he stared at her, as the glare of the phone\u2019s light revealed the shadows and contours of his expression, a flash of pure trepidation rushed through her senses. In his face, in his eyes, she saw hard, certain determination.</p><p>He had let her get away this time.</p><p>He had let her get away each time he\u2019d been close in the past two and a half years.</p><p>The next time . . .</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be nearly so lucky\u2014the next time.</p><p>TWO</p><p>It was so hot in the room, she was dying.</p> <p>Or was she so hot she was dying?</p><p>Eve tried turning the AC down, hoping the additional cold air would help cool her body, but she wasn\u2019t quite lucky enough for that to help.</p><p>This was killing her.</p><p>What the hell had she done to deserve this? To want a man, to ache for him until it felt like her body was on fire, and to know\u2014know to the tips of her toenails\u2014that allowing herself to have him would only end badly.</p><p>There were some men a woman just knew weren\u2019t good for her. Brogan Campbell had the potential to be just such a man.</p><p>It was there in that cynicism that wasn\u2019t quite hidden. The mockery that lingered at the edge of every smile she\u2019d ever seen on his lips.</p><p>He watched the world as though he knew all its cruel, bitter secrets and merciless games. He knew them, practiced them, used them.</p><p>Not that he was a deliberately cruel person, she didn\u2019t think.</p><p>Oh, hell, no, she was taking that damned thought back. Only a cruel, merciless, coldhearted, soulless man could have done to a woman what he had done to her outside.</p><p>Fists clenched in the blankets, she fought the need to relieve a little of the tension. Just marginally. Just enough that she could survive the aching burn in the depths of her pussy.</p><p>She\u2019d never wanted a man like this. What the hell was up with it?</p><p>All he had to do was be in the room to make her crazy to have him touch her, and now it was just going to be a hundred times worse. As far as she was concerned, she simply didn\u2019t deserve the torture.</p><p>She was aware of her fingers loosening, releasing the blankets beneath her and moving to her lower stomach. Aware of it, but helpless to stop it.</p><p>She had to get up in less than an hour, dress, and fix breakfast for a dozen guests who took the \u201cbreakfast\u201d part of \u201cbed-and-breakfast\u201d very damned seriously. And that didn\u2019t count the occasional friend of her mother\u2019s who stopped by. When she entered the kitchen there could be more orders waiting than the ones Piper and her mother collected from the guests\u2019 doors each morning.</p><p>Mercedes Mackay didn\u2019t run the typical bed-and-breakfast. Along with the regular breakfast fare, guests could choose how their eggs were prepared or if they wanted no eggs at all. They could request toast over biscuits, grits over gravy. Each plate was prepared individually and brought out rather than all the food laid out on the table or a buffet set up.</p><p>Breathing out roughly, she let her fingers push beneath the thin camisole top she wore. Her other hand pushed beneath her shorts.</p><p>Her nipples were swollen tight, so sensitive she had to bite her lip to hold back a moan as she gripped one between her thumb and the side of her forefinger. Rolling it slowly, exerting enough pressure to make the little tip burn with sensation, she fought to breathe through the pleasure.</p><p>The fingers of her other hand pushed beneath the elastic of her panties, sliding over the small area of curls that covered just the top of her mound before pushing further between her thighs to find the saturated folds of her pussy.</p><p>She was so wet, so sensitive and swollen that her own touch sent a rush of tingling sensation sizzling through her womb. Capturing her swollen, throbbing clit between her thumb and forefinger, careful to keep the hood covering her clitoris between it and her fingers, she began to work the swollen bud slowly, gently.</p><p>A whimper slipped past her lips as her hips lifted involuntarily, jerking beneath her own touch as she imagined Brogan\u2019s fingers there.</p><p>His touch would be firmer.</p><p>Tightening her grip on the tender bundle of nerves, feeling her pussy clench and weep in need, she caressed it slowly.</p><p>She wanted to push her fingers lower.</p><p>Simply stimulating her clit didn\u2019t satisfy her anymore. Once she found her release, her inner flesh still pulsed and ached, demanding penetration. Demanding something she\u2019d never allowed herself. Because the clitoral stimulation had been enough\u2014</p><p>Until Brogan.</p><p>Arching her head back, she rolled her hips beneath her touch, sparks of heated pleasure rushing through the swollen knot of nerves as the stimulation worked her clit closer to release.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She closed her eyes, keeping in her mind the image of Brogan bending over her, his hand between her thighs, his fingers working her clit, stroking her ever closer as his lips surrounded her nipple. He would suck it firmly, she decided. Hungrily. He would draw it in with a demand that refused to allow a protest.</p><p>Not that she would want to protest. She wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She would hold him to her, feel his tongue lashing at her nipple as his fingers worked her ever closer to release. He\u2019d have no mercy. He\u2019d push her hard, then hold her back, make her beg for ecstasy.</p><p>A moan slipped past her lips before she could catch it. She was rife with desperation and ever-increasing need, and the sound reminded her that the burning demand was only growing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whimpered again. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>She was close. So close she could feel the burning flames beginning to pulse and rage, the whipping sensations surging through her clit, building.</p><p>She was only seconds away.</p><p>A heartbeat\u2014</p><p>The harsh blasting ring of her cell phone had her jerking, shock pulling her fingers from between her thighs before she could stop herself, cutting her release off as it had just begun to build.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, a strangled cry of frustration escaping her lips, she jerked the phone from the table next to her bed without checking the caller and connected it with a frustrated flick of her finger.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d she snapped at the intruder. It was too damned early for anyone important.</p><p>\u201cIf I hear one more of those little moans\u201d\u2014Brogan\u2019s low growl shocked her into disbelief\u2014\u201cthen I swear I\u2019m going to pick the lock on your door, come in, and fuck you until you can\u2019t move. Until it\u2019s all either of us can do to breathe, let alone mowing the grass as I\u2019m supposed to later, or to help your sister cook breakfast for a houseful of guests. Are we clear here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he snarled. \u201cI fucking know what you\u2019re doing, dammit; I can feel it. Just like I always know what you\u2019re doing over there. Every fucking time you masturbate, I swear I can hear those breathy little moans you make, and if I hear it one more time, Eve\u2014\u201d</p><p>She disconnected the call.</p><p>Jumping from the bed, she grabbed her clothes and rushed into the bathroom, dressed, and hastily applied the necessary makeup before pulling her hair into a ponytail. Moving quickly back to her bedroom, she pulled on her sneakers, tied them jerkily, then rushed to the door.</p><p>She peeked out the door to the hall, saw no one, then hurried from the room before closing her door carefully behind her.</p><p>She was certain she had managed to escape.</p><p>She knew she had.</p><p>As she moved to pass Brogan\u2019s door, it opened with a snap and his arm jerked out, gripping hers with fingers of iron and pulling her into his arms as he turned and lifted her, pressing her against the wall inside his room as he pushed the door closed, trapping her there with his more powerful body.</p><p>Before she had time to do more than gasp, his lips covered hers, bold, heated, hungry, and demanding. He took the kiss she\u2019d been dreaming of and instilled an urgency she\u2019d never imagined in the erotic daydreams she\u2019d had.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but wrap her arms around his neck, her fingers pushing into the strands of hair that grew long over his nape and clenching to hold him to her.</p><p>Her lips parted, feeling his tongue lick over them before he took a quick, hungry taste. Tilting his head, he slanted his lips over hers as the kiss became deeper, harder. Dazed desperation filled her, the need for more of him growing in her, clawing at her senses until she was shaking with the surging force of it.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d His head jerked back.</p><p>The gray-blue color of his eyes was more blue now, gleaming with hunger, with lust as he glared down at her, his expression accusing as they both fought to just breathe.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing to me?\u201d His head lowered, his lips brushing against hers again, then immediately returning to the deep, hungry kisses of moments before.</p><p>That was fine with her, because she couldn\u2019t get enough of them.</p><p>The simple act of lips meeting should never explode through the senses and render self-control a thing of the past, she thought hazily. There should be some measure of control, right?</p><p>A hard knock at her bedroom door beside his had them jerking apart again.</p><p>The world was conspiring against her.</p><p>First his cell phone, now some moron at her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cEve, are you there?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Swallowing tightly, she jerked her gaze to Brogan\u2019s, certain disaster whipping through her senses at the sound of her brother Dawg\u2019s deep voice.</p><p>Brogan laid his finger against his lips, then, catching her hand, pulled her to his patio doors.</p><p>Opening one side, he stuck out his head, looked around, then pulled back.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he ordered, the softly voiced command harsh as he stared down at her with naked lust. \u201cGet the hell out of here before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Dawg knock again. His calling out her name a second time, his voice impatient, spurred her to do just as Brogan ordered.</p><p>Glancing back at him one last time, she rushed to the porch before turning away from her room and heading quickly to the front entrance. If Dawg was there, then her mother had opened the front doors.</p><p>Turning the corner to the main porch area, she saw she was right. The front doors were thrown open, the glass storm door revealing the hardwood entryway and the wide, curving staircase that led upstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stepping inside, she glanced to the entrance to the back rooms on the side of the foyer and watched as Dawg strode from the entryway.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he growled as he turned and moved quickly toward her. \u201cI need to talk to you a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone dying, dead, or in need of emergency care? For God\u2019s sake, Dawg, it\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the morning. What could you possibly need?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He stopped, his light green eyes narrowing on her between thick, lush lashes.</p><p>\u201cNo, no one needs emergency care. Not yet.\u201d There was a warning in his voice that she didn\u2019t have time to decipher.</p><p>\u201cThen I have to run,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m covering for Lyrica with Piper in the kitchen and I\u2019m running late.\u201d</p><p>She was actually running early, but she was so not about to tell him that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying for breakfast,\u201d he informed her as he followed her through the large dining room, the small tables already dressed with spotlessly white cloths and the colorful top cloths her mother used.</p> <p>\u201cDid you put your order in yet?\u201d she asked as she pushed through the swinging doors that led to the large chef\u2019s-style kitchen.</p><p>Dawg followed. She had really hoped he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMercedes has already taken care of it,\u201d he told her, pausing just inside the door, obviously finally remembering Mercedes\u2019s protests that only the cooks needed to be in the kitchen.</p><p>Grabbing the small stack of orders the guests had put in the night before, chosen from the small, select list of choices they were given, Eve quickly clipped them to the magnetic order clips along the wide hood of the combination gas stove and grill.</p><p>\u201cI went to your room to talk to you,\u201d he told her as she moved to the walk-in fridge on the other side of the room. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came in the front entrance,\u201d she told him, stepping inside the cool confines of the shelved refrigerator and pulling together the items they would need to prepare breakfast.</p> <p>Returning to the kitchen, she was really hoping Dawg would be gone.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He was standing where she had left him, a frown on his face, his arms crossed over his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Christa?\u201d she asked as she emptied the large tray she\u2019d used to carry everything on.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d he answered shortly. \u201cShe and Janey are going shopping or something today. The girls are swearing they need shoes.\u201d Bafflement crossed his face. \u201cYou\u2019d think a closetful is enough.\u201d</p><p>The girls were only six, but already Erin and Laken were shoe connoisseurs and purse divas. Eve loved it. She especially loved how her brother and cousins just couldn\u2019t seem to understand it.</p><p>\u201cSo what did you need?\u201d she finally dared to ask as she began preparing the homemade biscuits Mackay\u2019s Bed-and-breakfast Inn was well-known for.</p><p>Dawg shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll try to catch you after breakfast. I just need to discuss something with you for a minute, and I know what breakfast is like here.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke, the door was pushed forward firmly, slapping him against his powerful biceps as Mercedes rushed into the kitchen.</p><p>At thirty-eight, with four daughters and no gray hair or wrinkles, her mother looked ten years younger. Her long, dark brown hair was pulled back into a thick rope of a braid, revealing the high cheekbones and delicate features her daughters had inherited.</p><p>Five feet, seven inches of energy, Mercedes could outwork all four of her daughters most days and still have the energy to go out dancing that night.</p><p>Since coming to Somerset, her mother had bloomed. She was a social butterfly who loved meeting new people, learning where they\u2019d come from and where they were going, and even laughing at their bad jokes.</p><p>\u201cDawg Mackay, you are in the way,\u201d Mercedes informed him brusquely as she continued walking quickly to the large pantry across from the refrigerator.</p><p>Dawg pushed his fingers through his hair in frustration.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the living room,\u201d he growled. \u201cMaybe I can keep a door from smacking me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you don\u2019t stand in front of it,\u201d Mercedes informed him as she strode from the pantry, her arms full of white china plates and silverware. \u201cGrab those tea lights from the counter and come help me,\u201d she ordered him.</p><p>Eve almost laughed at his expression of male disgruntlement, but he did as he was told. Not before he glanced back at her, though, his expression warning her that whatever he wanted to talk to her about, he wasn\u2019t about to forget.</p><p>Breakfast for the inn\u2019s guests was usually something Eve enjoyed. She took pleasure in the preparation and in sharing the meal, and though cleaning up wasn\u2019t a joy, it could be fun.</p><p>Sitting down to breakfast a little after eight, at one of the busier tables after the guests had been served, she honestly thought she\u2019d be safer. Instead, she found herself facing Brogan across the circular table as her brother placed himself to the side.</p><p>Each table seated six. There were four tables in the room, and her mother often took reservations for breakfast as well as dinner if she knew the customers well. Normally the extras here were her daughters. This morning it was Dawg and a couple leaving after vacation who hadn\u2019t been able to get a room at the inn but had managed to convince Mercedes to allow them to join the meals instead.</p><p>Eve found it highly uncomfortable, though, sharing a meal with both Brogan and Dawg. Only hours before she had been in Brogan\u2019s arms, dying for more than the kisses and light touches he had been giving her.</p><p>It was almost impossible to keep her eyes off him now.</p><p>She kept glancing across the table, catching him watching her, then, as she looked away, catching Dawg glowering at both of them.</p><p>Her brother ate silently, though, and when he finished he drank his coffee, speaking only when necessary but keeping his eyes on her and Brogan.</p><p>Of course, Brogan acted as though her brother weren\u2019t even there. He still watched her, though Eve tried to keep her gaze elsewhere.</p><p>She tried, but it was impossible.</p><p>No one was happier to see the end of the meal than Eve when the guests finally began drifting away. Jumping to her feet, she began to clear tables and carry the dishes to the kitchen as Piper loaded the dishwasher.</p><p>Her mother joined her and Piper in cleaning up: first the dining area, then the kitchen. Sharing gossip and plans, they cleaned the two rooms down to the floors. The hardwood in the dining room and the ceramic tile in the kitchen gleamed with cleanliness when they finished and stepped into the foyer, a sense of satisfaction filling them.</p><p>Glancing at the clock, Eve sighed wearily, the lack of sleep finally catching up with her as she yawned slowly.</p><p>\u201cLyrica\u2019s going to have to give up on this Graham thing,\u201d Piper remarked as she caught Eve\u2019s yawn. \u201cShe has breakfast duty the rest of this week, and you\u2019re not going to cover for her every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Zoey, anyway?\u201d She looked around, realizing she hadn\u2019t seen her baby sister all morning.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s painting,\u201d her mother answered as she took a dust cloth to the aged wood of the sideboard that held the house phone, phone book, and tourist pamphlets just inside the door. \u201cShe\u2019ll be here to help with dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo will Lyrica,\u201d Piper decided. \u201cIf she can make Eve cover for her morning shift, then she can cover my evening shift and let me go out for a change. I\u2019ve worked a week straight now.\u201d</p><p>Eve frowned and turned back to her mother. \u201cZoey hasn\u2019t been helping?\u201d</p><p>Mercedes turned away again, running the dust cloth over another antique table sitting next to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, Zoey has not been helping,\u201d Piper answered for her mother. \u201cShe\u2019s been acting like a brokenhearted diva. And I could understand it if she were seeing anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiper, come on now.\u201d Mercedes turned back to her disapprovingly. \u201cI know plenty of times Zoey has worked two or three weeks straight so you and your sister could do whatever you were doing at the time. You and Lyrica can cover things for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind covering at all, Momma.\u201d Piper sighed. \u201cAnd if Zoey were actually doing anything then I could understand it. But it\u2019s like she\u2019s just hiding in her room or disappearing all day and half the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s painting,\u201d her mother repeated. \u201cYou know how she gets when she\u2019s wrapped up in her paints. You get the same way when you\u2019re designing, just as Lyrica does when she\u2019s writing. Zoey\u2019s covered for both of you when you were wrapped up in that, too. Give her a break now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I actually saw a single canvas with some color on it,\u201d Piper protested. \u201cBut I\u2019ve yet to see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t she been working a lot out of that empty warehouse on the other side of town?\u201d Eve asked. \u201cI thought I saw her taking some canvases in there last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe owner let her use it since it was just sitting there empty,\u201d Mercedes agreed. \u201cYou know how she is; she\u2019ll show up.\u201d</p><p>And she would, Eve thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d help, but I promised Sierra I\u2019d work at Walker\u2019s this week and next,\u201d she told them. \u201cThey\u2019ve had two waitresses quit on them in the last month and they\u2019ve not replaced them yet.\u201d</p><p>Piper groaned and turned to her mother. \u201cI can handle breakfast alone, Momma, but not dinner. You\u2019re going to have to talk to Lyrica.\u201d</p><p>Eve grinned at the familiar refrain. In one form or another, from one sister or another, it was the same argument and had been since they were children.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have help, Piper,\u201d Mercedes promised her with a laugh. \u201cNow let Eve go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to Eve first.\u201d Dawg stepped from the television and game room, leaning against the doorframe as he tucked his hands in the pockets of his jeans and watched them quietly.</p><p>There was the barest hint of gray in his hair, Eve realized. Right there at the side, when he turned his head just a certain way, she could see the few strands gleaming in the devil\u2019s black.</p><p>How old was he now? Forty-four? Forty-five, she believed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look it.</p><p>His shoulders were still broad, his arms powerful, his abs lean. He was still in his prime, and Eve knew his wife very much appreciated that fact.</p><p>He\u2019d waited to talk to her, and his impatience was apparent.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d She frowned back at him, surprised he was still there.</p><p>It was rare that Dawg became this stubborn over anything, despite his name and the rumor that he\u2019d acquired it because of his steely determination.</p><p>\u201cThere could be,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Mercedes moved to them, her maternal instincts instantly rousing.</p><p>Dawg looked up to the ceiling as though searching for patience.</p><p>When his gaze returned to them there was an edge of amusement in his light green eyes. \u201cMercedes, it\u2019s nothing for you to get worked up over,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI just need to talk to Eve about something, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get it over with,\u201d Eve suggested. \u201cI really need to go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She entered the television/game room and, turning, watched as Dawg closed the door before turning back to her.</p><p>Her brows lifted at the move to keep the conversation private.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d His gaze was intent as he crossed his arms over his chest and braced his feet apart as though steeling himself for a fight.</p><p>\u201cDawg, I\u2019m not in the mood for games,\u201d she told him, confused by the question. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept since yesterday morning sometime, and I have to be at the bar by six this evening.\u201d She glanced at the clock. \u201cIf I hurry, I might get five hours in before rushing back over there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw clenched. \u201cThen I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing to do,\u201d she agreed with a sharp nod as she propped herself on the heavily padded arm of the chair beside her.</p><p>\u201cBrogan Campbell,\u201d he stated.</p><p>Eve stilled. Dawg rarely had much to say about the men she and her sisters dated or seemed interested in. He watched, waited, and was always there if they needed to talk. But he never played the heavy-handed brother. This was the first time he\u2019d ever approached her about anyone she was interested in.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t say anything; she waited.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk, Eve,\u201d he finally said. \u201cA lot of people are seeing your interest in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She crossed one knee over the other before crossing her arms over her breasts and frowning back at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you? Interested?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She shrugged as though it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cCome on, Dawg; we practically live in the same house, and see each other often. He\u2019s cute as hell, and damned interesting\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s also a suspected traitor who was dishonorably discharged from the Marines four years ago.\u201d He shocked her, his tone heavy with disapproval. \u201cYou\u2019re family, Eve. I\u2019m not going to let you walk into something that\u2019s going to end up hurting or endangering you. Brogan Campbell will do both.\u201d</p><p>Eve forced herself to bite back the sharp retort that would have slipped free if he were anyone else.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s a suspected traitor, then why isn\u2019t he in prison?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cHe was discharged for striking a commanding officer while on duty. After returning to the States he migrated here. Within six months of his arrival high-ranking officers from Fort Knox began experiencing home and vehicle thefts. Those thefts were of top-secret military documents that were under review, or in the process of being transferred to locations where the information was needed. Campbell was seen in or near the area with almost each incidence. He\u2019ll be caught, Eve, and when he is, I don\u2019t want your name coming up in this. I do not want my sister suspected of being a traitor. That\u2019s a stigma that never goes away.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Staring back at Dawg, she racked her brain, trying to make sense of what he was saying.</p> <p>\u201cThere has to be a misunderstanding.\u201d She finally forced the words past her lips. \u201cHe\u2019s an arrogant son of a bitch, Dawg, but Brogan Campbell\u2019s no traitor.\u201d</p><p>He wiped one hand over his face, behind his neck, then turned away from her and paced to the wide window across the room. Standing there for long seconds, he finally drew in a deep breath before turning back to her. The look on his face wasn\u2019t comforting.</p><p>\u201cWhen he\u2019s caught\u2014and he will be caught,\u201d Dawg stated quietly, \u201ceveryone he\u2019s associated with will be stained by his guilt, Eve. Business associates, employers, friends.\u201d He paused, his jaw tightening again. \u201cLovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not lovers, Dawg.\u201d Eve rose to her feet, anger and nervous energy refusing to allow her to sit in one place now.</p><p>The only reason they weren\u2019t lovers was the fact that she feared that first broken heart. It hadn\u2019t happened yet, and she didn\u2019t want it to happen with Brogan.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He sighed, rubbing at the back of his neck again. \u201cBut it\u2019s in the air, Eve. I didn\u2019t believe it when I heard the talk that he was interested in you. I figured you\u2019d send him packing like you do every other man whose reputation is less than perfect. Instead, what I saw this morning was a man and a woman who couldn\u2019t wait to find a bed.\u201d</p><p>Eve felt heat fill her face as the words passing his lips sent embarrassment racing through her. She didn\u2019t drop her gaze, though. She had nothing to be ashamed of, and she wasn\u2019t going to act as though she did. If he was waiting for the shame, then he was going to be waiting a damned long time.</p><p>His jaw flexed; the fact that he was grinding his teeth was more than obvious.</p> <p>\u201cAre you waiting for an apology?\u201d she asked as she cocked her hip and faced him curiously. \u201cBecause if you are, you\u2019re going to be waiting awhile, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a damned apology,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI want you to find someone else to mesmerize you; that\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>Her brow lifted. \u201cHe\u2019s no traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel it, Dawg,\u201d she argued fiercely, her desperation to prove he wasn\u2019t tightening inside her. \u201cYou told me once that you\u2019ve lived by your instincts most of your life; well, I have, too. I\u2019ve had no other choice, any more than you did. And my instincts tell me he\u2019s no traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t your instincts, Eve. They\u2019re your hormones. And trust me, your hormones will lie to you and have a hell of a time doing it. And when your hormones have betrayed you, you\u2019ll find yourself sleeping with a traitor, under investigation for collusion, and your mother and sisters suspects as well.\u201d His shoulders flexed, shifting beneath the well-pressed shirt he wore. \u201cListen to me, Eve; I wouldn\u2019t lie to you, honey. And God knows it would kill me to watch you have to go through that.\u201d</p><p>Eve could only shake her head as her chest tightened with fear, regret, and an aching need she couldn\u2019t deny.</p><p>\u201cEve, he will be caught,\u201d he warned her again as he moved to her, reaching out to grip her shoulders gently, staring down at her, understanding and anger filling his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ve never asked anything of you. I\u2019ve done all I could to protect you, your mother, and your sisters. But I\u2019m begging you now: Don\u2019t let him destroy you. Don\u2019t let him do what I can see him getting ready to do to you.\u201d</p><p>This was truly the only thing he had ever asked of her, Eve realized as she felt her heart cracking with the pain of the choice he was giving her.</p><p>How could she ignore him? He\u2019d never ignored her, her mother, or her sisters. He\u2019d taken care of them. He\u2019d seen that they were fed, educated, and their futures provided for, and all he asked was that she stay away from one man.</p><p>A man she was so hungry for it was eating her alive.</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll try, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him, hugging her fiercely as she returned the embrace weakly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I ask, Eve,\u201d he said, kissing the top of her head gently. \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>Brogan glared at Timothy Cranston as he watched the monitor. The television and game room had a small warning plaque just inside the door. Notice: This room could be monitored by both video and audio surveillance. A small smile played at the agent\u2019s lips, but his brown eyes were narrowed, his expression thoughtful as he watched Dawg Mackay hug his sister fondly.</p><p>Of course it was fondly. The son of a bitch had just played the brother card and forced her to promise to stay away from the big, bad Brogan.</p><p>Bastard!</p><p>Hell, the ironic part was that he actually liked Dawg.</p><p>The Mackay cousins weren\u2019t known for their polite society ways, or their ability to soothe ruffled feathers. They were known for quite the opposite, actually.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, Dawg had laughingly told Brogan that he reminded him far too much of his cousins and asked whether he was a Mackay, despite the red hair. Six months later, Dawg had flat-out asked him whether the underground rumors he was hearing that Brogan was involved in the military thefts were true.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s boss had an agenda, unfortunately. Part of that agenda was pulling the Mackays in without officially asking them for help. Brogan had just stared back at him for long seconds before telling Dawg he was going to have to answer that question himself.</p><p>He\u2019d evidently done just that. Since that day, Dawg had been as cold as Lake Cumberland in winter.</p><p>\u201cYou told me Dawg and his cousins would keep their noses out of my business,\u201d he reminded Timothy as he leaned forward in his chair, frowning at the stark pain that filled Eve\u2019s expression.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to convince her brother that her instincts about Brogan were right. That, like him, she\u2019d had to learn how to depend on them, how to trust them, just to survive. And still, the brother who was known as not just protective and sheltering, but also respectful and tolerant, had demanded she stay away from the man it was clear his sister was unable to stay away from.</p><p>\u201cHe is keeping out of your business,\u201d Timothy murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s your sex life he\u2019s screwing with.\u201d</p><p>Brogan could feel his jaw aching from the clenched tightness of it. It was all he could do to restrain the urge to stomp downstairs and push his way into that room to confront the other man. To ensure that nothing and no one could pull Eve\u2019s attention from him.</p><p>His fists clenched, his short, clipped nails biting into his palm as he forced himself to remain sitting.</p><p>The last thing he wanted, needed, was for anyone to guess that he and Timothy were more than friendly enemies. Timothy had taken the same public stance on Brogan as Dawg had: a cool reception and a refusal to warm. It was required. Cranston was known as a former Homeland Security agent. Even the Mackays were unaware he was still an Agent in Charge for the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t in charge of this operation. He was only overseeing it. If he had been in charge, maybe, just maybe he could have convinced Timothy to keep Eve out of the operation they were conducting in Pulaski County.</p><p>Because the Agent in Charge of this operation had deemed Eve necessary. Even before Brogan had looked into those mesmerizing emerald eyes and knew he wouldn\u2019t rest until he\u2019d taken her to his bed, his boss had decided that Eve Mackay\u2019s participation was required.</p><p>\u201cI have things to do.\u201d Straightening from the chair he\u2019d taken in Timothy\u2019s small upstairs office, he turned and glared at the agent as Timothy sat back comfortably in his chair. Mercedes had designated the area as Timothy\u2019s and no one but no one, she\u2019d declared, entered without his permission. Even her.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d Timothy waved him away. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAhh, you\u2019ll be at the bar.\u201d Timothy nodded with a smile. \u201cEve\u2019s not a puppy you can convince to heel with treats, Brogan. I\u2019d remember that if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned good thing I don\u2019t see her as one, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said with a grunt.</p><p>Striding to the door, he opened it enough to ensure no one was in the hall before slipping from the room and taking the back stairs to the kitchen.</p><p>Mercedes Mackay left the kitchen open through the day, and plates of sandwiches and snacks in the stainless-steel refrigerator that sat next to the back door. If anyone caught him there, he\u2019d have a reason for it.</p><p>He\u2019d used a lot of bed-and-breakfasts over the years, and he had to admit, hers was one of the most unique.</p><p>Fortunately there was no one in the kitchen, and no one entered as he strode across it and slipped out the back door.</p><p>This was a fucking mess.</p><p>He\u2019d come to Pulaski County to find thieves; instead he\u2019d ended up playing the traitor and stealing top-secret files that were never meant to be seen by anyone other than those who were carrying the files.</p><p>The files were stolen from four high-level couriers traveling through Fort Knox, Somerset, Harlan County, and Pikeville. Others were stolen from the homes of the high-ranking military officers they\u2019d been delivered to. Each file had contained information unrelated to the files stolen before them.</p><p>Brogan had seen the reports of the files they had contained, and he could see nothing to tie them together.</p><p>Striding from the porch along the walk to the parking lot, he moved to the Harley and mounted it smoothly. Unlocking the helmet from between the handlebars and sliding it over his head, he activated the Bluetooth headset, then, with a quick flick of his wrist, turned the key and let the powerful motor throb for long seconds before pulling from the parking lot and turning onto the main road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDial Doogan,\u201d he said into the headset, activating the hands-free feature built into it.</p><p>\u201cDoogan,\u201d his boss answered before the first ring finished, his voice a dark, slow drawl that did nothing to indicate the man\u2019s impatience.</p><p>\u201cDawg\u2019s interfering,\u201d he told the other man. \u201cHe just pulled the brother card on his sister and made her promise to stay away from the big, bad Brogan,\u201d he said with a grunt.</p> <p>Doogan laughed at the reference. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMackays are known to keep their word, and she promised. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Pulling into the light flow of traffic along the main drag, Brogan headed away from Somerset and the temptation to follow Eve to her bed. He wanted nothing more than to make damned certain she didn\u2019t obey her brother.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Doogan growled. \u201cThink you can convince her to break her word?\u201d</p><p>That was Doogan, always going for the jugular.</p> <p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Brogan bit out. \u201cCome on, Doogan; she\u2019s one woman with no military connections at all. How can she possibly be of any importance to this operation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I said she was.\u201d The other man\u2019s voice lowered, his tone becoming darker, harder.</p><p>\u201cDoogan. I\u2019m the wrong man to keep in the dark,\u201d Brogan warned him. \u201cI\u2019m the one man who could jack this operation all to hell just by letting folks know exactly who I am. Don\u2019t force me to take that route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that because of one woman?\u201d There was a fine edge of surprise in his boss\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do that if you risked her, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if that isn\u2019t your intention.\u201d</p> <p>There were times he wished he knew the Agent in Charge better. Doogan was a man who had refused to climb the ladder of DHS success. He remained in his position of Agent in Charge far longer than he should have. He could have risen, taken a directorship or even a position as team commander.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my intention, Brogan,\u201d the other man finally assured him. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much: Eve Mackay is pivotal to this mission. There\u2019s one person in Pulaski County who I suspect knows a hell of a lot more than we, or our thieves, want them to know. My contact has spent the better part of eight years watching everything that goes on in that county. He\u2019s one of our spotters, and a damned good one at that. But even he doesn\u2019t know who this person is. All he\u2019s heard where these thefts are concerned is that they are tied together, and that there\u2019s one person who could answer a hell of a lot of questions if they would. The only thing, though, that\u2019s going to bring them out of the woodwork is if one of those Mackay girls needs them. And they\u2019d trust only whoever they trust. And despite appearances, there\u2019re very few people any Mackay trusts. If they see she\u2019s in your bed, and in your life, then you could possibly be considered in a position of trust and the situation deemed important enough to come out of the woodwork and reveal his secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if he knows as much as you think he does, then he\u2019ll know who I am and what I am.\u201d Brogan grimaced.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the thought of that at all. The very thought of it had a chill of warning lifting the hairs at the back of his neck. \u201cThere should be another way to ensure that this person makes contact,\u201d Brogan snapped. \u201cBringing her into my life might not be the best way to do that, Doogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way, Brogan,\u201d Doogan stated, his tone chilling at the indication that Brogan was second-guessing his orders.</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know it\u2019s the only fucking way?\u201d he bit out furiously. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me to endanger an innocent woman\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr save it,\u201d Doogan countered. \u201cAnd don\u2019t deny you\u2019re interested, Brogan. There\u2019s more than one report that\u2019s come in mentioning the suspected thief and Dawg Mackay\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he\u2019d just bet there was. He could practically feel the rumor mill heating up every time they were in the same place at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cIt might not be as easy as you thought it would be,\u201d he informed the other man. \u201cShe\u2019s made a promise now. She won\u2019t break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way this will work is if it appears Eve is aligned with you, Agent Campbell,\u201d Doogan drawled lazily. \u201cSo align with Eve Mackay and stop trying to convince me I\u2019m wrong. When you\u2019re the one reading the reports and listening to the director tear a strip off your ass because of military secrets falling into the wrong hands, then you can countermand orders. Until then, if it wouldn\u2019t bother you too much, try sticking with the plan we agreed on before you went out there.\u201d</p><p>Brogan could feel frustration and livid anger brewing inside him.</p><p>Without another word he broke the link before giving the cycle a surge of gas as he headed into the mountains.</p><p>He might not be the one reading the reports or getting his ass torn over the thefts, but he was the one taking the risks and fighting his own lust for a woman he was seriously afraid could end up owning his soul.</p><p>His father had once told him that a man knew when he\u2019d met his mate. That if he waited, kept his dick under control, and didn\u2019t fuck up, then he\u2019d find that mate.</p><p>He was thirty-four. A little old to be finding his mate, he thought.</p><p>Not that he believed in the whole mate-finding business. He didn\u2019t. But if it actually existed, then there was no doubt he\u2019d found his in Eve Mackay.</p><p>The hunger he felt for her was like a white-hot flame burning his senses and his common sense to cinders. He\u2019d waited two and a half years. Waited and watched, flirted with subtle demand, and teased until he finally managed to snag her interest.</p><p>Not that it hadn\u2019t been there before; it had been. But there were things that had to be done first, plans that had to be placed into motion.</p><p>Everything was in place now.</p><p>Brogan and his partner, his brother, Brody, now held the better part of the files that had been marked to be stolen. The inside source who had first contacted DHS gave them the information on each file targeted, and Brogan made damned sure he got to them before the real thieves could.</p><p>If the thieves wanted to acquire the missing files, then they were going to have to come to him.</p><p>According to Doogan, there was only one piece to the puzzle left to acquire: Eve\u2019s loyalty and the perception that she was Brogan\u2019s lover.</p><p>What would make a source contact him if he knew Eve trusted him enough to be his lover? What the fuck was going on in this damned place, and just how screwed up were the criminals operating here?</p><p>Pulling the cycle to a wide clearing at the side of the road, he turned around and headed back to town. Like Eve, he\u2019d had no sleep the night before, and if he was going to seduce his wild little Mackay, then he was going to need all his wits about him.</p><p>Because seducing her wasn\u2019t going to be nearly as hard, he feared, as keeping the independent, unfettered state of his heart intact.</p><p>He had a feeling Eve was invading it, and that could only spell trouble for both of them.</p><p>Besides, his long-term agreement with Mercedes Mackay included two days per week that he pitched in on the upkeep of the inn and grounds. And it was time to cut the grass.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Eve could feel a headache coming on.</p><p>Right there in her left temple. It was that heaviness that assured her the discomfort had no intention of going away.</p><p>And she should have expected it from the lack of sleep, the upsetting meeting with her brother, and the knowledge that no matter how badly she wanted him, Brogan was out of her reach.</p><p>To make matters worse, some of the less desirable members of the small Cumberland Touring and Motorcycle Club had taken a table right beside the step that led from the main floor to the bar area. Two of those members were determined that night to push her headache from irritating to migraine status: Donny Sutherby and his lover, Sandi Mikels.</p><p>Donny, nicknamed \u201cBowie\u201d by the club, was barrel-chested with a bearlike body, thick armed and heavy thighed. His straight, conservatively cut dark brown hair was thinning on top, while his pale blue eyes always looked suspicious and mocking.</p><p>Dressed in baggy jeans and a dark T-shirt that did nothing to hide his too-thick thighs and biceps, he swaggered when he walked, and even when he was sober one would swear he was drunk.</p><p>Sandi, a part-time stripper in Boston, followed him each summer, taking her place on the back of his motorcycle for the summer road \u201ctours\u201d the group took.</p><p>How a part-time stripper could afford to take the summer off, Eve hadn\u2019t figured out.</p><p>Her overblown figure was poured into snug jeans and the typical summer camisole that was at least one size too small as it stretched across the boob job she was so proud of. Personally, if she were Sandi and she was going to get a boob job, Eve thought, she would have gone with one that more suited her diminutive frame rather than a set of double Ds that made her look as though she were going to topple over forward at any second.</p><p>Donny and Sandi were sitting with Poppa Bear. Grady \u201cPoppa Bear\u201d Aarons and his wife, Mary, nicknamed \u201cMomma Bear,\u201d were one of the older couples. Poppa Bear had been a commanding officer in the army, discharged at retirement, and as jovial as they came.</p><p>He had a Santa Claus look about him, though his beard was shorter, his eyes dark brown, his laughter booming. Momma Bear was only a few years younger, slim and still a handsome woman for being in her late fifties.</p><p>Scattered around the large table with them was Poppa and Momma Bear\u2019s daughter, Baby Bear, a.k.a. Shanna. Also \u201cHondo\u201d Grael\u2014Eve had no idea of his real name\u2014\u201cPooh\u201d Yonkers and his sister, \u201cMarbles,\u201d and another brother and sister, Boo and Homer Kennedy.</p><p>The table wasn\u2019t overly loud, but Bowie and Sandi were ensuring that each time Eve passed their table, some snide remark was directed toward her.</p><p>Returning to the bar, she tried to avoid the table, but it was the most direct path to collect the drink orders she had, and she would be damned if she would let the couple know they were bothering her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Evie, is Brogan avoiding you tonight?\u201d Sandi laughed as Eve passed. \u201cHe\u2019s been here for a while now, ya know?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she knew.</p><p>Every tall, hard inch of him was there, dressed in jeans, a wide leather belt cinched at his lean hips, a white shirt tucked into the denim, several buttons undone and tempting her fingers to play with those red-gold curls across his chest. A pair of scuffed leather motorcycle boots completed the picture of hard-core sex appeal and danger.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Boogie, be nice,\u201d Poppa Bear chastised her, using the nickname he had given her. \u201cScots might be on the other side of the bar, but he don\u2019t take his eyes off her.\u201d He laughed boisterously.</p><p>Edging up to the bar, Eve sneaked a look in Brogan\u2019s direction and saw that Poppa Bear wasn\u2019t lying. Brogan might be talking to John Walker, but he was staring straight at her.</p><p>Loading the circular tray with ordered drinks and lifting it until she could balance it with one hand, with the other she gripped the handle of the pitcher and made her way back to the bachelorette party she was serving.</p><p>\u201cScots likes all the girls, though,\u201d Sandi remarked as Eve passed. \u201cHe\u2019s not a one-woman man, Poppa Bear.\u201d</p><p>Eve didn\u2019t hear Poppa Bear\u2019s answer as she made her way to the bachelorette party.</p><p>The eight women had arrived two hours before, and at the rate they were drinking, Eve had a feeling she was going to be calling cabs for the eight. She had yet to see their designated driver, and if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the bride wasn\u2019t going to make it until the witching hour, as she had sworn she would.</p><p>\u201cHey, here\u2019re our drinks,\u201d the bride called out, the bridal nerves reflecting in her eyes belying the goofy smile on her face.</p><p>Setting the beer on the table, Eve put their drinks out in front of them, then turned and headed back to the bar for another order. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bar, newly named Walker\u2019s Run, was hopping. The band was incredible, the singers capable of crooning or belting out the latest country hits. With both a male and female singer, the band was able to give the crowd the songs they wanted, the way they wanted them.</p><p>Drinks were flowing, the dance floor was full, and the managers, John Walker and his wife, Sierra, were out and about ensuring everything was running smoothly.</p><p>It always amused Eve that the owner of the bar, Rogue, had more or less given the bar to her brother and sister-in-law, John and Sierra, while Rogue managed the upscale restaurant, Mackay\u2019s Fine Dining, for Eve\u2019s cousin Janey Mackay Jansen.</p> <p>The restaurant was just as popular as the bar, though, and no doubt a line was starting to form at the doors there, just as it would be here soon.</p><p>Moving back to the bar, she almost changed direction and skirted the dance floor.</p><p>John Walker had disappeared, and Brogan had moved to Poppa Bear\u2019s table. He was standing between Donny and Poppa Bear. Sandi was sitting on Donny\u2019s lap, her hand stroking down Brogan\u2019s arm where it lay on the table, a sly smile curling her lips as she spoke to him.</p><p>The sight of the blond-haired witch touching him had Eve\u2019s fingers curling tighter around the tray she was carrying and her teeth clenching in anger.</p><p>Oh, she did not like that. Donny and Sandi weren\u2019t exactly faithful to each other. They each took other lovers often, and it appeared Sandi had every intention of getting Brogan into her bed.</p> <p>Serving drinks and gathering payments and tips kept her moving quickly. John had more waitresses coming in the next few weeks, but preferred not to train them on the weekends. That left Eve to fill in for the two girls who had left at the beginning of the summer.</p><p>She wished she could get out of it now. Each trip she made past the table, the other woman was touching him, and he wasn\u2019t exactly making her stop.</p><p>As Eve approached the table again she avoided Brogan\u2019s gaze. From the corner of her eye she watched Sandi stand and excuse herself.</p><p>Eve was almost past the group when she was suddenly thrown off balance and pushed hard into the wood railing that separated the bar area from the tables.</p><p>Reacting quickly, she grabbed the railing, righting herself before swinging to face Sandi.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, aren\u2019t I just so sorry.\u201d Sandi breathed out, her eyes widening in innocence.</p> <p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Eve gritted in irritation, picking up the tray and stepping up to the bar.</p><p>\u201cThat witch is out for trouble,\u201d the bartender, Dakota Wayne\u2014or Kota, as everyone called him\u2014warned her as he took the orders she\u2019d brought back. \u201cWatch yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, while I\u2019m putting your drinks together, could you run to the back and pull me some Jack and Johnnie Walker?\u201d Kota called out.</p><p>\u201cGot it, Kota.\u201d Shoving her tips into the front pocket of her jeans, she moved quickly to the end of the bar, lifted the hinged top, and entered the \u201cEmployees Only\u201d section.</p><p>\u201cKeys.\u201d Kota tossed her a key ring before turning back to the drinks he and the other bartender were quickly putting together.</p><p>Pushing through the swinging doors, she strode down the short hall before turning and heading for the liquor room.</p><p>As she entered the dimly lit, cool confines of the storage room and moved to the back shelves where the whiskey was, she was aware of voices in the office next door.</p> <p>She lifted the large bottles of liquor and placed them in one arm, and was turning around as the sound of a familiar voice had her pausing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d John protested from outside the storage room. \u201cThere are too many variables that could go wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they go wrong, then we\u2019re going to watch good friends suffer,\u201d an unfamiliar voice argued. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear this.</p><p>Deliberately bumping into a heavy shelf and causing it to smack against the wall, Eve cursed loud enough that she was sure to be heard.</p><p>The conversation abruptly stopped, and within seconds John was standing at the door of the storage room and staring into the dimly lit confines.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d Narrowing his gaze on her, he watched her, not suspiciously, but curiously. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s just been a long evening.\u201d She moved more fully into the light, knowing he would be able to detect the signs of the headache she was fighting. There were few men, or even women, perceptive enough to pay attention to facial expressions or changes in them; however, there were too many men in her life who did just that: her boss, her brother, her cousins. The men who had saved her and her sisters five years before, and their very small circle of friends, almost seemed to have a second sense for it.</p><p>\u201cNeed to take off?\u201d he asked, compassion lighting his pale blue eyes as he watched her intently.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to cover me?\u201d She smiled back at him, appreciating the offer. \u201cYou\u2019ll have Sierra out there serving drinks if you lose any more waitresses tonight.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced at the thought. \u201cShe\u2019ll start a riot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does every time,\u201d Eve agreed with a little nod as she moved to the door and he backed up.</p><p>Closing the door behind her, she let him have the keys when he reached for them, and waited while he locked the door before handing them back to her.</p><p>\u201cTell Kota that if he needs liquor to call back and I\u2019ll bring it out to him,\u201d he offered quietly. \u201cThat way you don\u2019t have to lug those bottles.\u201d He nodded to the two in her arms.</p><p>\u201cGot it, boss,\u201d she promised, smiling back at him before heading back up the corridor quietly and moving back into the bar area.</p><p>Wow, whatever those two were talking about, he didn\u2019t want to risk anyone hearing it again.</p><p>She doubted it was anything illegal. She knew John Walker and his wife too well, just as she knew her brother and cousins too well, to ever believe they would work on the wrong side of the law.</p><p>John and his friend were up to something, though, and that was scary. Because whatever John got into, then her brother and cousins were sure to follow. It was just the way it was when it came to Mackays and their family or friends. And John, his sister Rogue, and the Mackays, were definitely friends. And then\u2014and she knew this well from the stories she had heard\u2014then Timothy Cranston would get involved. . . .</p><p>Damn, she didn\u2019t even want to consider the consequences there.</p><p>As she dropped the bottles off with Kota, he was placing the last of the drinks she had ordered on the tray.</p><p>Handing over the keys, she gave him John\u2019s message and started to turn away.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, Evie?\u201d he asked her as she paused. \u201cYou\u2019re looking tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeadache coming on.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think John liked me being in the back rooms, Kota, so I\u2019d feel better if I didn\u2019t have to do any more runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d He tilted his head to the side curiously.</p><p>Eve gave a little shrug. \u201cIt was just a feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, the waitresses always go back there.\u201d Kota frowned.</p><p>She gave a negligent shrug. \u201cI just know what he said, Kota, and I don\u2019t want to step on any toes, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it, sweet pea.\u201d He gave a quick smile and nod, his expression clearing. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you stay on the floor.\u201d</p><p>Yippee.</p><p>Breathing out wearily at the thought, she grabbed the tray of drinks the other bartender, Matteo, pushed to her, and moved back into the throng. Though this time she carefully skirted the table where Brogan and Sandi sat.</p><p>She would have loved to know what the hell was going on with John\u2014 No, she didn\u2019t want to know, she told herself quickly. She knew his type far too well. He was too much like Brogan, her brother Dawg, and her cousins Natches and Rowdy.</p><p>Brogan, John, Kota, and Matteo were cut from the same cloth, and to poke into their business was to invite trouble.</p><p>No, it was to beg for trouble.</p><p>She\u2019d had enough trouble in her life before coming to Somerset to dare invite more. And she had no doubt in her mind that John was up to something. The group of men her brother was close to was always up to something.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so certain about Brogan yet, though she had hoped to find out. That aura of danger that surrounded him assured her that not knowing was probably for the best, though. This was as dangerous as she wanted her life to get, she assured herself as she evaded male hands attempting to pat her rear, cup a breast, or convince her to dance.</p><p>Her head was beginning to throb like gremlins were attempting to dig out her brains. And the gremlins were beginning to grow.</p><p>Glancing back to the table Brogan sat at, Eve saw Sandi running her fingers through his hair as she leaned toward his ear and said something. Eve\u2019s temples began to pound even more. Anger was rushing through her, crashing through her system and making her headache worse as she delivered the drinks to the proper table.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eve, that party in the corner is talking about rolling, and I don\u2019t see a designated.\u201d One of the bouncers stopped her as she delivered drinks to another table. \u201cShould I call a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check,\u201d she suggested. \u201cSomeone came in earlier whom I haven\u2019t seen drinking yet.\u201d</p><p>Moving to the women laughing and gathering their things together, Eve stepped to the table and caught the attention of the newcomer who had arrived late.</p><p>Tall, dressed in a pair of knee-length baggy shorts and a T-shirt, the other woman sat back in her chair watching the group with a smile. Her hair was pulled back in a low ponytail, the long excess pulled through the back of the ball cap she wore.</p><p>\u201cHey, Samantha,\u201d Eve greeted the detective who had just been hired to work with the Somerset police force. \u201cYou designated tonight?\u201d</p><p>An amused smile crossed the other woman\u2019s strong features as she adjusted the low-profile cap she wore.</p><p>\u201cI have them. A friend is waiting outside with another car so we could get them all.\u201d Samantha laughed. \u201cThough I\u2019m wondering if I shouldn\u2019t just arrest the lot of them.\u201d</p><p>The women groaned, then laughed as though the detective had just told some incredible joke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave them to you, then.\u201d Eve nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, Evie.\u201d One of the partygoers waved at her enthusiastically. \u201cWhere\u2019s your sister?\u201d</p><p>Eve laughed back. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one Samantha was asking Mellie about,\u201d she replied suggestively, her drunken demeanor more insulting than curious. \u201cSamantha is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFed up with the drunkards.\u201d Samantha rose to her feet, adjusted her cap, and glared back at the others. \u201cLet\u2019s go if you\u2019re going, or your asses can sit here.\u201d</p><p>Firm and reminding Eve far too much of the Mackays\u2019 tones when they\u2019d gotten tired of the bullshit, Samantha Bryce had the women moving within seconds.</p><p>Eve shook her head at the tottering group. She stood aside and watched them make their way to the exit as Samantha herded them along like children.</p><p>Poor Samantha and whoever her friend was. Getting those women to their respective homes wasn\u2019t going to be done easily.</p><p>\u201cYou really should give it up and stop casting him those puppy-dog looks.\u201d</p><p>Turning around slowly, Eve stared back at Sandi, wondering what she had done for karma to want to kick her ass tonight.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Sandi,\u201d she retorted wearily. She was really getting tired of this crap.</p><p>\u201cIf he wanted you, he wouldn\u2019t be there with us,\u201d Sandi stated then.</p><p>\u201cOr he could just be waiting for me to get off work.\u201d Eve turned back to the other woman, her smile deliberately challenging. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for Sandi to excuse her or not. Picking up her tray, she moved toward the bar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrogan\u2019s not white trash, Eve,\u201d Sandi continued behind her.</p><p>\u201cYou should know, Sandi.\u201d What the hell was it going to take to get rid of this woman?</p><p>\u201cAt least I didn\u2019t sell myself to some rich pervert, like your mother did,\u201d Sandi stated, disgust heavy in her voice as Eve started to step up from the main floor to the bar area.</p> <p>Oh, that was it.</p><p>Eve swung around so fast, so furiously that Sandi nearly ran into her. The other woman had to back up quickly, nearly tipping and falling on the stilts she called shoes.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d Eve demanded, the anger she had been fighting to keep a rein on all night breaking free.</p><p>\u201cOh, you heard me.\u201d Sandi sneered as Eve glimpsed Brogan rising to his feet, his expression suspicious as his gaze locked on her and Sandi. \u201cI might be white trash, but you and your family are nothing but low-class whores.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your opinion matters,\u201d Eve mocked.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to resort to violence. There were other ways to finish this, later. Clenching her teeth, she moved to turn away, determined to wait, to bide her time.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the place for a confrontation, even for her mother\u2019s sake.</p><p>Sandi suddenly reached out, gripping her arm as Eve tried to walk away. Eve felt the other woman\u2019s nails dig into her arm, breaking skin. A haze of fury rose in her mind, obliterating common sense. The dull ache throbbing at both temples was forgotten as the blood began to rush to her head, fueling the fury rising inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou might carry the Mackay name, but you\u2019re still a no-name little bastard with a tramp for a mother. Brogan doesn\u2019t need the likes of you, bitch. You\u2019re not part of his world, and he has no desire to be part of yours.\u201d</p><p>Eve jerked her arm back, feeling the raking talons of the other woman\u2019s nails in a distant, hazy part of her consciousness.</p><p>Others were watching. She could feel their eyes, their judgment.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t going to do this here. She hadn\u2019t fought in years. She had promised her momma she wouldn\u2019t fight unless she had no other choice.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d she rasped, the need to fight throbbing in her voice. \u201cOr I promise you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGonna sic Dawg on me, are you?\u201d Sandi laughed insultingly. \u201cHe\u2019s so pussy-whipped now he can\u2019t find his ass from a hole in the ground, let alone drag his fist out of his wife\u2019s snatch. He can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, the other woman was asking for it. She was begging for it.</p><p>Why, oh, why had she made that promise to her momma that she wouldn\u2019t fight unless she had to? Was she crazy?</p><p>She thought she\u2019d try one more time. \u201cDawg taught me to swat overblown barflies all by my lonesome. If you don\u2019t stop fucking buzzing at me, then you\u2019re going to find out exactly how he taught me to do it.\u201d</p><p>As she saw Brogan and Dawg, followed by John, converging on them, she turned to move away again. God, when had Dawg gotten there?</p><p>Eve started to turn, Sandi\u2019s arm went back, then flew forward, and she backhanded Eve with enough force to throw her into a customer\u2019s back and nearly slam his head to the table.</p> <p>Eve felt her lip split, but not with a sense of pain.</p><p>A haze of red descended over her vision as adrenaline crashed through her with a force she had never felt before. Before she could consider her actions, Eve turned, her fist jabbing into Sandi\u2019s face.</p><p>Right between the eyes.</p><p>As the other woman went backward, Eve was on her. She followed her to the floor, her knee slamming into the other woman\u2019s chest, holding her in place as she wrapped one hand around her throat and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cStay still, bitch!\u201d she snarled when Sandi went to claw at her face.</p><p>To reinforce the order, Eve tightened her hold on the other woman\u2019s neck, her fingers digging into Sandi\u2019s windpipe and not letting up until she dropped her hands.</p><p>\u201cInsult my mother, my sisters, my brother, or my cousins again\u2014touch me again, bitch, and I\u2019ll break your fucking nose. Then I\u2019ll damned well ensure those lovely dentures you have screwed into your head require major surgery to repair. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the crowd around them.</p><p>She could hear them.</p><p>Distantly.</p><p>She could hear Dawg and Brogan yelling at her. They were cursing, trying to get through the crowd to her, just as the bouncers were.</p><p>She was finished with the little piece of trash, though.</p><p>Jumping back in a smooth, well-practiced move she still worked at often, Eve landed on her feet just as Dawg and Brogan broke through the crowd across from her.</p><p>Her gaze met her brother\u2019s\u2014was that disappointment she saw in his eyes? No doubt it was. This was no way to ensure her reputation, her sisters\u2019 and her mother\u2019s, or his.</p><p>Adrenaline was still coursing through her veins, the urge, the hunger to fight flooding her system in such excess that when her gaze locked with Brogan\u2019s, it was all she could do not to grab him and stake her claim immediately.</p><p>Yet she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Tremors were shaking her from the inside out. It wasn\u2019t right. She had waited all her life for this, for the knowledge that there was a man out there who could ignite these fires inside her, and now she couldn\u2019t have him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, looking between the two men.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even know which of them she was apologizing to: Dawg, for wanting the one man he couldn\u2019t tolerate knowing she was with, or Brogan, the only man her blood raced for, her clit throbbed for.</p><p>Or perhaps it was for herself, because she knew it wasn\u2019t the promise she had made Dawg that she was going to end up breaking.</p><p>It was the promise she had made to herself.</p><p>The promise that at no time would she ever show her brother\u2014the man who had given to her and her family so unselfishly\u2014the least amount of disrespect.</p><p>Because she knew the chance of her finding herself in Brogan\u2019s bed was growing by the day.</p><p>What was he doing to his sister?</p><p>The agony burning in her eyes, the color of Natches\u2019s and similar to the emotions reflected in their cousin\u2019s gaze during those horrendous years he and Rowdy had been certain he would turn up dead, radiated in her gaze. Her face was stark white, blood staining her lip and cheek, the upper curve of one breast, and across her arm.</p><p>As she turned and raced from the crowd staring at her in shock, she made the turn around the bar and disappeared into the back rooms, Dawg blew out a hard breath.</p><p>Then he turned on Brogan, stopping the other man when he would have followed her by stepping in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough,\u201d he rasped, seeing in Brogan\u2019s gaze the same swirling emotions, needs, and hungers that he had seen in Eve\u2019s. Like Eve\u2019s emerald green, the blue-gray color shifted with emotion and fury and a need Dawg knew went soul-deep. He knew because it was the same lashing emotions that had burned in his eyes when he\u2019d thought he would lose his Christa.</p><p>\u201cShe needs me.\u201d The certainty in the other man\u2019s voice only sent rage crashing through him.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need you,\u201d Dawg retorted furiously. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need a traitor, Campbell. She needs a man with honor. Not one willing to trade his soul and his country for a dollar.\u201d</p><p>It had taken Dawg months to accept that Brogan Campbell was the man described in the reports he\u2019d had pulled up on him. Months of investigation and reaching out to contacts in the highest and lowest levels of the covert world.</p><p>Because he\u2019d actually liked him.</p><p>Because he remembered the boy Brogan had been when he\u2019d lived in Somerset so many years before, before he joined the Marines, and hadn\u2019t wanted to believe the fires that burned in him had turned so dark.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Mackay.\u201d Brogan was all but nose-to-nose with him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who I am, what I am, or where my honor lies, and don\u2019t fucking pretend to.\u201d</p><p>He pushed past Dawg, stalking toward the bar before one of the other two men staying at the Mackay Inn stepped in front of him. Jedediah Booker spoke hurriedly, his voice too low for Dawg to catch the words.</p><p>Brogan tensed, a curse slipping from his lips before he turned back toward Dawg, then strode past him and headed for the bar\u2019s exit.</p><p>Now, what the hell was that all about?</p><p>When Dawg would have left himself, Donny along with Eve\u2019s tormentor, Sandi, began to move past him as well.</p><p>Dawg stepped into their path.</p><p>He knew these two. Donny and Sandi were usually not much trouble. The girl had always had a mouth on her, but never one so vicious as to cause anyone to attack her. And never had he seen Sandi deliberately go after another woman as she had Eve.</p><p>\u201cYou looking to make enemies, Donny?\u201d he asked the other man carefully as he glanced at Sandi, disgust welling inside him at the memory of what this woman had pushed his sister into.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not, Dawg.\u201d Donny sighed, shaking his head in regret. \u201cThis was just a misunderstanding, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see her around my sister again and you\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d Dawg informed him. \u201cAnd you know I can do it, Donny. That is, if I can beat Natches to it.\u201d</p><p>Donny definitely looked worried now, while Sandi paled fearfully.</p><p>Natches\u2019s name was synonymous with the bogeyman since the day he had been forced to kill his own cousin Johnny Grace nearly eight years before.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t want Mackays for enemies,\u201d Donny repeated as he pulled at the loose neckline of his T-shirt as though it were choking him.</p><p>Sneering at the two in disgust, Dawg pushed past them and moved to the bar, intending on following Eve. Instead, he was brought to a stop as John stepped from behind the bar before he could reach it.</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s talking to her,\u201d John told him, his voice low. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure she gets home tonight. Sometimes, as my wife says, a woman just needs another woman to talk to.\u201d</p><p>There was no loosening the muscles at the back of his neck, but Dawg tried. Reaching around to rub at his nape in frustration, he blew out a hard breath.</p><p>\u201cCall me if she needs me,\u201d he finally said in irritation before shaking his head helplessly. \u201cHell, John. How do you survive hurting a sister?\u201d</p><p>Because he had hurt her, and he knew it. By making her swear to go against her own instincts and stay away from Brogan, he had a feeling he\u2019d hurt her more than he suspected.</p><p>\u201cYou let them forgive you and you go on.\u201d John finally smiled back at him in compassion. \u201cThat\u2019s all you really can do.\u201d</p><p>Clapping him on the shoulder, John turned and went back behind the bar to give the bartenders a hand.</p><p>Let her forgive him?</p><p>He turned and headed to the exit. He would love to let her forgive him. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t so certain he deserved it.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>John\u2019s wife, Sierra, was striding furiously through the hall leading to the bar as Eve pushed through it, intent on collecting her purse and leaving. Sierra must have left the bar while she was at the table with the bachelorettes.</p><p>Before Sandi had made a fool of her.</p><p>Eve didn\u2019t want to cry. She hated crying. But as Sierra stopped several feet ahead of her and stared back at her in disbelief, she could feel her throat tightening with the hated dampness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sierra,\u201d she whispered, pushing her hands into the pockets of her jeans as she blinked quickly to hold the moisture back. \u201cI\u2019m just getting my purse. I promise not to try to return.\u201d</p><p>She knew the rules.</p><p>As she had stared into Dawg\u2019s eyes after jumping back from where she\u2019d held Sandi to the floor, shame had surged through her.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought about the rules on fighting then. Not until she\u2019d seen Sierra and the fury glittering in her brown eyes.</p><p>Shame burned like a cinder in her chest.</p><p>When there was a fight anywhere on bar property, then both fighters were banned. The rule made sense. She really could have walked away, but once Sandi had dared to not just insult her mother, but to also use that sissy-bitch move and backhand her, it had been over with. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides, jealousy had been eating her alive.</p><p>Sandi had been able to sit next to Brogan. To laugh with him. To talk to him without censure, while Eve was restrained by a promise she couldn\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare apologize to me, Eve Mackay,\u201d Sierra demanded furiously.</p> <p>The tears fell.</p><p>Sierra was a friend, and now she wasn\u2019t going to forgive her.</p><p>\u201cThe fighting rule only applies when I say it does,\u201d Sierra continued, moving to her quickly, surprising\u2014actually shocking\u2014Eve as she wrapped her arms around her. \u201cAnd that rule does not apply to employees whom little bitches like that decide to torment all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eve shook her head as Sierra drew back, her hands still gripping Eve\u2019s shoulders and staring into her face in concern. \u201cI don\u2019t have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Sierra said gently, shaking her head. \u201cEve, that rule rarely applies to employees anyway. Once you get a couple of hundred bodies in one place, drinking and deciding they\u2019re more deserving than others, the first person customers take their attitude out on is the waitresses. That\u2019s why we have bouncers, and that\u2019s why we provide the girls with self-defense classes if they ask for them. Besides, I saw that bitch and her boyfriend watching you, obviously plotting each jibe before it was made.\u201d</p> <p>Eve sniffed, blinking again as she finally forced back the tears.</p><p>\u201cI should have ignored her. Or just gone home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on; we need a glass of wine,\u201d Sierra decided as she turned and headed back up the hall. \u201cAnd you need an ice pack for your cheek. The bitch must have been wearing a ring, because you have a hell of a scratch across it.\u201d</p><p>Eve lifted the back of her hand to her cheek, then pulled it back to see the smear of blood across it. She couldn\u2019t even feel it.</p><p>Following Sierra to the office in the back of the building, she sat down on the comfortable leather couch as Sierra went to the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of wine.</p><p>It took her a moment to pull the cork and pour two glasses. Once she did she handed Eve one before taking a seat in the chair across from her, her expression worried as she stared at Eve\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want some ice?\u201d she asked, sitting forward in the chair and crossing a leg over the opposite knee to prop her arm on it.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Eve shook her head before sipping at the cold wine. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprised me.\u201d Sierra grinned. \u201cWhen I saw how they were taunting you I told Kota to send you back here before I left the bar. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d do anything about it, and I didn\u2019t want you having to deal with that viperous bitch while you were helping me and John out of a hard spot. She attacked before Kota could tell you. I cheered when I saw you go after her on the security monitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have just escaped back here.\u201d Eve sighed. \u201cI promised Momma when we moved here that I would stop fighting. All of us did. We were wild as hell before moving here. At least one of us managed to get into a fistfight just about every day.\u201d</p><p>Life hadn\u2019t been easy before Dawg had taken them in.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only so much you can take.\u201d Sierra shrugged. \u201cBesides, she was too jealous to let it go. You\u2019ve managed to snag a man just about every woman in four counties has been after for years. Congratulations, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t captured anyone,\u201d Eve denied.</p><p>Only in her dreams, in her deepest fantasies.</p> <p>\u201cThe hell you haven\u2019t,\u201d Sierra said in disbelief. \u201cEve, that man can\u2019t take his eyes off you. Surely you can see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t want him.\u201d Eve set her glass on the table before covering her face with her hands for long moments.</p><p>Her cheek throbbed. She could feel her busted lip now, the bruise where the inner flesh had been knocked into her teeth.</p><p>Her heart was still racing, the adrenaline that had pumped into her system still searching for release.</p><p>\u201cGod, this situation is going to give me a migraine.\u201d She sighed, lowering her hands and staring back at Sierra miserably. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible, Sierra. For whatever reason, Brogan is the one man Dawg can\u2019t abide, and I understand why he feels the way he feels. I just can\u2019t believe Brogan would betray anyone, though, let alone his country.\u201d</p><p>Sierra frowned back at her. \u201cBrogan? A traitor?\u201d She shook her head slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors, of course, but that\u2019s just not Brogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Eve flipped her hand out, palm up, before using both hands to rub at her face in frustration. Lowering them again, she picked up the glass of wine, then set it back down. She had to drive home, and the wine would go straight to her head.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you intend to fight the fact that both of you want each other like crazy?\u201d Sierra asked. \u201cHe watches you like a starving man watches dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promised Dawg I would stay away from him,\u201d she told Sierra miserably, her throat tightening with emotion again. \u201cHe\u2019s never asked me for anything, Sierra, until now. And he asked me to stay away from Brogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eve,\u201d she whispered sympathetically. \u201cBut really, Dawg had no right to ask that of you.\u201d</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cHe told us when we first came here that all he asked was that we never betray ourselves or our family. As far as he\u2019s concerned, Brogan has betrayed his country, and to believe in him, to be with him, means I\u2019m tarred with the same brush. To Dawg, that\u2019s betraying not just myself, but my family, my friends, and the nation. And to Dawg, that\u2019s the worst thing I could do.\u201d</p><p>It had all been said lovingly, of course. And Dawg had hated saying it to her; she had seen that. But that was how he felt.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t believe he betrayed his country,\u201d Sierra stated.</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t believe he would do anything so vile, Sierra. He\u2019s arrogant, proud as hell, and so damned stubborn he probably makes people want to shoot him. But I can\u2019t see him betraying his country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re in love with him,\u201d Sierra said softly. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Eve sighed wearily. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know I can\u2019t stand the thought of denying myself something I want this badly. But I also know that if that\u2019s the problem, then he\u2019ll break my heart. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he will. And in turn, I\u2019ll break my brother\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>Brogan might not mean to. He may hate it, but it wouldn\u2019t stop it from happening.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can keep that promise, then?\u201d Sierra asked her.</p><p>Eve gave a bitter laugh. \u201cDawg saved us, Sierra. And I hate myself. I hate myself until I\u2019m sick to my stomach with the fact that the one thing he asked of me seems to be the very thing I can\u2019t give him. And he deserves so much more.\u201d</p><p>Dawg hadn\u2019t meant to eavesdrop.</p><p>He\u2019d been in the parking lot when Timothy had come around the side of the bar and called him back, bringing him through the side entrance to meet with him and John. What the hell Timothy was doing there, he hadn\u2019t yet figured out.</p><p>He\u2019d heard Eve\u2019s voice as they passed the partially closed door, and stopped just to make sure she was okay.</p><p>Now, as he heard the pain in her voice, aching regret filled his chest, he felt like a traitor himself. Hell, he hadn\u2019t meant to hurt her, or to make her feel as though she had disappointed him.</p><p>He rubbed at the back of his neck again as he turned and followed Timothy up the hall to John Walker\u2019s office. Once Timothy closed the door behind him, Dawg leaned against it, crossed his arms over his chest, and glared at the former\u2014he was doubting the resignation story now\u2014Homeland Security special agent and the supposedly unassuming bar manager.</p><p>There was too much going on here, he thought.</p><p>Suddenly Timothy was lurking in the back offices of Walker\u2019s Run, no doubt because that was one of the only two rooms in the lower levels where the security cameras could be viewed.</p><p>When Timothy had texted earlier to meet him there, Dawg had assumed they were meeting in the actual bar, not hiding in the back. And that made sense only if Timothy was conducting an operation.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, you little fucker?\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>Timothy grinned at the insult as though it were a compliment.</p><p>Little bastard.</p><p>At least he didn\u2019t look like a reject from the CIA anymore. His clothes were actually pressed, his hair combed. And he did smile more now than he had before Mercedes and the girls came into his life. Though Dawg admitted that the thought of Timothy Cranston with then svelte, model-beautiful Mercedes Mackay was just freaky.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I always have to be up to something?\u201d Timothy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe last time I asked you that question you called me a suspicious little bastard who needed to go home and get fucked so I wouldn\u2019t be so paranoid,\u201d Dawg pointed out thoughtfully.</p><p>Timothy grimaced good-naturedly.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to ask again, or send you home to your girlfriend minus some very important equipment?\u201d</p><p>Timothy chuckled at that. \u201cYou are too paranoid, Dawg. Even your cousins tell you that.\u201d</p><p>They did.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not up to something,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cNow, tell me what Brogan Campbell has to do with whatever the hell you\u2019re up to, and how do I keep him away from my sister?\u201d</p><p>Timothy sighed, then leaned forward, clasping his hands on the desk in front of him.</p><p>\u201cDawg, do you really think it\u2019s possible for your sister to be interested in a traitor? Doesn\u2019t that go against the Mackay DNA or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying he\u2019s not a traitor?\u201d</p><p>Timothy\u2019s eyes widened innocently.</p><p>\u201cInnocent\u201d and \u201cTimothy\u201d in the same sentence was damned terrifying.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would I know,\u201d Timothy protested. \u201cI just thought that, knowing Eve\u2019s intuition about people is pretty damned good, it seems funny she could be fooled by a man betraying his country, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all, huh?\u201d</p><p>Timothy nodded with apparent honesty. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d He held his hands out in a gesture of sincerity.</p><p>Sincerity and Timothy?</p><p>Had he just entered the fucking Twilight Zone?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pulling an op again and you\u2019re allowing Eve to be dragged straight into the middle of it. Now tell me what the fuck is going on,\u201d Dawg demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking the same questions I am, Dawg,\u201d Timothy admitted. \u201cWho Brogan Campbell really is, and what the hell is going on. What I am fairly certain of, based on the fact that he\u2019s lived in the same house I do for the past two and a half years, is that he\u2019s no traitor. And I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s not going to wait much longer before Eve\u2019s little heart is torn in two between you and the only man I\u2019ve seen her interested in since she came here.\u201d</p><p>Dawg straightened from his position against the door, stalked to the desk, and flattened his hands on the top of it as he leaned forward. \u201cHe will get her killed, Timothy. How do you think your lover, her mother, will feel when she finds out you let her walk smack into the middle of this and didn\u2019t tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>Timothy shrugged. \u201cIf I knew what was going on, I would of course tell her first. That\u2019s her daughter, and Mercedes has an amazing capacity to not just love her children, but also to accept the choices they make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if one of those choices gets them killed?\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re for.\u201d Timothy sighed then. \u201cTo keep that from happening.\u201d His smile was tinged with acceptance and resignation. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what loving them is all about, Dawg? Letting them find out who they are, and doing all we can to protect them as they do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck me.\u201d Dawg growled in resignation as he moved back and let himself fall into the chair behind him. \u201cJust let me kill Campbell myself.

And he was certain it could.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Timothy agreed. \u201cBut we\u2019ll be the ones who will know the truth as she cries. As she haunts the house and wonders what could have been. Is that what we want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be alive,\u201d Dawg pointed out logically.</p><p>\u201cWill she? Are you sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cWould you have been, if something had happened to Christa in that first week after she returned to Somerset?\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t have been, Dawg admitted. He would have been a dead man walking.</p><p>Rising from the chair, he stared down at the Homeland Security agent. \u201cYou know what the hell is going on.\u201d Dawg was damned certain of it. \u201cIf anything happens to her, I\u2019ll know whom to discuss it with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is pray, Dawg,\u201d Timothy said heavily, the fact that he was worried about her clear in his voice as well as his expression.</p><p>Dawg would definitely pray.</p><p>His uncle Ray used to tell him, Rowdy, and Natches that praying was good, but God liked to help those who helped themselves.</p><p>It was time to back up those prayers with a little old-fashioned action.</p><p>Mackay style.</p><p>Turning, he stomped from the office without waiting for a reply or an argument. Neither would do any good.</p><p>She was his sister.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to protect her as she was growing up, and he hadn\u2019t been able to ensure that her life was lived with at least a measure of security.</p><p>He was making up for lost time, and he\u2019d be damned if he would let Brogan Campbell or Timothy Cranston fuck that up.</p><p>She should have known he would show up at some point.</p><p>On second thought, she had known he would show up. She\u2019d actually expected to see him when she\u2019d arrived home.</p><p>Stepping from the bathroom, wearing nothing but a towel, she closed the door slowly and stared across the room to where he was sprawled in the easy chair sitting next to the patio door.</p> <p>As she leaned back against the door, he rose slowly to his feet, the blue-gray of his gaze gleaming in the low light burning next to the chair.</p><p>He\u2019d obviously had a shower himself. The jeans he\u2019d worn earlier that night had been exchanged for a lighter pair, the white shirt for a short-sleeved lightweight denim, though the boots were absent entirely, his feet bare. And he still looked far too sexy and far too dressed.</p><p>And she was far too underdressed in the large towel she\u2019d wrapped around her body. A body that was becoming far too sensitive as the adrenaline still simmering in her system began to come to a rapid boil.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she whispered, fighting the pulsing arousal she had yet to cool.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make certain you were okay.\u201d Rising to his feet\u2014her heart began to race furiously\u2014he stalked slowly toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine; you can leave now.\u201d She really needed him to leave now. Now, before she made the ultimate mistake of jumping his bones.</p><p>His lips tilted in a beginning curve of a smile.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared, little rabbit?\u201d The amused rasp of his voice sent heat racing through her lower stomach to clench deep inside her womb.</p><p>As he came closer, Eve found her grip tightening the towel where it was tucked above her breasts, gripping it with desperate fingers. The heat afflicting her womb flushed her face before racing through her body as the velvet slide of her juices eased from her pussy.</p><p>Hell, this wasn\u2019t fair\u2014to want him like this, to ache for a man so much, and to have his touch denied her.</p><p>He paused in front of her, his hand lifted, the back of his fingers glancing across the tenderness of her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIt makes me sick, knowing your pretty face has been bruised because of me. Sandi would have never targeted you if she hadn\u2019t been aware of my interest.\u201d His eyes moved over her face, intent, filled with purpose and regret. \u201cI promise you, though, I\u2019ll make sure you never have to worry about Sandi or anyone she knows, ever again.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging nervously, her breasts rising and falling as she fought to breathe, Eve shook her head slightly. \u201cShe just thought she could clear the playing field,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d he growled, anger licking at his gaze. \u201cShe belongs to Donny, and no matter the rumors about their relationship, there are some rules in the touring club, just because so many couples are so often in such close quarters. One of those rules makes her off-limits to any member of the club as long as she and Donny are together, and she knows it. The rumors of her and Donny taking lovers outside their relationship has never been true that I\u2019m aware of anyway. Besides, she\u2019s not the type of woman who draws me, Eve.\u201d</p><p>Nervous energy had her mouth drying out, her lips aching for moisture\u2014for his kiss\u2014her tongue peeking out to moisten them. Her breasts felt too tight and swollen, her breath catching as Brogan\u2019s gaze latched onto the parting of her lips as she fought to draw in air.</p><p>\u201cSo what type woman does draw you?\u201d she found the breath to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou draw me, Eve,\u201d he answered immediately, his voice low, deep, as dark as sin and sex itself. \u201cMore than you know. More than I should have ever allowed.\u201d</p><p>His hand turned, cupped her cheek, then pushed his fingers into the hair at her temple, easing back until he could clench the heavy thick strands at the back of her head. The other hand gripped her hip, holding her still as Eve\u2019s fingers clenched at the towel with a death grip.</p><p>Because she knew what was coming.</p><p>Staring up at him, she had plenty of time to say no.</p><p>\u201cI promised,\u201d she breathed out on a sob instead, torn between this man and a hunger she couldn\u2019t deny, and the brother who had saved her and her family\u2019s lives. \u201cI promised, Brogan.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing stalled.</p><p>Icy fingers of sensation, internal ghostly caresses feathered over her body, preparing her for his touch.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you promise?\u201d The cropped length of his beard brushed against her cheek, the feel of the closely clipped growth of his mustache rasping against the lobe of her ear as his lips caressed the upper curve. \u201cDid you promise not to be a woman? Not to be hungry for my touch, Eve?\u201d</p><p>He brushed a kiss against her ear, moved lower until his lips caressed beneath her jaw, smoothing against skin so sensitive that the feel of his kiss sent tiny explosions of heightened pleasure rushing through her body.</p><p>\u201cBrogan . . . please . . .\u201d But what she was begging for even she couldn\u2019t say for certain.</p><p>Was she begging for release?</p><p>Was she begging for more of his touch?</p><p>At this point\u2014</p><p>His head lifted, his nose rubbing against hers in a gesture that smacked so heavily of affection that Eve was lost.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t love, but no one . . . no one had ever stared down at her with such hunger in his eyes, such gentleness in his smile, and touched her with such easy affection.</p><p>The woman she was couldn\u2019t help but reach out for him as the sensualist, normally so well hidden inside her, came out to play, to luxuriate in the added warmth of affection.</p><p>When his head tilted, his lips slanting over hers, she had no choice but to accept the deep, stinging kisses and hungry licks. The hunger that raged inside her wasn\u2019t for sex. It wasn\u2019t just to relieve the lust that burned inside her.</p><p>Burning need raged through her body. Equal parts sexual and emotional: the need for touch, for warmth, for that hidden quality that couldn\u2019t be faked or practiced overwhelmed her control.</p><p>Emotion.</p><p>If not love, then affection.</p><p>If not forever, then the hope that forever might happen.</p><p>Loosening her grip on the towel, Eve slid her hands to his shoulders then behind his neck. One hand slid into the warmth of his hair while the other held tight to his shoulders.</p><p>Weakness assailed her, stealing the strength from her knees, sapping the memory of her promise and the will to deny him.</p><p>\u201cEve. Ah, baby,\u201d he growled against her lips a second before he lifted her to him.</p><p>His hips jerked into hers, the heavy ridge of his erection pressing firmly against the intimate mound between her thighs. The feel of the towel loosening from between her breasts brought only a second\u2019s thought before it was pushed away.</p><p>She would remember why she wasn\u2019t supposed to let him touch her when the cold light of day burned away the sensual illusions he was weaving around her.</p><p>For now\u2014for this moment and this man\u2014she needed just a little time, just a night to prove to herself that when morning did come, she would still be the woman she was now.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s kisses became deeper, more drugging, filling her with such a sense of overriding hunger that nothing mattered but his touch and touching him.</p><p>Her hands slid to his broad chest, her fingers shaking, clenching in the material of his shirt. Sensual, sexual intoxication dragged her deeper into the chaotic needs rising inside her, refusing to allow her to think or to control the hunger raging through her.</p><p>The feel of Brogan\u2019s hand sliding along the naked skin of her hip, caressing its way higher until it rested just beneath her breast, was like pouring an accelerant on the fires already raging out of control inside her.</p><p>Her fingers unclenched, trembling; she was desperate to touch him. Struggling with the buttons of his shirt, her hips shifted against his, the ache between her thighs building.</p><p>The heavy erection pressing against her had her body reacting with feminine demand, with a need to feel him hot and naked against her, taking her, driving into her with the power and fierce heat she could feel throbbing beneath his jeans.</p><p>As the last button slipped free, she pushed at the material, forcing it over his shoulders and whimpering beneath his kiss when the garment would go no farther.</p><p>A second later his hands cupped her rear and then turned and strode the few feet to the bed. His kiss never paused; the hunger raging through it never dimmed. When her back met the mattress his head lifted, forcing her eyes to open, her hands to tighten around his neck to bring him back to her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t leaving her, as she had feared.</p><p>His lips traveled instead to her jawline, then beneath it, moving down the column of her neck as it arched back, an agony of pleasure attacking her senses as his teeth raked against her flesh. His tongue licked and stroked, playing with her nerve endings and sending sensations racing through them. His lips kissed, took fiery tastes of her skin at intervals, and moved lower with each kiss as she arched to him.</p><p>Chaos clashed with the pleasure rising through her system as need burned through her senses. Lying naked beneath him, Eve was aware of every point of contact as the material of his jeans brushed against her thighs and hips. The rasp of chest hair brushed across her nipples, sensitizing them further.</p><p>His hand was at her hip, holding her still as she tried to move beneath him; she was desperate for some point of contact against the swollen, aching bud of her clit.</p><p>A whimper escaped her as her nails bit into his shoulders, the feel of his knee suddenly pressing between hers and driving the hard muscle of his thigh against her pussy dragged a startled cry from her lips.</p><p>Her juices trickled from her vagina, saturating the folds beyond and spilling a heated layer of slick warmth along her clitoris as she rubbed herself against his thigh. The stimulation against the bundle of nerves sent shards of sharpened sensation exploding to her womb. The driving need for more\u2014more touch, more sensation\u2014rose inside her with a burning force.</p><p>Heat brushed against the curves of her breasts; the rasp of his beard rubbing against the tender skin sent her hands searching between their bodies and finding his belt.</p><p>She wanted him naked. She wanted bare skin meeting bare skin from breast to ankle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips brushed against the outer curve of her breast, kissed it in passing, then eased higher, his tongue probing, licking, searching\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Oh, God. Brogan.\u201d She gasped, arching to him as his lips surrounded the tight, violently sensitive peak and sucked it into the heated depths of his mouth.</p><p>Liquid flames surrounded it.</p><p>The heated stroke of his tongue against the nerve endings gathered there sent pure ecstasy racing to her womb, her clit, exploding inside them and driving the need tearing through her higher.</p> <p>Eve tore his belt loose. Her fingers tugged at the metal buttons of his jeans. Pulling and tugging, she struggled with them until they were free, pushing aside the material before freezing in shock. A harsh moan escaped her as her hands found the long, broad length of his cock as it rose between his thighs. The flared crest was slightly damp, the shaft throbbing, pounding with the blood racing through the heavy veins just beneath the silken flesh that stretched tight over the iron strength.</p><p>There were too many sensations.</p><p>She felt a roughened heat against her nipple as he sucked at first one delicate tip, then the other. With thumb and forefinger he gripped the other peak, tugging and milking it with his fingers as electric forks of sensation slapped at her clit with each stroke.</p><p>She fought to breathe. She fought to understand the force of the sensations whipping out of control and blazing through her senses, and couldn\u2019t seem to do it.</p><p>As his hand moved from her breast and slid down her waist, over her abdomen, then tucked between her thighs as his knee eased back, Eve knew she was doomed.</p> <p>Right here in this bed on this sultry summer night, she lost herself.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t entirely certain she would be able to find herself once the pleasure was over.</p><p>SIX</p><p>Eve never imagined pleasure could be this extreme.</p><p>She\u2019d never before had her control stripped by a kiss or a little heavy petting.</p><p>She\u2019d never lost herself to the point that a man had actually managed to get his hands between her thighs, or to the point that she was so wet, so wild, that nothing mattered but Brogan\u2019s touch. She\u2019d been waiting for this. For a pleasure so extreme she couldn\u2019t deny it or the man giving it to her. Until Brogan, that hadn\u2019t happened.</p> <p>His fingers slipped through the thick layer of juices that gathered between the folds of her pussy. As they slid through the narrow slit, he parted the inner lips, his thumb pressing against her clitoris as he rubbed the clenched entrance with his fingers.</p><p>Lifting closer, desperate for his touch, aching for more, Eve whimpered at the heat flooding her senses and the driving hunger spurring it. She parted her thighs further, her hips shifting, arching to him, the feel of his mouth devouring her nipple as his thumb pressed against her aching clit dragging a low, harsh cry from her throat.</p><p>Suckling, licking, rasping the hardened peak of her breast, Brogan began to ease the tips of two fingers inside her. The feel of the entrance parting, stretching, her juices flowing to meet his touch suspended her breath for precious seconds.</p><p>Her fingers clenched in his hair as a gasp burst from her lips. It was all she could do to keep from screaming with the pleasure.</p><p>Sinking, falling deeper into the rapture surrounding her, Eve gave herself to the drowning sensations. So much so that when the sharp knock against her patio door exploded through the room, she wasn\u2019t entirely certain what it was, or where it was coming from at first.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s head jerked up and turned to the doors as Eve stared back at him, dazed.</p><p>The knock came again.</p><p>\u201cEve, are you awake?\u201d Dawg called out. \u201cI know you are; the light\u2019s on, sweetie. Come on; I just want to talk to you for a minute.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of her brother\u2019s voice was like cold water suddenly surrounding her body.</p><p>Oh, God, what had she done?</p><p>Staring up at Brogan, she was suddenly horrified. The thought that she was betraying Dawg, betraying every belief he had in loyalty to one\u2019s country and defending their freedom, rushed through her.</p><p>If he found Brogan here he would never forgive her.</p><p>If he had been disappointed in her before, how much more would he be now?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eve; just talk to me for a minute,\u201d he called out again as Brogan moved back from her, his jaw clenching, his blue-gray eyes flickering with frustration.</p><p>Jerking his shirt from the floor, he tossed the towel to her bed and hurriedly moved to the door connecting the bedroom to the sitting area.</p><p>Jumping from the bed, Eve grabbed her robe from the tall dressing screen on the other side of her bed and quickly pulled it on, tying it as she rushed to the patio door.</p><p>She opened the door just enough to face him, glaring at him, uncertain whether it was Dawg or herself she was suddenly angry with.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever sleep, Dawg?\u201d she questioned him, hearing the roughness in her voice, feeling the heat that still flushed her body, and terrified he\u2019d realize what she had been doing.</p><p>The look in his eyes sent guilt tearing through her.</p><p>He looked as miserable as she had felt at the bar. His celadon eyes were a shade darker, still such a light color it was hard to tell whether they were green or a very light blue or gray in the dim light of the room.</p><p>A heavy frown pulled at his brow as he reached back, rubbed at his neck, and sighed wearily.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t go home without checking on you,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI had to make sure you were okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dawg,\u201d she said with a sigh, her chest tightening with such regret and pain that the ache actually tugged at her heart. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it a little late for a married man such as yourself to be running the roads?\u201d</p><p>A heavy expulsion of breath met her question. \u201cSome things can only be done at night, it seems.\u201d He grinned back at her. \u201cBut this couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as you can see, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, ran the fingers of one hand through his hair, then propped both hands at his hips before sliding them into the back pockets of his jeans.</p><p>Damn, her brother was nervous. She had never seen Dawg nervous.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he finally said roughly, \u201cI was damned proud of you tonight at the bar. You kept your head and didn\u2019t let Sandi goad you with her insults. But once she struck, you took care of things damned well, Eve. I worry, you know.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her for a second, clearly not finished.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked anyway.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you and your sisters,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThat somehow you\u2019ll get hurt, seriously hurt, because I might not be where you need me. Or because someone decided to go on a rampage wherever you are. Knowing you have the ability to defend yourself makes me breathe a little easier. I\u2019ll sleep a little better.\u201d</p><p>God, he was serious.</p><p>The surge of thankfulness that he even thought about her while she wasn\u2019t in his sight rushed through her. It was almost as strong as the guilt tearing her apart now that Brogan was no longer touching her.</p><p>\u201cDawg, I try to be careful,\u201d she promised him. \u201cAnd I know Piper, Lyrica, and Zoey do as well. You, Rowdy, and Natches have taught us to fight and how to use our heads. The rest of it is up to us. You can\u2019t watch us twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>He nodded slowly, looked away again for long moments, then turned back to her.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAbout Brogan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Eve gave her head a hard shake as her hand clenched on the side of the door. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about Brogan, Dawg. Please.\u201d</p><p>This was tearing her apart. It was destroying her as nothing ever had. As nothing ever could. Guilt at her deception, at the knowledge that Brogan was standing just on the other side of the door between her bedroom and the sitting room, dug into her heart. It was like a lance piercing her soul, the knowledge that she was breaking her word to the only person who had ever given a damn about her besides her mother and sisters.</p><p>Dawg knew guilt when he saw it. Just as he knew the agony of thinking, believing something that should have been his never would be.</p><p>The day Christa had told him she had lost their baby when she had been little more than a teenager, that summer she had run from Somerset. He\u2019d felt it then. Felt his soul being sliced in two with a jagged blade.</p><p>That was the pain he saw in Eve\u2019s eyes now as nervous guilt darkened them.</p><p>How could he tell her he hadn\u2019t meant for her to believe she was betraying him with Brogan without effectively giving her permission or the go-ahead to have a man he knew would endanger her?</p><p>She would become a weakness to Brogan as well. A man doing what Dawg suspected Brogan was doing couldn\u2019t afford such a thing. A woman like Eve could break a man\u2019s soul when she was harmed because of his job or something he was doing. But even more, it would destroy Dawg and ensure that he killed Brogan himself.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Eve,\u201d he finally said, \u201cI\u2019ve always been proud of you, and I\u2019ve always been proud to call you my sister.\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him, the pain in her expression only intensifying as she looked away from him, blinking.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my sister, Eve,\u201d he tried again, knowing he was failing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Dawg,\u201d she whispered, nodding as she stared back at him. \u201cThat means more to me than you know.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his hands deeper into his pockets. Maybe he should have brought Christa with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired, Dawg.\u201d Those were tears in her voice.</p><p>He sharpened his gaze on her face, catching the glitter of moisture in her eyes, and cursed himself. He could kick himself if he could reach his own ass, he thought. Son of a bitch, what was he doing to her? Was this the kind of father he was going to be?</p><p>His sisters were practice, he\u2019d always said. Lately, all he\u2019d done was make them cry.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you hurt, Eve,\u201d he tried again. Pulling his hands from his pockets, he laid them on her shoulders, forcing her to stare back at him. \u201cSometimes, just because our instincts might be right about the person, they\u2019re not always right about whether or not we can trust our hearts to them, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dawg.\u201d She stepped back from him slowly. \u201cGo home to your wife and daughter. Get some sleep. I\u2019m all tucked into bed, safe and sound. No one\u2019s going to hurt me tonight.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>He breathed out in irritation and self-disgust.</p><p>Yeah, this was a job for Christa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d He sighed. \u201cGet some sleep, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back, she closed the door, and a second later the sliver of light at the side of the heavy curtains covering the glass blinked out.</p><p>Dawg shook his head, paused, then turned on his heel and forced himself to walk to the main porch entrance where he\u2019d parked.</p><p>Once he reached the steps, he paused.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, he looked around slowly.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. . . .</p><p>Brogan stepped back into the room, finding Eve as she stood by the patio doors. Her head was lowered, the midnight black silk of her hair falling around her face as he watched her shoulders tremble for a second.</p><p>He could shoot Dawg.</p><p>The son of a bitch just didn\u2019t know when to leave well enough alone.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d Eve shook her head as she lifted it before moving across the room to where he stood.</p><p>Walking past him, she jerked the door open and stalked into the other room of her suite before turning to face him.</p><p>\u201cAfraid he\u2019ll be watching for me?\u201d he asked, unable to keep the mockery out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s suspicious.\u201d She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to know I broke my promise to him, Brogan. Until I decide what\u2019s more important, how my brother feels or what you want from me, then I can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>Crossing his arms over his chest, he frowned down at her. \u201cHave you asked me what I want from you, Eve?\u201d Hell, no, she hadn\u2019t. But she didn\u2019t have a problem making decisions about what he wanted from her without his input, it seemed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to know,\u201d she admitted, and that only pissed him off further. \u201cBut I do know that Dawg has never asked me or my sisters and mother for anything. Not a damned thing, Brogan, for taking us in and securing our lives and our futures. Everything we have and everything we are, we owe to him. And all he\u2019s ever asked is that I stay away from you until you can prove you\u2019re not the man his contacts say you are.\u201d</p><p>There, it was all out in the open now.</p><p>His jaw clenched in anger as he glared back at her, wondering whether she believed the rumors or believed in herself and her instincts.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what kind of man do his contacts report I am?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019ve betrayed your country,\u201d she whispered, her expression so filled with hunger, need, and pain that she tempted him to paddle her ass and show her what she could believe in.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I betrayed my country?\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter about the reports or what she believed. He was going to have her. Tonight had proven to him that without his protection right now, certain people would consider her fair game simply because it was known he was interested. Donny and Sandi had made the first strike, but Brogan knew his interest in her was well known. If the men he was searching for suspected he was a government agent, then it could be much worse.</p><p>Even more important, he had to get this operation behind them so he could find the time and the space he needed to figure out what she was to him as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think, Brogan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s what Dawg thinks he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always obey your brother?\u201d He knew he wasn\u2019t being fair to her, but by God, she was his. She was going to have to make a choice, and she was going to have to make it soon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making it that simple,\u201d he growled as she turned and jerked the bedroom door open.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll follow along,\u201d she retorted, the emerald of her eyes lighting with an inner flame that only made his dick harder. Only made him want her beneath him more.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to argue this with her five minutes after her brother had left. No doubt Dawg had already suspected he was there, and he\u2019d said just what he\u2019d known he needed to. His object was to keep Eve from sleeping with Brogan, and tonight he\u2019d achieved his objective.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this. Soon,\u201d he warned her, stomping to the patio door.</p><p>Eve stared up at him, seeing the promise in his eyes and almost shivering at the latent dominance and pure demand in his look.</p><p>Her lips parted to argue, to inform him that they\u2019d discuss it when she was ready, when a sudden, horrified scream pierced the house.</p><p>The layout of the house put the kitchen directly across from her and Brogan, on the other side of the house. There were two halls leading from the kitchen to each wing. The shortest distance to the kitchen was the narrow hall just outside Brogan\u2019s room that opened directly into the kitchen.</p><p>Before the scream was silenced, she and Brogan both were running.</p><p>He made damned sure she didn\u2019t get ahead of him as they turned into the hall, knowing there would be no room for her to do so once they reached the narrow passageway, she noticed.</p><p>They had no more turned into the hall than another scream shattered the silence of the night, and the sounds of her sisters yelling through the house could be heard.</p><p>Terror pierced Eve\u2019s mind as they shot into the kitchen and raced for the open back door. She was terrified of what they would find, knowing her mother was not a woman who frightened easily.</p> <p>As they pushed out the door to the back porch, Eve came to a hard, sudden stop.</p><p>Her eyes widened, horror filling her as she felt her stomach pitch at the sight.</p><p>The back part of the wooden porch that surrounded the house was covered in blood, entrails, and body parts of the dozen or more fat rabbits her mother bred and used for the dinner table.</p><p>As with the chickens in the chicken house that provided eggs and meat, the turkeys and occasional duck her mother raised, and the deer she convinced Dawg to take her hunting for each year, Mercedes Mackay was known for her fresh meats, like venison during holidays and special occasions.</p><p>The rabbits represented five years\u2019 work with only a few of the plump animals actually making it to the dinner table.</p><p>Mercedes and Eve had raised the four babies she\u2019d bought, and from there began breeding them. Now they were gone in the most horrific manner that Eve could have imagined.</p><p>She didn\u2019t always agree with her mother\u2019s entirely pragmatic approach to food. Mercedes had learned to appreciate more than store-bought meats as a child. And growing up, Eve and her sisters had often been more than grateful for her mother\u2019s ability to prepare wild game. Though Eve herself found she much preferred buying her meat from the grocer rather than raising it herself.</p><p>Now, staring at the porch, seeing the blood and mutilated carcasses of the animals that had been penned close to the house to ensure that no predators attacked them, Eve well understood why her mother was screaming.</p><p>Mercedes had been screaming for Timothy and her daughters, terrified that if someone had been brazen enough to come onto her porch and do something so horrific, then her family could be in danger as well.</p><p>Timothy and, surprisingly, Dawg had made it to the back porch ahead of Brogan and Eve. Behind her, she could hear her sisters\u2019 gasps, then the silence that filled the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone do this?\u201d Her mother was furious.</p><p>Turning on Timothy as he held her to him, his gaze hard, cold as he stared at the carnage, Mercedes demanded an answer. \u201cTimothy, why would they do this?\u201d</p><p>Timothy could only shake his head before his gaze turned to Dawg, then Brogan.</p><p>Brogan had separated himself from the other two men. Enough distance was left between them that Eve had the feeling that he was ensuring that no one could ever mistake him and the other two men for friends.</p><p>Who would care?</p><p>\u201cAre they pets?\u201d Brogan asked her, his voice low.</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cWe get a lot of hunters as guests. She breeds them for when they stay.\u201d</p><p>The hunters often swore they came more for Mercedes\u2019s preparation of the wild meat than they did for the hunting.</p><p>The look in Brogan\u2019s eyes was so hard, so frigid, Eve actually shivered.</p><p>Casually, Brogan leaned against the side of the house, pulled a pack of the slim cigars he smoked from his shirt pocket, and lit one up.</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know anything about this, right, Brogan?\u201d Dawg snarled as his head swung around.</p><p>Several other guests had moved out to the porch, following Mercedes\u2019s screams.</p><p>It was almost dawn, and most people were asleep, but the guests on Eve\u2019s side of the house had obviously been awake.</p><p>The two single men, Jed Booker and Eli Grant, stood at the other end of the porch, their eyes on the bloody destruction spread out before them.</p><p>\u201cI want everyone to stay as far back as possible,\u201d Timothy ordered as he led Mercedes into the house.</p><p>Eve slid to the other side of the door as he did so, turning to go in.</p><p>Her mother was immediately surrounded by Piper, Lyrica, and Zoey as they led her to the other side of the kitchen and began preparing coffee. Their move allowed her to ensure that she heard whatever the men decided to discuss.</p><p>Eve could feel the tension in the air.</p><p>Unless they were standing exactly where Eve was, no one could have seen the looks that passed between Timothy, Dawg, and Brogan. But Eve saw them.</p><p>Brogan might be giving the impression of distance, but the look they shared assured Eve that they were all three on the same wavelength at the moment.</p><p>\u201cCampbell, you and the other guests should return to your rooms,\u201d Timothy ordered.</p><p>\u201cLooks like a fox ignored the henhouse and went for the rabbits instead,\u201d Jed commented as he scratched at his chest through the jersey jacket he wore.</p><p>Jeans and a jersey jacket wasn\u2019t exactly summer attire, she thought.</p><p>He\u2019d pushed the sleeves to his elbows and put his hands in the pockets as he leaned against the corner of the house and stifled a yawn.</p><p>Eli didn\u2019t say a word, just continued to watch out of hazel eyes that seemed darker in the low light. Finally he gave a slow nod toward the three men before turning and heading back down the hall.</p><p>A moment later, Jed yawned again. \u201cI\u2019m going to get ready for work,\u201d he finally stated. \u201cBy the time I get back to bed it\u2019s going to be time for breakfast.\u201d He paused, his sharp gaze turning on Eve. \u201cWe still having breakfast?\u201d</p><p>She almost grinned. She would have, if her imagination and her fear weren\u2019t in overdrive.</p><p>\u201cKnowing Mom, I\u2019ll say yes.\u201d She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d He turned and disappeared, leaving Eve alone with Timothy, Dawg, and Brogan.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a fox,\u201d Eve stated, keeping her voice low as she stared at each man in turn before pausing as she caught Brogan\u2019s eye. \u201cWas it?\u201d</p><p>Brogan shrugged, but she could see a warning in his eyes, in his expression, as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was, it won\u2019t be back tonight,\u201d Dawg growled. \u201cI\u2019ll get Natches later today and get some security cameras up out here. That way we catch the fox doing this and put it out of its misery.\u201d His voice hardened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not calling Alex?\u201d Eve demanded, speaking of Somerset\u2019s chief of police and one of Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches\u2019s best friends.</p><p>\u201cKilling a rabbit isn\u2019t a crime, Eve.\u201d Dawg sighed. \u201cAnd if it was a fox\u2014and they are prone to indiscriminately kill\u2014then how is Alex going to help?\u201d</p><p>This was no fox kill. Eve had seen a fox go after chickens and kill them, and she had never seen carnage like this. There was that warning in Brogan\u2019s gaze, though, as well as Dawg\u2019s. A warning to watch what she said.</p><p>\u201cGo inside, Eve.\u201d Brogan\u2019s voice was so low, the tone so dark, that she found herself doing just that.</p><p>Casting them all a look filled with irritation, she stepped into the kitchen with her mother and sisters, gritting her teeth as she closed the door carefully behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d Dawg demanded, not bothering to lower his tone or attempt to hide what he was saying as he looked up from where he was crouched on bent knees to study the porch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nosy.\u201d Brogan didn\u2019t bother to lower his voice either. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day I get to see a fox\u2019s kill, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dawg snorted at the comment.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re watching you.\u201d This time Dawg\u2019s voice carried no farther than Brogan\u2019s and Timothy\u2019s ears.</p><p>Lifting the cigar to his lips to hide his reply from anyone watching now, Brogan stated, \u201cYeah, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRetaliation?\u201d Dawg questioned.</p><p>Would Donny and Sandi go to these lengths?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out,\u201d Brogan promised.</p><p>And he would.</p><p>If Donny and Sandi were behind this\u2014and he didn\u2019t doubt in the least that they could be\u2014then it wouldn\u2019t happen again. He\u2019d show the two and anyone else what would happen if Eve was struck at again.</p><p>They were testing him; he could feel it.</p><p>Doogan had warned him when Eve\u2019s name had first come up that there could initially be problems. There were those who would do anything to keep her brother from getting involved in their business. That was one of the things that made Eve so important to the operation at this point. The second and even more important reason was the report that someone had information that could clear this case up, and only Eve could convince them to come out of hiding.</p><p>The minute the rumors had started that Brogan was interested in her, the report had hit Doogan\u2019s desk. A confidential informant had contacted Doogan claiming that the thefts of military files were linked to something far bigger than DHS realized, and there was information that someone had answers besides the thieves. Someone that might be convinced to come forward if he thought Eve Mackay was in danger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A year of investigation and still they hadn\u2019t figured out which of Eve\u2019s friends could possibly know about the thefts, let alone know why the files were being stolen.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Dawg murmured, as he seemed to still be studying the death spread across the porch.</p><p>Timothy was still silent, but the calculating rage that burned in his eyes assured Brogan that his silence didn\u2019t bode well for whoever was behind the bloody mess Mercedes had walked out to.</p> <p>\u201cGo hunting,\u201d Brogan answered just as quietly. \u201cFor fox.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>Brogan and his partners, Jedediah and Eli, entered the house Donny and Sandi shared in the mountains. There was no proof that the two were behind the destruction of the animals Mercedes and Eve had raised, but as they neared the bedroom, Brogan heard all the proof he needed.</p><p>Pausing outside the door, Brogan listened to them gloating about the blood the rabbits had shed and the mess they made. They had often seen Eve petting them and letting them out into the wire enclosure where she played with them.</p><p>That made their crime much worse, because they believed the rabbits were Eve\u2019s pets.</p> <p>\u201cDid you see how horrified she was?\u201d Sandi drawled. \u201cI thought she was going to puke.\u201d The obviously fake sympathy in her tone had his fists clenching in rage.</p><p>\u201cNow, that would have been a real mess,\u201d Donny drawled.</p><p>Brogan could feel fury boiling inside him, white-hot and destructive; Eve would have never struck out at Sandi in such a way, no matter what she had done.</p><p>But Sandi had killed what she believed were pets, because Eve had bested her in a fight.</p><p>Pulling his mask into place, Brogan looked at Jed and Eli where they had taken position across from him. Holding up three fingers to indicate three seconds before bursting into the room, he counted down.</p><p>Three.</p> <p>Two.</p><p>One.</p><p>Eli went in first.</p><p>With a hard kick from Eli\u2019s size-twelve boot, the bedroom door flew off the hinges as he and Jed rushed into the room and grabbed a nearly naked, clearly shocked Sandi from the bed.</p><p>In a second flat Sandi was restrained, her hands secured to the wooden arms of a nearby chair, her eyes wide as she stared up at Eli in mortal fear while Jed took his position on the far wall, the short, lethal barrel of the automatic weapon trained on her.</p><p>Donny just played stupid.</p><p>The little bastard actually thought he was tough enough to take his attackers on, and threw a punch at Brogan\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Brogan bitch-smacked him\u2014an insulting backhanded slap across the face, as Sandi had used on Eve. He\u2019d been enraged when he\u2019d seen Sandi deliver that blow to Eve\u2019s face. He wondered how well Donny enjoyed the same insult.</p> <p>The other man fell against the wall from the slight force. Hell, this wasn\u2019t going to be any fun\u2014</p><p>Brogan smiled in delight as Donny straightened.</p><p>Maybe the little bastard had some fight in him after all. He damn sure had a wicked as hell bowie knife. Brogan had half suspected he\u2019d gotten his nickname from Poppa Bear for just this reason.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Donny screeched, the high-pitched cry sounding a little girlish. \u201cI\u2019m gonna cut you, Brogan; I\u2019m gonna cut you bad.\u201d</p><p>Give me a break.</p><p>Chuckling, Brogan smiled back at the other man with confident mockery before lifting his hand and curling his fingers in an insulting \u201ccome on\u201d wave.</p><p>\u201cFucking cunt,\u201d Donny screamed as he took a swipe at Brogan\u2019s midsection.</p><p>Brogan moved back easily, testing Donny\u2019s abilities once or twice. The blade actually came a little too close for comfort as he got a feel for Donny\u2019s actual experience.</p><p>Brogan had certainly fought much better opponents with a much higher level of experience. But Donny was piss-his-pants scared, and that made a hell of a difference.</p><p>Pressing forward only to step to the side, Brogan caught the other man in midswipe with the knife before striking out himself. With the flat of his hand he slapped Donny again, laughing as the other man\u2019s nose started to bleed.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Sandi screamed out as Donny growled like an enraged bull.</p><p>Dancing back from the blade, Brogan waited, feigning one way, then dancing back, staying on the move as Donny let rage and fear drive him.</p><p>Donny jabbed the knife toward his belly.</p><p>Brogan jabbed his fist into Donny\u2019s face, busting both lips and laughing as Donny spit out pieces of his teeth.</p><p>He swiped at Brogan\u2019s arm, and the blade actually managed to skim the material of the black shirt he wore. The long sleeve covered his arm to the wrist, the protective weave of the material holding out against the glancing brush of the blade.</p><p>Donny snarled, enraged.</p><p>Brogan grinned, waited, then boxed both Donny\u2019s ears as the other man took his next swipe before Brogan spun away.</p><p>This was fun and all, but he was getting bored. Donny was actually shedding tears and snot, he was so pissed at being unable to shed blood.</p><p>Besides, Brogan wanted to get at least a few hours\u2019 sleep tonight. If he kept fucking around with this little weasel, then there was no way he would have time for it.</p><p>Brogan waited.</p><p>When Donny moved to slice out at his midsection again, Brogan caught his fist and twisted it hard as he angled the hand back forcefully and collected the knife from Donny\u2019s suddenly numb fingers.</p><p>Donny emitted a screech that would have done Sandi proud if she had made it herself.</p><p>Before he could struggle or attempt to get away, Brogan thrust his arm behind his back and laid the razor-sharp blade at Donny\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cI like the sight of blood, too,\u201d Brogan rasped, his voice well disguised by the electronic box secured at his throat. \u201cTonight I want your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t. Oh, God, please don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d Sandi cried out, real tears filling her voice and falling from her eyes.</p><p>Hell, she might really love the bastard, Brogan thought as she sobbed out Donny\u2019s name and pleaded for his life.</p><p>\u201cMuzzle that shit,\u201d he ordered Eli as he stroked the knife against Donny\u2019s throat warningly.</p><p>Glancing in the mirror across the room, he saw Donny as he watched Eli\u2019s black-clad form tear a strip of duct tape from the roll he\u2019d pulled out of the mission pack on his back.</p><p>Rage burned in Donny\u2019s eyes as Eli taped his lover\u2019s mouth, then patted her cheek with gentle mockery.</p><p>\u201cShall I have him slice her throat, or do I slice yours?\u201d Brogan asked softly at Donny\u2019s ear, still watching the other man\u2019s face in the mirror.</p><p>Donny swallowed tightly, and Brogan was certain what his answer would be.</p><p>The regret, the seeming apology as he stared back at his lover was all a dead giveaway that Donny would save himself.</p><p>Sandi was shaking her head desperately, sobbing through the tape, no doubt certain she was going to die.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Donny,\u201d he demanded, rubbing the blade against his throat in whispery strokes, \u201cOne of you is going to die. You or her?\u201d</p><p>Tears fell from Donny\u2019s eyes as Sandi became almost hysterical.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Sandi\u2019s chair almost tipped over before Eli could catch it as hysteria overtook her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I heard you, Donny.\u201d He held the knife motionless against the man\u2019s throat. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>Donny was staring at his lover in misery as she screamed through the tape again, still sobbing uncontrollably. He hadn\u2019t even noticed that Brogan was watching him through the mirror.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Donny answered, his voice louder, strangely devoid of fear. \u201cKill me; don\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Sandi bent forward, sobbing, screaming through the tape, jerking hysterically against the ropes that held her as jagged cries tore from her chest.</p><p>Brogan looked at Eli, the other man\u2019s eyes reflecting the same shock Brogan felt. Sandi was protesting so hysterically Eli actually had to hold the chair in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sacrifice yourself for her?\u201d Brogan asked in mocking disbelief. \u201cWhy? She\u2019s not faithful. She whores around on you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her that,\u201d Donny protested raggedly as Brogan watched his expression thoughtfully while watching Sandi from the corner of his eye.</p><p>Hell, they loved each other.</p><p>\u201cTell me why,\u201d Brogan demanded again.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll die anyway if you kill her,\u201d he stated, confusing Brogan with his suddenly calm demeanor. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you risk her life thieving? You pimp her out and keep her in harm\u2019s way here while committing treason?\u201d he probed while he had the chance. \u201cThat\u2019s not love, Donny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a protest or an argument. It was a statement. Then he frowned, confused. \u201cI ain\u2019t no traitor, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you love the woman you let other men screw for money?\u201d Brogan ignored the protest.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Donny snapped, meeting his gaze directly. \u201cAnd she\u2019s no whore. Sandi screws no man but me. I know what she does. She flirts and she teases a little. Then she gives them a few sleeping pills while I steal their money. She doesn\u2019t screw them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou endanger her in whatever moneymaking schemes you can come up with. That\u2019s not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>Brogan whispered the next accusation sneeringly. \u201cYou use her; you don\u2019t want to die for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d Donny\u2019s voice cracked in misery. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch, go figure.</p><p>\u201cDonny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He sniffed, swallowing tightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to live another day with the woman you love?\u201d</p><p>Donny nodded slowly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen listen to me carefully.\u201d Brogan hardened his voice. \u201cIf either of you, at any time\u2014tomorrow, next week, next year, fucking next lifetime,\u201d he snarled, \u201cshould verbally or physically or through someone else strike out at Eve Mackay again, I won\u2019t give you a choice; I\u2019ll just come after your woman.\u201d</p><p>Donny\u2019s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>\u201cIf you so much as breathe Eve\u2019s air, brush against her, or even think to insult her, her family, her friends, hell, her fucking enemies, then I\u2019ll come after your lover. When I do, I\u2019ll make what happened to those rabbits seem humane. You read me, asshole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear.\u201d He snarled as Brogan nicked his neck with the blade.</p><p>\u201cIf Eve Mackay or Brogan Campbell learns anyone was here tonight, learns you were threatened in any way, coerced to act decent, then I\u2019ll come for her,\u201d he whispered insidiously. \u201cAnd if I hear so much as a breath that you have information concerning thieves and traitors and didn\u2019t tell me, then I\u2019m coming after her. Read me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you.\u201d Donny\u2019s voice was barely a whisper now.</p><p>\u201cIf I find out you heard any of the above and you didn\u2019t contact me, I\u2019ll bathe in her blood. You got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Donny swallowed tightly. \u201cContact you how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left your cell phone in the kitchen,\u201d Brogan reminded him. \u201cThere\u2019s a new number in it. Now I\u2019ll ask you one more time: Do you know anything?\u201d</p><p>Donny and Sandi stared at each other for long moments. Nodding to Eli, Brogan watched as he pulled the long, wickedly sharp knife from the sheath at his thigh and laid it against Sandi\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWait. Wait,\u201d Donny whispered.</p><p>Eli lifted the knife marginally from Sandi\u2019s throat\u2014just enough that it wasn\u2019t touching her skin.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Donny,\u201d Brogan urged him. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thieves are part of the touring club,\u201d he revealed. \u201cSome say it\u2019s Brogan Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Brogan asked.</p><p>Fear flickered in Donny\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s someone else, but I don\u2019t know who. Someone who used to be in that group with Chandler and Dayle Mackay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Freedom League?\u201d Brogan asked, his gaze flickering to Eli. This was the first they had heard this.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that Freedom League.\u201d Donny swallowed again, obviously terrified, but more terrified of losing his lover.</p><p>Luck was with him tonight, Brogan thought. He\u2019d never imagined that coming here to beat the shit out of the little bastard over some rabbits would end up with information on the very investigation he\u2019d been working for two and a half years now.</p> <p>\u201cYou know something else, Donny,\u201d Brogan stated smoothly, confidently.</p><p>He could see it in the other man\u2019s eyes every time his gaze met his lover\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJust talk, that\u2019s all,\u201d Donny wheezed. \u201cThere\u2019s talk that the files Brogan Campbell stole are really important. They have coordinates in them for something. Something that the League wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where did you hear this talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was outside at the bar one night, snortin\u2019 a little somethin\u2019\u2014somethin\u2019,\u201d he said nervously.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what you were doing,\u201d Brogan stated softly. \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome dude was takin\u2019 a call.\u201d Donny\u2019s voice lowered as though he were afraid others might hear him. \u201cI don\u2019t know who it was. He was pissed; he said Brogan had to be behind it because they were searching for the same thing. He said he knew it was Brogan Campbell. That only Campbell had a reason to want those files or the information in them.\u201d</p><p>Sandi was still crying, though not as hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Brogan Campbell searching for?\u201d he asked as though he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Desperation filled Donny\u2019s gaze now. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he rasped. \u201cI swear to God, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard, then?\u201d Brogan asked.</p> <p>Donny licked his lips nervously, his gaze seeking Sandi\u2019s again. Sandi gave the barest nod.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Donny; don\u2019t make my friend over there hurt her, okay? Neither you nor Sandi would like it.\u201d</p><p>Donny\u2019s gaze flickered nervously. \u201cWhen Brogan showed up he got real interested in this motorcycle touring club we have. The dude said who they were lookin\u2019 for was there. They just don\u2019t know who he is. But he can read some files they have, and they think Brogan has the other files. He said Brogan was the only one with the background and experience to steal them, too. He said this dude they want can read them. Then, when I was in Fort Knox a few weeks later, there were these dudes at the bar I went to, they was talkin\u2019 \u2019bout Dawg and Eve\u2019s daddy. They said there was talk circulatin\u2019 heavy that there were files their daddy worked on while he was in some federal agency he worked for that hid the location on somethin\u2019, and those files were stolen. Talk was maybe Dawg would know what that somethin\u2019 was, and the only way to find out would be to use his sisters to scare him, but no one can go after a Mackay, \u2019cause if they did, then whoever that dude is that can read those files also has lots of information on that Freedom League and if any Mackay, or anyone that any Mackay loves is threatened, then he\u2019s gonna talk. And he\u2019s gonna tell all these secrets he has on that Freedom League. And they don\u2019t want him talkin\u2019 \u2019cause word is, he knows everything. Who wasn\u2019t caught, who\u2019s still hidin\u2019, and lots of other stuff.\u201d</p><p>Bingo. So that\u2019s why Doogan wants Eve.</p><p>\u201cAnything else, Donny?\u201d he questioned softly. \u201cCome on, anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear that\u2019s all.\u201d He whimpered. \u201cI swear that\u2019s all. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Brogan lifted the knife from Donny\u2019s neck and released him slowly.</p><p>Donny stepped back quickly, his gaze seeking his lover\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cYou hear anything else, Donny, use the number,\u201d Brogan growled. \u201cDon\u2019t make me come back.\u201d</p><p>Donny gave a quick, short nod.</p><p>Hell, Brogan expected both of them to be gone within hours.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, Donny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will know you were here,\u201d he promised, then gave a bitter, mirthless laugh. \u201cTrust me; I don\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d</p><p>Brogan strode quickly from the room, Eli and Jed following close behind as they left the house and disappeared into the trees.</p><p>The four-wheelers they\u2019d used to get into the mountains were still waiting where they\u2019d left them. Brogan mounted the rugged machine as Eli and Jed did the same, and they started the engines and headed for the enclosed trailer several miles down the mountain and the pickup it was attached to.</p><p>The night\u2014or morning, he should say\u2014had yielded far more information than he had ever expected.</p><p>Pulling the four-wheeler into the covered trailer as Eli and Jed pulled in behind him, Brogan knew he finally had a direction to move in. Something other than just a list of files currently under review by the military for destruction. Brogan hadn\u2019t seen a location for anything when he\u2019d gone through the files, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t there. It meant he was going to have to go over them much more closely. According to the information Donny had, the files were evidently encrypted, if whoever he\u2019d overheard talking that night, was right. So it made sense Brogan hadn\u2019t found it. What he needed was someone with the ability to read and crack military code.</p><p>Otherwise, there would be no keeping Eve out of this.</p><p>His director thought they had one asset no one else could touch.</p><p>That asset was Eve.</p><p>Because whoever cared enough for Eve that they would only come out if Eve needed them or would only trust whoever she was with, evidently had the ability to not just decode the encryption, but also had information on a militia that Homeland Security believed had been disbanded more than five years before.</p><p>He\u2019d been trying to find someone Eve was close to in his search for this informant. Maybe the way to go about this was to see whom Eve and her father, Chandler Mackay, now had in common.</p><p>That was where the answers lay.</p><p>To get those answers he would have to make Eve break a promise and betray the brother she loved.</p><p>He would be risking his soul, but he knew the plans the Freedom League had when it had been disbanded. They had been only months away from assassinating the president and ensuring the vice president, who had been a part of the militia, took his place. From there, they would have ensured the government officials they\u2019d been amassing information on, would fall in with their plans. If they succeeded, the world as he knew it would be over forever. The Freedom League\u2019s ultimate plan was the destruction of free enterprise, freedom of speech, and race equality. The nation would have been broken apart from the inside out, and before the American citizens even realized the danger they were in, it would have been too late.</p><p>According to Donny, the League was still in place, and that meant their plans were still in place as well.</p><p>And that, he couldn\u2019t accept.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Eve often helped not just at the bar, but also at Janey Mackay Jansen\u2019s restaurant, Mackay\u2019s Fine Dining. She helped Natches at the garage and in the office, and sometimes at Dawg\u2019s lumber and building supplies store, or, if needed, on the farm he had bought.</p><p>When she wasn\u2019t working for various cousins or their friends, then she worked for her mother.</p><p>Fortunately, John and Sierra had hired two experienced waitresses within a few nights of her confrontation with Sandi Mikels. Unfortunately, that left Eve at loose ends for a few days\u2014until her sisters learned she was currently jobless.</p><p>They saw that as extra time off from the inn to enjoy their summers more. Before she knew it Eve found herself working two straight twelve-hour days until she managed to put the skids on Piper and Lyrica.</p><p>Eight hours she didn\u2019t mind. Twelve hours she had a bit more of a problem with.</p><p>On the third day she found herself on cleaning duty after Zoey disappeared to \u201cpaint\u201d again. Piper and Lyrica had made plans, leaving her mother without the extra help at the same time that dinner preparation began.</p><p>There were eight guest suites, four to each wing at the side of the converted two-story farmhouse. The suites weren\u2019t overly large, though Eve\u2019s was smaller than the others. Each suite consisted of a bedroom, bathroom, and small sitting room with a reasonable-size flat screened television.</p><p>That morning after the guests left, she went through each room that had the service tag hanging on the outside of the door to clean or just refresh the rooms. On the back of each tag the guest had written what services were required. Changing the bed, extra towels, or a variety of other services listed to check off on the back of the card.</p><p>Armed with cleaning supplies, clean sheets, pillowcases, and towels, she made her way from the rooms on the opposite wing from her own and worked her way around to the side she shared with Brogan, Elijah Grant, and Jedediah Booker.</p><p>Her plan was to finish in her room and sneak in a nap. Her evening was free, and she intended to keep it that way. She\u2019d worked two weeks straight without a day off, and she was determined to make certain she had a break.</p><p>When she reached Brogan\u2019s room, nerves began to attack her normally calm demeanor.</p><p>Her hands were shaking as she unlocked the door and slowly stepped inside. The butterflies were beating at her stomach while her pussy decided it was a fine time to go from aching to all-out clenching in need.</p><p>And all it had taken was stepping into his suite.</p><p>She was pathetic.</p><p>Carrying the clean bedclothes to his bedroom, she was happy to see he wasn\u2019t a slob. There wasn\u2019t so much as a stray hair in the bathroom.</p><p>The same for the sitting area of the small suite. All it really required was a quick run across the floors with a vacuum and dusting the furniture before she returned to the bedroom to make the bed.</p><p>She had every intention of making the bed quickly, too.</p><p>Pulling the first pillow from the neatly straightened blanket, Eve stared at it for long seconds before slowly pulling it to her and burying her face against the ultrasoft cotton of the pillowcase covering it.</p><p>His scent was there: a clean, midnight scent that forcibly pulled the memory of his touch to the forefront of her mind.</p><p>Once again she could feel the heavy weight of his body against her own, his lips traveling down her neck, moving steadily closer to her hard, aching nipples.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t slept worth anything since that night. She tossed and turned, aching for him, and too wary of his warning of what would happen if he heard her masturbating again to risk it.</p><p>It was so tempting, though. The need for release was like a hunger she couldn\u2019t assuage. She couldn\u2019t forget it, and even if she could masturbate, she wouldn\u2019t be able to satisfy it.</p><p>Been there, done that, she thought wearily. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to take Brogan as a lover.</p><p>She had to get over it. This hunger for him was going to make her crazy.</p><p>Getting over it would be easier said than done, though.</p><p>For the first time in nearly eight months she had finally accepted one of the numerous invitations to dinner that she received. While picking up her check from the bar the night before, one of John and Sierra\u2019s friends had come into town from Boston and stopped by.</p><p>Before the evening was over he had invited her to have dinner with him that night, and with a sense of desperation she had accepted.</p><p>Chatham Bromleah Doogan III, tall, dark haired, and dark eyed. He had a steady, confident aura about him, and John and Sierra both really liked him.</p><p>She was thankful that Brogan had left with the motorcycle touring group he was a part of that afternoon and wasn\u2019t due back until sometime in the hours before dawn.</p><p>The group went most weekends sightseeing on the bikes. A group of over a dozen couples, riding their motorcycles along the scenic mountain highways and byways of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio.</p><p>Plenty of time, she thought to herself, to have dinner with Chatham, or Doogan as he\u2019d told her to call him, and to figure out whether she truly was ruined for another man.</p><p>Not that she intended to do more than have dinner, because she didn\u2019t. But there was always the chance her body would see the error of aching for Brogan and decide to ache for someone else instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a long shot, she admitted, but worth trying.</p><p>Tossing Brogan\u2019s pillow to the bed, she quickly stripped the blankets while laying the pillowcases carefully aside before making the bed. Gathering the bedclothes together, she moved first to her own room and tossed the pillowcases to her bed, then took the bedclothes to the laundry room at the end of the hall.</p><p>Throwing the blankets in the wash, she moved back to her own room, locked the doors, then placed the pillowcases on her own pillows before returning to the shower.</p> <p>Since walking from the shower to find Brogan in her room, it seemed she now expected him to be there each time she stepped into her bedroom.</p><p>Disappointment assailed her when she realized he wasn\u2019t. Even though she had known even before she entered the room that he wasn\u2019t there, still, the regret ached inside her.</p><p>The motorcycle touring club Brogan had been leading for the past year had been used to taking weekly trips several times a summer. They toured the States on their motorcycles, often riding to scenic, out-of-the-way areas, where civilization still hadn\u2019t marred nature\u2019s beauty. This last summer, they\u2019d stuck closer to Pulaski County, though. Their trips usually lasted no more than twelve to sixteen hours between leaving then returning.</p><p>Oh, civilization was creeping closer by the day, she admitted, even in Pulaski County.</p><p>Removing the towel she\u2019d wrapped around her and climbing onto her bed for a nap, she was surprised she fell asleep as quickly as she did.</p> <p>A deep, luckily dreamless sleep.</p><p>No dreams of Brogan and sex, or the dream that often visited her of watching him, aching for him, only to see him leave with one of the local women she\u2019d known him to see in the past.</p><p>Today, though, there was only peaceful sleep.</p><p>Something she hadn\u2019t had in far longer than she could remember.</p><p>Brogan pulled into the rest stop, parking the Harley in front of the concession building as Eli and Jed pulled in to one side of him.</p><p>The two other agents, despite renting suites at the bed-and-breakfast, were only rarely seen in his presence. The only time they spoke or even came in contact with one another was during the rides the touring club made.</p> <p>Luckily, there were fewer rides this summer than there had been in summers past. After the former \u201cpresident\u201d was arrested for drug possession, it was learned that the club\u2019s riding account was at nearly zero. They would be making a lot shorter trips until the monthly membership fees added enough for them to resume their normal summer schedule.</p><p>Dismounting the bike and hanging his helmet on the handlebars, Brogan watched as the rest of the group pulled in. Behind Eli and Jed, Poppa Bear and his wife pulled in, sharing a cycle the size of a small car. Their daughter rode her own Harley next to them and managed to make many of the trips her parents went on.</p><p>Behind them, surprisingly, rode and Donny and Sandi. They had been unusually quiet since their ordeal. Donny hadn\u2019t gotten into any fights, and Sandi hadn\u2019t instigated any. They were up each other\u2019s asses like Siamese twins, impossible to separate. The one time Brogan had heard one of the club members comment on the change, Donny had replied only that he was getting too damned old to be fighting and carousing all damned night long.</p><p>The number Brogan had programmed into his phone hadn\u2019t yet been called either. He\u2019d hoped the happy couple would be eager to get some useful information, just in case. Not that he\u2019d really kill either of them in cold blood, but he was fine with the fact that they believed he would.</p><p>\u201cBrogan, I have to admit, you know some damned fine scenery,\u201d Poppa Bear boomed as he helped his slender wife from the back of their cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally see something besides the interstates we were seeing when your predecessor was running things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying it, Poppa Bear.\u201d He inclined his head in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you gonna invite that little Mackay girl to join us?\u201d the Santa-looking Poppa Bear questioned him with a suggestive wink. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like having your gal sittin\u2019 behind ya.\u201d</p><p>Hooking his thumbs into his belt, Brogan grinned back at him. \u201cHell, her brother might shoot me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw, ol\u2019 Dawg loves his baby sisters. He might snap and snarl, but he\u2019d not kill you over her.\u201d</p><p>Brogan wasn\u2019t so certain of that.</p><p>\u201cBetter claim that pretty little thang afore it\u2019s too late,\u201d Poppa Bear claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of nice-lookin\u2019 boys that\u2019ll snap her right up \u2019fore you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like the one who asked her out last night.\u201d</p><p>Brogan\u2019s head jerked around to Donny\u2019s unusually quiet tone of voice as Poppa Bear and his family headed to the restrooms.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d Brogan asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to force the vein of surprise in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThere was a guy at the bar who asked her out to dinner last night.\u201d Donny shifted on his feet, moving with a nervous rhythm that made Brogan want to order him to stand still.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cWell, she accepted.\u201d Donny scratched nervously at his cheek. \u201cThey\u2019re having dinner at Mackay\u2019s tonight at seven.\u201d</p><p>The hell they were.</p><p>Brogan could feel the blood suddenly boiling in his veins.</p><p>Glaring at Donny, he wondered whether the little bastard would have the nerve to lie to him.</p><p>\u201cMan, I wouldn\u2019t lie to you about it.\u201d Donny lifted his hands helplessly as Brogan silently cursed the other man\u2019s ability to read him, if only for a second.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell would you know?\u201d Brogan snapped. \u201cI thought you and Sandi were barred from Walker\u2019s Run.\u201d</p><p>Donny shook his head and shrugged his shoulders uncomfortably as he cleared his throat. \u201cJust Sandi. But I doubt I\u2019ll be around much without her.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he felt real sorry for them. When hell froze over.</p><p>\u201cSorry, man.\u201d Brogan grimaced. \u201cI guess it was more than I expected. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d He gave the other man a short, tight nod before turning back to the Harley and jerking his helmet from the handlebars.</p><p>\u201cBrogan?\u201d Donny spoke again, his voice lower.</p><p>Turning to him with a frown, Brogan waited impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m like Poppa Bear; I don\u2019t think Dawg would kill ya because you\u2019re sleepin\u2019 with his sister. Break her heart, though, and Natches might.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, he was getting damned tired of that refrain.</p><p>Securing the helmet beneath his chin, Brogan mounted the Harley, kicked the stand back, and turned the key. The engine purred instantly.</p><p>Ignoring the confused summons from the riders returning from the concession building and bathrooms, Brogan sped from the rest stop. Pulling onto the two-lane road, he pointed the motorcycle toward Somerset and the woman who just might have it in her head to see whether Brogan could be pushed from her life.</p><p>Brogan had no intentions of being pushed out.</p><p>He\u2019d made a mistake in waiting. He should have never given some bastard the opportunity to slip in.</p><p>It was a mistake he would rectify.</p><p>NINE</p><p>He absolutely couldn\u2019t believe Doogan would do something so damned underhanded.</p><p>Chatham Bromleah Doogan, director of special operations of the Federal Protective Service, had actually dragged his ass out of his D.C. office to come poke his nose into Brogan\u2019s operation.</p><p>It was unbelievable.</p><p>As he drove the three hours back to Somerset, Brogan tried to figure out exactly what was in the director\u2019s mind.</p><p>There was no figuring it out.</p><p>Doogan was known for his oddities, but Brogan had never known him to physically interfere in an investigation. Especially as he was now.</p><p>He was a known player when it came to women. The man had no heart and no belief in a woman\u2019s tender emotions.</p><p>The son of a bitch would take Eve\u2019s innocence as though he had a right to it. Then he would ride off into the sunset and never give her another thought. And there was no doubt of Eve\u2019s innocence. Brogan knew from the investigation report Doogan had shown him that Eve had no lovers in Somerset since she had arrived. Brogan\u2019s investigation into her life in Texas revealed there had been none there.</p><p>Mercedes had kept a tight rein on her daughters and raised them to understand their responsibilities to themselves and one another. Survival had been uppermost, juvenile sex had been highly frowned upon. Mercedes, he had heard, had tried to instruct her daughters often on the dangers of sex and the chances of conceiving a child they were far too young to care for. Seeing their mother\u2019s example, living the hardships and the weariness their mother had suffered had obviously convinced the girls that she was right.</p><p>As he pushed the speed limit as far as he dared, Brogan found himself gritting his teeth.</p><p>Dammit, at this rate he\u2019d wear his back teeth to nubs.</p><p>Knowing what Doogan would do to her tender heart brought another realization, though. Brogan had never taken Eve out. He\u2019d almost taken her virginity in her own bed, but he hadn\u2019t taken her out or shown the world she was worth far more than the pleasure he would find in her body.</p><p>Doogan thought he could wine and dine her, but the ruse had nothing to do with showing the world a damned thing. Getting lucky after he took her home was all he would care about.</p><p>That, and ensuring that he pulled Eve Mackay in on an operation she had no business being a part of.</p><p>Brogan made one stop.</p><p>Driving into the back parking lot of the inn, he pulled a spare set of keys from the magnet beneath the four-by-four truck parked there, unlocked it, and a second later slid it into drive.</p><p>It was well after seven that evening before he pulled into valet parking at Mackay\u2019s Fine Dining, and gave the young man, Mark Carlson, a hard look and a fifty-dollar bill as he growled, \u201cThe truck stays here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be long?\u201d Mark eyed the fifty-dollar bill dubiously, making Brogan wonder when a fifty stopped impressing kids.</p><p>He slapped another in the young man\u2019s hand. \u201cMark, that truck moves and I\u2019m going to kick your ass and take both these fifties back,\u201d he promised softly. \u201cYou got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlls I can say is, as long as Declan, Rogue, Janey, or Alex don\u2019t yell at me.\u201d</p><p>Brogan wasn\u2019t worried about Declan for sure.</p><p>Declan Mackay, formerly Faisal Mackay, the Afghani whom Natches Mackay had adopted more than five years before, was the floor manager of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cJust tell them whose truck it is; they\u2019ll be fine with it,\u201d Brogan promised as he turned and entered the restaurant.</p><p>He strode past the well-dressed customers waiting for a table, knowing damned good and well that he was far from the dress code in his biker boots and khaki shirt tucked into his jeans.</p><p>He\u2019d been riding for more than six hours. The bandanna skullcap was still tied around his head, and Brogan didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>Striding past the sputtering hostess, he looked around quickly, caught sight of Eve, and strode toward her.</p><p>Damn, she sure looked pretty, too, he thought.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t dressed in her customary jeans and snug cami. Tonight she wore a sundress with thin straps at her shoulders. The bodice cupped and loved her breasts. It skimmed to her hips and fell to her knees in shimmering chiffon.</p><p>The soft blue color brought out the green of her eyes and made her look like a tempting little sorceress.</p><p>A sorceress he was set and ready to claim.</p><p>Eve could feel her heart racing, pounding in her chest as she watched Brogan stalk across the room.</p><p>It was obvious he\u2019d just returned from the ride. She had understood, based on listening to other members of the touring club, that the riders wouldn\u2019t be arriving back until late into the night.</p><p>He looked hot, though: rough, tough, dangerous, and so damned sexy she almost caught her breath in excitement.</p><p>Jeans, a road dust\u2013stained khaki shirt, rider\u2019s boots, and a dark blue bandanna skullcap wasn\u2019t exactly adhering to the restaurant\u2019s dress code, though. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was aware of the other diners watching curiously. She could almost feel them waiting to see what Brogan Campbell would do with his woman, who was obviously enjoying an evening with another man. Eve just wished there had actually been enjoyment.</p><p>Chatham Bromleah Doogan was a player, and he didn\u2019t try to hide it. He was nice about it. He was damned charming about it. But Chatham was unapologetically a playboy.</p><p>Brogan was unapologetically all man. Wild, tough, dangerous. He was willing to be tame, but only under his own conditions, and only at those times that he chose to be.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t willing to be tamed at this moment, though.</p><p>His gaze locked on hers, the blue-gray depths a sliver of color behind the lashes of his narrowed gaze, he came to a stop at the table, glowering down at her.</p><p>Chatham never lifted his gaze from the dessert menu.</p><p>\u201cAh, the ma\u00eetre d\u2019,\u201d Chatham murmured dismissively. \u201cIsn\u2019t it about time?\u201d</p><p>Eve almost groaned in rising trepidation.</p> <p>This could get ugly fast.</p><p>Brogan lifted a red-gold brow mockingly as he stared down at her. The arch conveyed such deliberate intent that she could feel her knees almost trembling.</p><p>How the hell was she supposed to handle this?</p><p>Chatham lifted his head then, gazing up at Brogan arrogantly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the ma\u00eetre d\u2019,\u201d she commented as Brogan completely ignored him.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chatham drawled in amusement. \u201cMy dear, I would have never guessed. Friend of yours?\u201d</p> <p>It could end gracefully, she thought.</p><p>Without bloodshed.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Eve cleared her throat. \u201cSometimes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Chatham chuckled. \u201cA friend is not a friend, my dear, unless he is a friend at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d She couldn\u2019t break the hold Brogan had on her gaze. She wanted to. She tried to. Yet she couldn\u2019t turn away.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the ride?\u201d she asked, fighting the tremble in her voice as something flickered in Brogan\u2019s gaze.</p><p>\u201cI canceled it,\u201d he growled as he slowly lifted his hands from where he\u2019d had his thumbs hooked in the front pockets of his jeans.</p> <p>Almost immediately his hands flattened against the top of the table, his upper body bending to her. He was almost nose-to-nose with her so fast she could only stare up at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming peacefully, or will I have to discuss the situation with your date?\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s gaze flickered in Chatham\u2019s direction. He sat back in his chair, completely at ease as he, too, seemed to await her decision. His dark brown eyes mocked her dilemma, and for a second Eve swore he appeared as self-satisfied as the proverbial cat with the canary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting much longer,\u201d Brogan warned her softly.</p><p>\u201cI believe we should leave this decision up to Ms. Mackay, without undue coercion,\u201d Chatham advised, causing Eve to flick a horrified glance in his direction.</p><p>Didn\u2019t he know a dangerous situation when he saw one? Brogan was in no way willing to endure advice at the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, Chatham.\u201d Lifting the napkin from her lap, Eve laid it on the table as she apologized.</p><p>Rising, she quickly opened her small clutch purse and pulled several bills free before laying them on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat is entirely unnecessary.\u201d Chatham looked almost horrified as he glanced at the bills before his gaze lifted to her again. \u201cMy dear, your company was well worth the meal.\u201d</p><p>Brogan jerked her money from the table.</p><p>\u201cBrogan?\u201d she hissed, outraged by the action.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like he can afford the damned meal.\u201d Brogan snorted.</p><p>Chatham rose to his feet, the amusement in his gaze intensifying.</p><p>Turning to Brogan, she said querulously, \u201cI hope you brought something besides that Harley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came prepared.\u201d</p><p>There was something about the way he said it and the words he used that sent a rush of heat flooding her body.</p><p>Before Brogan turned away, though, he reached into his pocket, pulled two hundreds free, and tossed them to the table.</p><p>\u201cI can pay for the meal.\u201d Chatham chuckled.</p><p>\u201cTake the money and count yourself lucky,\u201d Brogan suggested, his tone dark and forbidding. \u201cMy ancestors castrated poachers. With great satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Chatham lifted a brow as the diners around them snickered in amusement.</p><p>Gripping her upper arm, Brogan led her unhurriedly through the restaurant and out the front door as outrage rushed through her.</p><p>\u201cThat was completely uncalled-for, Brogan.\u201d She turned to face him as he stepped into the driver\u2019s seat after helping her into the truck. Glaring up at the brooding anger burning in his gaze, she ignored the butterfly excitement in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou had absolutely no right whatsoever to barge in on my date in such a way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date, was it?\u201d Silky, dangerous, his voice lowered and his expression tightened savagely as he started the truck. \u201cI\u2019d change the description of that little outing if I were you, Eve. Because you knew better than to date until this relationship thing of ours has been settled, one way or the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d she snapped back at him, so offended by his attitude she could barely tolerate it. \u201cWe have no relationship, remember? I told you, I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>It was killing her\u2014the need for his touch, for his kiss. It raged inside her, hotter even than the anger now coursing inside her. \u201cBecause of you my brother is probably getting calls from everyone in that restaurant about now. He\u2019s going to end up at my door again\u2014God forbid, while you\u2019re in my bed. And before the night is over I\u2019m going to feel like the worst sister to live, because I find it completely impossible to tell you no.\u201d</p><p>She was only barely aware of the tightening of Brogan\u2019s knuckles on the steering wheel, as though he were fighting desperately to keep his hands off her.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me no all the damned time,\u201d he argued, his tone rasping with irritation. \u201cYour damned brother can just be proud as hell of you, can\u2019t he, Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if he shows up and you\u2019re in my bed.\u201d Turning to face forward again, her arms crossing over her breasts, she glared into the evening traffic.</p><p>Until the chain swinging on the rearview mirror drew her gaze. She recognized the small gold cross Timothy Cranston had told her belonged to his daughter. She had been wearing it the day a bomb had killed her and her mother.</p><p>\u201cTimothy let you use his truck?\u201d she questioned in disbelief. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stole it,\u201d he informed her with such a look of triumph she was momentarily taken aback. \u201cI knew where he kept the spare key and I just took it.\u201d</p><p>Pure disbelief filled her as she shook her head and returned her gaze forward. She had to grit her teeth to keep herself from completely losing her temper. That lasted all of the time it took him to pass the turnoff that led to the inn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? You just missed the turn to the house,\u201d she reminded him as he continued through town.</p><p>\u201cI borrowed a place for the night.\u201d He shocked her with the statement. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to have Dawg Mackay disturb me again while we\u2019re together, Eve. I may end up forgetting he\u2019s your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only friend you have in this county who would have something to loan is Billy Ray, and all he has is that ragged houseboat of his. You think Dawg won\u2019t know the minute we pull into the marina and go onto that alley cat\u2019s boat? Are you trying to rub his nose in the fact that I can\u2019t stay away from you?\u201d</p><p>Where had his mind gone? There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell that she was getting on a houseboat with him. Especially Billy Ray Chauncey\u2019s. The man was a dog when it came to women.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, give me a little credit here, Eve.\u201d The look he shot her was rife with simmering lust and banked frustration. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019m going to give Dawg Mackay the opportunity to try to beat the shit out of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry?\u201d She looked back at him doubtfully, determined to make him as crazy as he made her.</p><p>She was pushing him, and she knew she was, but this was the first time she had seen so much emotion in him. He wasn\u2019t as controlled as he normally was, and the knowledge of that had adrenaline crashing through her system.</p><p>She could get used to this. The excitement was addictive.</p><p>Brogan snorted. \u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself, sweet pea. The Mackay cousins are hitting their forties. They\u2019re not exactly as spry as they used to be.\u201d</p><p>Eve almost laughed. For a second\u2014well, maybe a millisecond\u2014she had the insane urge to share with him the fact that the cousins\u2019 wives often made that claim themselves. But it was only after the cousins proved otherwise.</p><p>\u201cMaybe your confidence is just enough to ensure that he does kick your ass,\u201d she suggested. \u201cBe careful there, Brogan; you could be a little overconfident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201d Surprising her with the agreement as he cast her a hard, mocking look, he continued. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d just as soon not find out, though, so I\u2019ve made certain he\u2019ll be completely unaware of our location.\u201d</p><p>She doubted that. Dawg seemed to know exactly where each of his sisters was and what they were doing at any given time of the day. Or night.</p><p>\u201cSo what have you borrowed and who did you borrow it off of?\u201d she asked, rubbing at the sensation almost of static electricity that raced over her arms at the thought of being alone with Brogan right now. Sensual intensity and male confidence seemed to bleed from every pore of his body. Sexual intent and erotic heat filled the cab of the truck, raising her heart rate and sending excitement crashing through her bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter who I borrowed it from?\u201d he answered her as he turned up a narrow, unlined paved road.</p><p>It was one of the few she and her sisters hadn\u2019t explored\u2014for a reason.</p><p>\u201cThe property up this road is gated,\u201d she told him. \u201cThere used to be a guard at the gate, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when it\u2019s being used by certain people,\u201d he informed her cryptically.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of people?\u201d Eve probed as the truck pulled up to the locked gate and the guard post.</p><p>The guard post was empty. Surprisingly, Brogan pulled his wallet from his jeans back pocket, extracted what appeared to be a key card from one of the credit card slots, and slid it through the security scanner.</p><p>The gate swung open slowly in the bright lights of the truck as a green light flashed next to the gate\u2019s support post.</p><p>Driving through, he stopped at the mounted control box on the other side, opened the weatherproof door as he stuck his arm through the open window of the truck, and pushed in a code. The gate swung closed behind them.</p><p>The entirety of the property was fenced in, though it was fenced at different heights as it moved up the mountain, to allow larger wildlife to clear it. As the cabin came into view, Eve glimpsed the eight-foot fence about two hundred feet from the house and another gate. Like the control box that closed the first gate, this one took only a code that Brogan pushed into it.</p><p>There were rumors . . .</p><p>Eve stared through the windshield as she propped her elbow on the door and rubbed at her temple. \u201cWho does this cabin belong to, Brogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight it belongs to me. I told you: I have a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Timothy give you the key and access code into it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI know there\u2019s a rumor this cabin belongs to the government, and Timothy\u2019s the only former agent I know who you talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, though, Timothy and I aren\u2019t exactly friends,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Timothy has friends no one knows anything about, and often treats the friends he does associate with like suspects or enemies rather than friends. So who the hell knows?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brogan chuckled, a low, sensual sound that sent heat skipping up her spine.</p><p>Stepping from the truck, Eve stared around the small clearing before turning to the cabin and staring up at it.</p><p>She\u2019d thought the fence surrounded all four sides of the large cabin until she stepped from the truck. To the side, instead, the waters of the lake lapped at the sandy ground, while a dock extended out into the water.</p> <p>Lights had flipped on from the front porch as the truck pulled up to it, revealing the elegant wilderness retreat.</p><p>She\u2019d heard the cabin hidden in the wide canyon above the lake was a luxurious retreat often used by government officials, senators, governors, and megarich hunters with the right political ties.</p><p>From the back of the truck Brogan pulled two overnight bags free. Eve\u2019s brows lifted in disbelief as she recognized her own bag.</p><p>\u201cYou packed my clothes?\u201d Propping her hands on her hips, she stared back at him incredulously. \u201cBefore or after you stole the truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I had help.\u201d He growled.</p> <p>\u201cYou had no right to go through my things, Brogan,\u201d she informed him, furious that he\u2019d taken such liberties. It was one thing to practically kidnap her, but packing her clothes? Going through her drawers? That was uncalled-for.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d he stated, as though that made it just fine.</p><p>\u201cSo? That doesn\u2019t give you the right to paw through my clothes.\u201d Or anything else she kept in her drawers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie; your little toys didn\u2019t offend me in the least,\u201d he promised good-naturedly as he stepped up on the porch, set the bags on the wide bench beside the door, and pulled the key card from his shirt pocket before swiping it through the reader.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d she bit out furiously as she followed him into the cabin. \u201cBrogan, what gives you the right to do any of this? First you barge in on my date\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned on her so fast she stepped back, startled that he was facing her so quickly, no more than inches from her where less than a second before he had been a good three feet away.</p> <p>\u201cEve, sweetheart, don\u2019t make me tell you again not to call that farce of a dinner you were having with that jackass a date,\u201d he ordered fiercely rather than furiously. \u201cMy patience is wearing thin with the people who seem to be standing between us. I can deal with your brother, your sisters, your cousins. Hell, I can even deal with your mother if she decides to protest. But if you dare to put a date between us, then I might not hold on to my patience much longer.\u201d</p><p>Her arms lifted, her hands propping on her hips as she lifted her chin defiantly. \u201cAre you threatening me, Brogan Campbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Eve, I\u2019m not threatening you.\u201d He was closer, his head lowering, his gaze holding hers as the blue-gray appeared more a steel gray now than the light blue it sometimes seemed. \u201cI\u2019m telling you: My dick is harder than titanium, my control is all but shot, and I\u2019m so damned hungry for you I\u2019m about to lose my fucking mind. So please, for both our sakes, don\u2019t refer to that man as your date again.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned.</p><p>She could feel her nostrils flaring as she drew in air, fighting to control the racing, adrenaline-laced blood surging and thundering through her. That small movement was her first warning that her own control was thin. That her ability to access her common sense was endangered.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to take our clothes to the bedroom,\u201d he stated as he stepped back from her. \u201cIf you want something to drink, there\u2019s a bar in the living area and one in the kitchen. The fridge should have drinks, as well as the walk-in pantry. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>She nodded silently, her gaze still narrowed on him, her fingers so tight on the purse she expected her nails to pierce the soft leather.</p><p>Her cell phone was in her purse; she should call her mother\u2014no, she should call Dawg. She should show Brogan he didn\u2019t have the option of ordering her around.</p> <p>There was a part of her\u2014the independent fighter who used to worry her mother to distraction\u2014that assured her she didn\u2019t need Dawg\u2019s help. If he showed up he\u2019d drag her from the house and probably camp on her doorstep to ensure Brogan didn\u2019t come around her again.</p><p>She could handle this.</p><p>Besides, if Dawg dragged her off, then there was no way she would end up in Brogan\u2019s bed. And Brogan\u2019s bed was exactly where she wanted to be.</p><p>Well, that was where she wanted to be once she and Brogan set a few ground rules, that was.</p><p>Nothing strenuous for him, just a few concerning free will, her own choices, and dates.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Brogan stared around the bedroom, making a mental note to himself to thank Timothy for everything he\u2019d managed to arrange in a few short hours.</p><p>If the DHS agent survived his little chat with Dawg, that was.</p><p>The bedroom was exactly as he had requested.</p><p>The huge custom-made, larger than a king-and-a-half bed was surrounded by ivory netting that hung from the ceiling and draped around the thick, ultracomfortable mattress situated on the platform beneath it.</p><p>Candles by the dozen, from thick pillars to slender tapers and everything in between, were positioned around the large room. The property\u2019s caretaker had slipped in and lit them just before Brogan and Eve arrived.</p><p>The hot tub just outside the glass patio doors steamed invitingly, while candles were positioned around the deck that surrounded it, flickering with warmth.</p><p>Opening Eve\u2019s overnight bag he\u2019d had Piper pack for him, he grinned as he pulled free the white lace-and-chiffon gown he knew would fall to Eve\u2019s pretty toes, and the matching robe. She did love her chiffon.</p><p>Beneath that were jeans, camis, socks, and sneakers. He\u2019d told Piper to pack for her sister enough clothes to last the weekend. Piper had been more than happy to do so. It was high time Brogan decided to finally do something about all the sexual tension burning between him and Eve, Piper had laughed.</p><p>He stared around the room again.</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d never taken a virgin before, but he knew his sister had once claimed her girlfriend would forgive her anything if she treated her like a virgin and put some effort into seducing her. Brogan had snorted in amusement at the claim, while Samantha had stared back at him with a confident smile.</p><p>Picking up his own overnight bag, he moved to the shower in the next room. The damned thing was the size of two of his bathroom at the inn, let alone the shower. It was much too large for one person.</p><p>If Eve was there with him, though . . . The bench on the other side of the shower was easily six feet long and nearly as wide. Hell, the things he could do to her luscious little body on that bench as the rain showerhead poured down on them.</p><p>Showering quickly, all he could think about was the fact that she was still a virgin. Twenty-four years old, beautiful, social, yet she had saved herself for some reason\u2014until now.</p><p>Drying quickly, he dressed in clean jeans and a white shirt.</p><p>Buttoning the shirt, then tucking it into his jeans before securing a belt around his hips, Brogan moved back into the living room, his gaze searching the room before he found her curled up on the wide hanging chair on the screened-in patio outside.</p><p>Padding barefoot to the open patio doors, Brogan stepped out on the stone flooring and leaned against the teak bar just outside the doors.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a teenager curled up in that chair like that,\u201d he told her with a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, really.\u201d The sassiness and defiance in her voice had his balls throbbing, his dick threatening to swell impossibly wider. \u201cWell, that just makes you a dirty old man then. Feeling the guilt yet?\u201d</p><p>He wanted to laugh. Damn her, she could have the sharpest tongue.</p><p>\u201cI picked out my bedroom while you were freshening up,\u201d she told him with a little arch of her brow. \u201cIt\u2019s not nearly as nice as yours, of course, but it\u2019s still pretty swanky.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d obviously explored the house some while he had been showering.</p><p>Lifting a glass to her lips, she sipped at the white wine she\u2019d obviously found in the large walk-in refrigerator. The house had an actual walk-in refrigerator, which had amazed Brogan the first time he had been there.</p><p>Propping one arm on the bar, he just watched her, biding his time. She was sitting over there trying to convince herself she could control what was going to happen this weekend and how it was going to happen. And he would give anything to allow her the opportunity to see whether she could use all those very perceptive instincts and feminine wiles to control him. Unfortunately, in the middle of an operation with the potential to turn nasty fast was no place to allow himself to be that distracted.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to tell me who owns this place yet?\u201d she asked when he said nothing more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything before we leave Sunday,\u201d he promised her. \u201cHold your questions until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very ominous,\u201d she murmured as she brought the wineglass to her lips once again. \u201cLet me guess: You\u2019re waiting until Sunday because you know once you explain everything, I\u2019m going to be either so pissed, so brokenhearted, or both that you won\u2019t have a chance in hell of getting me into your bed.\u201d</p><p>She was good; he had to give her that.</p><p>He merely grinned back at her, and kept his opinion to himself. His opinion and his confessions. It was the confessions that were going to get him in trouble. Or might piss her off for a while.</p><p>Of course, sometimes she was so much like her brother she might actually shoot him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed; I\u2019m tired.\u201d Sliding from the chair, still wearing those strappy four-inch peep-toe heels and carrying her glass of wine, she strolled toward him with such sensual grace and sleepy-eyed arousal, he had to clench his teeth, grinding off yet more enamel, to keep from throwing her to the couch and taking her with all the finesse of a callow, inexperienced teen.</p><p>He waited until she was ready to pass him. Until he was confident she actually thought she was going to get past him.</p><p>Then he stepped in front of her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen all the rooms yet,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cHow can you be certain you\u2019ve chosen the right one if you\u2019ve missed any?\u201d</p><p>Her heart was pounding. He could see the proof of it at her throat, where her vein pulsed at a rapid pace beneath her flesh. It was there in the hard, quick rise and fall of her breasts and the fine trembling of her body.</p><p>\u201cThe room I chose is fine, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>God help him, her nipples were as tight and hard beneath the material of her dress as little pebbles.</p><p>He lifted his hand and stroked the backs of his fingers down her cheek as her breath caught before she exhaled with a rough little sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told her as her lips parted to facilitate her breathing.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to happen right now,\u201d she informed him. He let her lift the wineglass and take a healthy sip before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t heel worth shit,\u201d he told her then. \u201cYou won\u2019t control me, Eve, you won\u2019t tame me, and you won\u2019t dominate me. Now, that\u2019s a warning I\u2019ve never given another woman, and I won\u2019t waste my time telling you again. So if that\u2019s what you think you\u2019re going to do, then I highly suggest you reconsider your options.\u201d</p><p>Eve stared back at him silently, careful to keep her mouth firmly shut until she was certain she had a handle on the anger ready to burst past her lips.</p><p>When she felt she could speak civilly she smiled back at him with cool disdain.</p><p>\u201cBrogan. Number one.\u201d She held her forefinger up to him imperiously. \u201cI am not now, nor have I ever been, some bitch who needs to be warned how arrogant, controlling, dominant, and manipulative men such as you can be until you realize just how it can potentially damage a relationship you decide you don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI listened to the bullshit spilling from your lips, Brogan; you can take a few precious minutes of your time to listen to common sense now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That finger pointed up toward his face imperiously.</p><p>\u201cNumber two,\u201d she continued. \u201cNot only am I not a bitch to jump at your command, neither am I some whore you bought for fifty bucks, or the mistress you support. Just because you all but kidnapped me does not mean I owe you so much as my company, let alone my virginity.\u201d</p><p>She watched as his eyes narrowed on her, the blue-gray definitely turning steel gray at the mention of her virginity.</p><p>\u201cAnd number three,\u201d she snapped, unable to hold back the anger caused by so much adrenaline with no place to go. \u201cIf you can\u2019t respect me, Brogan, and see me as your equal, then I\u2019ll be damned if you\u2019re even in the running for my virginity.\u201d</p><p>She was finished now.</p><p>Stepping back, she propped her hands on her hips and glared at him. He smiled. And that smile sent trepidation surging through her.</p><p>\u201cMy equal?\u201d he asked. \u201cSweet pea, when you can work a ten-hour day in the freezing rain, take down four drug-crazed dealers intent on having your head, keep up with my daily workout, and show me you\u2019ve grown a ten-inch dick at some point, then I will most gladly drop all my dominant, manipulating schemes to rid you of your virginity and will then consider you my equal.\u201d His hand shot out, grabbed her wrist, and, before she could jerk it back, he used it to drag her to him, his other arm locking around her back to hold her to him. Eve found herself up and close and personal.</p><p>\u201cTen . . .\u201d she squeaked as his hips pressed against her firmly while he held her close enough that there was no escaping the fact that he might not be lying.</p><p>\u201cOutside our bed, outside what is sure to be some damned fucking mind-blowing sex, you can attempt to tame me until hell freezes over, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d His head lowered, and the erotic demand and white-hot lust that tightened his features completely stole her breath as he continued. \u201cBut you will not control nor tame the dominance and sexual tastes that are as much a part of me as the color of my eyes or the sound of my voice. And I\u2019m still damned sure going to accept your virginity.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember offering it, and he didn\u2019t give her a chance to offer or refuse.</p><p>Brogan lifted her closer as his lips slanted over hers, heated and hungry, the rough velvet feel of them staking a claim on her senses that she\u2019d always known was coming.</p><p>The kisses they had shared before now were nothing compared to this one.</p><p>Eve whimpered in rising pleasure as her hands slid from where they were pressed against his chest to grip his shoulders. Sensation swirled inside her, around her, threatening to destroy any hope she ever had of escaping the hold she could feel he was taking of her soul.</p><p>As he lifted her closer, bringing her feet off the floor and urging her knees to his hips, Eve moaned at the implications of the position. She gripped his hips anyway, because she couldn\u2019t help herself. Because the feel of his erection, heavy with lust and pressing tight against his jeans, was driving her crazy with need.</p><p>Using his hips as leverage, she rose and fell against the wedge of heat between her thighs, grinding it against her pussy, rubbing the denim covering it against the silk of her panties, and pressing it against the swollen, too-sensitive bud of her clit.</p><p>Suddenly she could feel things she had never felt before where her own body was concerned. She was feeling things she had never known she could feel until Brogan.</p><p>The emptiness of her vagina, clenched and aching; she could feel the desperate need to be filled. To be possessed.</p><p>His lips continued to devour hers; he took deep, stinging kisses and licked at the burn before deepening the kiss again. His tongue pressed between her lips, licked and teased hers. His lips slanted over hers as his tongue tasted against hers, and the taste of them together became intoxicating.</p><p>She was only barely aware of him moving, walking the distance from the patio to the bedroom, she assumed as he lowered her to the incredibly lush support of a mattress. His lips slid to the curve of her jaw before he lowered himself to his knees.</p><p>Her knees were still gripping his thighs. As he lifted from her, hurriedly unbuttoning his shirt, Eve stared around them in awe, taking in the incredibly romantic candlelit bedroom. The soft light cast a dreamy quality through the netting draped over the bed in several layers.</p><p>Like a scene out of one of the naughty romance books she liked to read, the candlelight gleamed against the bronzed flesh of his chest and shoulders as he shed the shirt. He was living proof that redheads could indeed tan to that gorgeous bronze color.</p><p>Lifting her hands, she ran them down his chest, past his flexing abdomen, to the leather belt cinching his hard waist.</p> <p>Loosening the leather, she smothered a cry at the feel of his hands pushing the chiffon of her dress above her thighs. His gaze locked with hers as she struggled with the metal tabs securing his jeans.</p><p>When she eased up until she was sitting in front him, he let her have her way. When she released the last tab, he caught her hands, holding her from her prize.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded desperately, her hands secured by his.</p><p>\u201cUndress for me, Eve.\u201d The demand in his voice should have pissed her off, rather than making her wet between her thighs.</p><p>Swallowing tightly as he eased back and helped her from the bed, Eve found herself standing before him, suddenly uncertain, trembling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . .\u201d She swallowed again, her hands lifting helplessly.</p><p>\u201cShh, baby,\u201d he whispered, catching her hands, and as she watched he brought her hands to his lips, turned them, then pressed a kiss to each palm before he released them.</p><p>\u201cI fantasize about watching you undress,\u201d he said softly as he rose before her and shed his jeans. \u201cEvery time I jack off it\u2019s to the images of you.\u201d He sat back down on the bed, his fingers gripping the broad length of his cock, and began stroking it slowly as she watched, mesmerized.</p><p>The wide, engorged crest throbbed demandingly as a creamy bead of pre-come formed at the tip. Eve licked her lips nervously, unable to draw her gaze from the heavily veined shaft and throbbing head.</p><p>\u201cHow does that pretty dress come off, Eve?\u201d he asked, the low, caressing murmur of his voice drawing free a sensuality she hadn\u2019t known burned within her.</p><p>Lifting her hands, her gaze locked on his fingers as he caressed himself, Eve slowly reached behind her back and slid the zipper down. She knew what she wore beneath the dress. She had worn what she dreamed of wearing for him.</p><p>After releasing the zipper, Eve lifted her shoulders and slowly lowered the material over the black lace bra and matching bikini panties. The chiffon fell to her feet, revealing the silk thigh-high stockings gripping her thighs with a band of lacy elastic, while the four-inch heels made her legs look incredibly long.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s fingers stilled on his cock, his gaze glittering with lust as it went over the lacy underthings.</p><p>Reaching back, Eve moved to unclip the fastening of the bra. Once the tiny hook released, she shrugged the straps from her shoulders and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>He was stroking his erection again, his fingers tightening at the base as she bent to loosen the heels she wore.</p><p>\u201cLeave the shoes and the stockings,\u201d he growled, reaching out to thread his fingers through her hair before she lifted her head.</p><p>\u201cEve,\u201d he whispered her name, but the command, the dominance in his tone left her trembling. \u201cIf I ask for something and you\u2019re uncomfortable, make certain the discomfort is because you\u2019re not certain you want it rather than because of your innocence.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to still the demand in his tone and give the statement more of the appearance of a request, but she knew what he was doing, just as she knew what he wanted.</p><p>He held her head, staring back at her as he stroked his erection, and Eve felt a shudder race through her as he slowly released his grip on her hair.</p><p>She straightened, restraining a low groan as he rose and held her shoulders, slowly turning her to the bed as his lips lowered to hers once again, moving against them, sipping at her lips, tasting her as his hands stroked down her back to her hips.</p><p>His lips shifted to her neck, stimulating and exciting the sensitive flesh as Eve trembled beneath him. She tipped her neck to the side, arching against him, and the hard, engorged shaft of his cock pressed against her lower stomach. Heat and steely strength throbbed against her, dragging a whimpering cry from her lips as need overcame hesitancy.</p><p>Eve\u2019s lips found his chest, brushed the small disk of a male nipple, and she gloried in the sudden tension that tightened his body. One hand buried itself in her hair as the other gripped her thigh, holding her to him.</p><p>Easing her lips lower, Eve caressed the broad expanse of his chest one kiss at a time until the fingers buried in her hair tightened, easing her lips lower.</p><p>She knew what he wanted. She could feel it in the press of his fingers in her hair, the waiting stillness of his body.</p><p>Gripping his lean hips with trembling hands, Eve lowered her head down his torso, her tongue peeking out to sample the dark male taste of him. Slowly easing lower, she paused inches above the broad, throbbing crest awaiting her attention.</p><p>She\u2019d never done this before. She\u2019d dreamed about it, but she never actually tasted a man so intimately. And she found herself so nervous now, so uncertain.</p><p>Brogan pulled back.</p><p>Staring up at him in surprise, she gripped his hips, not ready quite yet to admit to failure. Her lips pressed against the strength of his abdomen, she closed her eyes, uncertain what to do.</p><p>\u201cSit on the bed.\u201d The growl in his voice was a rasp of pure hunger.</p><p>Eve sat on the bed, finding herself at the perfect level now for what he wanted. His hand slid into her hair again as his fingers wrapped around the pulsing shaft.</p><p>There was no request, no apology. Her gaze jerked up to his as the broad head was slowly pushing against her lips.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth over it.\u201d He groaned, his expression demanding. \u201cSuck it into your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted over the bulging crest, a whimper escaping her as the slow penetration of her mouth sent a surge of sensation racing to the depths of her pussy.</p><p>Her clit was a swollen knot of sensual agony, aching with a force she hadn\u2019t expected as her lips finally closed over the full breadth of his cock head.</p><p>It was a powerful feeling, the intimacy of holding such erotic strength with nothing but the pleasure her mouth could bring him.</p><p>The second her lips closed around the width of the throbbing crest, instinct seemed to take over. Everything she had read, every time she had tried to practice what she read with the erotic toy she had bought, came to her rescue. Her natural sensuality and the hungry need filling her did the rest.</p><p>Caressing him, her nails rasping against his flesh, Eve lowered her hands from his hips to his thighs. The fingers of one hand curled around the heavy shaft throbbing beneath her lips, while the fingers of the other found the taut sac drawn tight to the base of his cock.</p><p>Forcing her gaze to meet his, Eve watched the steely depths of his eyes flare, the color darkening as his hard jaw tightened with a noticeable clench.</p><p>She sucked the fierce heat of the broad crest into her mouth. Eve flicked her tongue beneath the flared head, rubbing at the sensitive underside with her tongue. Caressing and sucking the throbbing head, she closed her eyes. She stroked the hard shaft, her nails rasping over the tightened flesh of his balls before she cupped them, weighted it as a harsh groan sounded above her.</p><p>Brogan watched her face, the flushed, delicate features absorbed, suffused with sensuality as the heated dampness of her mouth tightened on the head of his cock. His fingers fisted in her hair, the silky midnight length like living warmth in his hand. Holding the soft strands, clutching them, he fought to keep from pushing her faster than she was ready; he wanted to let her find her own rhythm, her own pleasure in him.</p><p>And she was killing him with that pleasure. Each heated stroke of her hot little mouth, the silken glide of her delicate fingers, lanced his balls with heat. His shaft throbbed furiously as her mouth destroyed him with each sweet draw, with each stroke of her fingers and lash of her tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was pushing him to an edge he\u2019d never known before, one no other woman had ever pushed him to. As inexperienced as she was, as nervous as she had been starting out, she was destroying him now, moving her mouth up and down, suckling and licking and sending pulsing flares of incredible sensation racing through his cock.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Eve.\u201d He couldn\u2019t hold back the rough groan as the sensations threatened to send him exploding into her mouth. \u201cSweet baby. Sweet, sweet fucking Eve.\u201d</p><p>Holding her head in place as his hands tightened in her hair, Brogan watched her face, watched the lush beauty of her mouth as he fucked it with slow, shallow thrusts.</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah. Suck it, sweetheart. That\u2019s it.\u201d His teeth clenched as her hold on his cock head tightened, the heat of her mouth drawing him closer to the edge of control.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t pull back he was going to come. He\u2019d fill her mouth with every hot pulse of semen building in his balls. And though he would love nothing better than watching her take every spurt of his release, he wasn\u2019t quite ready to give in to the sensations whipping through his senses.</p><p>Pulling back from her, forcing her to release her hold on the engorged head of his cock, Brogan forced himself to ignore her moan of protest. If he heeded it, if he gave in to her, then the pleasure he had in store for her might well have to come another night.</p><p>He had only one more night to give her before he had to tell her the truth.</p><p>Cupping the back of her neck in his hand and pulling her to him, Brogan covered her lips with his again and consumed her kiss. Tilting his head, slanting his lips over hers, and devouring the pleasure to be found in her, he gave the lust burning in his veins full rein for just a second.</p><p>God, he loved kissing her. Loved the way her lips moved beneath his, the way her fingers slid into his hair, gripping and holding tight to him. She trembled in his arms and moaned into his kiss, lost to the pleasure building between them.</p><p>He loved her\u2014no, he loved her kiss. He loved her touch. He loved her\u2014 He pushed the thought away, kissing his way from her lips, along her jaw, to the delicate line of her throat.</p><p>Eve\u2019s head tilted to the side, granting access to the graceful line as her lips found his shoulder and her nails dug into his biceps. He kissed, licked, marked the base of her neck, shocked by the groan of satisfaction that escaped his lips at the sight of the reddened love bite where her neck and shoulder met.</p><p>Leaning back, Brogan framed her face with his hands and stared into her dazed expression.</p><p>\u201cSo pretty,\u201d he whispered, stroking his hands along her neck, shoulders, and then down her arms to her wrists. Slowly pulling her wrists behind her back, he lowered his lips to the upper curves of her breasts.</p><p>Hunger, lust, and something more\u2014something he didn\u2019t recognize and couldn\u2019t define\u2014threatened to pull him under. Threatened to destroy his control and the pleasure he insisted on giving her.</p><p>When this night was over he would have to tell her the truth. He had no choice. Pulling her into his life required that she know what his life was, and her part in it. And the chances of losing her once he did so were high. High enough that he had to attempt to tie her to him with pleasure.</p><p>Brushing his beard over the hard tips of her breasts, he allowed his tongue to take a quick, flickering taste. Restraining her gently, he watched her expression, watched the pleasure building inside her.</p><p>This was a high that could never be duplicated. It was a high more dangerous to a man\u2019s soul than any found in a drug. Because this high chanced an addiction to not just the pleasure, but to the woman. And he was beginning to fear he had found the woman and the pleasure that could become an addiction impossible to live without.</p><p>Parting his lips, still watching her, he lowered his mouth to the pebble-hard tip of her nipple.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Brogan,\u201d she cried out, arching into him as desperation filled her voice and aching, imperative need filled her gaze.</p><p>Ah, yes, he knew that pleasure rising inside her. The same pleasure he\u2019d felt lashing at his cock as her mouth surrounded it and sucked it inside the damp heat.</p><p>He drew on the engorged peak of her nipple, licking at it, watching her expression and feeling the tension rising in her\u2014ah, God, yes. She could definitely become his addiction.</p><p>His weakness.</p> <p>She could become his destruction.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>Explosive pleasure, flaring through her senses and rasping over sensitive nerve endings, screamed through her body. The feel of Brogan\u2019s lips surrounding the tender tip of her nipple was throwing her senses into chaos. Whipping pinpoints of sensation struck at her clit, at the sensitive depths of her pussy. They burned through her, flickered across her flesh, and sent electric bursts of impending ecstasy rocketing through her.</p><p>She arched to him, desperation filling her with the need to get closer to the heat of his body. She needed more, needed her nipple deeper in the fiery heat of his mouth. She couldn\u2019t get close enough. She couldn\u2019t still the demand raging through her body. Frantic, hungry lust built and burned to furious peaks, spilling her juices from the clenched depths of her pussy and drawing her body tight with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Oh, God. Brogan, please,\u201d she cried out, feeling her senses spinning as her breath caught at the sensations thrumming through her clit and making her pussy clench.</p><p>Releasing her nipple from the devouring grip of his mouth, Brogan turned his attention to its mate.</p><p>\u201cI love your nipples,\u201d he crooned, brushing his beard against the hard, incredibly sensitive peak. \u201cThe feel of them, the sweet taste of them.\u201d</p><p>He surrounded the hard tip with his mouth, and heat shot from the throbbing peak to pierce her womb before striking at the pulsing bud of her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cBrogan. Damn you . . .\u201d Straining at the hold he had on her, Eve felt herself becoming consumed by the needs racing through her body.</p><p>Excitement and adrenaline pumped through her bloodstream and laid waste to her ability to hold any part of herself back; pleasure rushed through her system again. Holding her relentlessly in his grip, Brogan sent torturous pleasure whipping through her with his touch, melting her, consuming her ability to function without him.</p><p>When his head drew back she could only moan at the loss of his touch as she attempted to push her breasts to him once again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to release your arms, Eve,\u201d he told her, staring into her eyes as she forced them open. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, understand?\u201d</p><p>She could only shake her head, confused now.</p><p>\u201cI need to touch you, Brogan,\u201d she whispered, breathless and aching with such force it was like being tortured from the inside out.</p><p>She loved the feel of his body. The warmth and strength of him were a stable port in a chaotic storm of sensation.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cMy control is shot, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t wait.\u201d She reached for him, pouting when he caught her hands again.</p><p>Holding them at the wrists, he stared back at her with dominant intent. \u201cEve, I could always tie you to the bed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare!\u201d</p><p>Gripping her wrists in one hand again, he lowered the other, trailing it along her thigh before sliding it between them and quickly wedging them apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of eating your hot little pussy,\u201d he growled. \u201cSo yes, sweetheart, I damned well would tie you to the bed.\u201d</p><p>The first sentence hadn\u2019t passed his lips before Eve was breathing roughly, more of her juices flooding her pussy and spilling to the swollen folds beyond.</p><p>\u201cWant me to do that to you, Eve?\u201d he asked softly, knowingly, as his finger touched her, slowly easing through the saturated slit.</p><p>Her hips jerked, the sensations tearing through her pussy, jerking through her body like bolts of electric energy.</p><p>\u201cAh, you do like that,\u201d he crooned.</p><p>Holding her gaze, he returned his finger to where it had been, the tip stroking upward this time to circle the swollen bud of her clit and dragging a harsh, desperate cry from her lips.</p><p>A second later he removed his touch again, staring up at her, demand filling his expression. \u201cNo touching me, agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Agreed,\u201d she breathed out roughly.</p><p>He released her slowly. \u201cLie back on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, oh, God. This was going to be so good. She could feel excitement racing through her veins and searing her body.</p><p>Lying back, lifting her arms above her head, she breathed in hard and deep.</p><p>\u201cCome to the edge of the bed,\u201d he urged her, his hands at her hips to help her scoot forward until her hips were braced on the side of the bed.</p><p>Slowly he opened her thighs, spreading them wide as Eve fought to breathe through the anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking pretty,\u201d he whispered, his finger easing through the bare folds again, sliding heatedly through the gathering juices.</p><p>\u201cBrogan, please don\u2019t torture me,\u201d she whispered, her fingers clenching in the blanket above her head. \u201cI\u2019ve waited too long.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d waited so long for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this,\u201d he promised, his lips pressing to her thigh as she jerked in reaction. \u201cJust let it have you, Eve. Let me have you. Let me give you all the pleasure you\u2019ve waited for.\u201d</p><p>All the pleasure she\u2019d waited for?</p><p>Could she bear it?</p><p>No.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The first heated kiss to the swollen bud of her clit had her crying out as his head lifted. Her hips jerked, lifting to him as the first warning pulse of her orgasm began rippling through her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Damn you, Brogan, don\u2019t stop.\u201d The breathless demand came out as a desperate cry.</p><p>Gripping her hips, he controlled her movements easily as she tried to press closer to his mouth once again.</p><p>Easing his tongue through the swollen folds, he licked at her flesh, tasting the slick, wet heat spilling from her. Heated kisses along the bare folds stole her breath. As he lifted her feet to the narrow edge of the platform to open her more fully to him, her breath caught.</p><p>His tongue glided through the narrow slit, licking and probing as he moved lower. The rasp of his licking strokes moving over the sensitive flesh had her hips lifting to him. The needs assailing her were so unfamiliar they were impossible to anticipate. She couldn\u2019t hold back. Second by second she could feel more and more of herself becoming lost to this man.</p><p>Gasping, fighting to breathe through the building sensations, Eve couldn\u2019t help the cries falling from her lips. She couldn\u2019t hold back the burning, building pleasure of her cries.</p><p>Her pussy contracted in spasming waves as his tongue flicked around the clenched, weeping entrance of her sex. Quick, heated licks of his tongue lapped at the juices falling from her.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s tongue plunged inside her pussy, suddenly fucking into the delicate tissue, rasping around it as the sensitive flesh and clenched muscles clamped down in an effort to keep him inside her. The fierce impalement, the heated internal licks and sure stimulation of her nerve endings sent her hurtling through an explosion that completely devastated her senses.</p><p>Ecstasy tore through her. Her hips lifted, her hands jerking from above her head to bury themselves in his hair, clutching the strands, holding on tight, holding him to her. Eve\u2019s release swept through her.</p><p>His tongue pumped inside her, even through the brilliant explosions tearing her apart. Her pussy clenched and rippled, clamped down as heat surged from the depths of her cunt. Ecstasy sent her juices spilling to his tongue, explosions radiating through her as she cried out his name.</p><p>Shuddering, fighting to breathe, Eve sobbed beneath the overwhelming release, barely aware of Brogan moving, his hands forcing her fingers from his hair as she shuddered again.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine a greater pleasure, a more sweeping release. She didn\u2019t believe she could survive it\u2014until she became aware of the fiery, stretching invasion of her sex.</p><p>Her eyes opened, her gaze centering between her thighs. There, the head of his cock buried inside her as the slick folds of her flesh embraced the wide shaft. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo fucking tight. Like a living vise clamped around my dick,\u201d Brogan growled as her gaze jerked up to his.</p><p>His eyes were a cloudy gray now, his face savagely hewn and pulled into lines of agonizing pleasure. Perspiration dotted his forehead, but a bead slid slowly down his neck. The muscles of his chest tightened, the exertion of holding back reflected plainly on his face.</p><p>Her gaze fell to her thighs again. Eve watched as he eased back, dragging the engorged crest from the spasming entrance of her pussy.</p> <p>Throbbing, slick from her juices, the dark crest gleamed beneath the candlelight for a second, until he was pressing into her again, entering the flexing entrance and working into the snug muscles.</p><p>Eve\u2019s breath caught, the fiery heat blooming in the delicate tissue he slowly forced to part, stretching them until she was certain she could take no more. Until he pulled back and pressed inside again, stretching her further.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby . . . Eve, it\u2019s so fucking good.\u201d He groaned, taking more of her, giving her more of himself.</p><p>With each inward stroke he filled her further, burying himself deeper and deeper inside the fierce clasp of her inner muscles.</p><p>\u201cBrogan. More.\u201d She gasped. \u201cPlease, please, more.\u201d</p> <p>More sensation. More pleasure. Enough sensation to send her hurtling into release again.</p><p>The incredible pleasure bordered on pain, crossed the line only to ease back before building again. Each thrust was a stroke of pure, lancing sensation. Agony and ecstasy burned and flamed and kept her poised on such a brink of incredible rapture that she began to fear flying from the peak.</p><p>Each stroke buried him to the depths of her sex, the thrusts gaining in pace until the sound of their flesh slapping together filled her senses. She was so sensitive she swore she could feel the air brushing across it, the flickering warmth of the candles like a lick of flames.</p><p>Her internal muscles stretched around the impaling flesh, nerve endings so sensitive, so responsive that each thrust only pushed her higher.</p><p>She was screaming, yet only barely aware of it.</p><p>She was begging, terrified of the coming onslaught, desperate to weaken her release when it came. She could feel it building to a critical point. The sensations were flaming higher inside her as her pussy clamped on his cock. With each forward thrust he began fucking her harder, shafting inside her faster as he surged over her. His head lowered to her breasts, his lips covering a nipple and sucking it inside, tipping her over the edge.</p> <p>Eve felt the explosions tear through her senses. The force and fury of her release flung her so high, so deep into ecstasy Eve swore she felt her soul open and merge. . . .</p><p>Felt it embraced and sheltered . . .</p><p>Brogan felt Eve\u2019s release as her pussy clamped down on his shuttling dick. Her eyes were open, her lips parted on a silent cry as he was taken unaware.</p><p>It happened so fast. It hit him with such force, with such impact, there was no saving either of them.</p><p>He knew the second it slipped his control and began blazing through him. The moment he realized the condom he wore had split, the latex folding back from the head of his cock. For the first time in his life he felt the full sensation of the lush, silken depths of his lover\u2019s pussy. He felt the heat of her slick cream as it surrounded his engorged cock head.</p><p>For the first time in his life he lost that last measure of control.</p><p>Eve exploded with the initial stroke of his bare cock. Her internal muscles rippled and stroked the wildly throbbing crest, then clamped down on it like an internal fist, milking it until his release began spurting furiously into her fiery depths.</p><p>A shattered groan tore from his chest as complete rapture drove spikes of ecstasy through his soul.</p> <p>He had no idea what happened or how. As his release began spurting inside, the muscles of her pussy clamping and rippling over his dick, Brogan lifted his head, staring into her pleasure-dazed eyes, and he felt her. . . .</p><p>The ecstasy and the fear\u2014the uncertainty and the\u2014</p><p>God, no, he swore he could feel her heart, step into her soul. He could feel an emotion he couldn\u2019t allow himself to acknowledge as he buried his head at her shoulder and felt the last of his seed spurting inside her.</p><p>It had to be an aberration. Shock at the realization that he was spilling into her unprotected. That he was risking not just their lives, but possibly one more innocent than he could ever imagine.</p><p>Yet the thought of that hadn\u2019t been enough for him to pull free of the grip she had on him. It wasn\u2019t enough to hold back his release, or the need to give her all of himself once the condom ruptured. Nothing on the face of the earth could have held him back once he felt the unprotected depths of her pussy and the rich heat surrounding his bare cock.</p><p>And nothing could change the fact that he had given in to the urge to do just that.</p><p>As the last pulses of her waning orgasm caressed his cock, Brogan fought just to catch his breath. Beneath him, Eve was motionless, her own breathing hard, her heart racing in her breast beneath him as he forced himself to ease from her.</p><p>A shudder raced up his spine at the incredible pleasure of her snug grip as he pulled free of her. The overly sensitive head of his cock pulsed at the silky stroke of her slick inner muscles that had the shaft throbbing in renewed interest before he managed to pull free.</p><p>Hell, his knees were weak.</p><p>As he stood before her, his lips kicked up in a grin at the sight of her legs as they sprawled off the bed, her feet resting against the floor.</p><p>Picking her up, he laid her fully on the bed, brushed the tangled length of her hair back from her face, and wondered what the hell they were going to do now.</p><p>It was bad enough that he\u2019d allowed her to be pulled into something that could possibly risk her safety. But now he\u2019d done something she could find even more unforgivable. Something he didn\u2019t know whether he could even forgive himself for.</p><p>Yet he also knew he would do it again if he could.</p><p>If it happened again, if he once more found himself bare inside her that second before release, then he would give in to it. Because the pleasure had been astounding; the sensations, the intimacy of it had been more than he had ever imagined it would be.</p><p>Pulling back, he strode to the bathroom and quickly cleaned and dried the proof of their release from his flesh before wetting a clean cloth and grabbing a fresh towel. Returning to the bed he had to grin at the sight of her as she slept. Sated, exhausted, she\u2019d given in to the weariness and slipped into sleep. He cleaned her gently, easing the cloth between her legs, then through the soft folds of her pussy before he quickly finished with her thighs.</p><p>Drying the dampness from her, he pulled the comforter and sheet over her body before collapsing in the large chair by the bed. Staring at her, watching her sleep, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder at this new joke fate seemed to be playing on him.</p><p>He had a woman whose qualities were exactly those he\u2019d once told friends he dreamed of finding in a woman: innocence, honor, humor, and strength. She knew how to find amusement in herself as well as the world around her, but she also knew compassion. She\u2019d saved herself far longer than he had ever imagined a woman of such beauty could have, and she had given herself completely to him.</p><p>Because she loved him.</p><p>The thought smacked him like a blow to the head and rattled his senses.</p><p>That was what he had felt as he stared into her dazed eyes, feeling her release spill along the bare crest of his cock.</p><p>She believed she loved him, he amended. She couldn\u2019t truly love him, because she didn\u2019t truly know him.</p><p>And once she did?</p><p>He sighed at the thought. Once she did, would she still believe she loved him?</p><p>He highly doubted it.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Brogan stood next to the water, watching as bass jumped and frolicked playfully in the first morning light. It wasn\u2019t the bass that held his attention, though, any more than it was the beauty of the fog rising from the water and twisting around the trees growing along the bank. It was the unfamiliar emotions twisting and churning in his chest that held his attention.</p><p>He was thirty-four years old; there shouldn\u2019t be emotions he hadn\u2019t felt before, but these feelings were completely alien to him.</p><p>The possessiveness he knew and he understood. He wasn\u2019t a man who appreciated or practiced casual sex. One-night stands had never been his thing. It had always been his intention to develop a relationship with Eve. It had just been his intention to complete this operation first.</p><p>He\u2019d never meant to drag her into whatever the hell was going on in the Lake Cumberland area. And it had never, ever been his intention to risk the creation of a child.</p><p>Rubbing at the back of his neck, he paced at the edge of the lake, the sound of the water lapping at the bank joining the soft, early morning symphony as the memory of spilling his release inside Eve tormented his mind.</p><p>It had happened only one other time in his life, when he had been much younger. The condom hadn\u2019t ripped with such force, and he hadn\u2019t known the pleasure of finding his release as his bare cock sank inside the heated depths of his lover\u2019s pussy.</p><p>Rather, the small tear at the tip of the condom had allowed a small amount of his release free.</p><p>Brogan hadn\u2019t been ready to be a parent, but he\u2019d accepted the responsibility of it. The day his fianc\u00e9e had taken the home pregnancy test four weeks later, his heart had melted at the thought of their child when he\u2019d seen the positive result.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t discussed it. She had never mentioned not wanting the child, but neither had she mentioned plans to abort the baby. Until he\u2019d returned home from the law enforcement academy after officially being offered a position in the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>He\u2019d bought a teddy bear for the child, and had made plans to build a house on a piece of property outside his hometown. When he\u2019d stepped in the door of the apartment Candy met him with a happy squeal as she threw herself in his arms. Pulling back, she\u2019d looked at the teddy bear that had fallen at his feet and laughed. She wasn\u2019t ready for a child to blow her figure out of shape, and she definitely wasn\u2019t ready to settle down to the ties of motherhood.</p><p>And Brogan had never forgiven her.</p><p>The moment the admission of the abortion had slipped past her lips, he was finished with her. He had felt grief wrap around his heart, felt the guilt and shame of it sear his soul. Their child had been innocent of its creation, and she hadn\u2019t been able to give nine months of her life to giving it birth?</p><p>He would have taken the child and raised it himself. Hell, he would have paid her to have the baby.</p><p>He\u2019d broken their engagement immediately. As she cried, screamed, pretended confusion, and then raged in fury that it was her choice, he had packed.</p><p>The child hadn\u2019t just been hers; that baby had been his, too. It should have never been just her choice. He should have had a choice as well. Their child should have had a choice, he had raged at her as he left her life and never looked back.</p><p>What would Eve do? he wondered. Would she kill their child or would she shelter it? Could he take the chance that she would at least discuss the options with him?</p><p>He was torn, and holding the knowledge of what had happened the night before bothered him more as he thought of it. He\u2019d raged at Candy for not giving him a choice in their child\u2019s birth, yet here he was, holding the truth of a possible conception from Eve, fearing the same result. What he was doing was no better than what Candy had done. He was refusing to give her a choice.</p><p>As the internal debate raged inside him, the muffled sound of a boat\u2019s motor moving closer to the cabin reached him. The narrow water lane leading to the hidden cabin wasn\u2019t one that could be accidentally taken. The safeguards set at the entrance of the tributary, the warnings placed farther up it, combined with strategically placed cables stretching across several points, the metal signs attached to them warning boaters back. It normally turned innocent curiosity seekers back.</p><p>Whoever his visitors were, they weren\u2019t there by accident. Pulling his weapon from where he\u2019d tucked it at the small of his back, Brogan stepped behind the huge oak growing close to the water. From here, he could identify any threat and make his way back to the cabin before the boat could reach the beach. He would have time to pull Eve out if he had to, and to ensure her protection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the boat came into view, clearing the fog, the trolling motor easing it through the water, Brogan grimaced in irritation. This was definitely one of those uncalled-for occurrences in his life.</p><p>At the controls was Eli. Riding in the back of the expensive bass boat was Jed, cradling an automatic rifle. Sitting cool and comfortable in the seat next to Elijah was Chatham Bromleah Doogan III, director of operations and all-around fucking bastard.</p><p>There were opinions that he and Timothy Cranston were cut from the same cloth.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t exactly true. Cranston had a heart. He had compassion. Doogan had neither. Brogan was convinced pure ice water ran through his veins. That or oil. All good robots had to run on something.</p><p>As the boat pulled up to the small dock and Jed jumped out to secure it, Brogan stepped from behind the tree and strolled out to the boardwalk that led from the beach to the dock farther out in the water.</p><p>What the hell were they doing there cramping his day?</p><p>Doogan pulled off his dark glasses, amusement filling his dark brown eyes as a grin curled his lips.</p><p>\u201cDawg Mackay\u2019s looking for his sister and he\u2019s fit to be tied,\u201d Doogan stated, mockery filling his gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s a little overprotective, wouldn\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>What would Doogan know about protectiveness?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a sister, do you, Doogan?\u201d Brogan asked.</p><p>Doogan shuddered, his gaze flashing in mock horror. \u201cMy parents were actually humane enough to stop with me,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t say I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows,\u201d Brogan retorted.</p><p>Doogan scowled back at him. \u201cNevertheless, Dawg didn\u2019t care much for Timothy\u2019s explanation, nor mine. The fact that Dawg knew I was in Somerset still greatly concerns me. I was unaware he knew my full name.\u201d As opposed to the codename Doogan had insisted be listed instead. The only reason Brogan, Eli, and Booker were aware of it was because they\u2019d trained with him, drank with him, and listened to his drunken ramblings before he\u2019d begun his climb up the federal ladder.</p><p>\u201cIt should,\u201d Brogan assured him. \u201cMy question is, how did you find us?\u201d</p> <p>Doogan smiled complacently. \u201cThis is a political retreat, Brogan. All those nasty politicians with their young mistresses need someplace safe to hide. And someone has to make sure the place doesn\u2019t get overcrowded. That job falls to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it does? Get overcrowded, that is,\u201d Brogan asked mockingly.</p><p>Doogan shrugged. \u201cFederal Protective Service has a houseboat stored along a nearby tributary and another cabin hidden along the lake. But overcrowding doesn\u2019t happen if one is diligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegular little caretaker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Brogan taunted him.</p><p>Doogan tilted his head to the side. \u201cWhy do I keep seeing a real dishonorable discharge in your future?\u201d</p><p>Brogan shrugged. \u201cWishful thinking maybe? Because we both know John David Bryce isn\u2019t going to allow that.\u201d</p><p>Doogan\u2019s eyes flashed with rueful laughter rather than the offense Brogan had intended.</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Doogan agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to fire the director of Homeland Security\u2019s bastard son, I would imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, a few have tried.\u201d Brogan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, unfortunately,\u201d Doogan lamented on a sigh. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t come up here to trade insults, as much as I do enjoy the opportunity. And neither did I come up here to warn you about Dawg. Though I would enjoy being present when he finds you.\u201d</p><p>Brogan only snorted at the comment as he waited to see why Doogan had shown up.</p><p>Stepping from the boat, Doogan started around the small clearing. \u201cIt\u2019s really rather pretty here,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cGet to the point, Doogan,\u201d Brogan growled. \u201cI have things to do.\u201d</p><p>Concern flashed in Doogan\u2019s eyes for a second before the brown depths were once again icy and emotionless.</p><p>\u201cWe need to seriously discuss this operation,\u201d he warned Brogan. \u201cI know you; you intend to tell her your purpose for being here, and the fact that you were ordered to develop a friendship with her.\u201d</p><p>Brogan\u2019s brow lifted as he noticed the amused amazement on Elijah\u2019s and Jed\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cA friendship?\u201d Brogan questioned him. \u201cDoogan, you\u2019ve been playing pimp from afar for more than two years in your attempt to get me to invite myself into her bed. It was only your dumb luck that I wasn\u2019t able to stay the hell away from her any longer.\u201d</p><p>Doogan slid one hand casually into the pocket of his slacks as he stared back at Brogan coolly.</p><p>\u201cI did you a favor, actually,\u201d he drawled. \u201cYou\u2019ll thank me for it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of here before I have to shoot you.\u201d Brogan glowered back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to deal with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until we discuss what you intend to tell Ms. Mackay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d Brogan snapped. \u201cI won\u2019t lie to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would highly suggest doing just that,\u201d his boss ordered. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been cleared for this operation, and her brother and cousins sure as hell haven\u2019t been cleared for it.\u201d He swiped his fingers through his hair as he glared at Brogan now. \u201cI\u2019m ordering you not to inform her of your true purpose for being here. You will stick to the parameters of your cover and tell her nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Brogan almost laughed. Doogan liked to think he had some measure of control over his agents, but they\u2019d all learned how to deal with his manipulations.</p><p>\u201cGo to hell, Doogan. Tell me something I want to hear or get the hell out of here,\u201d he warned, hostile.</p><p>Brogan might not know what he was up to yet, but he\u2019d figure it out. When he did . . . well, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the two of them had fought.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few details we need to go over,\u201d Doogan began.</p><p>\u201cLike the one where someone slipped into Eve\u2019s room last night,\u201d Elijah spoke up. \u201cWe saw it on the cameras when we returned to the inn. The same intruders tried to get into your room, but the new dead bolt you put on it kept them out long enough that they were forced to leave when Timothy made his rounds. That\u2019s why Dawg\u2019s trying to find you two. Timothy found her door unlocked, stepped inside to see the suite wrecked, and called her brother.\u201d</p><p>Brogan slid his gaze to Doogan slowly.</p><p>The other man stared back at him coolly before turning to Elijah and Jed. \u201cI could have taken care of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to help you out, boss.\u201d Elijah shrugged with a tight grin.</p><p>Doogan snorted in disbelief as he turned to Brogan. \u201cYou inspire insubordination,\u201d he accused irritably.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Brogan inclined his head in a gesture of gracious accomplishment before turning back to Jed and Elijah. \u201cDid they take anything from her room?\u201d</p><p>Elijah shook his head in the negative. \u201cThey searched the hell out of it, though. She won\u2019t be happy.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to be happy to begin with.</p><p>\u201cWhy search her room?\u201d he asked thoughtfully. \u201cI can understand searching mine, but why hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe to be certain you hadn\u2019t hidden anything there,\u201d Doogan pointed out. \u201cYou would expect your room to be searched, but not that of a woman you hadn\u2019t even made your lover yet.\u201d</p><p>Brogan frowned, turning to Eli. \u201cDid anyone leave the trip yesterday after I did?\u201d</p><p>Eli grimaced. \u201cPoppa Bear called it off after you left. He said he wasn\u2019t going searching for scenic destinations or those caves the group was heading to see without the leader of the pack.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>Doogan snickered at the comment.</p><p>\u201cThis happened before we arrived back at the inn,\u201d Elijah told him. \u201cWe were almost there when Donny asked exactly where the caves were, and Sambo commented that it would have been nice to have you there to make sure they were at the right place. That\u2019s when Poppa Bear called us all to pull into the parking lot of a grocery store and suggested coming back.\u201d</p><p>Sambo was a bear of a man and often pretended he didn\u2019t know his own ass from a hole in the mountain, let alone how to find some of the most popular caves in Kentucky.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone know why I left?\u201d</p><p>Jed and Elijah shook their heads. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Donny and Sandi called anyone later or not, but they played real dumb after you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Brogan, that boy\u2019s acting damned strange anyway after the two of them went ape shit thinking one of them might die. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say they might love each other. A lot.\u201d Jed shook his head at the thought.</p><p>\u201cThat little strike was unsanctioned as hell,\u201d Doogan reminded them all before glaring at Brogan. \u201cYou don\u2019t use agency resources to get vengeance over a perceived slight to a potential girlfriend, Agent Campbell.\u201d</p><p>Brogan found it strange that Doogan knew about it to begin with. And he\u2019d had to have said something to Jed or Eli about it first for either of them to have discussed it with him.</p><p>Brogan turned to the other two men. \u201cIs that everything Doogan needed to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Eli grinned as the director shot a silencing look at him and then at Jed. Brogan knew that if there was more, one of them would call or text the moment they had the chance.</p><p>\u201cAnything else I need to know before you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell her what you\u2019re doing here, Brogan,\u201d Doogan warned him again. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell her brother, her brother will tell his cousins, and then I\u2019ll have to start arresting Mackays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider your argument. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn you, you won\u2019t consider shit,\u201d Doogan burst out furiously as he stepped closer. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a direct order, you little son of a bitch. If you want to keep your job, you\u2019ll obey it.\u201d</p><p>Brogan\u2019s eyes narrowed, though he was very damn careful to hold back the suspicion he could feel churning in his gut.</p><p>\u201cFeel that strongly about it, do you?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI feel that strongly about your deliberate, constant insubordination,\u201d Doogan snapped. \u201cGet a handle on it before I take care of it myself.\u201d</p><p>Stepping onto the bow of the fishing boat, Doogan stepped back into the boat and took his seat as he shot Brogan a deliberately superior look.</p><p>\u201cMove out, Agent Grant,\u201d he ordered Eli.</p><p>Eli did as ordered as Jed rolled his eyes and gave Brogan a quick, short shake of his head.</p><p>This was why he preferred working with Jed and Eli instead of the two agents over those in the regional office. He could trust them to cover his back, both in and out of the field. His gut was already telling him Doogan\u2019s reaction was way off base.</p><p>He\u2019d come out there specifically to piss Brogan off. All he\u2019d done was make him highly suspicious. The other man was a manipulator. And he was trying to ensure that Brogan did as he wanted him to do, not as he was telling him to do.</p><p>Doogan wanted the Mackays in on this operation, and he\u2019d wanted them there from the beginning.</p><p>From the first day Brogan had set foot in Pulaski County, Doogan had been pushing him toward Eve.</p><p>Walking back to the house as the last of dawn began to slip away, he knew Doogan was only pushing him, or Eve, into informing her brother of Brogan\u2019s mission. And Brogan couldn\u2019t figure out why the other man didn\u2019t say so. Brogan had finally put Doogan\u2019s manipulations together. He was salivating to get the Mackays on this operation.</p><p>Doogan was a hell of a manipulator, but usually he was only this bad when he had no other choice. And if he wanted the Mackays so badly, why not just ask them himself? Or he could have gone to Timothy. There were few things Timothy enjoyed more than manipulating Mackays; he would have loved to have pulled Dawg and his cousins into the operation himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There were few things Doogan loved more than the chance to do his own manipulating, too, though. Once he saw that pulling the Mackays in would actually take some effort, he would have done exactly as he did: rushed straight to Somerset and set his plans in motion. Plans that would get him killed if they managed to harm even the first silken hair on Eve\u2019s head.</p><p>Eve stood in the large bathroom staring through the window that looked out onto the water and the small beach with its long dock extending out to deeper water.</p><p>It was the faint sound of the boat\u2019s trolling motor moving up the waterway that had urged Eve to crawl from the bed and go to the bathroom, where she could see the beach more clearly. And boy, had she gotten an eyeful that she hadn\u2019t expected.</p> <p>It was easy to recognize the three men Brogan had just been talking to. Jedediah Booker and Elijah Grant, the two building contractors staying at her mother\u2019s inn, along with Chatham Doogan, were meeting with Brogan.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, but she\u2019d been able to follow their expressions. Brogan had been trying to hide his irritation and suspicion, where both Jedediah and Elijah had looked more amused than anything else.</p><p>The one thing that had clearly come across, though, and really pissed her off was the fact that Brogan and Doogan obviously knew each other very, very well.</p><p>Liars. She hated them. There was something about deliberate lies and deceit that reminded her far too much of Chandler Mackay.</p><p>As Brogan moved toward the house, Eve turned and rushed back to the bed, knowing he would come straight to her. He wouldn\u2019t wait; he wouldn\u2019t find anything else to do.</p> <p>Crawling back into the huge, obviously custom-made bed, she pulled the sheet to her breasts just as Brogan entered the room. He came to an immediate stop as he saw she was awake and waiting for him.</p><p>Instantly wariness seemed to settle around him, though his expression didn\u2019t change. It didn\u2019t flicker in his gaze, and there was no tension in his body. So she had no clue how she knew he was suddenly unsettled by the fact that she was waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d he stated softly, moving toward her as she watched him closely.</p><p>\u201cFor a while now,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI wondered where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had some business that couldn\u2019t wait.\u201d He grimaced as he rubbed at his jaw. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later. Are you ready for breakfast yet, or would you like a hot bath first?\u201d</p><p>They would discuss it later?</p> <p>Eve could feel an impending sense of panic settling in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather discuss the business first,\u201d she argued.</p><p>Brogan shook his head, his lips tilting in that little partial grin she thought was so sexy.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast or bath.\u201d Evidently, those were her only choices. \u201cWhich do you prefer first? There are some bath salts to ease the soreness in your muscles, imported all the way from China.\u201d Rueful amusement tinged the blue-gray depths of his gaze.</p><p>\u201cBath, I guess.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBrogan?\u201d</p><p>He paused as he moved to turn to the bathroom, staring down at her questioningly instead.</p><p>\u201cThis business we\u2019re going to discuss,\u201d she asked as her heart began beating hard and sluggishly. \u201cIs it something bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing bad.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetheart; everything will be okay. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t really believe that. He wanted to, she thought. He might be trying to convince himself it would be, but she could sense his uneasiness, and that was freaking her out just a bit. She shouldn\u2019t be able to sense anything that he wasn\u2019t showing the obvious signs to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start your water.\u201d Turning, he headed back to the bathroom before pausing at the door and glancing back at her. \u201cYou have several changes of clothes; wear whatever you like. I thought we\u2019d take a walk after breakfast, but the path is easy enough for sandals or sneakers.\u201d</p><p>A walk sounded nice. Or was that when he was going to discuss the business of Chatham, Elijah, and Jedediah\u2019s morning visit?</p><p>Checking the bag he had brought, Eve pulled out one of the heavy plastic hair clips she used to pin her hair up. Twisting the long strands to the top of her head, she clipped it in place before moving to the bathroom when he left.</p><p>True to his word, he had started her bath. The water was deliciously warm without being too hot. The bath salts gave it a silky, caressing feel as she settled into it, sighing at the luscious sensation of the water easing overused muscles.</p><p>The tub itself was large enough for two or three people. There was an open shower larger than her entire bathroom. The vanity and sleek modern overlarge sink sat on one side of the room, a pair of heavy padded chairs beside it. The toilet was in a room by itself, separated from the bathing area with a sliding wooden door that pushed into the wall. Heated ceramic tiles covered the floor, while more tile covered the walls and gave the bathroom an elegant, charming feel. It was luxurious and ultrarich, with enough wasted space to house two more regular-size bathrooms.</p><p>The entire house was a rich person\u2019s play den, nothing more. One of those places the megarich kept as a hidden sex spot: wild parties, mistresses, booze, and drugs. Hell, in the other bathroom there had been an eight-ball of cocaine sitting in the medicine cabinet in plain view.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t checked this bathroom that well yet.</p><p>Finishing her bath with the fragrant soap Brogan had laid out for her, Eve stepped from the tub nearly half an hour later. Drying herself, she brushed her hair until the silky sheen gleamed a blue-black, then dressed quickly.</p><p>The white lace panties and matching bra she\u2019d found in the bag comprised one of her nicer sets. Trust Brogan to pick out the best she had.</p><p>The short cream-colored chiffon skirt and matching sleeveless top slid over her skin as she dressed, caressing it with cool silkiness.</p><p>The top was held up by fragile straps over her shoulders, while the shallow vee cut of the bodice revealed the upper curves of her breasts. The skirt fell just below her thighs, the soft flare of the material making her legs appear much longer and sexier.</p><p>She was dressed now and ready to face whatever lies or perhaps explanations Brogan might have.</p><p>Nervously she left the bedroom and headed to the main part of the house. There she found Brogan in the large open kitchen sliding pancakes onto a plate with steaming eggs. Beside it sat another plate, while bacon, sausage, and fluffy biscuits filled a platter.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d sit on the breakfast patio.\u201d Grabbing the two plates and silverware, Brogan nodded to the platter. \u201cGrab that. The coffee\u2019s already out there.\u201d</p><p>The breakfast patio held a wide table and seating for six. Sitting across from Brogan at one end, she stared at the tall picture windows that surrounded them on three sides.</p><p>Eve enjoyed the view outside as they ate in silence. At one point, a doe moved through the trees beyond the glass, and a thought piqued her curiosity.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if hunters accidently shoot this way?\u201d Hunting season would be coming around in a few months.</p><p>\u201cThe windows are actually bullet resistant. The glass itself has a special coating that blocks anyone outside from looking in.\u201d He volunteered more information. \u201cAll the windows in the house are similarly secured. The basement has a security room with its own backup generator, and that wall\u201d\u2014he indicated the mural painted on the wall leading into the living area\u2014\u201chas a hidden panel to a safe room. There are satellite phones, cell phones, and a landline. The wires to the landline are buried nearly six feet deep and run through metal pipes. The phone and electrical wiring runs through the house in titanium tubing, and it\u2019s almost impossible to open the access panels without the proper key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Sipping her coffee, she turned back to him. \u201cAll the comforts of home, huh?\u201d She grinned.</p><p>\u201cJust about,\u201d he agreed as he bit into a sausage link.</p><p>\u201cSo, which ultrabillionaire does it belong to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe government.\u201d He finished his coffee before placing the cup on the table. \u201cAre you ready for that walk now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered, staring back at him with a sense of nervous awareness. \u201cAre we taking a walk to avoid the questions I\u2019m going to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo answer your questions, Eve,\u201d he promised her softly. \u201cWhatever you want to ask. As soon as I tell you a few things, then you can ask all the questions you like.\u201d</p><p>Rising from the table, he held his hand out to her, his expression closed and guarded. \u201cWalk with me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Placing her hand in his, Eve let him draw her to her feet and lead her through the open kitchen and living area to the wide patio she\u2019d sat on the night before. Opening the glass patio doors, Brogan stood aside, allowing her to step into the cool mountain air before he closed the doors behind them. Eve couldn\u2019t help but feel she should have stayed where she was.</p><p>She should have waited.</p><p>She should have begged him to make love to her one more time before she learned something that could destroy every possibility of her staying with him.</p><p>She should have never gotten out of the bed at the sound of the boat motor and taken a chance on seeing the men who had arrived. If she hadn\u2019t, she would have never known he was hiding anything. And that, she thought, was her biggest mistake.</p><p>Getting out of the bed.</p><p>If she had just stayed, then when he returned to the bedroom she would have done as she had been fantasizing. She would have tempted him to lie down with her again, perhaps convinced him to allow her the exploration of his body before he took her again.</p><p>But no, Eve had to be nosy.</p><p>She had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to like the consequences of that nosiness now.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Stepping from the cool interior of the luxurious house to the heated summer warmth of the sun was a comforting feeling. This was the part of Kentucky that Eve loved so much: the heat overhead, the cool, sheltered shadows of the surrounding trees, and the lush vibrancy of the mountains.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so pretty here,\u201d she said as he led her along a decorative gravel path that wound through the trees. \u201cAnd peaceful.\u201d</p><p>He settled his palm against the small of her back as they followed the path, and Eve swore she could feel a sense of hesitancy filling him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very peaceful when the parties get started up here.\u201d He sighed. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s been a veritable den of iniquity for days at a time.\u201d</p><p>He was giving her the perfect opportunity to delve into the questions she\u2019d claimed to want to ask.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell it\u2019s been anything but this peaceful,\u201d she commented as they continued along the path. \u201cI remember when we first came to Somerset. Timothy flew us in and pretty much surprised Dawg with our existence. But I remember the drive to the house Timothy was living in at the time. The mountains were so beautiful and so green. After spending most of our lives in northern Texas, it was like an alien world.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of him glancing down at her thoughtfully. She rarely talked about their arrival in Kentucky. The years in Texas hadn\u2019t always been pleasant, and remembering them was something she rarely enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cHow did Dawg react to meeting four sisters and their mother? Hell, Mercedes is younger than he is, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he questioned her curiously.</p><p>Eve nodded as she pushed her hands into the hidden pockets at the side of the skirt. \u201cHe\u2019s older by several years. The day we arrived at the marina, Momma was sick. Timothy was trying to explain to Dawg who we were when Zoey rushed in accusing him of not wanting us.\u201d She grinned at the memory. \u201cThe rest of us were in the truck with Momma, but I remember seeing his face when he came out to where we were. He looked completely stricken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d Brogan gave a surprised laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no way in hell he could deny he\u2019s related to Zoey. Look at her and you\u2019re looking at the image of his daughter in a few more years.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the image of each other now.\u201d Eve laughed lightly. \u201cChrista thinks it\u2019s a hoot when people mistake Zoey for Laken\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did Dawg react to Zoey?\u201d he asked her, his tone husky with amusement.</p><p>\u201cZoey swears he looked like he was going to cry. She says his hands were shaking. But as soon as she mentioned Momma was sick again, Timothy rushed outside to the truck where we were waiting. After that, it was like Dawg had always been there watching over us.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced up at Brogan, seeing the understanding in his eyes. \u201cHe made sure Momma got the tests and medication she needed. He moved us in with him and Christa while Momma was in the hospital. When he learned Momma had always wanted her own bed-and-breakfast inn, he had one waiting for her when she came out of the hospital. He\u2019d completely remodeled it and had everything perfect for her. He told her he didn\u2019t have just four sisters; he had five. And he had to take care of her, too.\u201d</p><p>Rounding a bend in the path, Eve came to a surprised stop, delight racing through her at the sight of the small trickling stream flowing past a nearly hidden grotto.</p><p>Beneath the canopy of wisteria and honeysuckle was a wide padded bench almost half the size of a bed.</p><p>\u201cCan we go in?\u201d she asked, the urge to stretch out on the padded bench nearly overwhelming.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Catching her hand, he held it with his own as he led her beneath the wide opening.</p> <p>Releasing her to explore, Brogan leaned against the heavy support post as she sat on the padded stone bench before stretching out on it and staring up at the fragrant, colorful clusters of flowers hanging above her from amid the leafy green.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful,\u201d she said wistfully, wishing she could hold back time just a little longer. That she could still the questions raging inside her.</p><p>Turning her head, she stared back at him. His gaze met and locked with hers, regret flickering in the blue-gray depths. Did he wish time could be held back as well? That they could have just a few more hours before reality had to be dealt with?</p><p>Sitting up slowly and tucking her legs to the side, she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to lie to me?\u201d she asked, somehow knowing she would sense it if he did.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he promised. \u201cI may not be able to answer some questions, but I won\u2019t lie.\u201d</p> <p>Eve looked away. She gazed down at her lap and watched her fingers for long moments as they twisted together. When she lifted her gaze to his once again, it was to see the regret he made no effort to hide now.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait so long?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cAnd why now?\u201d She had flirted with him since she had first met him the day he arrived in Somerset two and a half years before.</p><p>\u201cI waited because I didn\u2019t believe it was fair to drag you into my world,\u201d he explained, his voice heavy as he crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy now? Because I couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, Eve. I\u2019ve wanted you since that first day, and waiting simply wasn\u2019t any option any longer.\u201d</p><p>His answer only made her next question harder. Twisting her fingers together in her lap, she watched his eyes as she asked, \u201cHow do you know Chatham Doogan, and why did you show up at the restaurant last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, we couldn\u2019t start with the easy questions first, could we?\u201d He grimaced before his eyes narrowed on her. \u201cI\u2019m going to be honest with you, Eve, but I\u2019m telling you now: No one\u2014not your brother, your sisters, or your mother\u2014can know about this. It goes no further, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t go any further,\u201d she promised. She knew his answers weren\u2019t going to be easy to hear, though.</p><p>\u201cChatham Bromleah Doogan the third.\u201d He gave a short, bitter laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s my boss, sort of. He\u2019s the operations director for the regional office of the Federal Protective Service. It\u2019s a division of Homeland Security that deals with the protection and security of federal buildings, employees, assets, and possessions. And if you tell anyone what I\u2019m telling you today, then Doogan is going to jump on it like a dog on a bone and drag your brother and cousins into something I don\u2019t think they want to be a part of.\u201d</p><p>Eve stared back at him, expecting him to declare, \u201cApril Fools\u2019,\u201d despite the fact that it was already June. If not that, then, \u201cpsych,\u201d or, \u201cjoke,\u201d or some declaration to indicate that he certainly wasn\u2019t serious. But the longer she stared at him, the more she knew it wasn\u2019t coming. The more sense it made.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a traitor then?\u201d she finally asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been stealing government files left and right or attempting to weaken the pillars of society?\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile pulled at his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the pillars of society, but sorry, baby, the thieving is pretty much true. For the past two and a half years I\u2019ve been a thieving son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were shaking. As Eve stared at her hands in her lap she realized they were trembling like leaves in a storm.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, keeping her gaze on her hands, wondering whether she could will them to be still.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the investigation FPS is conducting to catch the thieves actually stealing government files from independent analysts who were contracted to study them,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Okay, so he was pretending to be a thieving son of a bitch, she thought as her gaze lifted to him again. That was the easy part. There was much more than this going on; Chatham\u2019s presence at the boat dock proved that.</p><p>\u201cBefore you ask this next question be damned sure you want the answer,\u201d he warned her as her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I\u2019m going to ask?\u201d Her voice was faint, cautious.</p><p>She could feel things she didn\u2019t understand. Feelings and suspicions she wasn\u2019t certain were hers.</p><p>\u201cThe hell if I know, but I can tell,\u201d he growled in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d No. She really didn\u2019t want to know. She needed to know, but she didn\u2019t want to. The truth truly could hurt.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s jaw clenched savagely. \u201cYou want to know why Doogan asked you to dinner and why I came back and dragged you out of there. That\u2019s what you\u2019re ready to ask.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t exactly ready, but . . .</p><p>She stared at him in shock before turning away for long moments. How had he known? The same way she knew he didn\u2019t want to tell her? The way she knew he\u2019d never intended for her to ever have the opportunity to ask even the questions she was asking?</p><p>She turned back to him and nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cDoogan asked you to dinner to force me to do exactly what I did,\u201d he revealed. \u201cDonny heard him invite you to dinner, heard the location and your answer. The bastard let me get three hours out of town before he was good enough to tell me. And I came back for you, by God, because you\u2019re mine! And that\u2019s besides the fact that I\u2019ve never fucking cared for Doogan\u2019s poaching tendencies. Coming back for you was a hell of a lot easier than trying to get out of a murder charge.\u201d</p><p>Eve could feel her insides shaking now as well. She was trembling from the inside out, shaking with the desperate need to deny what he was telling her.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense, Brogan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow could I be of any use to Homeland Security or to Chatham?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much you as your brother and cousins. Doogan wants the Mackays to solve this for him, without his asking. If he has to ask and they solve it, then he owes them major. They solve it because you\u2019re possibly in danger or your lover endangers you, then it\u2019s just a freebie and he doesn\u2019t owe them a damned thing.\u201d</p><p>There had to be more, though. She could feel it, sense he was holding back. But if she didn\u2019t ask the right question, then he wouldn\u2019t tell her. But she knew it wasn\u2019t just a case of pulling her brother and cousins into some conniving bastard\u2019s operation.</p><p>Staring back at him, she whispered, \u201cIs everyone in Homeland Security manipulating bastards with nothing better to do than scheme and interfere in innocent people\u2019s lives?\u201d</p><p>Brogan shook his head. \u201cTimothy and Doogan are freaks of nature best avoided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Chatham Doogan asked me out knowing you would return once you found out about it and then make me your lover?\u201d she asked dubiously. \u201cHow could he be so certain it would work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a freak of nature,\u201d he repeated. \u201cMen like that can calculate the odds and then find ways to turn the situation to their favor. That\u2019s what Doogan is best at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of this just so Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches would help solve a case for him?\u201d</p><p>Brogan nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow are they supposed to accomplish something you\u2019ve not yet managed?\u201d she bit out, her fingers forming fists as offended anger began to surge through her senses.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s lips tilted in a smile, more rueful than mocking. \u201cThey know this county and the people in it,\u201d he told her. \u201cEven more, they know which rocks to turn over and the heads to knock together to get the answers they need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think they haven\u2019t gotten tired of waiting and are doing it anyway?\u201d she asked in disbelief. \u201cBrogan, this is their home, and they wouldn\u2019t let this go on without helping if they knew about it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his arms dropping from his chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, Eve, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said acerbically. \u201cThere\u2019s doing what\u2019s required because the director of operations of the Federal Protective Service threatened to imprison you if you stuck your nose in another agency operation. Then there\u2019s active determination to finish the job before something happens to the baby sister you swore you would protect. The first kind of man steps in only when asked to. The second doesn\u2019t wait to be asked.\u201d</p><p>And Dawg wouldn\u2019t wait to be asked if he thought Eve, Piper, Lyrica, or Zoey were in danger.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Dawg won\u2019t figure it out?\u201d she questioned him harshly. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Brogan, I promised him I would stay away from you. That I wouldn\u2019t take as a lover the only man he couldn\u2019t bear to see me with. Trust me; Dawg will question me. He\u2019ll want to know why I broke my promise when I\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d</p><p>What had she done to betray her brother?</p><p>Disbelief crashed through her system as the reality of it, of the fact that she had done the one thing Dawg, her brother, had asked her not to do. The only thing he had ever asked her not to do.</p><p>\u201cHe should have never made you promise to stay away from me.\u201d His brow arched, mockery gleaming in his eyes, but Eve could feel the thread of anger emanating from him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a suspected traitor, Brogan,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cLiving in the same house as a former Homeland Security special agent,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself, sweet pea. Dawg Mackay knows a traitor when he\u2019s in the presence of one. Just as he knows an agent when one\u2019s around.\u201d</p><p>Eve stared back at him, hurting, her heart aching so fiercely she reached up to rub at her chest, trying to ease the burning tightness.</p><p>He was right. Dawg would have known Brogan was no traitor, so why would he deceive her? Make her believe he suspected Brogan of being exactly that?</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because everyone else believes you\u2019re one?\u201d she questioned him, her voice rough. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s because he suspected what your boss is capable of doing.\u201d</p><p>Still, Dawg had led her to believe he, too, suspected Brogan of treason, or acting against his country. And because he had believed it, Eve had questioned her own instincts where Brogan was concerned.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Eve, when you made that promise, did you intend to keep it?\u201d The look in his eyes warned her he wasn\u2019t happy she had given in to Dawg\u2019s demand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had she intended to keep it?</p><p>Eve had never lied to herself, but she realized she had lied to her brother.</p><p>\u201cMy head did,\u201d she finally whispered. \u201cBut my heart wasn\u2019t so certain.\u201d</p><p>Staring up at him, Eve realized that even when Dawg had asked for her promise, she had known it was unfair. Just as she had known it would be impossible for her to keep.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she had every intention of returning to the lake house, gathering her things together, and leaving. There were too many emotions swirling inside her. Too many that she could sense were coming from Brogan, and too many of her own that she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Then there was the hunger.</p><p>Through the conversation, each question and answer, there had been an unspoken hunger building, growing between them: needs she didn\u2019t understand, hungers that raged and built until she was certain she wasn\u2019t sensing just her own, but his as well.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he demanded as she moved past him.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave, Brogan.\u201d Staring up at him, she felt torn, so torn she couldn\u2019t make sense of it. \u201cI need time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to think about what?\u201d he demanded, his hands catching her hips and pulling her into him. \u201cAbout us? Or about keeping a promise you should have never made to begin with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I need to think about the fact that I really don\u2019t like being controlled,\u201d she burst out. \u201cNot by my brother, your boss, or you.\u201d</p><p>She faced him, her chin lifting proudly as she tried\u2014hell, she fought\u2014to ignore the needs raging through her.</p><p>Hard and erect, his cock pressed into her stomach.</p><p>She was wet, slick, and hot, the weeping heat spilling to the bare folds of her pussy and dampening her panties.</p><p>\u201cAnd I already warned you that was something you should have already considered. It\u2019s too damned late to think you can just walk away, Eve,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cI can do whatever I want to do,\u201d she informed him defiantly.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I need to remind you why you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he stated, his tone rasping, assuring her that the thought of her leaving was one Brogan was refusing to entertain.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she cried out, the uncertainties assailing her driving home the fact that maybe she really didn\u2019t know the man she had allowed herself to sleep with the night before.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t known him, something protested inside her, but she knew him now. She could stare into his face, into his eyes, and she could see him now. She could see the man staring down at her and recognize the emotions swirling beneath the chilly surface of his gaze.</p><p>What she sensed there had her body instantly priming for sex. Her clit swelled; her pussy began heating, the slick dampness preparing her vagina for his invasion. She could feel the fierce determination swirling in the depths of his gaze reaching out to her. And being able to read him so well now was a little freaky.</p><p>\u201cI can fucking feel you.\u201d He grimaced, his blue-gray eyes darkening, flashing with frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re slapping me with your hurt feelings and uncertainty. Stop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it?\u201d Shooting him a withering look, she propped her hands on her hips in vexation. \u201cFine, Brogan, I\u2019ll stop slapping you with the fact that everyone around me seems to be using me, for some reason, and you can stop slapping me with all that arrogance and distrust I can feel rushing from you.\u201d She started to turn away before turning back to him. \u201cAnd while you\u2019re at it, stop fucking me in your mind. It was bad enough before, when all I had to worry about was changing my panties because of my own dirty thoughts, but yours are just plain depraved.\u201d Her arms crossed beneath her breasts as she stared back at him, incensed.</p> <p>His gaze became shuttered, brooding as she watched him, her heart racing with anger and excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never felt this before either, have you?\u201d That certainty was as clear as the knowledge that the arousal hardening his body was only burning hotter inside him by the minute.</p><p>\u201cFelt what?\u201d Guarded, cautious, he watched her almost impassively.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Shaking her head, she refused to allow herself to be drawn into an argument he would only find ways to refute. \u201cJust mark it down to my overactive imagination. But remember, Brogan, you\u2019re the one who told me to stop slapping you with my emotions first. I was keeping my mouth shut about it.\u201d</p><p>That was what she sensed, felt. As though a part of her had opened up to him, making her completely empathic when it came to him.</p><p>And, it seemed, him to her.</p><p>\u201cChatham Doogan spoke to me first at the bar,\u201d she gritted out between clenched teeth, determined to steer the conversation well away from what they were feeling. \u201cJohn Walker introduced him as an old friend of his and Sierra\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSierra\u2019s a distant cousin,\u201d he admitted grudgingly.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to dinner; I accepted. Why did the two of you pretend you didn\u2019t know each other at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it was the wrong place and time for explanations.\u201d His tone was clipped as the curve of his jaw tightened into unyielding lines.</p><p>Complete denial filled his expression and his gaze, but that did nothing to change what she could feel\u2014or what she could sense, perhaps.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain what it was. Staring back at him, she could feel his anger, his sudden distrust, but also his arousal. And that was building by the second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go home, Brogan. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re as damned ready to fuck as I am.\u201d Dripping with carnality, his voice roughened, lowering insinuatingly. \u201cWhat do you want, Eve? My tongue filling your tight little pussy again? My cock fucking your mouth until you can taste my release?\u201d As he spoke, his sharp, almost insulting tone became hoarse, heated.</p><p>And he was right; she wanted that and more.</p><p>Warily, she watched as he moved closer, his head tilting as he stared down at her, his gaze becoming dark, stormy as it glittered almost feverishly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you want it here,\u201d he stated provocatively. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Eve? Right here within this grotto, spread out on that bench.\u201d His head lowered, his lips brushing at her ear. \u201cYou want my tongue and my cock so deep inside your pussy that you can\u2019t bear any more. But you want more than that, don\u2019t you?\u201d he whispered then, surprise and rapacious anticipation growling in his voice. \u201cYou want it to hurt just that little bit again. You liked it, didn\u2019t you? Fuck, no.\u201d His breathing was heavy, harsh. \u201cYou loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She couldn\u2019t fight this battle. She didn\u2019t have the experience or the knowledge to combat what he was sensing.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I would love to do to you?\u201d His hand lifted, the calloused tips of his fingers running up her arm. \u201cI\u2019d love to turn you over on your stomach, prop that pretty rounded ass up to me, and spank it until it flushes cherry red. Until your pussy is so wet your thighs are damp with your cream. And when you\u2019re begging, so desperate to be fucked that nothing else matters, I want to watch my dick stretch your ass, watch as that tiny, tiny little entrance blooms around my cock and sucks it inside.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Eroticism rushed through her, weakening her knees and accelerating her breathing as he gripped her hip with his other hand while the fingers stroking her arm slid to the curve of her rear.</p><p>Cupping the rounded flesh of her rear cheeks beneath the soft chiffon of her skirt, he clenched the rounded flesh, pulling at it, igniting a tiny burst of heated sensation in her anus.</p><p>\u201cI could make that hurt so good, Eve. You won\u2019t know if it\u2019s agony or ecstasy. All you\u2019ll know is that you want more. That you have to have more.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking in his arms, trembling as his hand moved between them, obviously loosening his belt, then his jeans.</p><p>\u201cBrogan.\u201d Protest or pleasure?</p><p>She had no idea what she was feeling or how she should react. She had no idea how to handle the wicked, carnal animal Brogan was unleashing on her.</p><p>Or the one he was unleashing in her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take your ass here.\u201d Grudging regret filled his voice. \u201cUnfortunately, the lube and toys are all back at the house, baby. But I can give you part of what you want.\u201d</p><p>His jeans parted and a second later she could feel him stroking the hard, heated length of his cock as her nails curled against the shirt covering his wide chest.</p><p>\u201cWhy . . . why are you doing this . . . ?\u201d Why was he using his ability to sense only her sexual needs and not the rest of her? The sexuality, the hunger for him, was rooted in something much deeper than lust.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m just as hungry to do it as you are to have it done,\u201d he admitted, his tone ragged. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to do it, Eve. Just like you\u2019re going to suck my dick, right here. Right now.\u201d</p><p>His gaze was narrowed as her gaze jerked to his in sudden nervous awareness.</p><p>\u201cGo to your knees,\u201d he demanded, though his tone gentled at the last second. \u201cShow me how badly you want to come for me, sweetheart. Show me how badly you want me to come in your hot little mouth.\u201d</p><p>Sensation erupted in her womb, spasming through it as his gaze suddenly gleamed with avid hunger and awareness.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees.\u201d The erotic command sent wanton excitement exploding through her senses.</p><p>Slowly, her gaze held by his, she went to her knees.</p><p>His fingers slid into her hair, clenching it and holding her in place as he gripped the base of his cock and rubbed it against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI love watching my dick slide between your lips,\u201d he confessed, his voice thick and rough. \u201cWatching you suck it in as that hot little tongue licks over it. Suck it in, Eve. Show me how much you want it.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, her tongue curling over the engorged crest as he pressed inside, filling her mouth with the throbbing heat of his cock head.</p><p>She wrapped the fingers of both hands around the thick shaft as she began to milk it slowly, her mouth tightening on the crest, sucking it deep as it filled the damp interior.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s hands clenched in her hair, his hips suddenly tense, the need to thrust inside her mouth filling him.</p><p>Fuck. How had this happened? He\u2019d been certain he\u2019d never convince his sexually inexperienced little Eve to become so brazen and wanton.</p><p>Eyes closed, her face flushed and absorbed in the complete sexuality overtaking her, Brogan watched as her lips stretched to take the broad crest.</p><p>Her mouth suckled at the iron-hard flared head; she milked it with her mouth and hands as each draw sent brutal lashes of pleasure striking at his balls, surrounding his dick. Her delicate hands moved on the wide shaft, masturbating it in rhythm to the hungry draws of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSweet Eve.\u201d He groaned, his body taut with the sweeping pleasure. \u201cThat hot little mouth makes me crazy.\u201d His hips moved, thrusting shallowly against her stretched lips. \u201cYour fucking mouth is so damned good. Watching my dick take your mouth is so damned hot.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened, her mouth drawing on the fiercely erect cock head. Her tongue lashed beneath the flared head, rubbing at the highly sensitive, nerve-laden area just beneath the crest.</p><p>Exquisite pleasure tightened around the taut sac of his balls. Clenched tight beneath the base of his cock, his testicles throbbed, ached for release. He watched her lips surrounding the throbbing crest as he fucked in, pulling free, the glistening moisture followed by the lash of her tongue around the crest.</p><p>His fingers held her hair, keeping her head firmly in place as he pressed deeper.</p><p>\u201cTake it, baby,\u201d he crooned, encouraging her hunger. \u201cJust relax. Breathe out and swallow.\u201d</p><p>His cock slid to the back of her mouth, and the feel of her swallowing against the tip sent jagged forks of sensation rushing straight to his balls.</p><p>Brogan knew he wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. Hell, he didn\u2019t want to last much longer. He wanted to watch her face, see her take his release as he filled her mouth with it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His thrusts increased, a ragged groan escaping his chest as he swore he could feel something more. He swore he could feel wild hunger, fierce pleasure, and a tempting adventurousness that he knew had to belong to her.</p><p>He could sense her pleasure.</p><p>He could sense her hunger.</p><p>His cock slid faster inside her gripping mouth, sinking to the depths of it, feeling her moan ripple against the sensitive head. Each sensation, each strike of pleasure that began in the flared, responsive crest echoed stronger, hotter in his balls. Her hands stroked and milked the shaft; her tongue licked and lashed; her mouth sucked and tightened around it. Pleasure whipped through the hardened flesh, coalesced in his steadily tightening testicles before it exploded through his system.</p><p>\u201cSuck it. Fuck. Suck it deep, baby.\u201d He surged to the back of her mouth as his head tilted back in furious rapture. Brogan felt the ecstasy explode in his balls before it rushed in furious release to the broad head of his cock.</p><p>Throbbing, expanding in rapture, Brogan felt the first heavy gush of his semen spurting into her mouth as she struggled to take it.</p><p>Each subsequent explosive eruption drew a ragged groan from his throat. With each pulse of semen blasting to her throat, she swallowed, sending spikes of ragged pleasure shooting through his system.</p><p>Each spurt of his release jetting into her mouth, Brogan realized he felt more than he had ever felt before at the point of orgasm. He could feel his own release, feel it tearing through him, weakening his knees and draining his balls. But he felt hunger. A wild, tempestuous hunger that blazed with a heat that he knew could belong only to Eve.</p><p>A heat he had a feeling would turn into a conflagration and burn them both to cinders.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Eve was shaking, arousal and pure white-hot need flooding her bloodstream and pounding through her veins. As she stood before him, her knees shaking and weak, her senses dazed from the excitement surging through her system, she watched as Brogan toed off his sneakers, then slipped his jeans from his powerful legs.</p><p>He was still wearing the white, luxuriously soft cotton shirt buttoned to his chest. Those buttons were falling open beneath his fingers, though, revealing his powerful chest with its mat of red-gold curls and the almost invisible freckles she\u2019d glimpsed the night before as the candlelight had gleamed off the powerful muscles.</p><p>He was so incredibly tall and strong. It was one of the first things Eve had noticed about him: that strength and easy power that he wore so effortlessly.</p><p>Moving to her, his hands framed her face, and though she hadn\u2019t expected it, she watched in surprise as his head lowered to cover her lips with his.</p><p>The kiss was deep, searing, and intimate.</p><p>His tongue brushed over her lips, then over her tongue. He sipped at her lips, kissed them, drew her deeper into the twisting storm of sensation rushing through her.</p><p>\u201cGod, how pretty you are,\u201d he whispered, reaching out to touch her. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the padded bench and his hand wrapped around the back of her neck. He pulled her to him. This time the feel of his lips moving over hers dragged a cry from her. The sound was so ragged it startled her, so filled with hunger it was shocking, even to her.</p><p>Running his hands down her back to her thighs, Brogan pressed her legs apart before he moved one to make her straddle him before pulling her closer to him.</p><p>She found herself straddling his lap, her rear resting on his knees as he kissed her with pure carnal demand. His hands gripped her rear, slowly pulling the curves apart until Eve felt the tingles of heat as the nerve endings in her puckered rear entrance revealed themselves.</p><p>Was she insane to have pushed him as she had? To have revealed how much she had enjoyed the pleasure-pain sensations he had given her the night before? But how could she have hidden the knowledge of it from him when she responded so readily to the more intense pleasure?</p><p>Whatever had happened the night before to bind them together hadn\u2019t been the aberration she had thought it to be. It was still there, and she wasn\u2019t the only one feeling it.</p> <p>As he urged her closer she knew where he wanted her, knew he wanted her as he helped her remove the cami and her bra.</p><p>Easing his lips from hers, he kissed the line of her jaw, moving lower, drawing a cry from her as pleasure began washing through her.</p><p>Kissing his way from her lips to her neck, he laid more of the stinging kisses to the base of her neck, where he paused, caressing the skin there with a sharp, fiery kiss that dragged a startled moan from her lips.</p><p>Then one hand moved from her rear, slid beneath her breast, and lifted it, and he surrounded the small, pebbled tip with the heat of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cBrogan,\u201d she cried out, her arms wrapping around his neck as she arched against him. \u201cOh, yes, please.\u201d</p><p>As he suckled at her nipple, his hand moved back to her rear, pressing beneath the fragile material of her skirt to find the naked flesh revealed by her thong panties.</p><p>The hardened width of his cock was pressed between them, the heated stalk grinding against her clit as her hips moved, rubbing the tortured bud against the fierce heat of the iron-hard flesh.</p><p>As she did she felt the hidden zipper at the side of her skirt release, easing down before Brogan pushed the material down her hips and let it puddle on the ground.</p><p>She was all but naked in his arms now. The cool mountain air touched her body, stroking it as the breeze drifted over it.</p><p>His hands moved to her rear again, caressing and cupping the curves as his lips moved to her other nipple. He sucked it inside as well, laving the tip with his tongue and sending starbursts of pleasure exploding in her womb.</p><p>One of his hands lifted, though she wasn\u2019t certain what he was doing, because he didn\u2019t move it to caress any other part of her body.</p><p>Then it landed against the rounded curve of her rear in a firm, heated little tap of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d Eve jerked in his hold, the muscles of her rear clenching, a shudder working through her body at the sensations flooding her system now.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a hard blow. There was nothing painful about it, just a little startling.</p><p>Then another landed.</p><p>His lips drew on her nipples, first one, then the other. His teeth rasped against them, tugging at the taut tips as she arched in his hold. Her nails bit into his shoulders now, her head tipping back, her hair flowing around her and caressing her naked skin.</p><p>The tap came again, this one just a little firmer, just a little heated against flesh that had already grown warm from the taps before it. With each heated caress a flame began to lick beneath her flesh and spread outward.</p><p>With each firm, quick little tap to each cheek of her ass, Eve felt the heat blooming in her rear spread to her clit, to the delicate muscles and tissue in the clenched emptiness of her pussy.</p><p>Sensations as shocking as they were arousing began to consume her, drawing muted, muffled little cries from her lips that she fought to contain.</p><p>The next tap was followed by his fingers slipping between her thighs, gathering the slick, heated moisture flowing from her vagina. Drawing her juices back from her pussy, he used the tip of a finger on the other hand to rub against the clenched entrance of her anus.</p><p>Another solid tap to her rear heated the flesh more, the sensation a stinging pleasure she was beginning to crave. She couldn\u2019t get enough. It wasn\u2019t burning enough. It wasn\u2019t firm enough.</p><p>His fingers slipped between her thighs again, drawing even more of the slick heat from her pussy and easing it to her anus. As his hand delivered another hot little tap, a fingertip rubbed more firmly against her back entrance.</p><p>No more than two taps later he was able to use the same hand to gather the moisture outside her pussy to lubricate her anus further. His fingertip pressed against the little hole, pushing the slick moisture just inside the snug entrance.</p><p>The next little slap had his fingertip pressing further inside as she ground her clit against the stalk of his cock. The hard shaft pressed against her pussy, the iron-hard, iron-hot flesh torturing her with the awareness of how desperately she needed to be fucked.</p><p>With the next little blow to her rear cheek, Brogan gathered more of her juices as they spilled to his fingers, lubricated her anus further.</p><p>\u201cPush against my finger with your muscles here,\u201d he ordered her roughly as he began rubbing the little hole. \u201cOpen for me, baby; I\u2019ll do the rest.\u201d</p><p>His hand landed again; more of her juices were used to slick the little hole further; then, as his fingertip pressed against it, Eve fought to relax the muscles he caressed, pushing against the pressure.</p><p>His finger slipped inside.</p><p>Instantly the little hole clamped shut, shocking electrical flares of heat suddenly erupting in the nerve endings being stretched around the digit. He\u2019d already penetrated the tight entrance, though. Her body\u2019s instinct to clench around the intruder and then to try to push it out only aided in allowing his heavily lubricated finger to push farther inside.</p><p>His hand delivered another firm, heated pat, the gentle slaps driving her crazy with the burning heat flaring beneath her flesh. Between the cheeks of her ass his finger moved inside her, stretching the tight entrance around it and burying inside her again.</p><p>Pulling free, he dragged more of the juices collecting outside her pussy back to the tender entrance, pressed two fingertips against it, and began working them inside the tender channel.</p><p>Rising and falling against him, Eve worked her hips against the broad heat of his cock, her clit on fire. Her pussy clenched and wept the slick lubrication he was using to penetrate her rear; she was desperate to be filled by the throbbing shaft pulsing between them.</p><p>The two fingers penetrated her again, sliding inside her in one smooth thrust as Eve cried out, stilling against him as shudders raced through her body.</p><p>\u201cLift,\u201d he ordered harshly.</p><p>She lifted against him, her knees braced on the padded edge of the bench as he used his free hand to maneuver his cock between them.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d The sexual roughness of his voice had her fighting to breathe as she lifted further.</p><p>The flared crest of his cock pressed against the entrance to her vagina then, stretching it as another little slap landed on her rear and his fingers thrust inside her ass again.</p><p>The penetration, the pressure against her pussy had her bearing down, feeling the thick crest penetrate her muscles with a suddenness that had her head falling against his shoulder and a cry tearing from her throat.</p><p>\u201cBrogan.\u201d She sobbed, the demands her body was putting on her both confusing and frightening. \u201cFuck me now. Please. I can\u2019t stand this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little more, baby.\u201d He groaned, his fingers pulling back, working more of the natural lubrication inside her before penetrating her again. \u201cJust a little more.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait just a little more.</p><p>His hand fell against her rear again and Eve lost her mind amid the shattering sensations tearing through her body.</p><p>The fact that he wasn\u2019t wearing a condom registered only in the most distant part of her mind. The fact that his cock was inside her, working too slowly past the clenched muscles, wasn\u2019t lost on her.</p><p>Lifting against him, feeling the flared crest of his cock throbbing inside her, Eve lowered herself against the impalement, forcing him deeper, harder.</p><p>His fingers pushed deeper into her rear, driving her to work her hips harder, to take more of him. His hand landed against her ass again in a firm little tap, almost a little slap, and sent a flare of such wicked heat racing through her system that nothing mattered but her desperation to reach her orgasm.</p><p>The dual penetrations were building a pleasure so hot, so wild inside her that Eve couldn\u2019t bear the rising tension whipping through her. Her thighs clenched his, straddling them as she rode the fierce length of his cock with desperate movements.</p><p>She rose and fell, the heavy width stretching her pussy, stroking inside her as Brogan fucked her rear with his fingers and had her panting for air, fighting to scream out his name but unable to find the breath to do more than gasp.</p><p>Perspiration gathered on her body as the heat inside her begged for relief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brogan released the nipple he\u2019d held in his mouth, his arm wrapped around her back as the fingers of the other hand thrust in an increased rhythm into the tender rear entrance and his hips began moving, driving his cock harder inside her, faster.</p><p>The heat of the morning gathered around them; the heat burning in their bodies began to flare and flame with sensation, burning their senses. Eve felt the conflagration as it happened as though in slow motion: The rake of her clitoris against his flesh as he drove inside her. The brutal pleasure that seared delicate nerve endings revealed by the thick width of his cock stretching her with burning pleasure. His fingers stroking inside her anus, stimulating nerve endings that responded with a strident clamoring for more.</p><p>Each sensation tightened, flamed, then erupted into an orgasm that shook her to her core.</p> <p>It imploded inside her before exploding outward, sending her juices gushing against the rapidly thrusting movement of his cock and the sudden, heavy spurts of his release spilling inside her.</p><p>Her eyes opened wide in shock, met his, and that feeling of being a part of him was there again. As though time stopped and stilled for precious moments. As though nothing existed but the sensation of hurtling through space, locked in an ecstasy that neither of them could escape, and both of them shared\u2014merging, melding, ecstasy that sealed them together for an impossible moment in time before hurtling them from an edge of such rapture that nothing else mattered.</p><p>Eve collapsed against him, only barely aware of the moment he fell backward on the bench, cushioned by the pad beneath them as Eve\u2019s body was cushioned by his.</p><p>One arm locked around her, ensuring that she stayed in place, as they both fought to catch their breath.</p><p>Their hearts raced; their breathing was ragged, frantic.</p> <p>Nothing existed outside the place they\u2019d found for this one fragile moment. There was no danger; there was no anger or pain, confusion or impending heartache. There was nothing but the two of them, the pleasure that had bound them, and the certainty that, like an addiction, the need to touch, to taste, to hold each other again would be one for which denial would not be an option.</p><p>Finding the strength to pull themselves from the bench and dress took a while. As Eve pulled the thin silken camisole shell over her head and adjusted the thin straps over her shoulders, she looked up at Brogan.</p><p>Securing the dark leather of the belt at his hips, he hadn\u2019t yet straightened his hair. The coarse, red-gold strands had fallen over his forehead and now lay disheveled around his head.</p><p>Scratching at his chest, he leaned down, snagged his shirt from the rug that lay over the stones, and pulled it over his arms. As he began securing the buttons, his gaze lifted as though drawn by the thought that suddenly seared her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked absently, snagging his sneakers and untying them before propping himself against the heavy support column and pulling them over his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t use a condom,\u201d she stated, watching him closely.</p> <p>He paused for a moment before resuming with his shoes. Pulling the other one on, he tied them quickly before straightening and staring back at her.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d he admitted\u2014a little too calmly to suit her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pull out either.\u201d</p><p>His fingers raked through his hair, pushing it back, if not neatly, then at least into some kind of order.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he admitted again.</p><p>She stared back at him, feeling a sudden disquiet begin to settle around her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cBecause whatever\u2019s going to happen began last night. The condom split, and before I could think to pull free, I was already spilling inside you. This morning isn\u2019t going to make a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me this morning,\u201d she stated, wondering why.</p> <p>His jaw clenched brutally, a sudden feeling that he was pushing back something angry and bitter filling her senses.</p><p>\u201cI was waiting to make certain it would be too late to use the morning-after pill,\u201d he finally snapped, his eyes turning a dark gray as he glared back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in it, Eve.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, frowning heavily.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe he had just said that. She couldn\u2019t believe he would even suspect she would do something so horrible. That she would abort her baby, just get rid of it as though it were trash. Damn, he sure did have a hell of an opinion of her, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>What hurt more, though, was the fact that he seemed to think it was okay to make that decision for her. That he thought she would be so easy to control and to maneuver.</p><p>He may not have lied to her, but what he had done was by far much worse: He had tried to take her free will, her right to a choice away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he growled.</p><p>She rose from the bench, smoothed her skirt, then stared back at him painfully. \u201cAt what point, Brogan, did you begin to believe that you were entitled to make any decisions for me? Let alone one so important?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t he know her any better than that?</p><p>There had been a few moments over the years when she had sworn she had known what he was going to do or say, or what his opinion would be even before he voiced it. Yet after all this time, he believed he needed to hide something so important from her rather than trusting her?</p><p>\u201cWhen the decision involves me or mine, then I have some say in it,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She laughed, a mirthless, angry sound that she didn\u2019t bother to hide.</p><p>\u201cNo, Brogan, you only have the right to discuss it, and you just made damned certain you no longer have even that right.\u201d</p><p>She moved from the grotto, aware of him following behind her, silent, a dark shadow keeping pace with her as she moved quickly back to the house.</p><p>Stepping inside the glass doors and hurrying through the living room, she suddenly came to a hard, surprised stop. Behind her, she heard Brogan curse, and she would have seconded the explicit word if it weren\u2019t for the fact that she knew it was a word her brother was attempting to erase from his vocabulary.</p><p>And there he stood, along with Rowdy and Natches, all three men staring at Brogan with an animosity that would be impossible to miss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain you were told that I was fine, Dawg.\u201d She crossed her arms over her breasts and glared back at the three men.</p><p>\u201cI was told,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysically,\u201d he offered, \u201cI believed you were fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I ask why you\u2019re here? Tell me, have you decided to take it upon yourself to make some decisions for me that have absolutely nothing to do with you, as well?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cTold you so,\u201d Rowdy muttered aside to Dawg as he lifted his hand and covered his mouth.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Rowdy,\u201d Dawg ordered, his gaze still locked with hers.</p><p>\u201cI told you so, too,\u201d Natches offered.</p><p>Dawg didn\u2019t bother to give the same order to his younger cousin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell the four of you what.\u201d She included Brogan in the offer. \u201cYou can stay here and beat one another to a bruised pulp, scream, yell, curse, or whatever, and I\u2019ll just get my things and roll.\u201d She looked over at Natches. \u201cYou were smart enough to drive yourself, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he answered warily as he hooked his thumbs in the belt cinching his lean hips. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cI want your ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, now, come on, Eve.\u201d He frowned, protesting the order as he glanced at the other three. \u201cI don\u2019t like their company.\u201d He hooked a thumb over his shoulder to indicate Dawg and Rowdy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, Eve,\u201d Brogan stated behind her.</p><p>She turned slowly, drew in a hard, deep breath, and met the anger burning in his gaze. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cI won\u2019t be manipulated, ordered, or deceived, Brogan. If you learned anything about me in the past two and a half years, then you know that.\u201d</p><p>Fury burned in his eyes, but his lips thinned as he only continued to glare at her.</p><p>Turning to her brother once again, she stared at him until his gaze flickered. No one, but no one could make Dawg flinch when he believed he was completely in the right.</p><p>\u201cThis is none of your business,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m not six; nor am I sixteen. I\u2019m a grown woman and I can make a grown woman\u2019s decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d His arms went across his chest as his brows lowered broodingly. \u201cEven if he\u2019s a damned criminal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m wrong about the fact that everything inside me tells me he\u2019s not a criminal,\u201d she amended, \u201cI can\u2019t live my life by your instincts and your rules, Dawg. I have to live by my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made me a promise, Eve,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI thought you understood the stakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to disown me, Dawg?\u201d she asked curiously. \u201cYou once said we\u2019d get along fine as long as I didn\u2019t betray family, country, or myself. I haven\u2019t betrayed any of the three. But you skirted the line when you manipulated a promise from me that you knew I\u2019d never be able to keep.\u201d</p><p>Rowdy and Natches both turned a look of disgust on their cousin.</p><p>\u201cMan, you know Christa\u2019s gonna find out,\u201d Natches warned him.</p><p>\u201cNot if you keep your fat mouth shut,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Natches frowned and turned to Eve. \u201cIs my mouth fat?\u201d He was suddenly fingering his lips as though worried before turning on Dawg. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a fat lip in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Dawg snorted. \u201cYeah, and go home all bruised to Chaya? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Natches grinned. \u201cI won\u2019t get in near as much trouble as you will.\u201d</p><p>Eve shook her head. \u201cYou three just work that out on your own.\u201d She turned her attention to Natches. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last time I play cards with you,\u201d he threatened her, clearly annoyed that the promise he owed her from the poker game months before had resulted in losing his ride for the day.</p><p>\u201cYou said anytime, anywhere,\u201d she reminded him with a shrug as he tossed her the keys.</p><p>\u201cEve.\u201d Brogan moved in front of her. \u201cWe need to discuss this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, steely determination and offended pride clawing at her emotions. \u201cNo, Brogan, we don\u2019t,\u201d she told him softly, distancing herself from the frustration and the edge of desperation she felt emanating from him. \u201cNot now. Not until you decide that controlling me may not be as important as you seem to think it is.\u201d She turned to Dawg then. \u201cYou knew he wasn\u2019t a traitor. Hell, your instincts are better than mine. You all but lied to me, Dawg. And I would have sworn that was something you would have never done to me. You knew all along he was an agent, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Facing him, seeing the brooding guilt in his gaze, she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that he had been aware of what he was doing when he did it.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop them. She couldn\u2019t stop the sudden, brutal sense of betrayal as it exploded inside her any more than she could have stopped the sun from rising that morning.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d Her voice cracked with the tears suddenly filling her eyes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that to you, Dawg. I wouldn\u2019t have lied to you about Christa to keep you away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell.\u201d It was Natches who emitted the low exclamation as he and Rowdy both turned on Dawg.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to hurt you,\u201d Dawg stated, so certain of it, so determined he was right that pure arrogant stubbornness filled his face.</p><p>\u201cSo what if he does.\u201d A tear slipped free as she suddenly realized just how much she and her sisters, even her mother, had allowed Dawg to shelter them. \u201cCan\u2019t I live, Dawg? Do I have to have your permission?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned at the question. \u201cNo . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently I do,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou made me swear I wouldn\u2019t take him as a lover by telling me he was the only man you couldn\u2019t abide my being with. That you believed he was a traitor.\u201d Her breathing hitched as astonishment filled the cousins\u2019 expressions as they turned to Dawg.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no proof that says he\u2019s not a traitor,\u201d Dawg accused Brogan, his fingers clenching at his sides as his expression turned wrathful and centered on the other man.</p> <p>Eve shook her head as a sob escaped her. \u201cMomma once told me that even good men had the power to be bad,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t believe that of you, Dawg. I really didn\u2019t. I believed there was nothing bad or deceitful in you. That all I had to do was find a man like you and I\u2019d always be safe and loved.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and rubbed the back of his neck in agitation.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Eve,\u201d he cajoled gently. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t that the truth,\u201d Natches bit out.</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Natches,\u201d Dawg snarled, silencing them all in surprise as he said the hated F-word before turning back to Eve. \u201cLook, I never meant I would disown you or anything else if you broke a promise. I just meant that you know he\u2019s going to hurt you. You know it, if he hasn\u2019t already.\u201d He shot Brogan a look of promised retribution. \u201cThat\u2019s all I meant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you left me feeling like I had betrayed you. Like I was no more than a criminal myself, Dawg, because you couldn\u2019t let me follow my own instincts. You couldn\u2019t let me follow my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Eve, whatever the hell he\u2019s into could get you killed,\u201d he yelled back at her.</p><p>\u201cAnd that was just too hard to tell me at the time, wasn\u2019t it,\u201d she cried out, furious and hurt, and feeling her heart breaking in two. \u201cYou lied to me, Dawg. You may not have said the words, but you still lied.\u201d</p><p>Gripping Natches\u2019s keys in her hand, she turned to Brogan, seeing for the first time the heavy, dark emotion that filled his gaze, and feeling something hesitant, something distant shutting that door on what had been forming between them.</p><p>His eyes were that unique blue-gray. The color was no longer shifting with emotion, just as his emotions were no longer reaching out to her.</p><p>Her lips twisted bitterly as she suddenly felt so bereft, so alone without that connection she\u2019d had for such a few short hours.</p> <p>Another sob escaped before she forced the others back and quickly dashed the tears from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou should have known I would have never done something so vile,\u201d she whispered for his ears only. \u201cI believed in you, Brogan.\u201d She shook her head bitterly, painfully. \u201cI believed in you.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from him, she strode quickly to the front door, glancing back at her brother and her cousins as they stared back at Brogan with the same expression.</p><p>Disappointment.</p><p>Pushing through the front door, she ran to the car Natches had driven, surprised that he hadn\u2019t driven his truck, hit the automatic lock, and slid inside the low-slung sports car quickly.</p><p>She had to adjust her seat so she could reach the gas pedal, but once she did she pushed the start button and felt the throbbing vibration of the powerful little Mercedes before reversing and turning, then sliding the vehicle into drive and roaring away from the cabin.</p><p>She should have kept her promise to Dawg, she thought.</p><p>She should have never given in to Brogan. She should have never given in to her own needs. If she hadn\u2019t, then perhaps her heart would still be in one unbroken piece.</p> <p>FIFTEEN</p><p>Dawg shook his head as the door slammed behind his sister\u2019s livid form, his gaze locking on Brogan accusingly as the other man stared at the door with a piercing, intent look.</p><p>\u201cMan, you are one stupid fucker,\u201d he stated, pitiless. \u201cI could almost feel sorry for you, but you brought every damned bit of it on yourself, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brogan shook his head slowly, his gaze still locked on the door.</p><p>He was watching the heavy wood panel as though he actually thought Eve would walk back through the doorway at any moment.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Dawg glanced at his cousins before his gaze moved back to Brogan. \u201cNo what?\u201d He looked back to Natches and Rowdy again. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>Natches gave a brief, amused chuckle as they all watched Brogan take a step toward the door before pulling back almost immediately.</p><p>He raked his fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cKnew better,\u201d he mumbled peevishly as he left a spike of red-gold hair standing on end. \u201cFucking knew better. She\u2019s a fucking Mackay.\u201d</p><p>Dawg actually growled.</p><p>Now, that was just damned uncalled-for.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love.\u201d Natches snickered behind Dawg.</p><p>Dawg glowered back at his cousin. \u201cI already fucking knew that. Thanks for the news flash, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why get Eve to promise to stay away from him?\u201d Rowdy was the one who asked that question.</p><p>Dawg wished he\u2019d kept his damned mouth shut now.</p><p>\u201cFucking knew better. She\u2019s a Mackay,\u201d Brogan mumbled, drawing their attention back to him as he glared at the door again.</p><p>Brogan turned his gaze to the Mackays then.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fucking fault,\u201d Brogan accused Dawg. \u201cYou son of a bitch, if you had just left her the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy fault?\u201d Dawg would have shown him the business end of his fist if Rowdy hadn\u2019t grabbed his arm and pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d Brogan\u2019s lips pulled back from his teeth in a snarl. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stay the fuck out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s my sister, asshole!\u201d he bellowed back at him.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to have a talk with your wife,\u201d Brogan suggested snidely then. \u201cI have a feeling she\u2019d put a stop to your fucking meddling.\u201d</p><p>Dawg snorted, though he knew that was way too close to the truth. Behind him, Natches snickered.</p><p>\u201cI warned you last year,\u201d Dawg reminded him. \u201cDidn\u2019t I warn you, Brogan? You could step the hell out of what you were doing or you could stay away from my sister; it was your choice.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Rowdy and Natches were both staring at him now as though he were crazy, but Dawg figured Brogan would end up letting the truth slip out of his mouth anyway, so he might as well strike first.</p><p>Brogan\u2019s eyes narrowed in contempt before he turned and stalked across the house to the patio room, where he stood with his back to them, obviously staring out into the woods beyond the house.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done, Dawg?\u201d Rowdy muttered.</p><p>Dawg grimaced at the question. \u201cProtected my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder how you would react to it if Christa\u2019s brother Alex up and decided to protect his sister in the same way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him.\u201d He shrugged as though he would do just that.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t, but hell, it would be damned close.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the threat?\u201d Rowdy bit out, obviously pissed now. \u201cYou had to have had a threat to go with it.\u201d</p><p>Dawg shifted uncomfortably beneath his cousin\u2019s glare as he dropped his arms from across his chest and gave the other man a scorching look. \u201cWhat threat? What do I have to threaten him with?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Brogan turned back to them then, and Dawg wondered whether he had been unlucky enough that the other man had heard the question.</p><p>\u201cDawg, what the fuck did you do?\u201d Rowdy\u2019s no-nonsense tone had him breathing out roughly.</p><p>The threat had been a simple one. Dawg still had connections, major connections at the Department of Homeland Security and among the politicians that could make or break a man\u2019s career in law enforcement. Dawg had simply told Brogan that if he was an agent, and if he did care anything about his career, then he\u2019d understand the ramifications of Eve\u2019s heart getting broken.</p><p>His father might well be the director of Homeland Security, but that wouldn\u2019t save Brogan\u2019s place in the Federal Protective Service if Dawg wanted him out of there.</p><p>Brogan chose that moment to stalk through the house and disappeared into a room up the short hall. The bedroom, no doubt, Dawg thought.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should just tell Kelly what happened today and see if she wants to ask Christa if she knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d Rowdy suggested.</p><p>Hell, he was getting tired of this. Every time his two yahoo cousins went blabbing on him, Dawg managed to do without his wife\u2019s tender touch for far too long. At this rate, they were going to cause him to have to just start knocking heads together again instead of trying to be nice about things.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t come up here to hurt Eve or piss Brogan off,\u201d Rowdy reminded him as the door slammed behind Brogan with enough force that Dawg swore the windows rattled.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to listen to us right now,\u201d Dawg reminded him testily. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be too busy feeling sorry for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d Natches questioned behind him.</p><p>\u201cWould you two stop acting as though this is all my fault?\u201d Dawg questioned them incredulously. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou breathe, Dawg,\u201d Rowdy accused him bluntly. \u201cYou breathe. Some days that\u2019s seriously all it takes.\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door jerked open so hard it crashed against the inside wall as they turned and stared at Brogan in surprise.</p><p>He was carrying two small bags; one was obviously Eve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Dawg inquired sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWherever she went,\u201d Brogan informed them ruthlessly as he stalked to the door. \u201cStay as long as you like. There\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t show up here to watch you stalk off, asshole,\u201d Dawg called out as they followed close on his heels until he reached Timothy\u2019s pickup.</p><p>\u201cNo, you accomplished what you showed up to do,\u201d Brogan informed them, keeping his voice calm. He\u2019d caused Eve enough heartache and pain; he wouldn\u2019t compound it by sending her brother and cousins to the hospital. Not unless they forced him to it.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was that,\u201d Dawg agreed with a vein of amusement behind the words. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already aware someone tried to break into her room.\u201d Thank God for Eli and Jed. Brogan wasn\u2019t certain Doogan would have told him, if it had been left up to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was that,\u201d Dawg repeated. \u201cBut once again, not the only reason we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the fuck are you here, Dawg?\u201d he snarled back, his hand clenching on the truck door to keep from ramming his fist in the other man\u2019s face.</p><p>He\u2019d get the first strike, but he doubted he\u2019d leave unscathed. Then Eve would just be pissed as hell at him. And if he did manage to get her to let him touch her again, he\u2019d be too sore to do much.</p><p>Dawg chuckled. \u201cYou see that look on his face, Rowdy?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy grinned, his arms crossed over his chest, the smile amused and mocking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018I\u2019d love to try to kick his ass, but if I do, she\u2019s gonna be too pissed and I\u2019m gonna be too sore to love her later\u2019 look.\u201d Natches snickered knowingly. \u201cI\u2019d tell him to join the club, but he\u2019s not quite paid his dues yet; what do you think?\u201d</p><p>Rowdy shook his head. \u201cNah, not yet. We\u2019ll make him wait awhile just for being a prick about us showing up and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three of you are fucking insane.\u201d Brogan moved to step into the truck.</p><p>\u201cPull out before we\u2019re finished and I promise you, I\u2019ll make your life such hell that you\u2019ll beg me to let up on you. And I can do it, Brogan. I promise you I can do it.\u201d Arrogant assurance and self-confidence filled Dawg\u2019s expression as well as his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brogan gripped the door hard enough that he could feel his knuckles turning white as he glared back at the three men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like your endangering my sister\u2019s life, and if I could have steered her toward some nice, safe, simpleminded little farmer or accountant to ensure her safety, then I would have done it. But you\u2019re what she wants. So I\u2019m trying my damnedest to help you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made her promise to stay the hell away from me,\u201d Brogan accused him furiously. \u201cThat\u2019s not helping me, Mackay. And that was only after threatening my fucking career if I didn\u2019t stay the hell away from her.\u201d</p> <p>Rowdy and Natches turned to Dawg incredulously.</p><p>Brogan bit back a curse as he just ignored them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew damned good and well she wasn\u2019t going to keep that promise.\u201d</p><p>The acknowledgment had Brogan narrowing his gaze on the other man.</p><p>\u201cThen why do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Dawg grumbled irately. \u201cAnd I needed time to finish what I was doing to protect her before she drew any more attention to the fact that she was most likely the only weakness you had. You weren\u2019t doing anything to keep her out of your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t come to me.\u201d Mackay\u2019s arrogance and stubborn independence reminded Brogan of a crazed bull staring at a red flag.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too close to Doogan. And if you weren\u2019t, then we knew your partners definitely were,\u201d Dawg informed him, his tone hardening. \u201cUntil Doogan asks one of us for help, then he\u2019s getting nothing from me that he can use to pull me into his bullshit without a hell of a compensation package, Brogan. You know that bastard as well as I do, and you know damned good and well he\u2019d use us up, then throw us to the wolves when he was finished.\u201d</p><p>Brogan had no idea Dawg knew Doogan, let alone that he knew him so well.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Brogan growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done instead is work from where it counts,\u201d Dawg informed him. \u201cThat motorcycle touring club is bullshit. A bunch of veterans riding around sightseeing? Give me a fucking break,\u201d he jeered. \u201cI know exactly what it is, what it was started as, and what it will always be now that it\u2019s established. Just as I know there\u2019s not a chance in hell you\u2019re going to be pulled into the inner circle of that group, no matter how long they let you carry that title of \u2018leader,\u2019 without our help.\u201d</p> <p>Brogan stiffened, his gaze going between the three men as suspicion rose inside him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s going on,\u201d he demanded, suddenly certain these three men were the exact reason he\u2019d never been able to break the ice where the club was concerned.</p><p>Brogan had known there was far more to that club than he\u2019d ever been able to figure out. Just as he\u2019d known that many of the tours they\u2019d taken came far too close to the known locations of small militia groups rumored to be operating from those areas.</p><p>\u201cNot without that compensation package,\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>Brogan shook his head. \u201cFuck Doogan. He\u2019ll come to you; I promise you that. I don\u2019t need Doogan to do my job or to protect Eve any more than you need him to tell me what I need to know.\u201d</p><p>Dawg glanced at his cousins, each man meeting his gaze, communicating as only men as close as they were, who had fought together and worked together in the operations that they had been conducting in the county, as long as they had, could communicate.</p><p>Finally Dawg nodded before turning to him. \u201cYour thieves aren\u2019t in the motorcycle club, Brogan. And the files that have been stolen don\u2019t have a damned thing in them that tie them together. What they do have, though, is the ability to draw three men out of hiding who were working with Chandler and Dayle Mackay in the Freedom League. Twenty years ago, Chandler was stationed at Fort Knox when a transport hauling more than six million in gold bullion was hijacked. Rumor in the Freedom League was that the gold was hidden by one man and the location of it supposedly encoded in a set of files at Fort Knox in case something happened to him before it could be recovered and used to fund the League. Timothy managed to acquire the files and we found the gold. What we don\u2019t have are the three high-ranking military officers Chandler was working with.\u201d</p><p>Brogan stiffened in sudden outrage. \u201cYou mean I\u2019ve been busting my ass for two and a half years for nothing?\u201d</p> <p>Dawg grinned. \u201cWell, you did get Doogan here. And you obviously drew the attention of the three we\u2019re looking for. Unfortunately, now Eve\u2019s drawn their attention as well.\u201d He glared at Brogan for that. \u201cIt was suggested to Doogan that he pull us into this, because we\u2019re the only chance he has of recovering the gold or arresting the traitors involved in it. When Doogan refused to come to us, and decided to find the answers without us, then we let him. Don\u2019t doubt that you\u2019ve done your part, despite his machinations. You\u2019ve done exactly what we would have wanted you to do if we had been working together. But when Eve became involved, I had to adjust the plan a bit to ensure she was protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the bastard Donny said has the information Doogan wants and will help only if Eve was involved with me?\u201d Son of a bitch, and they called Timothy and Doogan game players?</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Dawg rubbed at the back of his neck as he grimaced in irritation before propping his hands on his waist and blowing out a hard breath. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who that was until last night, after Eve went missing from the restaurant. He came to us then.\u201d</p><p>Brogan looked between the three men, more amazed that they had been able to accomplish drawing that contact out without raising red flags with Doogan, or with him.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Brogan demanded.</p><p>Dawg shook his head. \u201cYou have enough. Get Doogan on board with the program. We want those packages. Full immunity, no matter what we have to do from here on out, no matter the investigation or the agent conducting it. Because I\u2019m telling you, we\u2019re getting damned sick of being pulled into the agency\u2019s bullshit, threatened, our families endangered, and our freedom placed on the line because the agents in charge are too damned arrogant to accept defeat, or to acknowledge that they don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing once they get in these mountains.\u201d</p><p>He was right, and the fact was that Doogan wasn\u2019t the only agent with the opinion that just because a man was from the backwoods Kentucky mountains, then he was somehow not as smart, as quick, or as capable as one born and raised in the city. Or in Doogan\u2019s case, the boardrooms and drawing rooms of the ultrarich.</p><p>Brogan shook his head. \u201cDelaying risks Eve,\u201d he protested. \u201cWrap the case up; then play games with Doogan.\u201d</p><p>Dawg shook his head in the negative, his expression as well as Rowdy\u2019s and Natches\u2019s turning grim as they watched him.</p><p>\u201cI have Eve covered, but that won\u2019t last forever,\u201d Dawg informed him, his voice tight. \u201cGet those packages in place, Brogan; then we\u2019ll finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Eve gets hurt while we\u2019re fucking around with Doogan?\u201d he snarled furiously. \u201cWhat then, Dawg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she gets hurt because our hands are fucking tied, or later one of the others is hurt because our hands were fucking tied or we didn\u2019t know they were pulling an operation beneath our noses?\u201d Natches sneered, his eyes, so like Eve\u2019s, glittering in fury. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Brogan. We\u2019ve told you enough; get it fucking taken care of; then we can finish this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Doogan doesn\u2019t cooperate? What then?\u201d Brogan questioned harshly, beginning to see exactly where this was going.</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to play ball, then you have other connections,\u201d Dawg stated knowingly. \u201cUse them.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Brogan surmised mockingly. \u201cThis is where it\u2019s been going all along. You want me to go to JD and have it taken care of.\u201d Brogan rarely called his father by anything other than \u201cJD.\u201d \u201cJohn David\u201d if he was pissed with him.</p><p>Son of a bitch, just what he needed.</p><p>\u201cI want you to do whatever it takes for me to see to my family\u2019s fucking protection. And if you care anything about Eve, then that\u2019s all you should want, too,\u201d Dawg retorted heatedly. \u201cAs long as DHS is using this county and the Mackays to do their dirty work, then we\u2019re all at risk. And that includes Eve, her sisters, and her mother. And trust me, you think she\u2019s pissed at me?\u201d he warned with dark emphasis. \u201cThen how will she feel if one of her baby sisters, or God forbid, her mother, who nearly died of a chemical infection trying to feed Eve and her sisters, or her brother and cousins who all but got on their knees and begged for your help.\u201d Dawg grinned mockingly. \u201cIf any of us end up hurt because you didn\u2019t go to daddy to ensure we were all protected, then how do you think she\u2019s going to feel?\u201d</p><p>Brogan stepped into the truck, slammed the door, and started the engine.</p><p>Throwing the three men one last bitter, furious look, he reversed the truck and whipped it to the side of the parking lot before pushing it into drive and hitting the gas. Gravel spewed as the tires bit into the unfinished parking area and the truck shot forward and sped from the cabin.</p><p>Folding his arms over his chest, Dawg frowned before sliding his dark sunglasses over his eyes and turning back to his cousins. They, too, were watching the truck speed away, their expressions brooding.</p><p>\u201cAre we doing the right thing?\u201d Natches murmured.</p><p>Dawg could only shake his head. \u201cTimothy and Chaya are right, Natches. As long we\u2019re alive and living here, DHS or some other American alphabet agency is going to play games with us for the simple fact that they know we love our homes, our families, and our country too much to stand back and just protect our own asses. And if they get the urge to demand more from us, they can always threaten our family\u2019s freedom to ensure they get it. We have too much at stake and too much to lose not to do this now, while we have the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really think Brogan will ensure that it happens?\u201d Rowdy muttered, unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cHe ensured that he had his own agreement and compensatory package before ever agreeing to work with Timothy Cranston and Chatham Doogan.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAnd I know Director Bryce. He wants the gold. He has no idea it\u2019s been found, and that\u2019s been okay until now, because he wants those traitors more. They\u2019ve been a thorn in his side since before DHS existed. I think this is the best chance we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink Eve\u2019s going to forgive you for playing these games with her?\u201d Natches asked quietly, compassionately. \u201cYou should have talked to us, cuz. Told us what was going on. We work better together, remember?\u201d</p><p>Dawg turned away from his cousin\u2019s too-perceptive gaze to stare into the beauty of the mountains for one long moment. When he turned back, he took a shaky breath and said, \u201cIf she can\u2019t forgive me, she\u2019ll need you and Rowdy. I couldn\u2019t chance her hating all of us. She\u2019s too much of a Mackay, Natches. Too much pride, too much spirit and fire, and when she hurts, she hurts too deep. I didn\u2019t want her hurting and feeling she didn\u2019t have one of us to come to.\u201d</p><p>Natches breathed out roughly and gave his head a hard shake.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way, Dawg.\u201d It was Rowdy that chastised him quietly. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t come to us. She\u2019ll go to our wives. And that\u2019s okay, because that\u2019s what makes them strong. They\u2019ll always have each other, and they\u2019ll never be alone if the unthinkable ever happens and we\u2019re not there anymore. And we have each other, Dawg. Our ladies take care of home and hearth, our babies and our hearts. We keep their lives, their families, friends, and homes safe. We do that together. No more hiding things, you got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that.\u201d He gave a hard, sharp nod of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Eve, Dawg?\u201d Natches asked again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dawg knew he wasn\u2019t repeating his earlier question, but that earlier question was all Dawg could consider.</p><p>Would Eve forgive him?</p><p>Dawg\u2019s lips tightened. Shaking his head, he strode to the dual-cab pickup he\u2019d driven in, and stepped into the driver\u2019s seat without answering.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have an answer because he simply didn\u2019t know.</p><p>What did he know?</p><p>If it were him, he knew he wouldn\u2019t forgive\u2014no matter the reason, the explanation, or the circumstances. He wouldn\u2019t want platitudes and promises of protection. He\u2019d want the trust and the ability to choose his own path and his own protection. And he knew Eve was often far too much like him and his cousins, just as the other girls were.</p><p>There was a chance, a very good chance, that she might never forgive any of them.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p> <p>A week later, Eve entered the backyard of Ray and Maria Mackay\u2019s farmhouse and stared around at the gathering of family, relations, and scattered friends.</p><p>This year there were nearly a hundred family members who had confirmed attendance at the Mackay family reunion, and it looked as though every one of them had shown up.</p><p>The reunion was a yearly endeavor Ray and Maria\u2014Grandpa Ray and Grandma Maria\u2014had begun insisting on the year Rowdy and Kelly had become engaged. As he had explained it to his son and nephews, as children came, they would need traditions. And his \u201cboys\u201d\u2014who comprised his own son as well as his two nephews\u2014well, their children deserved a far better life than their father had had.</p><p>Not that Rowdy\u2019s life had been too hard, as Eve heard it. He\u2019d had Ray, and then, once Ray had married Maria, he\u2019d had a mother. The stories she\u2019d heard of Rowdy\u2019s mother had never been pleasant, but there was no doubt Maria had loved Ray\u2019s son.</p><p>Just as Ray had taken her daughter, Kelly, in and loved her.</p><p>Eve had always found it amusing that Rowdy and Kelly had lived in the same house for so many years and then ended up married.</p> <p>But Grandpa Ray had bragged that his boy, his Rowdy, hadn\u2019t been base or without honor. When his son had realized he was feeling things for Kelly, Rowdy had moved out. And even before he\u2019d realized he was falling in love with her, Rowdy had made certain he\u2019d taken care of her, his father bragged.</p><p>Once Rowdy and Kelly became engaged, Ray had begun the family reunions, even though the first \u201creunions\u201d were only him, Maria, Kelly, Rowdy, Dawg, and Natches.</p><p>He said kids needed traditions. They needed to know and understand family.</p><p>Christmas, New Year\u2019s, church on Easter morning, then the egg hunt before dinner once the girls had been born. Ray made certain each holiday was celebrated for the meaning it was intended by the family, with the family. And every June, there was the Mackay family reunion.</p><p>That Saturday, Eve had no choice but to slow down, take a day off, and show up at Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s farm. The reunion had begun as a meal, and had turned into a daylong circus as years had gone by.</p><p>It was a day Eve and her family looked forward to every year. And each year it had only grown. With Dayle Mackay, Nadine and her son, Johnny Grace\u2019s, deaths eight years before, the separation of Ray, Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches from their relations had ended. Now, all the Mackay relations and their families had begun showing up. Among them were the Augusts from Madison, Texas\u2014Cade, Brock, and Sam August\u2014along with their wives and children.</p><p>The Mackays and their extended families were just as interesting and just as complicated as Eve had always imagined they were as she grew up. Living in northern Texas, so far away from the brother and cousins her father had told her mother about, Eve had often hungered for news of them. She\u2019d built them up in her mind instead, and at times she could honestly say she hadn\u2019t done them justice.</p><p>Grandpa Ray and Grandma Maria, as they insisted they be called, were the grandparents Eve and her sisters had always dreamed of having. From day one, they had accepted Mercedes Mackay and her daughters with such warmth and acceptance that it often seemed her family had come home when they stepped foot in Kentucky.</p> <p>That first family reunion, Eve and her family had cried. They had never been to such an event; they had never known family. All they\u2019d ever known was one another. Having that tradition and then so many others as well had been a dream come true for them.</p><p>And having not just one big brother, but three, had always been so incredible to Eve. Rowdy and Natches never accepted being described or introduced as her cousins. They were her brothers, too, they promised.</p><p>Yeah, she had family now, and for the first time, Eve had no idea what to do with them. They were just as intimidating and as controlling as Timothy was rumored to be. They were just sneakier about it than Timothy.</p><p>Eve herself had never seen Timothy playing those games with her or her family. Of course, the Mackay sisters had never done anything to cause him to need to investigate them, or for him to have to maneuver them into protecting themselves.</p><p>For five years Eve had lived in a dream world that she was now terrified was no more than a lie.</p><p>Dawg loved her and her family; she knew that. But he was manipulating and controlling her, and she was suddenly afraid he had been controlling them all along. Especially her, where Brogan was concerned.</p><p>As she wandered through the backyard, stopping to talk to cousins, friends, and various Mackay relations, she looked around for Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches.</p><p>She found Dawg with Timothy, standing at the oversize barbecue grill, where Timothy was grilling the burgers and hot dogs. Eve couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether she was wrong about the man her mother was in love with, as she had been wrong about Dawg.</p><p>Watching them talk, though, she saw Timothy pause and glance up at Dawg disapprovingly. As Dawg continued to talk, Timothy frowned and, without so much as the flicker of an eyelash, froze so completely that Eve knew he was livid. She\u2019d known Timothy long enough that sometimes, unless he was trying to hide what he thought and what he felt, she could detect his anger.</p><p>Her gaze moved to Dawg. As she watched, his arms crossed over his broad chest and a scowl darkened his face. Then Timothy shook his head.</p><p>Dawg began protesting, and Timothy was ignoring him.</p><p>She would love to be the fly on that wall rather than the one watching from afar. Except she doubted Timothy would have discussed her with Dawg if she was close enough to hear.</p><p>Eve forced herself to move away.</p><p>Dawg once warned her and her sisters of the rules of the Mackay house, so to speak: Don\u2019t betray yourself, your family, or your country, he\u2019d told her. If they could adhere to those few rules, then they would always have family.</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d become a part of his family, she\u2019d lied to him. And she was smart enough to know that part of her anger toward him had a lot to do with the fact that she had broken a promise, and now, she feared, she had risked not just her place with the Mackays, but also her sisters\u2019 and mother\u2019s places.</p><p>What Dawg had done was wrong. He\u2019d played her in some way and she knew it. She just wasn\u2019t certain how yet, and that hurt her, just as it risked her trust in him. But never her trust in the fact that he loved her family.</p><p>Or he had loved her.</p><p>Would she do it again? she wondered as she slipped into the house to find a little privacy for a while.</p><p>Eve knew she would.</p><p>Brogan had broken her heart, but staying away from him was so impossible that she had forced herself to work until she collapsed into bed around daylight. The less time she spent anywhere close to him, the better.</p><p>Not that she had seen him around very often. He seemed to be gone more often than not. Even Jed and Eli hadn\u2019t been around much.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stay busy enough to forget the night and the morning she had spent in his arms, though. The memory of it tormented her. She couldn\u2019t sleep without dreaming of it. She ached for him. She missed him.</p><p>And she was beginning to wonder whether perhaps he had lied to her in the worst possible way. Maybe he was one of those men who, once they\u2019d had her, were just finished with a woman.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eve.\u201d Rogue Mayes, a friend of the family and, as Grandpa Mackay liked to call her, his adopted granddaughter, waved at Eve from a table set beneath the huge oak at the side of the yard.</p><p>Smiling whether she felt like it or not, Eve moved to the couple and stared at the baby Rogue was holding close to her breast.</p><p>Little Ezekiel Mayes Jr. was only three weeks old, and looked impossibly tiny to Eve. He was filling out wonderfully, though. The cap of red fuzz on his head reminded her too much of Brogan\u2019s red hair, while everything else about him was the image of his father.</p><p>\u201cHow gorgeous.\u201d She breathed out as Rogue handed the baby to her carefully. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get a chance to come out and see him.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did good, huh?\u201d Rogue laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou did excellent,\u201d Eve assured her as she caressed the baby\u2019s soft, rounded head before turning to the father. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do too bad yourself, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Zeke chuckled at the compliment. \u201cAt least you acknowledge that I might have had a hand in him. Your brother and cousins seem to believe immaculate conception occurred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, that\u2019s because they think Rogue\u2019s a sister, too,\u201d she assured him. \u201cAnd you know all their sisters are pure, sweet, and completely innocent.\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned to his wife in surprise. \u201cHas anyone told his sisters that yet? If they have, they\u2019ve completely ignored the concept.\u201d</p><p>Eve couldn\u2019t help but laugh at the playful mockery as she handed the baby back to his mother. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous. He\u2019s going to break hearts right and left when he grows up.\u201d</p><p>Rogue beamed in pride, while Zeke\u2019s chest must have puffed out two feet.</p><p>As Eve turned to skirt the main part of the yard, she heard her name called out again.</p><p>\u201cAuntie Evie. Auntie Evie.\u201d Erin Jansen, Natches\u2019s niece, was running through the yard, a smile covering her face as her long dark hair flew out behind her.</p><p>That child was going to have the boys worshiping at her feet, Eve thought as the six-year-old ran to her. Bending, Eve caught her, lifting her as Erin wrapped her arms around her neck for a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI missed you.\u201d Erin beamed as Eve set her back on her feet, then bent down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, baby.\u201d Eve grinned as the little girl stared back at her with eyes an odd mix of green and gray. The world would label the color hazel, but there was no way such a tame description could describe it. At any time, there were at least two shades of green playing with the unusually dark gray color.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go play with Bliss now.\u201d She jumped around like a little Mexican jumping bean on caffeine. \u201cLove you, Auntie Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, baby.\u201d Eve smiled back at her, watching as she skipped off, the pretty summer dress she wore bouncing around her.</p><p>At that second, the possibility of being pregnant slammed into her so hard, Eve lost her breath.</p><p>Pressing her hand to her stomach, she looked around wildly, desperate to escape now, to find someplace to think, to ache in peace.</p><p>Someplace where so many people weren\u2019t around her and possibly watching her.</p><p>Entering the quiet house, Eve moved through the kitchen, remembering the years that the reunion had been held in the house, and the kitchen had been brimming with people, laughter, and food.</p><p>It had quickly outgrown the house, though\u2014so much so that Grandpa Ray and his \u201cboys\u201d had gone in together and built the backyard kitchen, with its huge grill, gas stove, and a sink so big Eve had teased them that it could double as a tub.</p><p>The whole thing was built under a massive gazebo-style shelter with a fireplace at one end and sliding windows that allowed the whole interior to be open to the yard in the summer to catch the breeze that rolled out of the mountains. In the winter it could be enclosed and, with the warmth of the fireplace, made a wonderful gathering area.</p><p>Moving to the living room and sitting on the sofa, she slipped her sandals from her feet and curled her legs beside her. Resting her head in the corner of the furniture Eve stared into the shadowed room as she closed her eyes and fought her tears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d been crying for a week and she was tired of it. She hated it.</p><p>Not that fighting the tears often did her any good. Just as they did now, there were those tears that escaped her control and eased down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to kill him if he\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve been crying for a week.\u201d Dawg\u2019s declaration had her eyes flying open as she quickly swiped the tears from her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you yet,\u201d she whispered, refusing to look at him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. She felt too guilty. She\u2019d made a promise, and no matter what he\u2019d done, that didn\u2019t change the fact that she had broken her word to him.</p><p>Dawg let out a hard breath and a second later she felt him sit down beside her.</p><p>Leaning forward, his big hands clasped between his spread legs, he stared at the floor thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me now, little sister?\u201d</p> <p>Swinging her head around, she stared at him in surprise. \u201cHate you? For what? Caring enough for me that you tried to protect me?\u201d She sniffed back more tears. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that just make me more awful than I already feel I am?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was hoarse with the effort to hold back her emotions as she watched him, despising herself for the brooding look she saw in his eyes.</p><p>Finally he shook his head slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re not an awful person at all, Eve,\u201d he seemed to chide her gently. \u201cWhat would make you think you are?\u201d</p><p>Her breathing hitched as she pushed back a sob. \u201cI lied to you. I didn\u2019t mean to, but I gave you my word and I broke it. I broke it and I blamed you for my own guilt when I knew, you may not have been able to explain why, but you were only trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>His brows lowered, his expression becoming dangerously still.</p><p>\u201cEve, do you think I\u2019d hold that against you?\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t maintain his look. Turning away, she whispered, \u201cOne of the few things asked is that we not betray family.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI lied . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I\u2019ll kill Brogan and just have it done with,\u201d he threatened as her gaze swung back to him. \u201cBecause it\u2019s obvious that falling in love with him has somehow weakened your mind.\u201d</p><p>Never let it be said that Dawg Mackay was afraid to state his opinion.</p><p>Eve shook her head in confusion. \u201cI promised . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much because I manipulated you into that promise and exerted as much guilt as I could to ensure you made it.\u201d He snorted. \u201cEve, sweetheart, you can\u2019t let the people you love do this to you.\u201d Reaching out, he wiped a tear from her face as his expression eased. \u201cHoney, I never blamed you for breaking your promise. Hell, I knew you would break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you come to the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the night before, someone had broken into your room and trashed it maybe?\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt took several hours for me to find out you had left with Brogan. He wasn\u2019t answering his phone, and yours was going straight to voice mail. No one knew where the two of you were or where Brogan planned to go. If it hadn\u2019t been for Timothy and the fact that he knew the location of the cabin, then I would have driven myself wild thinking that you were hurt, or worse.\u201d</p><p>Lips parted, Eve stared back at him in surprise. \u201cI hadn\u2019t known about my room until I returned home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was going to tell you before you left the cabin.\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . Hell, sis, I took one look at Brogan that morning and I knew you\u2019d slept with him. Then all I could think was, \u2018That bastard was sleeping with my baby sister.\u2019 Sometimes I forget you\u2019re an adult. I still see that wary, uncertain teenager who watched me with that sure and certain knowledge I was going to let her and her family fend for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Eve looked away from him.</p><p>She\u2019d been terrified when she\u2019d returned home to find her suite trashed. So terrified she\u2019d accepted her mother\u2019s offer to move into the extra bedroom above the inn.</p><p>She was still in that bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCome on; you\u2019re not crying because you broke a promise I knew you\u2019d never be able to keep,\u201d he chided.</p><p>She was almost amused. Sliding a sideways look toward him, she caught the concerned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you ask me to promise, Dawg?\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to feel about anything this week. Or how to deal with such strong, stubborn men.</p><p>\u201cBecause I was fighting to find a way to protect you, Eve.\u201d He reached back and rubbed his neck with an air of weariness. \u201cI could see what was going on between you and Brogan. I\u2019ve watched it building between the two of you, and when I saw it was going to happen, and it was going to happen soon, I needed time to finish some things.\u201d</p><p>Did he know?</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He sat back on the sofa and watched her quietly. \u201cI know Brogan\u2019s an agent for DHS, Eve. I suspected at first, but then I knew what he was doing here. You don\u2019t have to keep that secret for him, from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked to be told.\u201d She picked at a loose thread on the knee of her jeans as her throat thickened with emotion. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not been at the inn in a few days,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been worried as hell,\u201d he corrected her. \u201cTimothy says you\u2019ve been pacing your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again. \u201cI was just wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had some things to take care of in D.C.,\u201d he told her. \u201cHe should be back in a few more days, from what I understand.\u201d Thank God.</p><p>Eve felt a sense of relief expand inside her. She hadn\u2019t realized how worried she had been until Dawg had confirmed that Brogan was okay.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him, Eve?\u201d he asked, his gaze so heavy she felt her lips tremble.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d She had asked herself that question all week.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think it does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem to matter to him.\u201d A bitter laugh escaped past her lips as the ache in her chest echoed to her soul. \u201cHe had a job to do. I was a way to do that job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Dawg murmured. \u201cI guess that was why he waited two and a half years to do it, if that\u2019s true? Strange, if I knew that there was an asset that could help me solve a case, I believe I\u2019d be on her ass first thing out.\u201d</p><p>She picked at the thread on her jeans again, not certain what to say now.</p><p>\u201cEve, do you know what having you meant for him?\u201d Dawg pressed.</p><p>Eve shook her head.</p><p>\u201cIt meant dragging you into a case and endangering you for the very fact that you were there. I may be pissed at him for not keeping his hands off you until this was over, but I\u2019m not a stupid man, honey. You want him as much as he wants you. You didn\u2019t know why he was there; all you knew was that you couldn\u2019t believe the rumor that he could do anything illegal. A man can fight himself, but he can\u2019t fight the woman who can break down his defenses with a smile. Or a tear.\u201d Lifting his hand, he used his thumb to wipe away another tear. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man as much as I know his history, but I do know he was engaged once, years ago. Until his fianc\u00e9e had their baby aborted while he was at the training academy, just before joining DHS. It damn near killed him. He had relationships, but never with a woman close enough to an operation to be identified or endangered.\u201d</p><p>Eve was so thankful she hadn\u2019t been looking at Dawg when he spoke of Brogan\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s abortion that she nearly closed her eyes thankfully.</p><p>\u201cI met Brogan just before he joined the academy,\u201d Dawg reflected as Eve hung on every word. \u201cI think it was a few days after he left his fianc\u00e9e. He was talking to his father as I walked up to the table.\u201d He shook his head regretfully, compassion filling his odd green eyes. \u201cHis fianc\u00e9e had informed him within minutes of his arrival that she had aborted the baby. It damned near broke him. He looked his father right in the eye and told him he\u2019d wanted that kid. That he\u2019d have never turned his back on his child as his father had. Then he stood up and walked away from this big, tough FBI director as though he didn\u2019t have the power to yank his placement at DHS in a heartbeat.\u201d He rubbed his jaw before scratching at it thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019d trust Brogan Campbell with my life, Eve. I know I never showed it, but he was undercover. Showing it would have endangered him, and though I trust him, there\u2019s not a whole lot I know about him. But I know he\u2019s not a man who trusts women, and he\u2019s not a man who ever gives all of himself except to his job. I guess I worried about that. Worried about you and your tender heart.\u201d</p><p>And he was right to worry, Eve thought as she swiped at another tear. Here she sat, her heart broken, wishing she knew how to deal with what Brogan had done, and the impact it had had on her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you do,\u201d she whispered, tears thick in her voice. \u201cWhat would you do if it were you, and something happened?\u201d She swallowed tightly, lifting her gaze, knowing he would know once she asked. \u201cIf something happened and there was a possibility your lover was pregnant after that happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Another tear fell.</p><p>For a moment it was all she could do not to start sobbing, to beg him to fix it like he had every other problem she\u2019d ever brought to him.</p><p>He watched her in confusion for only a second before understanding filled his gaze, darkened it, and shadowed it with pain.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eve, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered sorrowfully, that understanding filling his voice along with the pain. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Briefly, her voice breaking, she explained the condom breaking, then Brogan\u2019s admission that he hadn\u2019t intended to tell her. At least, not until it had been too late for her to do anything about it.</p><p>Dawg didn\u2019t appear to get angry, though he did tense, and for a second his eyes flashed with something dangerous.</p><p>Finally, he exhaled roughly as he rubbed his hand over his face.</p><p>\u201cDo you know yet?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cBut that\u2019s not why it hurts, Dawg.\u201d Her breath caught as she continued to fight her tears. \u201cWhat hurts . . . He knows me,\u201d she cried, her fists clenching, the pent up sobs escaping. \u201cI know he does. Everyone thinks he\u2019s a traitor, but I knew better. All the nights he was sitting on the porch when I would come in from the bar, we\u2019d talk.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cFor two and a half years, Dawg. We talked and we\u2019ve laughed. And through those conversations I knew things about him, and he didn\u2019t have to say it.\u201d She swiped at more tears. \u201cBut something this important, as important as a child, and he thought I was that cold?\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s arms were suddenly around her, pulling her against his broad chest as she sobbed. As the grief tearing her heart in two escaped once again.</p><p>She knew things about him, she knew him. Why hadn\u2019t he known her?</p><p>She knew he loved his mother, but he resented her, even though he hadn\u2019t told her about the resentment. Resented her for dying and leaving him to a father who had no idea what to do with his bastard son. She knew he loved his sister and his baby brother, but he worried because his sister wouldn\u2019t let him protect her and his brother refused to try to protect himself. He loved the color green, but he hated the color blue just because it seemed to be everyone else\u2019s favorite. She\u2019d known he loved children because whenever her mother had the kids at the house he always found time for them. She hated, hated with a passion, anyone who dared to so much as speak ill to a child. He loved dogs but didn\u2019t care much for cats.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told her any of these things, but she knew.</p><p>She knew.</p><p>When the worst of the tears finally eased, she drew back and accepted the tissues he pulled from the box on the table next to the couch. Wiping them away and blowing her nose, Eve finally managed to pull the ragged threads of her control around her emotions enough to sit up and stop sobbing like a baby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>What was she supposed to do?</p><p>She shrugged, wiping at her tears again. \u201cI\u2019m really mad at you, too,\u201d she informed him, her voice hoarse from the tears she\u2019d shed. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby, Dawg. You could have told me, and I would have stayed away from him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you have?\u201d Gentle amusement filled his voice. \u201cYou knew him so well you didn\u2019t know he was working something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d Indignation filled the tears. \u201cI knew he was working something, but I thought he was doing the surveillance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat surveillance?\u201d Drawing back, Dawg stared at her in surprise as she wiped at her tears again.</p><p>\u201cThe surveillance on Judge Kiser.\u201d She sniffed again.</p><p>\u201cWho has surveillance on Judge Kiser?\u201d He frowned, obviously either unaware of the surveillance or trying to hide his knowledge of it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who does.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they introduce themselves, Dawg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about it then?\u201d he demanded instead, frowning back at her.</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t know about it.</p><p>\u201cI heard Jed outside the other night.\u201d She had to smile at the thought of it. \u201cYou can\u2019t convince these city boys how sound travels at night, can you? He was around the side of the house talking on his cell phone about the surveillance on Judge Kiser. Do you think it has anything to do with his connections to the Freedom League?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s connected to the Freedom League?\u201d Dawg was trying to hide his shock.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Dawg, I thought you knew everything that was going on.\u201d She actually managed a laugh.</p> <p>Dawg shook his head. \u201cHow\u2019s Kiser connected to the Freedom League?\u201d</p><p>She actually sat back and stared at him in surprise. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know about this, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t know about this,\u201d he agreed, disbelief echoing in his voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, well, maybe you\u2019d better check into it.\u201d She smiled back at him, though it was short, and she knew it.</p><p>Turning her gaze to her lap once again, she watched as she twisted her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could fix this,\u201d she whispered, her tears finally no longer falling. \u201cI wish I could go back and understand things better. I would fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you do that?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI would have stayed away from him,\u201d she insisted, looking up to meet the somber compassion in his gaze. \u201cIt was my fault, Dawg. It wasn\u2019t his.\u201d</p> <p>The shake of his head was followed by his strong arms wrapping around her as he pulled her to his hard chest. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault either, little sister. It wasn\u2019t your fault either.\u201d</p><p>Dawg stared across the living room, glaring at the wall, fighting to hold back the anger brewing inside him. He\u2019d grown, he realized. Christa had actually managed to mature him a little bit, because he wasn\u2019t storming out to kill the little bastard. He was still sitting here, comforting his sister and considering the best way to handle the situation.</p><p>His best bet, though, was to kill the little bastard.</p><p>Or at least beat the shit out of him.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had a very bad feeling he was going to have to settle for a forcible discussion with Mr. Campbell.</p><p>A very forcible discussion.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>Entering the inn through the front entrance the next day, something she rarely did, Eve started toward the stairs that led to the main residence, and her mother\u2019s rooms.</p><p>\u201cEve, sweetie, did you need something?\u201d Her mother stepped from the kitchen into the dining room and called out to her.</p><p>Stepping back, Eve turned and entered the dining room, moving to her mother.</p><p>\u201cAre you busy, Momma?\u201d</p><p>Of course, her mother was always busy. Mercedes Mackay wasn\u2019t a person who could tolerate sitting still for long periods of time. Unless she was asleep.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, I was just making pies for dessert tomorrow. Come into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>She almost laughed. Her mother didn\u2019t consider baking pies a chore?</p><p>Stepping into the kitchen, Eve moved to the counter in front of the wide center aisle in the middle of the kitchen floor and pulled a stool from beneath the attached counter.</p><p>Taking her seat, she watched as her mother rolled the pie dough carefully, Eve\u2019s mouth already watering for the taste of the flaky crust she knew would emerge once her mother was finished.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, Eve?\u201d Mercedes paused in her pie prep, her gaze intent on her daughter\u2019s face. \u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She nodded as she drew her hands from the counter and clasped them underneath it.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d her mother guessed. \u201cIf you were, you wouldn\u2019t be hiding your fists under the counter, and your eyes wouldn\u2019t look like bruised emeralds.\u201d</p><p>Eve blinked back the emotion threatening to fill the eyes that were already betraying her with the tears that never seemed far away.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re on the verge of tears.\u201d More than a little concerned now, Mercedes set the pie dough to the side, washed her hands quickly at the small sink in the counter before drying them and moving to where her daughter sat on the other side. Pulling herself to the bar stool beside Eve, she drew Eve\u2019s fists from beneath the counter. They were so tight her knuckles were white. Running her hand gently over them, Mercedes watched Eve silently for long moments.</p><p>When the words started pouring from Eve, she couldn\u2019t stop them. All the things she couldn\u2019t tell Dawg while they talked spilled out to her mother: the pain, that sense of being so fully connected to Brogan that no one else in the world existed, the sure and certain knowledge that he cared for her, cared for her deeply, and Eve\u2019s certainty that he would turn her away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like he was determined to push me away, even as he pulled me to him,\u201d she grieved, her heart so heavy in her chest that the physical ache was draining. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, Momma,\u201d she whispered, staring back at her mother almost pleadingly. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to just let him go. I don\u2019t know how to give up, because he already owns so much of me, I don\u2019t know whether my heart would survive just giving up.\u201d</p><p>Yet she didn\u2019t know what else to do. Brogan had been gone for over a week now, and though Jed and Eli were still in town, they were rarely in their suites either.</p><p>Mercedes listened, her heart breaking for her daughter and for Brogan.</p><p>He was a good man. She knew he was. Her Tim thought very highly of him, and Tim was an excellent judge of character. But just because he was a good man didn\u2019t make him a man who knew how to care for a precious heart given to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019re pregnant, Eve?\u201d Mercedes asked then.</p><p>\u201cWell, now, Momma, I\u2019ve never been pregnant, so I don\u2019t really know,\u201d Eve exclaimed in frustration. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>Mercedes\u2019s eyes darkened with concern, though there was a glimmer of excitement in the depths, Eve noticed. \u201cYou can feel it, Eve. From the first day, if you\u2019re still and just think of the child that could be growing inside you, you find you can just feel your child.\u201d Reaching out, she cupped Eve\u2019s cheek with her palm. \u201cI knew the moment I conceived you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cChandler had left that morning, and there I sat in the house without him, terrified of being alone in a strange country, unable to understand the people\u2019s language or their ways, and I was so very frightened.\u201d The memory of those years haunted her mother, Eve knew.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting there at the kitchen table watching the sun rise, spreading its warmth across the canyons and buttes, reaching out for the house. It slipped through the windows, edged over the floor, and I watched as it inched a trail across the kitchen, coming nearer each moment.\u201d She laughed. \u201cOne ray was very adventurous. It slipped over my bare foot, moved up my leg. . . .\u201d Her mother touched her stomach as though remembering that moment. \u201cThe moment it reached me here\u201d\u2014moving her hands, she pressed her fingers to her abdomen, her face lighting in joy as though she had returned to that moment\u2014\u201cI felt you then,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMy first. There was this warmth, like the sun had sunk inside me to touch you. And I knew I would no longer be alone. My child would be with me, and she would fill my heart.\u201d</p><p>Eve marveled at the expression on her mother\u2019s face and the love that seemed to transform every inch of it.</p><p>\u201cBut, Momma,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe raped you. Over and over again, in his attempt to force you to breed sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have sons, did I?\u201d Mercedes reminded her with tender emphasis. \u201cI had my beautiful, beautiful daughters, and through all these years they have sustained me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have gone to school, Momma,\u201d Eve protested. \u201cA real school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have been returned to Guatemala, just as Chandler threatened to do, but I was not,\u201d her mother pointed out before clasping both her hands and staring into her daughter\u2019s eyes. \u201cLove him if you must; release him if you must, because you cannot hold one who does not feel the death of all he is inside, without you. If he does not feel that way at the thought of losing you, then you do not need him, precious. You deserve far better. If you carry his child, then treasure it; give it all the love you will find exists inside you the day your baby is born. But\u201d\u2014holding Eve\u2019s hands tighter as she leaned closer, her momma sharpened her gaze, making it harder\u2014\u201cdo not let him steal your soul, Eve. He can hold your heart and your woman\u2019s spirit, but if you let him steal your soul, then you and your babe will only suffer for the loss. Your sense of adventure, your independence, and your love of the world you\u2019ve created for yourself are yours alone. No one can take this from you if you do not allow it.\u201d</p><p>Eve stared back at her mother in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d But she had a feeling she understood completely.</p><p>\u201cAh, Eve, you know what I mean,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou are letting this man steal your soul and it should not be his to own, unless he gives his in return. As long as you have that part of you, you will always have the will to ensure that he never breaks you, or breaks the joy you find with your child.\u201d</p><p>Eve\u2019s lips trembled for a moment before she found herself suddenly dry-eyed, that core of strength that had always sustained her finally awakening again with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI can live without him,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s fingers trailed over her cheek as an approving smile shaped her lips and filled her golden brown eyes. \u201cYou will weep often,\u201d her mother assured her. \u201cYou will rage and you will cry and you will ask God why. But you will always find yourself again, and you will never sell your soul to a man who cannot love you. If he cannot love you with all his heart and all his spirit as well, then you are better off without him.\u201d</p><p>Eve nodded. Reaching out, she wrapped her arms around her mother and held on tight. \u201cI love you, Momma,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, my Eve,\u201d her mother swore, hugging her just as fiercely. \u201cAnd if you carry his child and he does not wish to be a part of your lives, then your sisters and I will surround you and that precious babe with all the love you could ever need. I promise you this.\u201d</p><p>Eve nodded against her mother\u2019s shoulder as a single tear escaped.</p><p>The last one, she knew. The last one for the child she had been until that final maturity had occurred in Brogan\u2019s arms. One last tear for what might not be, and what she may not ever be able to fix.</p><p>She could love him, and she did love him.</p><p>But she would never again lose herself for fear of his walking away.</p><p>Or for fear of his taking her heart with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Timothy stepped back from the kitchen doorway, turned, and slipped through the dining room, his hands shoved into his slacks as a frown pulled at his brow.</p><p>He\u2019d heard it all. Dawg had told him most of it at the reunion, then called later that night to tell him the rest. Neither he nor Dawg had been certain how Eve would deal with it, though. Whether she was strong enough to truly love and understand a man such as Brogan.</p><p>She was too strong for him, Timothy decided.</p><p>Hell, Eve was too good for the likes of Brogan Campbell and his damaged heart.</p><p>He\u2019d give the boy a chance, though. Mercedes would ask that of him; he knew her well enough to know that. And there was nothing he could deny his Mercedes.</p><p>Showered and lying back on her bed, naked and relaxed for the first time since leaving Brogan at the cabin, Eve realized how desperately she had missed him.</p><p>Most of it had been her fault, she admitted. She\u2019d kept herself away from the house and away from him until she\u2019d heard he\u2019d left town. Even Dawg didn\u2019t know when he would return, and she was hesitant to ask Timothy.</p><p>Timothy was as protective over her and her sisters as she imagined he would have been over the daughter he had lost so long ago. Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t had to rouse his suspicions; nor had she had to tempt that protective side of him.</p><p>Lying in the bed now, drifting in and out of a peaceful dreamscape, she found her memories turning to the pleasure she\u2019d found in Brogan\u2019s arms.</p><p>Those heated, completely destructive kisses. The way he touched her, as though he knew from one touch to the next exactly what she needed. The way he could make what should be painful, exquisitely pleasurable. A mix of pleasure and pain that she might be becoming addicted to.</p><p>As her body began to heat, to pulse with the memories, she found her hands straying to her body, stroking down her side, across her abdomen. One hand caressed her breasts\u2014along the rounded curve, cupping one, her thumb sliding over the nipple as her breathing began to accelerate.</p><p>Pausing, her eyes opening on a frustrated groan, Eve moved from the bed and collected the dildo she\u2019d bought for herself a few years before and had never used properly. After meeting Brogan, she had been determined that if he ever took her, then there would be no mistake that he was her first. That she had saved herself for him.</p><p>That veil of innocence was gone now. It had been given to the only man she knew would ever hold her heart as fully as Brogan held it.</p><p>The warmth beginning to rise in the tender tissue and delicate muscles of her pussy tormented her now. Her nipples and breasts ached, her body tingled for touch, and she was certain bringing herself to release would be better than nothing.</p><p>She had the memory of his touch, knew it as freshly as if he had just taken her the day before.</p><p>Lying back on the bed, Eve resumed touching, stroking. In her mind he was with her, drawing the breathless little moans from her lips and filling her with a hunger she couldn\u2019t control.</p><p>Her own touch wasn\u2019t nearly as heated and knowing. It wasn\u2019t as instinctively experienced. But it was enough. Enough to build the need and the pleasure until she was able to slip the vibrating dildo inside the snug channel with a desperate moan.</p><p>She ached for him.</p><p>She needed him.</p><p>But if she had to, she\u2019d live without him. Now all she had to do was convince her body of that.</p><p>The compensation package the Mackays wanted wasn\u2019t easy to acquire. When it came right down to it, Brogan had to threaten Doogan with his father, and apprising the director of his actions, if he didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>Nearly three days after leaving for D.C., Brogan drove back into Somerset after midnight and headed straight to the inn.</p> <p>He\u2019d missed Eve.</p><p>Admitting it hadn\u2019t been easy. He\u2019d lost two nights\u2019 sleep, jacked off more than he wanted to, and found he didn\u2019t get aroused in the slightest when he visited what had once been his favorite watering hole for drinks with his father.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a one-night-stand sort of person, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t get aroused when obvious interest was shown. Until now. Until all he could think about was Eve and the feeling he\u2019d had as he came inside her. That feeling that he could sense part of her soul that he had no right knowing. Parts of her heart that he knew no other man had ever felt, had ever gotten close to.</p><p>Pulling into the parking area and cutting the Harley\u2019s motor, he breathed out a sigh of relief before slipping off his helmet and hanging it over the handlebars of the cycle. Looking toward the side of the house, he could see the faintest sliver of light beneath Eve\u2019s curtains, and his cock came to instant attention.</p><p>For the briefest, briefest moment, a sense of knowledge shot to awareness inside him and his entire body tightened.</p><p>Son of a bitch, he knew what was going on, but he was damned if he wanted to admit to it. Not yet, at any rate. There was no way in hell he could have such a connection to a woman. That he could feel her, that he could imagine exactly what she was doing and know to the depths of his soul that he was right.</p><p>Blowing out a hard breath, he moved to the porch, making his way quickly along the wraparound porch and moving past the door to his own suite, toward Eve\u2019s instead.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother knocking.</p><p>Sliding the key he\u2019d lifted from her room and had copied before he left, he quickly, quietly unlocked the patio door and stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d he groaned roughly, his eyes widening, his breath stopping in his chest at the sight that met his eyes. \u201cI swear to God, if you move, I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Knees bent and lifted, her pretty delicate feet planted against the mattress, emerald eyes slitted and burning with lust, she slid the dildo free of her gripping little pussy until nothing but the head remained, then pushed it in slowly.</p><p>So fucking slowly he swore he held his breath waiting for it to stop. Her hips lifted, her breath catching as the toy delved deeper inside her until her lashes fluttered when she could take no more.</p><p>Closing the door carefully, locking it without taking his eyes from her, Brogan moved one hand to the buttons of his shirt and quickly released them.</p><p>Sitting in the chair next to the bed, he pulled his ankle boots from his feet, then stood and shrugged the shirt from his shoulders. He was breathing heavily as his hands went to the metal buttons of his jeans, released them, then quickly shed the jeans. Still watching her, fighting to remember how to breathe, he wrapped the fingers of one hand around his cock and watched her, mesmerized.</p><p>He stroked the hardened flesh from base to tip, a groan working from his chest as he watched the artificial dick pull free of her clenched inner muscles. It glistened with her juices as they clung to the latex form. The realistic design with its flared head and bulging veins was a poor substitute for what she wanted, though.</p><p>Desperate for her, his knees weak, Brogan moved to the bed, his jaw clenching as he watched her fuck herself with the dildo, watched the need burning in her eyes. Stepping to the side of the bed, he moved onto it carefully, kneeling on the mattress at her head as his gaze narrowed on the tube of lubrication next to her.</p><p>\u201cAh, baby,\u201d he whispered, watching as her tongue flicked over her lips. \u201cKeep fucking yourself with that toy dick.\u201d Moving closer, he pressed his cock to her lips, watching in anticipation as they parted and her hot little tongue licked out to taste the head of his dick.</p><p>Her hand faltered, the dildo pausing in its strokes. Brogan slowly sank the head of his cock past her lips as her tongue rubbed against the sensitive underside and a breathy moan vibrated against his cock.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, beautiful Eve,\u201d he moaned, reaching for the lube as she wrapped her fingers around the shaft of his dick and began working her mouth and tongue over the head as though she were starved for the taste of him.</p><p>That was okay, though; he knew what to do for her. He knew how to make her feel damned good. He knew exactly what to do to ensure that, once she came to her senses, those senses would be so infused with him that she wouldn\u2019t have a chance at convincing herself to deny him.</p><p>\u201cAhh, sweet Eve,\u201d he crooned, pushing the dildo slowly into her accepting body. \u201cLet\u2019s see what we can do to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>With the dildo lodged in her pussy, the bare, saturated folds parted and gripping it snugly, Brogan carefully coated his fingers with the gel from the tube he\u2019d found at her side. Spreading her legs firmly, he reached beneath the toy and found the tight, clenched entrance to her rear.</p><p>Sensual, lush, his Eve gave all of herself to him. Rather than stilling or freezing in shock at his touch there again, she lifted her hips, her thighs spreading as she surrendered the brave sensuality and erotic depths of the woman she was.</p><p>Clenching his teeth, reining back the need to satisfy his hunger like an animal desperate to fuck, he forced himself to be patient.</p><p>With one fingertip he began working the intimate little entrance open a little at a time. Using the lubricating gel as well as her juices as they wept from her pussy, Brogan prepared the entrance, then applied layer after layer of the cool gel as he worked his finger inside her.</p><p>The delicate bud of her clit swelled until it peeked above the folds around it. Her juices wept from her pussy, spilling along the folds, dampening her thighs and sliding slowly to the tight entrance of her ass as Brogan worked it open.</p><p>Her mouth worked on his cock, sucking and laving it; she drew on it with heated pulls of her lips as he felt her become lost to the hunger sweeping through her.</p><p>Little moans vibrated against the head of his dick, her desperation, her need to be fucked reflected in the deepening moans as he fucked his finger inside her ass.</p><p>As she began to take one finger easily, Brogan added another. Pressing inside her, he had to forcibly restrain himself, to do calculations in his head long enough to keep from giving in to the clawing, raking need to come\u2014to end the erotic torture gripping his cock and balls.</p><p>Lifting himself until he was staring down at her, watching as he fucked her mouth with shallow strokes, Brogan knew there was no hell he could survive without her\u2014without this.</p><p>He\u2019d run out of time, though. If he didn\u2019t pull back, it was all going to be over for a while. If he was going to take her as he was dying to do, better to do it in the first round. He wouldn\u2019t last as long this first time, not after spending more than a week away from her, craving her.</p><p>Holding his breath at the sensual agony, he pulled back from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Moving to sit up before him, to capture his cock in her hands once again, Eve found herself flipped to her stomach instead as Brogan slid between her thighs, keeping her from closing them to hold the dildo inside her.</p><p>Pleasure streaked through her as he gripped the base of the fake cock and slid it back slowly before working it inside her once again. He repeated the move, sending forks of fiery sensation to attack the internal nerve endings and draw a ragged cry from her lips.</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel as good as I do?\u201d he whispered behind her, his lips pressing against her spine, between her shoulder blades as she drew in a hard breath beneath him. \u201cTell me, baby, does this little dick feel as good as my nice thick one? Does it stretch your pussy as wide, make you as wild for the next thrust as I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried out breathlessly, her hips lifting, thighs spreading as she arched.</p><p>Fuck, yeah, that was what he wanted.</p><p>The lubricated anal entrance glistened with a mix of the slick gel and her juices as she lifted to him.</p><p>He slid the fingers of his free hand along the narrow cleft that separated her rear cheeks. Finding the clenched opening again, he watched, his dick clenching and throbbing as he pressed the tips of two fingers against the opening. Easing them slowly against the puckered, nerve-ridden entrance, he watched as the delicate muscles slowly parted, accepted the tips of his fingers; then he felt the inner muscles draw his fingers inside.</p><p>Eve was suspended on the edge of pure electric sensation and racing shocks of burning pleasure. The feel of his fingers easing inside her rear as the toy vibrated gently inside her pussy was filling her with such pleasure she felt tortured by it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn, Eve, how I love your body.\u201d He groaned behind her. \u201cNo matter what I do, it loves my touch. Loves every caress, every kiss, every penetration.\u201d</p><p>No, she loved it. Loved every caress, every kiss, every penetration.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I\u2019m going to do to this hot little rear of yours?\u201d</p><p>She shivered beneath him, anticipation sending a rush of adrenaline tearing through her and sensitizing her body further.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stretch your pretty rear nice and sweet; then, when you\u2019re taking three fingers instead of two, I\u2019m going to leave that dick buzzing in your tight little pussy while I fuck this tight, hot little ass.\u201d</p><p>Quivering, heat burning through her flesh, she thought the words should have been vulgar. They should have never turned her on with the force that shot through her, nearly pushing her into orgasm from the excitement alone.</p><p>Pulling his fingers back from the gripping, responsive flesh, he laid another kiss between her shoulder blades before straightening behind her. When his fingers returned they were cool and slick with the lubrication. His fingers slid inside her again, stretching her slowly, patiently. Pulling back again, relubricating his fingers, he returned.</p><p>This time the wider, burning penetration assured her he was reaching his goal.</p><p>The thought of taking him there, of feeling his cock throb inside her rear, had her juices rushing from her, spilling along the dildo lodged inside her.</p><p>\u201cDo you like that, baby?\u201d he crooned behind her, leaning over her to allow his lips to press to her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re taking three fingers, sweetheart. You\u2019re so hot and tight around them. It\u2019s going to feel like sinking inside the tightest, hottest little flame. You\u2019re going to burn me alive, Eve.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t burn her alive first.</p><p>His fingers pulled back. He moved over her again, supporting his weight on an elbow next to her shoulder as his lips brushed against her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, sweetheart?\u201d he growled as the thick, flared crest of his cock pressed between the cheeks of her rear and found the tender anal entrance.</p><p>\u201cBrogan.\u201d She was burning with excitement and a pleasure so heightened it was nearly agony. Eve\u2019s breath caught at the feel of the broad crest pressing against the tender entrance.</p><p>Blistering, hot, the nerve endings the thick flesh stimulated sang in ecstasy, creating a feeling of such intense pleasure, such burning pain, that she had no idea which should be uppermost.</p><p>\u201cBring your legs together,\u201d he said in a groan behind her, easing his legs from between hers until his knees bracketed her and she was suddenly gripping the fake cock vibrating inside her pussy as the additional pressure created a firestorm inside the delicate flesh.</p><p>It was the slow, searing impalement of her anus that was stripping her of any sense of reality, though. With each roll of his hips, each press of the thick cock head working its way inside her ass ravaged her self-control.</p><p>\u201cBrogan.\u201d She gasped his name, certain she couldn\u2019t bear another touch, yet desperate to be touched everywhere.</p><p>Unclenching her fingers from the blankets at her sides, Eve slid one hand beneath her, her fingers finding the achingly hard tips of her breasts and enclosing one between her thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Brogan, please. Please . . .\u201d The sharp flare of heat that pulsed from the nipple she rolled and tugged at with burning pressure struck her to her clit, to her womb.</p><p>The muscles of her anus clenched around the throbbing tip of his cock, making her hungry for more as the vibration in her pussy rippled through her clit with an intensity she had never felt before.</p><p>His free hand gripped her hip as his lips smoothed down her neck, over her shoulder. As his teeth gripped the base of her neck at the point where her shoulder met the sensitive column, the head of his cock slipped fully inside the clenching, quivering entrance and sent a shocking surge of pleasure through Eve so intense it bordered on agony.</p> <p>A hoarse, throttled scream escaped her as her hips jerked, lifting, pressing closer, fire and ice streaking across her nerve endings as her senses slipped into chaos.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to me, Eve,\u201d he urged her softly, the deep, sexual tone of his voice sliding across her consciousness with an eroticism that pulled her deeper into the dark sensuality holding her captive.</p><p>There was no room for deceit, no place to hide or to deny what she knew was the truth.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Eve,\u201d he demanded, his tongue licking over the bite before his lips moved to her ear. \u201cTell me you\u2019re mine, Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she cried desperately, her anus clenching involuntarily as she fought to press closer, to drive his cock deeper.</p><p>At the same time, his hips eased forward, the added pressure suddenly driving the broad head past the snug ring of muscles that tightened in response to the pressure before the burning width cleared it. Ecstasy and agony poured through her senses. Fire and ice raked over nerve endings that seemed bared to his touch and screaming out at the overstimulation.</p><p>Her hips jerking, her back arching as she felt him drive in to the hilt, Eve cried out in tortured pleasure as her senses expanded in brutal awareness.</p><p>Sliding his hand between their bodies and finding the base of the dildo vibrating inside her pussy, Brogan found the controls. The gentle rasp became a furious, never-ending pulse of sensation that traveled through her vagina to the point where the nerve endings of her clit met the rarely touched flesh high within her pussy.</p><p>The stimulation rocked through her body as his hips moved behind her, driving his cock into the milking tissue of her rear.</p><p>Each stretching, burning stroke sent spikes of ever-increasing sensation tearing through her senses as she felt Brogan\u2019s hand gripping her wrist, pulling her fingers down her body as he drove his cock inside her, stretching her anew with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself, baby,\u201d he growled behind her. \u201cLet me feel you stroking that pretty clit, baby.\u201d</p><p>Mindless, she concentrated her senses fully on every fiery stroke into her rear as the dildo\u2019s hard vibration and the stimulation of her fingers against her clit sent rapid, driving pinpoints of sensation surging through her.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yes,\u201d he snarled behind her, straightening, both hands gripping her hips firmly as he began to move harder, faster behind her.</p><p>He dragged his cock fully from the gripping channel, only to return immediately, fucking her to the hilt as an agonizing ecstasy tore through her, raking her senses with burning force.</p><p>Each hard thrust pressed the dildo deeper inside her, as each retreat lessened the pressure. Harsh groans spilled from her lips as each rasp of the vibrator\u2019s tip against inner muscles connected directly to her clit had her begging\u2014begging, pleading with the rapidly increasing pace of the strokes of his cock.</p><p>Eve couldn\u2019t breathe. She couldn\u2019t think. She wasn\u2019t going to survive.</p><p>\u201cFuck. Eve . . .\u201d The growl of male ecstasy came as she felt herself unraveling.</p><p>Sensation. Agony. A pleasure that bordered on insanity.</p><p>Her orgasm tore through her, melting her senses as her pussy, the spasming muscles of her milking anus, the hard throb of her clit exploded in excruciating sensation. She was flung into rapture. Brutal waves of agonizing pleasure battered her senses as each nerve ending seemed to explode, sparking a conflagration inside her body that wiped her mind and sent her hurtling through chaos.</p><p>Fear could have dragged her back. The complete destruction of her senses could have been weakened by an inborn sense of survival that would have driven the sensual creature exploding in rapture back into the confines of her body.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>Brogan flew beside her, his spirit wrapping around her, infusing her, holding her secure in a world of blinding, overwhelming ecstasy.</p><p>She was crying. She could feel it, sense her own tears as the exploding pleasure threw them higher, harder, and bound her closer to the man leading her through each chaotic storm of rapture that tore through her.</p><p>The feel of his release spurting against the naked nerve endings inside her anus was an added pulse of sensation, another explosion.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he snarled, his lips at her cheek, the growl surging through her with another pulse of sensation. \u201cTell me, Eve. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours. Yours,\u201d she said in a sob. \u201cOh, God, Brogan. I love you. I love you . . .\u201d</p><p>He owned her.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Brogan awoke with Eve cradled in his arms, the warmth of her naked body invoking a response he was certain he wasn\u2019t quite ready for.</p><p>Hell, he wasn\u2019t ready to face the warmth he could feel moving through him. The warmth threatened to overtake him and claim parts of him he hadn\u2019t known existed until Eve. He felt drained, physically and emotionally, but his cock was assuring him it was more than ready to rumble.</p><p>He smiled against her hair at the thought. Her cheek was cradled against his heart, his arms holding her snugly to him, and for a few short minutes he actually contemplated going back to sleep. Until he felt her breathing pattern change, and he swore he felt her wake up.</p><p>There was an awareness that he could feel moving through him, a gentleness, an initial confusion and then a feeling of contentment and satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be here when I woke,\u201d she muttered with a drowsy smile against his chest as the fingers of one hand curled against the mat of hair that covered his chest. \u201cDo you know how good it feels, Brogan, to awaken with you?\u201d</p><p>He knew, because he felt the same. He didn\u2019t just feel his own contentment, but he knew he was feeling hers as well. It had to be hers, because it was completely different from what he knew contentment felt like.</p><p>It was gentle; it was innocent. And Brogan knew he had no innocence left inside him. His innocence had been ripped out of him the day he learned his child had been deliberately destroyed before it could even begin to live. An innocent life barely formed because a condom had failed and had somehow acquired a tiny, tiny hole at the tip.</p><p>It had been so long ago, he should have forgotten it by now.</p><p>It had been years ago, and it still felt like yesterday.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shook his head, confused.</p><p>\u201cThat look on your face,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>He breathed out heavily. \u201cI was engaged once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fianc\u00e9e who aborted your baby?\u201d She nodded, her palm flattening against his chest comfortingly.</p><p>Pushing her hair back from her cheek, he watched as it fell about her face and over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLike you, my father wasn\u2019t married to my mother,\u201d he told her softly, his fingers tangling in her hair as he felt a sense of comfort wrapping around him. \u201cLike yours, my mother struggled\u2014until I was five, when she was murdered by a drug-crazed teenager who had stolen a gun from home and came to the diner she worked at looking for a meal.\u201d He shook his head bitterly. \u201cIf he had asked her, she would have bought him a meal, but he asked the owner first. When the old bastard wouldn\u2019t feed him, he pulled the gun and shot Mom in the head. Then he turned back to the owner and asked again. He got the meal. He sat and ate it as Mom bled out on the floor and the customers in the diner rushed to save themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Brogan,\u201d she whispered, her compassion wrapping around him.</p><p>A bitter smile tugged at his lips as he let his hand cup her cheek for a moment, drawing in the gentleness that was so much a part of her.</p><p>\u201cI want you to understand,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs I said, I was five. My father didn\u2019t know I existed. When Child Services showed up on his doorstep with me, he looked down, and I saw disgust curl his lip when he said, \u2018Hell, I paid her to abort the little bastard.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in outraged pain.</p><p>\u201cHe took me in, though.\u201d He sighed. \u201cTwo weeks later I was in a military school four states away. I came back to Somerset during the holidays and for summers and stayed with my aunt until she died in a car crash when I was sixteen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat an abrupt change from a loving home to a cold, emotionless world,\u201d she whispered, her emerald eyes dark with distress, with banked anger at the thought of his father\u2019s cruelty.</p><p>And yes, it had been cruelty.</p><p>\u201cI was eighteen and working with the FBI as an informant against a particular clique of students I was a part of when John David Bryce was assigned as the director of the bureau office I reported to.\u201d There was something about the fact that he was holding her, his hands stroking her shoulders, his fingertips relishing the feel of her soft flesh, that dimmed some of the fury he usually felt at those early memories.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He snorted at the question. \u201cI was the pride of my regional office because of the information I was reporting on a small, select group of students creating their own homeland militia group. I was pulling in information on their parents, political and military figures, their sharing of information and top-secret files. And when John David, or JD as I usually call him, came into the office he felt the need to announce the fact that I was his son. Pride and all that.\u201d He grunted in disgust. \u201cThirteen years of being ignored by the bastard and suddenly I was his son. When graduation came I dropped out of the program and went my own way for a while. That was when I met Candy.\u201d</p><p>The feel of her lips pressing against his shoulder soothed him, and he found he didn\u2019t want to get pissed. He didn\u2019t want that darkness to mar the peace he found with her.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Eve,\u201d he admitted as she lifted her head and stared up at him.</p><p>Regret filled him at the memory of the pain he had caused her the week before, the feeling of betrayal he knew she felt. Hell, he didn\u2019t blame her for feeling it.</p> <p>\u201cI missed you. More than you know, Brogan,\u201d she admitted as his lips lowered, taking a small, lingering kiss before pulling back.</p><p>The memory of last night swept over him again. The feel of her coming for him, destroying his senses with their combined pleasure and the heat that had built between them. Even clearer, though, was the memory of her crying out her love for him, and how he\u2019d known in that instant that the emotion that swirled and drew them together was indeed love.</p><p>Yet he hadn\u2019t told her he loved her as well.</p><p>He\u2019d tried. His lips had parted, the words lying ready on his tongue before instantly shrinking back in response.</p><p>As that memory tempted him, as the words waited, once again at the tip of his tongue, he found himself once again unable to utter them.</p><p>Why? What could be holding him back?</p> <p>She stared up at him expectantly, waiting. She wasn\u2019t going to ask, and she wasn\u2019t going to beg for his love. He would give it willingly or she wasn\u2019t going to take it at all.</p><p>She wanted more than what he was giving her. It didn\u2019t take an extra or heightened sense of what she was thinking to figure that one out.</p><p>She was going to make him say the words, he thought, feeling his throat tighten at the thought of it. He hadn\u2019t said those words in a hell of a lot of years. More years than he often cared to remember. He didn\u2019t even know whether he was aware of how to say them now.</p><p>\u201cI missed you a lot,\u201d he tried, brushing his lips against her brow as she continued to stare back at him.</p><p>A backbone of pure steel, Timothy had once accused her. As stubborn and determined as the mountains themselves.</p><p>And she was at that. But his block against the emotion that he had lived with for so damned long was just as stubborn.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say it. He wanted to, but there was always the chance he could have the girl and protect his heart at the same time.</p><p>And that was important.</p> <p>Eve stared back at him for long moments, feeling a hint of nerves, a bit of uncertainty, but also a great capacity to love that he was still holding inside him like a miser held on to his gold.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t satisfied with that now. She wanted the love that he was still holding inside his soul like a captive he refused to release.</p><p>She wanted all of him, not just the parts of him that he was willing to give her right now. She wanted the heart he was so protective of, the one she knew belonged to her, yet that he kept just out of reach.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t satisfied with just knowing he cared about her. She didn\u2019t want to just sense those emotions held trapped inside him. They weren\u2019t going to do her any good if they weren\u2019t allowed to be free.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t get the words verbally, even though she could feel them as he stared back at her, then she wasn\u2019t going to accept any of it. She deserved much better. She deserved all of the man she loved, not just an awareness that he could love her if he let his emotions free.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to let it break her, though.</p><p>No matter how much it hurt, no matter how much she ached for him or how it would kill her to lose him, she wouldn\u2019t let it break her pride. There was no way to keep it from breaking her heart, but the rest of her emotions were salvageable.</p><p>Besides, if she was pregnant, her child would need a mother fully capable of caring for him. If he had to do without a father, then he at least needed more than just half a mother. Or a mother who couldn\u2019t forget that she had had to beg his father to love her.</p><p>He. She kept thinking of the baby as a he. Just as Christa, Chaya, and Kelly had claimed they had done with their daughters, she had already assigned a sex to the child she might have conceived.</p><p>As she stared up at Brogan, he laid his forehead against hers and closed his eyes as though he meant to nap a bit more this morning.</p><p>It was apparent he wasn\u2019t going to say a damned thing.</p><p>This time she didn\u2019t have to fight the tears back, though her chest tightened with aching regret. There were no tears filling her eyes; there was only acceptance\u2014an acceptance tinged with bitter regret.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to get up,\u201d she told him, pretending everything was fine. \u201cI have things to do this morning.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, watching her carefully, he let her go.</p><p>Uncertainty flickered in his gaze, and despite having sensed it in him before, she still found that small bit of vulnerability endearing. Brogan wasn\u2019t a man who admitted to any sort of weakness, and he would see uncertainty in any area as a weakness.</p><p>\u201cWill I see you this evening?\u201d she asked as she moved to the closet and pulled out a light blue casual chiffon skirt that fell just below her thighs, along with a loose matching camisole top.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d he answered, propping his hand on his palm as he watched her, his gray-blue eyes reflecting simmering lust. \u201cI may even be able to get away from the job early. We could go out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>He was willing to take her out now? Why now? Because he was afraid she wouldn\u2019t wait until he was ready to stake his claim? Her dinner with Chatham\u2014or Doogan, as Brogan had called him\u2014hadn\u2019t pleased him in the slightest.</p><p>Brogan was ready to stake a public claim on her now, while he was always willing to walk away from the more private claim.</p><p>Her jaw tightened in anger as she turned away from him and moved back to the closet, where she pulled free a pair of flat, strappy leather sandals. She was not going to let him see how hurt she was, or how angry. If he didn\u2019t want to own her heart, then screw him; she had no problem at all trying to take it back from him.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not back when you return, then I won\u2019t be much longer,\u201d she promised, fighting to keep her voice even, her tone casual.</p><p>The last thing she needed was for him to suspect her plans.</p><p>But if he thought she was going to hang around Pulaski County and watch him flit around like a buck in rut while all the women swarmed him, like they had since he\u2019d arrived, then he was crazed. She\u2019d be damned if she would have to deal with the smart-assed territorial women who seemed to think he was their own personal prize.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d Suspicion entered his gaze as well as his voice, though maybe he was finally figuring out that things weren\u2019t going to go all his way any longer.</p><p>\u201cI had a job offer.\u201d She shrugged as though it didn\u2019t matter, while she gathered clean underclothes together before heading to the shower. \u201cI\u2019m going to meet with the company\u2019s owner today so he can explain the job.\u201d</p><p>The offer had come from another of John Walker\u2019s friends from Boston the day before. He had enough of those to go around, it seemed. At first she hadn\u2019t been interested, until she had talked to her mother the night before.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this job, Eve?\u201d</p><p>Brogan could sense the ax getting ready to fall, and he could kick his own ass for letting it go this far.</p><p>Staring into his eyes moments ago, Eve had shown him more clearly than words what it would take to keep her, and he had ignored her.</p><p>Stubborn arrogance, his father called it, and now Brogan might very well pay for it.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d She laughed as though he should know. As though the question were moot.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is, outside Kentucky,\u201d he stated.</p><p>Eve turned around slowly to face him, and the answer was in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBoston.\u201d She confirmed his guess. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful opportunity. I\u2019ll be managing several offices and client lists. My degree is in business administration, and there are just so few\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Eve. . . .\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Shock registered on her face as she stared back at him as though she were certain she hadn\u2019t heard right.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Rising from the bed, he moved to her. Clasping her shoulders in his hands, he stared into the naked vulnerability of her gaze.</p><p>\u201cI said I love you, Eve,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI love you, heart and soul. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve fought it. Even before we spent that first night together, I\u2019ve known I loved you and that I couldn\u2019t bear to lose you. I sure as hell don\u2019t want you moving to Boston, where I\u2019m afraid I would lose you forever.\u201d</p><p>Joy exploded in her gaze, flushed her cheeks. Brogan swore he could feel it now: an explosion of heat and happiness that filled her entire consciousness and then whipped into his.</p><p>Before he\u2019d left for D.C., the Mackay cousins had detained him for a few hours. Somehow, Brogan had found himself trying to vocalize the confusing mix of emotions he always felt whenever he and Eve were in the same room. Dawg called it a mating. Natches called it a soul thing. Rowdy had laughed at all of them and told Brogan to prepare himself; it was this little thing called love.</p><p>Some couples\u2014most couples\u2014waited years and years before they developed the ability to read or to feel each other so well. Then there were those very few who touched each other so deeply, so perfectly that first time that the bond was almost immediate.</p><p>For the Mackay men and their wives it hadn\u2019t happened until each of their wives had conceived their first child. Each cousin swore it was the first time he felt his child kick. Connected as they were to their wives and, through their wives, to their children, that bond had kicked into place.</p><p>\u201cYou really love me?\u201d she whispered as he came to her and framed her face gently. \u201cYou really love me, Brogan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPast forever, Eve,\u201d he promised to her. \u201cHow could you doubt it? You\u2019ve felt it, the same as I have, since we spent that night together. I felt your heart touch mine, and I know mine touched yours. What else could it be but love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s love,\u201d she whispered, that explosion of happiness radiating from her soul to warm his own as she threw her arms around his neck and hung on tight. \u201cOh, God, Brogan, it\u2019s love.\u201d</p><p>A part of him had been dark for so many years, even before Candy. The deliberate destruction of his child had only cemented the bitterness that had raged in him for so long.</p><p>The moment he met Eve, he\u2019d felt light touch that darkness. Each time she touched him with her smile he had become even more vulnerable to her. He\u2019d become locked firmly beneath her spell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave patience with me?\u201d he whispered as he buried his face against her neck again, holding her close to his heart.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d she swore, and he was warmed by her heart touching his.</p><p>\u201cIt may take me a while.\u201d Closing his eyes, he prayed\u2014prayed he could keep the evil of his world from touching her. \u201cI promise to get the hang of it soon.\u201d He lifted his head from her neck; then his lips lowered, touched hers, and he belonged.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Eve,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>And her smile completed his dreams, filled his life with light, and once again Brogan knew hope.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Brogan Campbell. Forever and always. I love you.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>There was something about Eve, Brogan decided, that just made it impossible to maintain distance.</p> <p>She\u2019d declined the job offer before they had shared a shower, then cussed him out when she realized she was too sore to take him again. She\u2019d decided instead to make the trip to the store for the groceries her mother needed, kissed him with enough heat to damned near blow his tiny mind, then drove off.</p><p>Shaking his head at her particular brand of revenge, Brogan mounted the Harley, listened to the smooth throb of the motor, then pulled out of the inn\u2019s gravel parking lot and headed toward the Mackay Marina.</p><p>He\u2019d accomplished what they wanted; now he wondered what those three intended to do with, basically, a license to kill with impunity.</p><p>It would have been damned concerning if he didn\u2019t know the Mackays as well as he did.</p><p>Fortunately, he did know them that well, and he knew they weren\u2019t stupid men. They wouldn\u2019t risk the agreement, especially considering the compensatory package was for the single purpose of ensuring that nothing risked their ability to protect their family, friends, and the county itself from the undercurrents of treason and homeland terrorism, and the people who had been attempting to use the sheltering mountains as a cover for their activities.</p><p>The same thing he intended his own agreement for. He wasn\u2019t a stupid man either. While ensuring the Mackays\u2019 protection, he\u2019d taken steps to ensure his own, as well as that of any family he might have. How much more dedicated could a loving husband and father be?</p> <p>He intended to find out.</p><p>Pulling into the marina\u2019s nearly full parking lot, Brogan wasn\u2019t in the least surprised to see the three men leaning against Natches\u2019s black-on-black Mercedes Roadster, waiting for him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t look too damned happy with him either. Especially Dawg. Brogan was guessing Eve had gone to her brother for advice while he was gone. Not that he could blame her. It wasn\u2019t as though Brogan had been there for her, or had given her reason to believe he would return.</p><p>Pulling the Harley in behind the expensive little Roadster, he inhaled for strength. For a man who prided himself on never asking anyone for a damned thing personally, he was about to ask the Mackays for a hell of a favor.</p><p>Stepping from the bike, he moved the slight distance to the three men and stared back at them without so much as a hint of the nervousness he could feel in his gut. His nerves were on edge, a sense of foreboding that made no sense filling his gut.</p><p>As he stepped to them, the three men watched him with narrow-eyed suspicion.</p><p>\u201cDawg, Natches, Rowdy.\u201d He nodded in an attempt at politeness. \u201cBefore we take care of business, I need to ask a favor.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s gaze sparked with anger as the other two watched him with cool suspicion.</p> <p>\u201cSeen Eve since you got back?\u201d Dawg actually showed his teeth.</p><p>Brogan turned his gaze to Rowdy, usually the tolerant one of the group. There would be no hope there.</p><p>\u201cDawg, could you stop . . .\u201d being an ass, he wanted to say.</p><p>\u201cHave you stopped breaking her heart? Because once was too damned many times to hold my sister while she cried over your worthless ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still say, get the papers we need, then tie his feet to cement blocks and dump him in the middle of the lake,\u201d Natches grunted.</p><p>Brogan forcibly controlled his grin as he turned back to Dawg. As he started to speak, the door to the marina offices opened and Ray Mackay stood in the doorway. Dawg might be Eve\u2019s brother, but Ray was the acknowledged patriarch of the clan.</p><p>\u201cBrogan, son, is Dawg giving you problems?\u201d Ray shot Dawg a warning look.</p><p>\u201cSir, I\u2019ve been trying to ask Dawg to accept my request to marry his sister Eve, but he doesn\u2019t seem too inclined to let me get the words out.\u201d</p><p>Even Ray appeared completely shocked by the request.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Dawg said, the look in his eyes nearly dazed as he stared back at Brogan.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re trying to piss me off,\u201d Brogan decided. \u201cNow, while I\u2019m away from her, I\u2019d like to go to the bank and take my grandmother\u2019s ring out of the safe-deposit box I have there. But it will do no damned good if you refuse the request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dawg was still staring at Brogan as though uncertain whether he should believe him.</p><p>Brogan shoved his hands into the back pockets of his jeans to keep them away from Dawg\u2019s throat.</p><p>It would be simpler, easier to explain what he wanted, further, he decided.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother left me her engagement ring and her and my grandfather\u2019s wedding bands,\u201d he gritted out in irritation. \u201cBut I can give them to my fianc\u00e9e only if a male relative gives permission for her to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Dawg frowned. \u201cShe won\u2019t like wearing a ring your first fianc\u00e9e wore.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Dawg was just trying to piss him off; that was all it could be.</p><p>\u201cCandy never wore my grandmother\u2019s ring,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNo other woman has even seen it since my grandmother\u2019s death. Candy had no male relatives to ask, so I couldn\u2019t have done it even if she had known about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are ways around that.\u201d Natches grinned. \u201cYou could still have given it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, I didn\u2019t want to give it to her,\u201d Brogan snapped furiously before turning back to Dawg. \u201cYes or no, dammit. And if you say no, I\u2019ll show her the rings and tell her you\u2019re the reason she can\u2019t have them.\u201d</p><p>Dawg\u2019s eyes widened in mocking innocence. \u201cI never said such a thing as no, Brogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say yes, either.\u201d</p><p>Dawg grinned. \u201cHell, I didn\u2019t. Did I?\u201d</p><p>Brogan took a step toward him, intent on cracking the other man\u2019s jaw on his fist.</p><p>\u201cHow bad do you want that compensatory package, Dawg?\u201d he asked instead.</p><p>\u201cPretty damned bad.\u201d Dawg\u2019s eyes narrowed thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes then. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now, I don\u2019t know about that. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, you have my permission to marry her,\u201d Ray snapped, glaring at Dawg. \u201cYou want to see her cry again, moron?\u201d he asked with more playful affection than true anger.</p><p>\u201cI was going to give him permission,\u201d Dawg growled as he propped his hands on his hips and stared at his uncle with a fierce frown. \u201cThere was no damned sense in making it easy on him.\u201d</p><p>Brogan snorted at the smirk that curled Dawg\u2019s lips then as Brogan glared back at him.</p><p>As Brogan opened his lips to say something particularly insulting, Dawg\u2019s expression suddenly creased into one of concern a second before a blaring horn had the rest of them turning quickly. The two-year-old bright blue BMW barreled toward them quickly.</p><p>\u201cSamantha,\u201d Brogan shouted her name, sprinting toward the vehicle as it suddenly slammed into another parked car. Racing to the driver\u2019s side, his heart in his throat, he jerked the door open, only just barely catching his baby sister as she toppled from the vehicle.</p><p>Mackays were cursing as Brogan caught her in his arms, the sight of her blood matting her hair from a jagged gash in her scalp, a deep puncture to her shoulder, and a slice across the side of her neck that only narrowly missed her jugular. Glimpsed, but not ignored by Brogan was the sight of her partner, Kraig, in the passenger seat staring unseeingly into the window, half his face blown away.</p><p>Brogan felt his insides freeze to jagged chips of ice inside his soul as he heard Dawg ordering an ambulance to the marina.</p><p>\u201cBrogan,\u201d Samantha sobbed weakly, her normally tanned skin paper white. \u201cThey have her; he betrayed me, Brogan. He betrayed both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Samantha, who do they have? Who betrayed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKraig,\u201d she sobbed weakly as he tore the bottom of his shirt before folding it to apply pressure to the wound at her neck, where she was losing more blood than she could afford. \u201cI think I killed Kraig, Brogan.\u201d She stared up at him, her gaze feverish and dazed. \u201cI killed him, but he let them take her, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he wheezed, but he knew. He knew who had been taken even before she whispered the information. Samantha stared up at him miserably.</p><p>\u201cEve, I\u2019m so sorry, Brogan, I tried to stop them but they took Eve,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cShe was going into the grocery store when we pulled in. Judge Kiser\u2019s big white truck pulled up and his foreman jumped out and grabbed her. I tried to get out of the car and save her, but then Kraig pulled a knife on me. He sliced me pretty good until I could get a shot off. My phone got damaged in the fight\u2014thank God you told me you were meeting Dawg here,\u201d she whispered hoarsely as Brogan stared down at her and felt a darkness unlike anything he had ever known before fill his soul.</p><p>Brogan could hear Ray, Dawg, Rowdy, and Natches as they contacted Alex Jansen, John Walker, and Sheriff Zeke Mayes, and ordered them to the marina.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Brogan,\u201d Samantha cried weakly. \u201cPlease forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Samantha, I promise, I don\u2019t blame you,\u201d he managed to say through the awful buzzing that filled his mind.</p><p>\u201cSamantha. Samantha, sweetie.\u201d Dawg knelt beside them as he tore his own shirt from his back, folded it, and pressed it to her head wound. \u201cDid Kraig say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said you and Brogan would know why.\u201d She stared back at Brogan painfully. \u201cHe said I would be dead, but you would know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Samantha.\u201d He held her to him, cradling her against his chest as Dawg fought to stem the flow of blood from her wounds. \u201cYou\u2019ve never failed me, sweetheart.\u201d Brogan stared at Dawg, feeling nothing inside him, not even desperation.</p><p>Dawg blew out a hard breath. \u201cI should have known\u2014she told me DHS was watching Judge Kiser\u2019s home and suspected him of being part of the Freedom League with Dayle Mackay, before Dayle\u2019s death. I should have checked into it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did she tell you this?\u201d Brogan narrowed his eyes on Dawg. \u201cDHS has not had Judge Kiser under surveillance.\u201d</p><p>Dawg frowned back at him. \u201cEve overheard Jed talking about watching Kiser\u2019s house. She told me about it the other day at the family reunion.\u201d</p><p>The ambulance screamed into the marina followed by Zeke, Alex, and John Walker\u2019s vehicles. Immediately the EMTs surrounded Samantha and the dead Kraig still in the car.</p><p>\u201cFind her, Brogan,\u201d Samantha cried as the EMTs lifted her carefully to a gurney. \u201cThey\u2019re going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Agony threatened the ice that had his emotions in deep freeze, saving his sanity. As Brogan rose to his feet, Donny and Sandi pushed through the crowd surrounding them, and went straight to Dawg and pulled his attention to them as Donny hurriedly whispered something quickly in Dawg\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cBrogan, the office,\u201d Dawg ordered, staring around at the crowd. They moved quickly to the marina office, closing the door behind them as Dawg turned to Donny as Brogan glared at them. Donny shocked him, though, Donny and Sandi. They flashed their badges and identifications declaring them FBI Special Agents Clarke. Hell, they were married.</p><p>\u201cWe know where she\u2019s at,\u201d Sandi said in a coolly authoritative tone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brogan glared at Donny. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d \u201cSorry, Brogan,\u201d Donny sighed. \u201cWe had to hold our cover even with you. Though it was damned hard to hold the part the night you visited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he rasped again, his fists clenching furiously.</p><p>\u201cKiser\u2019s not involved with this,\u201d Sandi said quickly. \u201cHis foreman is another story. He was one of Chandler Mackay\u2019s partners. He believes Brogan has the coordinates of the stolen gold. He\u2019s holding Eve for the gold.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he rasped again, his fists clenching furiously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going in alone,\u201d Donny stated firmly, coolly. Before Brogan could stop himself he had a handful of the agent\u2019s shirt as he hauled him nearly off his feet, dragging him nose-to-nose with him.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you,\u201d he stated with an icy calm. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey stole the Nauti Buoy.\u201d Donny grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s currently anchored in the middle of the left fork of Lake Cumberland. Kiser\u2019s foreman, Kai Maynard, is a former Special Forces and one of his cohorts is a formerly dishonorably discharged Ranger named Joel Keller.\u201d</p><p>Brogan turned to a fuming Rowdy, the owner of the Nauti Buoy. \u201cHow do I get to that boat and how do I get on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting on it is easy,\u201d Rowdy answered. \u201cGetting to her is another thing, according to where they\u2019re holding her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our information she is on the first level, tied to one of the bunk beds on the right, in the hall,\u201d Donny stated.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you getting your information?\u201d Brogan snarled.</p><p>\u201cPoppa Bear\u2019s with them,\u201d Donny admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s been part of Kai\u2019s group for several years. Before that he was with Chandler Mackay. But he\u2019s always been a federal agent and informant.\u201d He gave Dawg and Brogan a hard look. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. Now do we get onto that fucking houseboat?\u201d</p><p>Brogan\u2019s gaze sharpened on the other man. \u201cKai has more than just Eve,\u201d he guessed in a dangerous voice. \u201cWhat does he have that the FBI is after?\u201d</p><p>Donny\u2019s lips tightened as Sandi whispered something to him. His gaze shifted to Brogan furiously as he gave a tight nod. Sandi stepped back. \u201cOne of the files Kai Maynard stole had a list of agent code names assigned to several subversive Homeland Security groups. If he gets away with that file, a lot of agents are going to die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a dead man,\u201d Brogan declared as he turned to Dawg. \u201cYou ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Dawg nodded, his smile savage. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>Eve sat on the bunk, her arms stretched above her and secured to the bottom of the metal bunk frame with a pair of handcuffs. Her fingers bit into the metal slats above her as she held onto them in an attempt to keep the pressure of the cuffs from tightening around her wrists each time her arms got tired and slipped. Not that holding them up by her fingertips tucked beneath the slats was really helping a lot.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, cutie pie.\u201d Poppa Bear gripped her shoulder and pulled her forward to tuck another pillow behind her without asking if that would make her more comfortable.</p><p>She glared at him, taking in the Santa look of the full head of gray hair and the well-trimmed beard and mustache of the same color.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered, staring up into the dark brown eyes that held a twinkle of a smile.</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes me happy,\u201d he laughed jovially.</p> <p>He may look like that jolly little elf, but she couldn\u2019t remember a single story where Santa took hostages or where he threatened to kill them. Unless that was fun and games in his off hours, she thought half hysterically.</p><p>This was just wonderful. She was definitely living on a much shorter time line than she had ever imagined and here she was worrying about Santa.</p><p>\u201cToo bad we lost Kraig,\u201d Kai grumbled as Poppa Bear moved back to his seat just inside the hall where he could keep an eye on her. \u201cHe\u2019d make a hell of a scapegoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we get the gold we\u2019ll just take care of both of them.\u201d Poppa Bear shrugged as he looked back at Eve, grinned and winked merrily. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sweetie, I\u2019ll make sure it don\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>She sneered back at him.</p><p>Yeah, that was a comforting thought. It just wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>Kai laughed at the other man\u2019s comment as Eve glimpsed him prowling about the other side of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it should take?\u201d Kai asked. \u201cI have to call them soon. I don\u2019t want anyone getting any ideas if they figure out we have the boat and where we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all depending on where that gold is.\u201d Poppa Bear shrugged. \u201cIt will take them a while to load it, though. Chandler never got it all transported after he stole it. Though, I\u2019d say Dawg can get it all in one haul in that heavy-duty delivery truck he has for the store if he can get it to wherever his daddy hid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad it wasn\u2019t hidden in the house.\u201d Kai grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI spent three nights searching that house after Chandler died.\u201d Poppa Bear sighed. \u201cIf it was there, it was hid so damned good that even my electronics couldn\u2019t find the shit.\u201d</p><p>What gold?</p><p>God, she hated this. If she ever got out of it alive and Brogan kept so much as one damned secret from her then she was going to end up shooting him.</p><p>Besides the fact she was way too damned nosy and hated, absolutely hated, not knowing what was going on, she had also not been prepared for Kai Maynard. Perhaps if she had known what was going on, she would have been prepared.</p><p>\u201cIf we could have gotten rid of Brogan\u2019s sister, then none of us would have been identified,\u201d Kai snapped, his anger obviously brewing. \u201cSon of a bitch, Bear, this is ridiculous. How the hell did he manage to fuck up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe warned him,\u201d Poppa Bear seemed to be reminding him. \u201cSamantha Bryce ain\u2019t no man\u2019s dummy. And her instincts are out of this world. She was already gettin\u2019 suspicious of him and he wouldn\u2019t hear it.\u201d</p><p>Kai muttered something that caused Poppa Bear to chuckle in amusement. \u201cJust \u2019cause she\u2019s a lesbian don\u2019t make her no dummy, Kai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, she\u2019s no dummy,\u201d Kai snapped, his tone hard and angry. \u201cKraig wasn\u2019t stupid either. So how did she manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you Kraig was underestimating her,\u201d Poppa Bear retorted, obviously becoming irritated. \u201cI even told Kraig and he wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid bastard,\u201d Kai cursed again. \u201cI should have called one of the men in from Illinois. They wouldn\u2019t have put up with her shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, us Southern boys just seem to have trouble believin\u2019 our womenfolk are as smart as we are.\u201d Poppa guffawed. \u201cIt ends up gettin\u2019 most of us hurt. Boys like Kraig end up gettin\u2019 killed.\u201d</p><p>Poppa Bear looked back at her, winked again, this time without the smile, but with a warning look instead before turning back to Kai.</p><p>\u201cGive \u2019em a call, Kai,\u201d Poppa Bear told him patiently. \u201cMake the call to Ray, he has a cooler head. Those boys just blow up and lose their senses when they get pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t it just break my heart that they\u2019re gonna get pissed,\u201d Kai sneered. \u201cSee if you can find that location scrambler for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I told you to keep it with you, Kai,\u201d Poppa Bear growled in irritation. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>Straightening from his chair Poppa Bear moved down the hall to the back bedroom. Watching him, Eve saw him going through the blankets on the bed before turning into the bathroom. Empty-handed, he moved back into the bedroom, started going through some bags then moments later gave a muffled \u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>Stepping back into the hall, he paused.</p><p>Pushing a small metal key quickly into her hand, he whispered so low she barely heard him. \u201cWait for the sign. Unlock. Go over back into water. Hear me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly.</p><p>Rising, he took a quick step away from her as she felt the cool light weight of the key in her curled fingers.</p><p>\u201cI got our location scrambler,\u201d Poppa Bear announced as he moved back into the kitchen. \u201cIs there anything else you need, young\u2019un?\u201d</p><p>Kai laughed fondly as he stepped to the other man and took the device.</p><p>\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Kai remarked. \u201cThat should be plenty of time for them to get everyone together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Poppa Bear agreed. \u201cMake sure old Dawg has plenty of help loadin\u2019 all that purty gold.\u201d</p><p>Eve watched as Kai plugged his phone into it then quickly made his call.</p><p>Location scrambler?</p><p>She knew it was possible to track cell phones, but strangely enough no one had taken her cell phone from her bag, nor had they turned it off. It was lying at the bottom of the bunk bed, and she prayed it was providing a beacon to the houseboat.</p><p>As she watched, Kai moved past Poppa Bear toward her as the phone rang.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Grandpa Ray answered the phone carefully.</p><p>\u201cRay Mackay?\u201d Kai asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour niece Eve wants to say hello,\u201d he spoke into the speaker phone. \u201cHere she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandpa? I\u2019m fine,\u201d she told him, avoiding Kai\u2019s cruel, hazel eyes. \u201cTell Brogan not to worry.\u201d</p><p>Kai pulled the phone back.</p><p>\u201cRay, if you ever want to see Eve alive again, then listen up. And tell your boys they better follow my directions exactly.\u201d He chuckled then. \u201cAnd tell Brogan to worry. \u2019Cause if they don\u2019t hurry, then I\u2019m going to have a little personal party with Ms. Mackay here. I\u2019ll show her how a real man fucks.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at Eve in leering lust before turning and pacing back to the front of the boat before he began conveying his \u201corders\u201d to Ray.</p><p>As Kai spoke, Poppa Bear moved back to the hall, turned, and mouthed \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Eve moved. Carefully turning the key in her fingers she inserted it into the lock and turned it carefully.</p><p>The cuffs clicked open.</p><p>Glancing up the hall again to see Poppa Bear\u2019s wide form blocking Kai\u2019s sight down the hall, she quickly slid from the bunk before slipping into the back room and moving nervously to the sliding glass door at the back.</p><p>Sliding it open just enough to slip onto the narrow deck, she edged over to the ladder that led into the water and quickly began descending.</p><p>The water was still chilly.</p><p>Summer hadn\u2019t gotten as hot as it normally did by now, but even then, the deeper waters took longer to warm.</p><p>Not quite icy but definitely uncomfortable, the water washed over her ankles, her knees as she glanced up quickly, all too aware of the two men Kai had directed onto the top deck of the houseboat.</p><p>Thankfully, the overhang from the second floor and deck roof provided just enough protection that they wouldn\u2019t see her easing into the water, but after she got into the cold lake, there would be no swimming for shore.</p><p>The water lapped over her waist, causing a shiver to wash up her spine as she ran out of ladder and finished lowering herself by holding onto the ladder\u2019s rungs with her hands.</p><p>She was at the last rung, thinking desperately, trying to figure out how to hide when a hard hand suddenly capped over her mouth.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cHello, baby,\u201d Brogan whispered at her ear. \u201cReady to go hide with me?\u201d</p><p>Relief rushed through her with tidal wave force, sucking the strength from her knees and making her damned glad she didn\u2019t need them right now.</p><p>As he helped her, she turned in his arms, feeling the wetsuit he wore and seeing the oxygen tank on his back, the rebreather on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going under the boat,\u201d he explained quickly. \u201cOn three take a deep breath. One. Two. Three.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They went under as a sudden shout exploded from inside the houseboat.</p><p>Holding on to Brogan she was surprised when he ducked straight under the houseboat then resurfaced beneath it in the cavity created between the two floaters the boat was built on.</p><p>Brogan wasn\u2019t alone.</p> <p>As they resurfaced Dawg was suddenly pushing a diving tank over her arms as Brogan held her up, his hands gripping her waist.</p><p>Natches and Rowdy were behind him, Chaya behind them.</p><p>\u201cRemember how to use this?\u201d Dawg asked quickly as a regulator was attached and Natches ducked under the water.</p><p>She nodded quickly.</p><p>A second later fins were being pushed on her feet as Brogan quickly fitted the weight belt around her waist.</p> <p>\u201cGo with Chaya. Once they can\u2019t find you they\u2019ll start the motor and we\u2019ll all be in trouble if you\u2019re not out of here,\u201d Dawg growled.</p><p>\u201cBrogan . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get him killed, Eve,\u201d Dawg snapped. \u201cGo with Chaya now.\u201d He pushed the regulator between her lips.</p><p>\u201cLove you, Eve. Always,\u201d Brogan whispered at her ear before Dawg pushed her beneath the surface and Chaya grabbed her hand, pulling her out of the way.</p><p>It was like a war zone under the water, she thought in amazement as Chaya continued to drag her out of the way.</p><p>Brogan, Dawg, Rowdy, Natches, and Chaya weren\u2019t the only ones beneath the cool surface.</p> <p>Deep enough beneath the boat for safety and to ensure they weren\u2019t seen, two underwater propelled, sled-like vehicles waiting with two frogmen outfitted with military rebreathers such as the ones Brogan and the Mackays were wearing.</p><p>Of course, Eve hadn\u2019t been that lucky. She couldn\u2019t see, couldn\u2019t hear anything going on. All she could do was hold on to Chaya as the other woman directed her while unclipping an underwater propulsion device from her waist belt and activating it.</p><p>Immediately they were drawn through the water as Eve saw the first lines of water being split from bullets firing into the depths. And all she could do was worry and pray.</p><p>Two minutes flat, Brogan thought in disgust as he surveyed the interior of the Nauti Buoy. Kai was dead, and unfortunately Poppa Bear had been wounded. The bullet he\u2019d taken in the leg would put him out of commission for a while.</p><p>The three men that had been on the upper deck had been taken out in twenty seconds flat with only a few wild shots getting off.</p><p>Two were only badly wounded; one was dead.</p><p>Staring down at Kai\u2019s body he felt the irritation rising inside him.</p><p>\u201cFuckers say they don\u2019t know anything,\u201d Dawg announced as he came from the makeshift interrogation room the upper bedroom had been turned into. \u201cTimothy\u2019s having a boat dispatched, it should be here in about five minutes to haul their asses to the nearest Homeland Security holding cell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBye-bye, bad guys,\u201d Brogan muttered.</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d Dawg snapped, turning back to him, his hands propping on his hips as he stared at the bloody mess that had been made of Kai. \u201cHell, the girls are going to make us clean up this mess, you know?\u201d</p><p>Brogan shrugged. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>Dawg laughed. An amused, evil laugh that had Brogan staring back at him askance. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll get to have fun with us, ole boy, you just watch. Chaya will have taken Eve straight to Kelly, Christa, Janey, and Rogue, and she\u2019ll be given the full lowdown on how things work. And trust me, those girls stick together like glue against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Eve\u2019s future husband isn\u2019t an asshole.\u201d Brogan grinned confidently. \u201cSo have fun without me.\u201d</p><p>Dawg chuckled at the declaration. \u201cYou know, Brogan, it\u2019s going to be fun watching you learn the ropes. Lots and lots of fun.\u201d</p><p>The look on his face wasn\u2019t one of amusement, though. Brogan couldn\u2019t help the trepidation that slowly rose inside him at the pure anticipation that filled Dawg\u2019s, Rowdy\u2019s, and Natches\u2019s gaze.</p><p>And he really hoped they were wrong.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>She prayed.</p><p>She paced the marina office even though she could hear everything coming through the radio Chaya manned and knew they were okay. She hadn\u2019t really believed it until Brogan had walked through the door.</p><p>He caught her as she threw herself at him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t clean blood out of houseboats,\u201d he suddenly hissed at her ear. \u201cYou hear me, Eve? It\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me home.\u201d She buried her head in his shoulder and held on tight, praying he didn\u2019t catch the smirk at her lips. \u201cJust take me home.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t exactly take her home. They stepped into one of the Lake Patrol\u2019s boats and once she was strapped in, felt the speed of the craft as its nose lifted and flew over the water.</p><p>Before long, it was turning up a long tributary, working its way through a series of twists and turns, sandbars and fallen trees that turned out to be automated blocks easily opened when using the right electronic device.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long to reach the cabin retreat Brogan had taken her to before. And much, much less time for him to carry her to the bedroom.</p><p>She\u2019d showered and changed clothes at the marina, while he\u2019d showered and changed on the Nauti Buoy with the others.</p><p>He paid little attention to the pretty skirt and blouse she wore, though he did give her an appreciative look when he glimpsed the lacy white bra and panties. Two seconds before he all but tore them off her.</p><p>His own clothes were disposed of just as quickly and when he tossed the last sock aside he hooked her around the waist and dragged her immediately to the extrawide bed, pulling her beneath him.</p><p>His lips came down on her as his hands caressed down her arms, her hips, one sliding between her thighs and finding her already wet and wild for him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he growled, moving over her.</p><p>The wives had warned her to expect this. She\u2019d been in danger, and his male instincts would go crazy until he had her again, marked her in some alpha male way, and assured himself she was alive and all his.</p><p>Then he would be normal again, she was promised.</p><p>Spreading her thighs with his knees, his fingers gripping the base of his cock, he pressed the engorged head against the slick folds of her pussy and began pressing inside.</p><p>Immediately, curling heat and that pleasure-pain ecstasy began to overtake her.</p><p>Lifting her knees to clasp his hips as her own arched into the penetration, Eve felt the sudden remnants of despair and grief, love and pain, joy and pleasure.</p><p>His emotions.</p><p>His fears and his pleasure.</p><p>They moved into her, over her, mixing with her own as her pussy slowly stretched around his cock, working open to accept the width of him.</p><p>Each thrust pushed him deeper, stretched her internal muscles, and caressed oversensitive nerve endings and delicate tissue. Each time his cock plunged inside her, pushing in till the hilt of his erection met the clenched entrance before he was moving again.</p><p>Pulling back, thrusting inside her with increasingly quick thrusts, burying inside her again and again as the pleasure rose, slamming through her senses again and again.</p><p>Coming over her, his lips covering hers as he fucked her desperately, his hips twisting, thrusting, stroking her internally with such heated pleasure Eve felt herself rapidly teetering on the edge of bliss.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he groaned against her lips.</p><p>Her lashes lifted, her eyes immediately meeting his.</p><p>She was being dragged into a chaotic whirlwind of pure sensation.</p><p>Pushed from the edge, ecstasy surging through her as she began to unravel beneath him, her release exploding through her with rapid pulses as he thrust deep inside her, stilled, and the throbbing heat of his release began spurting inside her and mixing with hers.</p><p>They cried out, meeting, merging, and with a sense of shock, Eve felt his soul open to hers and felt them entwining in such rapture she lost herself to him.</p><p>But, he lost himself to her as well.</p><p>Holding tight inside her, his body trembling, rapture lashing him as he felt his lover, his other half, heart and soul, Brogan knew he\u2019d never be lost again.</p><p>There would always be a port in a storm. There would always be a partner to share the joy, as well as the grief with.</p><p>There would always be Eve and Brogan.</p><p>\u201cI love you. . . .\u201d</p><p>They whispered the words as one. </p> </body></html>"]
