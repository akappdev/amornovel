It had already been a long day and the last thing I wanted to do was to run out and buy even more food, but the guys always wanted to eat. Jeff hadn\u2019t given me any extra beer money and I didn\u2019t want to ask him\u2014not with his money troubles. It wasn\u2019t like I paid rent. For a guy whose entire mission in life was to smoke pot and play video games, my brother Jeff had done a lot for me over the past three months. I owed him and I knew it.</p><p>I\u2019d already grabbed some beer and ground beef that\u2019d been on sale. I\u2019d planned on burgers, buns and chips for the two of us, but I always made extra, for leftovers. Gabby had given me a watermelon she\u2019d picked up in Hermiston that weekend. I even had a big potato salad all made up for the potluck after work tomorrow. I\u2019d have to stay up late making another one but I could handle that.</p><p>I smiled, thankful something in my life was going right. Less than a minute to plan and I\u2019d figured out a meal\u2014might not be gourmet, but it wouldn\u2019t embarrass Jeff either.</p> <p>I pulled up next to the bikes, careful to leave them plenty of room. I\u2019d been terrified of the Reapers the first time they\u2019d come over. Anyone would be. They looked like criminals, all tattooed and wearing black leather vests covered in patches. They cussed and drank and could be rude and demanding, but they\u2019d never stolen or broken anything. Jeff had warned me about them lots of times but he also considered them friends. I\u2019d decided he was exaggerating about the danger, for the most part. I mean Horse was dangerous enough, but not because of any criminal activity...</p><p>Anyway, I think Jeff did some web design for them or something. Some kind of business. Why a motorcycle club needed a website I had no idea, and the one time I\u2019d asked him about it he told me not to ask.</p><p>Then he\u2019d scuttled off to the casino for two days.</p><p>I got out of the car and went around back to grab the groceries, almost scared to see whether Horse\u2019s bike was in the lineup. I wanted to see him so bad it hurt but wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d say if I did. It\u2019s not like he\u2019d answered my text messages. But I couldn\u2019t help myself, I had to check for him, so I grabbed my groceries and walked over to the bikes to scope them out before going inside.</p><p>I don\u2019t know much about bikes, but I knew enough to recognize his. It\u2019s big and sleek and black. Not all bright and decorated the way you sometimes see bikes on the freeway. Just big and fast, with giant, fat tailpipes off the back and more testosterone than should be legal.</p><p>The motorcycle was almost as beautiful as the man who rode it. Almost.</p> <p>My heart stopped when I saw that bike, right on the end. I wanted to touch it, see if the leather of the seat was as smooth as I remembered, but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to do that. I didn\u2019t have the right. I really shouldn\u2019t even be excited to see him, but I felt a rush knowing he was right inside my trailer. Things weren\u2019t smooth between us and I honestly didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d even acknowledge me. For a while he\u2019d seemed almost like my boyfriend. The last time I\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d scared the crap out of me.</p><p>Even scary, the man made my panties wet.</p><p>Tall, built, with shoulder-length hair he kept pulled back in a ponytail, and thick black stubble on his face. Stark, tribal cuffs ringed his wrists and upper arms. And what a face... Horse was handsome, like movie star handsome. I\u2019d bet he had women coming out his ears, and the fact that he\u2019d spent more than one night in my bed made me all too aware that his beauty wasn\u2019t just above the belt. The thought of his below-belt assets led to a brief but intense fantasy about him, me, my bed and some chocolate syrup.</p><p>Yum.</p><p>Shit. Dessert. I needed dessert for tonight. Horse loved sweets. Were there any chocolate chips? I could do cookies, so long as there was enough butter. Please don\u2019t let him be pissed at me, I prayed silently, even though I was pretty sure God wasn\u2019t interested in prayers where the promise of fornication played such a prominent role. I reached the door and juggled the bags, sliding most of them onto my right arm so I could turn the handle. I walked in and looked around the living room.</p><p>Then I screamed.</p><p>My baby brother knelt in the center of the room, beaten raw and dripping blood all over the carpet. Four men wearing Reapers\u2019 cuts stood around him. Picnic, Horse and two I didn\u2019t know\u2014a big, built hunk of a man with a mohawk, tattoos on his skull and about a thousand piercings, and another who was tall and cut, with light-blond hair in short spikes. Horse studied me with the same cool, almost blank expression he wore when we first met. Detached.</p><p>Picnic studied me too. He was tall with short, dark hair that looked far too stylish to be on a biker and bright blue eyes that pierced right through a girl\u2014I\u2019d met him at least five times. He was the club president. He had a great sense of humor, carried pictures of his two teenage girls to flash whenever he got the slightest opportunity and had helped me shuck corn the last time he\u2019d come to visit.</p> <p>Oh, and he also stood right behind my brother with a gun pointed at the back of his head.</p><p>June 16\u2014Twelve weeks earlier</p><p>\u201cMarie, you did the right thing,\u201d Jeff said, holding an ice pack to my cheek. \u201cThat cocksucker deserves to die. You will never, ever regret leaving him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I replied, miserable. He was right\u2014why hadn\u2019t I left Gary earlier? We\u2019d been high school sweethearts, married at nineteen and by the time I hit twenty I already knew I\u2019d made a terrible mistake. It took until now, five years later, to realize just how terrible.</p><p>Today he\u2019d backhanded me right across the face.</p><p>After that, it only took another ten minutes to do what I hadn\u2019t managed in all our time together. I threw my clothes in my suitcase and left his abusive, cheating ass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of glad he did it,\u201d I said, looking down at the scarred formica table in my mom\u2019s trailer. She was taking a little vacation at the moment in jail. Mom\u2019s life is complicated.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Marie?\u201d Jeff asked, shaking his head. \u201cYou\u2019re f**ked in the head, talking like that.\u201d</p><p>My brother loved me, but he wasn\u2019t exactly a poet. I offered him a wan smile.</p><p>\u201cI stayed with him for way too long, just taking it. I think I might have stayed forever. But when he hit me, it\u2019s like it woke me up. I went from being terrified of leaving to just not caring anymore. Honestly, I don\u2019t care, Jeff. He can keep everything\u2014the furniture, the stereo, all that shit. I\u2019m just glad to get out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, you can stay here as long as you need to,\u201d he said, gesturing around the singlewide. It was small and dank and smelled kind of like pot and dirty laundry, but I felt safe here. This had been my home for most of my life, and while it might not have been a picture-perfect childhood, it hadn\u2019t been too bad for a couple of white-trash kids whose dad took off before they hit grade school.</p><p>Well, good until Mom blew out her back and started drinking. Things went downhill after that. I looked around the singlewide, trying to think. How was this going to work?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any money,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t pay you rent. Not until I get a job. Gary never put my name on the bank account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k, Marie? Rent?\u201d Jeff asked again, shaking his head. \u201cThis is your house too. I mean, it\u2019s a shithole, but it\u2019s our shithole. You don\u2019t pay rent here.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him, a real smile this time. Jeff might be a stoner who spent ninety percent of his life playing video games, but he had a heart. Suddenly I felt such incredible love for him that I couldn\u2019t keep it in. I dropped the ice and launched myself at him, giving him a fierce hug. He wrapped his arms around me awkwardly, returning it even though I could tell it confused and frightened him a little.</p><p>We\u2019ve never been a touchy-feely kind of family.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jeff,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d he muttered, pulling away from me nervously, but he wore a little smile. He walked over to the counter, opened a drawer and pulled out a little glass pipe and a baggie of weed.</p><p>\u201cYou want some?\u201d he asked. Yup, Jeff loved me. He didn\u2019t share with just anyone. I laughed and shook my head.</p> <p>\u201cPass. I\u2019ve gotta start job hunting tomorrow morning. Don\u2019t want to flunk a drug test.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and walked into the living room\u2014which was also the dining room, the entryway and the hallway\u2014to sit on the couch. A second later his ginormous big-screen TV flickered to life. He clicked through the channels until he hit wrestling, not the sport but the kind where they wear funny costumes and it\u2019s like a soap opera. Gary was probably watching the same thing back at our house. Jeff took a couple hits and then set down the pipe and his favorite death\u2019s-head Zippo on the coffee table. Then he grabbed his laptop and flipped it open.</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>Jeff\u2019d always been the shit when it came to computers. I had no idea what he did to earn money\u2014although I suspected he did as little of it as he could get away with and not starve. Most people, Gary included, thought he was a loser. Maybe he was. But I didn\u2019t care, because whenever I\u2019d needed him, he\u2019d been there for me. And I\u2019ll always be here for him, I promised myself. Starting by getting the place cleaned up and buying some real food. So far as I could tell, the man lived on pizza, Cheetos and peanut butter.</p><p>Some things never changed.</p><p>It took a lot of work to get the trailer clean but I enjoyed every minute of it. I missed Mom, of course, but I have to admit (if only to myself) that the place was a lot more comfortable without her around. She\u2019s a terrible cook, she keeps the shades closed and she never flushes the toilet.</p> <p>Oh, and everything she touches turns to utter chaos and drama.</p><p>Jeff doesn\u2019t flush the toilet either, but for some reason it didn\u2019t bother me as much. Probably because he\u2019d not only given me the bigger bedroom, he\u2019d also shoved a surprisingly large wad of bills into my purse that first morning and kissed me on the forehead for luck when I went out job hunting. I needed to find work despite sporting a nasty bruise on my face from Gary\u2019s little love tap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna kick ass, sis,\u201d Jeff said, rubbing his eyes. I was touched he\u2019d gotten out of bed to see me off. He wasn\u2019t exactly a morning person. \u201cBuy me some beer on the way home? And some of those coffee filter thingies... I ran out, and now I\u2019m outta paper towels too. I don\u2019t know if TP will cut it and I need my caffeine.\u201d</p><p>I winced.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the shopping,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cAnd the cooking,\u201d I added, glancing toward the kitchen sink, which was piled high with dishes. And pots. And something green that might just hold the cure for cancer...</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered, then turned and stumbled back toward his room.</p><p>Now it was two weeks later and things were looking up. For one, I\u2019d made enough progress in the house that I wasn\u2019t afraid to sit on the toilet any longer, or use the shower. My next project was the yard, which hadn\u2019t been mowed in at least two years. I\u2019d also gotten a job at the Little Britches Daycare, which was run by my old friend Cara\u2019s mom, Denise. Cara and I had fallen out of touch when she\u2019d gone to college, but I\u2019d seen her mom around occasionally and always asked after her. Cara\u2019d worked her way through law school and had a job in New York at some hot-shit firm. Her mom showed me pictures sometimes and Cara looked like a TV lawyer to me, all designer suits and fancy shoes.</p><p>Not me though. I\u2019d had grades as good as hers, but I\u2019d been in looooove with Gary, so I blew off college. Great thinking.</p> <p>Anyway, Denise asked cautiously if I was still with Gary, eyeing the foundation I\u2019d spackled over my bruise. I told her about my new living arrangements and that was that.</p><p>So I had a job now and while it didn\u2019t pay much, I liked working with the kids and had even started doing some babysitting in the evenings for different families who brought their children to Little Britches during the day. Jeff loved having me around because I cooked and cleaned and did the laundry. I\u2019d done all that for Gary too, but he never said thanks.</p><p>Nope, he just bitched about how I\u2019d done it wrong.</p><p>Then he\u2019d gone off and f**ked his whore.</p><p>I got off work at three that day, so I came home and made bread. Over the years I\u2019ve perfected my technique\u2014I start with a basic French bread recipe, but I add a ton of garlic, Italian herbs, five different kinds of cheeses and an egg-white glaze. The recipe makes two big loaves and I planned to serve it with spaghetti topped with fresh tomatoes from Denise\u2019s garden and my signature spinach salad. Of course we couldn\u2019t even come close to eating that much bread, but I planned to take the second loaf to work tomorrow for the girls.</p><p>Denise had a huge garden behind the center, and she\u2019d told me to help myself. I planned to take advantage of it as much as I could before the season turned. I had this fantasy that I\u2019d do some canning but it probably wasn\u2019t realistic. I\u2019d left all my equipment at Gary\u2019s place, and I wasn\u2019t ready to go back there. He hadn\u2019t gotten in touch with me since I left (which made me happy), and I\u2019d heard around town that he\u2019d already moved Misty Carpenter into our bed (which made me want to puke). </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I liked to think of Misty as THE WHORE, which I wrote in all caps for all emphasis whenever I texted someone.</p><p>I set the bread out to rise on a tray on our old picnic table outside and decided to get going on the weeds around the porch. It was hot, so I popped on a bikini top (which I must say, I filled out nicely, despite my smallish cup size). I grabbed some old work gloves I\u2019d found in the shed and poured myself some iced tea, rolling down the windows on my car so could I blast the radio. Then I set out to commit some serious acts of violence against all weed-kind.</p><p>Half an hour later the weeds seemed to be winning so I decided to take a break. I climbed up on top of the picnic table, resting my feet on the bench seat on one side and lying back with my arms over my head, dangling off the far side. It felt fantastic to be so relaxed and free in my own yard without a care in the world.</p><p>Naturally, that\u2019s when all the bikers showed up.</p> <p>I heard them coming, of course, although not as early as you\u2019d think\u2014I had the music cranked pretty high. I didn\u2019t realize we had company until they were about halfway down our long driveway, which wound through our landlord\u2019s orchard. I sat up and leaned back on my hands as they pulled closer, dumbfounded. Usually I liked the fact that we lived in the middle of nowhere without neighbors. Now I felt very alone.</p><p>Who were these guys?</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to me that I was glistening with sweat and wearing a bikini top until they turned off the bikes, pulled off their helmets and turned to scope me out. To make my own personal clich\u00e9 perfect, Def Leppard\u2019s Pour Some Sugar on Me blasted through the radio. I winced\u2014I must look like a white-trash princess from hell, basking outside my trailer in a bikini to outdated butt rock. I actually felt their eyes crawling over me, and while all three seemed to appreciate the view, it was the one in the middle who really caught my attention. The man was big. I don\u2019t just mean tall (which he was\u2014he had to be nearly six and a half feet compared to my petite five foot four) but large. Broad shoulders, muscular arms with tattooed tribal cuffs around his wrists and biceps. I\u2019d bet I couldn\u2019t put my two hands around those arms, and thick thighs I wanted to squeeze...and maybe lick.</p><p>He got off his bike and walked toward me, eyes holding mine hostage. I felt a startling flush of warmth between my legs. I\u2019d gone a long time without feeling sexual at all, to be honest. The last few years with Gary had been frustrating at best and painful at worst. But something about the way this biker swaggered, taking up space and the very air around him with his presence, caught me off guard and knocked me right in the...</p><p>Well, you know.</p> <p>My ni**les hardened and I swayed a little as he stopped, reaching out with one finger to trace my collarbone from my shoulder inward, then running it down between my br**sts, grazing the sides. He raised it to his mouth, tasting my sweat. He smelled like motor oil and sex.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweet butt,\u201d he said. That broke the spell. Sweet butt? What the hell kind of guy called a girl he\u2019d never met something like that? \u201cYour man here? We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled backward off the table, away from him, nearly falling off in the process. The music stopped abruptly, and I glanced away from him to see that one of his buddies had reached into my car and pulled out my car keys. He put them in his pocket. Uh oh.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Jeff? He\u2019s in town,\u201d I replied, trying to compose myself. Shit, should I have admitted I was alone? I really didn\u2019t have a choice. I mean, I could have said I needed to go get Jeff from inside and then locked the door, but the trailer was thirty years old. The deadbolt had been rusted shut since I was a kid. Not to mention that they had my keys. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait out here while I call him?\u201d</p><p>The big man studied me, his face cold and expressionless. I couldn\u2019t be entirely sure he was human, I decided. More like a Terminator. Unwilling to hold his gaze, I let my eyes drop to his vest. Beat to hell, black leather, lots of patches. One of them caught my attention in particular, a bright red diamond that had a number one with a percent sign next to it. I didn\u2019t know what it meant, but I was pretty sure I wanted to get into the house and put on some more clothing.</p> <p>Maybe a burkha.</p><p>\u201cSure thing, babe,\u201d he said, straddling the table\u2019s bench and taking a seat. His friends sauntered over to join him.</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink, girl?\u201d one of them asked, a tall man with short dark hair and startling blue eyes. I nodded and walked quickly toward the trailer, using every bit of my self-control not to break into a run. I heard them laughing behind me. Not a friendly laugh.</p><p>Thankfully, Jeff actually answered his phone on the first try.</p><p>\u201cThere are some guys here to see you,\u201d I said, peeking out through the kitchen window, careful to keep the faded curtains decorated with pictures of little flying vegetables closed. \u201cThey\u2019re bikers. I think they might be dangerous. They look like murderers to me, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m crazy on this one. Tell me I\u2019m being paranoid, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d Jeff replied. \u201cThat\u2019s the Reapers MC, Marie, and they don\u2019t f**k around. Do what they say, but don\u2019t get too close to them. Whatever you do, don\u2019t touch them or talk to them unless they talk to you first. Don\u2019t even look at them. Just stay the hell out of their way. I\u2019ll be home in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s an MC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotorcycle club. Stay calm, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Jeff hung up on me.</p><p>Now I was really scared. I\u2019d expected him to laugh at me and tell me they were just harmless guys who liked to ride their bikes and play badass. I guess this was the real thing. I ran into my room and pulled on a baggy t-shirt I liked to sleep in. I dropped my shorts and put on a pair of capris, pulling my long, dark-brown hair back into a messy bun. A quick look in the mirror was enough to convince me that I was worrying too much\u2014they might have been crude and suggestive toward me, but I was no man\u2019s dream girl. I had dirt smudges on my face, my nose had burned bright red and I\u2019d somehow gotten a giant scratch across my cheek. It contrasted nicely with the fading yellow and purple of the bruise Gary\u2019d given me.</p><p>My hands trembled as I poured three big plastic tumblers of iced tea, wondering if I should put sugar in them. I decided to bring some sugar in a cup and stuck a spoon in it. Then I wedged two of the tumblers between my right arm and my torso, grabbing the third with my hand. I snagged the sugar with my left and managed to get through the door with some careful maneuvering. They were talking to each other in low voices when I came out, watching me as I walked to the table. I pasted a bright smile on my face, just like I used to wear when I waitressed back in high school. I could do this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou call your man?\u201d the big one asked. I glanced at him, forgetting I was supposed to avoid his gaze because his eyes were so deep and rich and green.</p><p>\u201cMy man?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cJensen.\u201d</p><p>Shit, I forgot about that. They thought I was Jeff\u2019s girlfriend. Should I tell them? I couldn\u2019t decide. I studied the biker, trying to figure out the safest answer. He met my gaze without giving anything away. His hair was pulled back in a rough ponytail and his chin was covered with thick, dark stubble. My stupid body came alert again as I wondered what that stubble would feel like if I rubbed my lips against it slowly.</p> <p>Probably pretty damned good.</p><p>\u201cGirlie, answer the f**kin\u2019 question,\u201d said the blue-eyed man. I jumped, splashing some of the tea against the front of my shirt. It drenched my right boob, of course, and my nipple came to instant attention when the icy drink hit it. The big guy\u2019s eyes followed it, his eyes darkening.</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s coming,\u201d I said, managing not to stutter. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be here in twenty minutes. I\u2019ve got tea for you,\u201d I added inanely. Big Guy reached out and took the cup from my hand. That left me in a bind because I couldn\u2019t unload the other two glasses without my other hand free. I could either give him the sugar or I could lean past him and put it on the table. I was pretty sure I didn\u2019t want to do that.</p><p>He solved the problem for me, reaching out again and wrapping his fingers around one of the cups I held clasped against my body. I felt all sorts of tingles as they slid between the cold plastic and my skin, standing frozen as he repeated the gesture. Then he took the sugar. He caught my hand and pulled me up against his thigh, until my stomach almost touched his face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>He reached up to take my chin, turning my face so he could study the bruise. I held my breath, willing him not to ask me about it. He didn\u2019t. Instead, he dropped his hand to my waist, rubbing down and up slowly along the curve of my hip. It took everything I had not to lean in and push my br**sts into his face.</p><p>\u201cJensen do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Dammit. I had to tell them, I couldn\u2019t let it look like Jeff hurt me. He didn\u2019t deserve that.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019d never do that. Jeff\u2019s my brother,\u201d I said quickly, jerking away, blushing. Then I turned and ran into the house.</p><p>They sat at the table drinking their tea and talking until Jeff got home. It felt like he took hours, even though he made it in record time. At one point the big guy reached over and peeked under the towel covering the bread dough, which was in danger of rising way too high if I didn\u2019t get it into the oven soon.</p><p>Crap.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t going out there though. Not until they were gone.</p><p>Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t seem to be in the mood to leave. When Jeff rolled up in his aging Firebird they all stood around and talked for a while. Then they got up and walked toward our front door. Big Guy glanced toward my window and even though I knew he couldn\u2019t possibly see me, his eyes seemed to lock on mine.</p><p>As they came inside, Jeff was smiling and looking relaxed. The others were too. Everything was friendly and I frowned, wondering if I\u2019d imagined just how serious he\u2019d been with me on the phone.</p><p>\u201cSis, my associates are going to stay for dinner,\u201d he announced grandly. \u201cYou better go get your bread, I think it\u2019s done rising. You guys are gonna love this, Marie\u2019s bread is amazing. She\u2019ll fix you a f**kin\u2019 great dinner.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him a little shakily, cussing him out in my head. What the hell? Sure, I cooked for him, but I didn\u2019t want to cook for this group. They scared me, which combined oddly with my disobedient body\u2019s desire to jump Big Guy\u2019s bones. I couldn\u2019t think of a way out of it though, not without breaking our little pretense that there was nothing weird about three scary biker dudes showing up out of nowhere.</p><p>Not only that, the bread would be ruined if I didn\u2019t cook it soon. I had spaghetti sauce simmering on the stove and it smelled amazing. I couldn\u2019t even claim it was too hot to use the oven because we had a couple of those little window air conditioners chugging along like the Little Engine That Could, so the interior was pretty comfortable. The men settled themselves in the living room, except for Big Guy, who pulled out one of the stools at the kitchen bar, which was also our table. He sat down, leaning back against the wall comfortably, arms crossed in front of him.</p><p>He\u2019d be able to watch me cook the whole time while still following the action in the living room.</p><p>I ran out to get the bread while Jeff turned on the TV. When I got back there was some kind of fighting on. Not wrestling this time, but real fighting in some sort of cage.</p> <p>\u201cGrab us some beers, sweet butt,\u201d said the third guy, a dark-haired man with slightly pock-marked cheeks. I bit my lip. I really didn\u2019t like being called that. Not only was it degrading, there was some sort of nasty implication in the way he said it. But Jeff glanced up at me and mouthed \u201cplease\u201d, so I set down the bread, went to the fridge and pulled out four beers. They ignored me for the most part while I fixed dinner, except for my Big Guy. Every few minutes I\u2019d look up to find him watching me, pensive. He didn\u2019t smile, he didn\u2019t talk to me, nothing. Just studied me, with special attention for my boobs (smaller than some but perkier than most) and ass (slightly larger than I\u2019d like).</p><p>I grabbed a beer for myself, relaxing after a while and rolling with it. I supposed I should be indignant that he just sat there, blatantly checking me out, but it felt kind of good to have a man appreciate me.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time.</p><p>By the time I pulled the bread out of the oven the fight on TV had ended. I set out some hot pads for the pasta and sauce and grabbed the salad. The guys fell on the food like a bunch of starving animals.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d the man with blue eyes said, as if seeing me as a person for the first time. He had strong, sculpted features and I decided he was pretty hot for an old guy. \u201cYou can really cook. My old lady used to cook like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, hoping I wasn\u2019t blushing. This might go down as the oddest dinner party of my life, but I loved to cook for people who appreciated good food. In fact, during high school I\u2019d planned on going to culinary school.</p><p>Thanks for nothing, Gary.</p><p>Big Guy didn\u2019t say anything, but I noticed he took seconds and then thirds of everything. While they finished, I started cleaning up, but he reached across the bar and grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to go for a drive,\u201d he said, jerking his chin toward the door. \u201cWe\u2019ve got business.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glanced over at Jeff, who offered me a placating smile.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind, sis?\u201d he asked. I shook my head, although I felt a twinge at leaving without even learning their names. Somehow over the course of dinner they\u2019d stopped scaring me, turning alarmingly human. I knew when I wasn\u2019t wanted though, and I owed it to Jeff not to cause trouble. I smiled brightly at everyone and went to the door, grabbing my purse off the rack next to it.</p><p>\u201cWell, nice to meet all of you, um...\u201d</p><p>Mr. Blue Eyes, who I noticed had the word \u201cPresident\u201d written on his vest, grinned.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Picnic, and these are my brothers, Horse and Max,\u201d he said.</p><p>I glanced over at Big Guy. Horse? What kind of name was that? And they really didn\u2019t look like brothers...</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Picnic,\u201d I said, holding back my questions.</p><p>\u201cJust Picnic. Thanks again for the food.\u201d</p><p>Horse stood.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out to your car,\u201d he said, his voice low and rumbly. Jeff\u2019s eyes opened wide, and he jerked his head, then stilled. Picnic smirked at me knowingly.</p><p>\u201cTake your time, we can wait,\u201d he said to Horse, reaching down and pulling my keys out of his pocket, tossing them to me. I walked out into the warm sun of the late-summer evening, Horse following me. He snagged my hand, leading me to the table. My heart raced with every step. I had no idea what was about to happen, but part of me really wanted him to touch me.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Probably not.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Horse tucked his hands under my arms, popping me up onto the table. Then he slid them down my sides, wedging them between my legs and pushing my knees gently apart. He stepped between them and leaned into me.</p> <p>I\u2019m pretty sure I came close to stroking out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d I said, glancing back at the house, heart hammering. Jeff wouldn\u2019t like it. Horse was dangerous. I could smell it on him. Seriously. Under the delicious scent of leather, light sweat and man was a pungent strain of pure trouble. \u201cI mean, everyone is waiting for you, right? I can just go, let\u2019s just forget this, okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, just studying me with that cool, expressionless face of his.</p><p>\u201cThat how you gonna play it, sweet butt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sweet butt,\u201d I snapped, narrowing my eyes. I hated getting called things like that. Gary did it all the time. Why did they keep calling me that?</p><p>To hell with him and to hell with Gary too.</p><p>Men.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d I said, glaring at him.</p> <p>Horse gave a bark of laughter, the sound sudden and loud in the silence, which pulled me back to reality. His hands tucked around my waist, jerking me into his body where my crotch immediately came up against what had to be a pretty healthy erection.</p><p>He swiveled his hips into mine, slowly dragging it up and across my clit. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that I creamed my pants right then and there instead of kicking him in the nuts like a sensible girl. He leaned over and I held my breath, waiting for him to kiss me. Instead he whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNice ass. Sweet. Butt.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like his tone, so I bit his ear. Hard.</p><p>He jumped back, and I wondered if he was going to kill me. Instead he started laughing so hard I thought he might pull a muscle. I scowled, and he held up his arms to each side in pointed surrender.</p><p>\u201cI get it, hands off,\u201d he said, shaking his head, bemused. \u201cPlay it the way you like. And you\u2019re right, we\u2019ve got business. Go drive for an hour, that should be enough time.\u201d</p><p>I slid off the table and darted around him. He trailed me as I went to my car. I opened the door and almost got in, then the same stupid streak of curiosity that\u2019d caused me trouble all my life drowned out my sense of self-preservation. I stopped in the doorway, looking at him across the roof.</p><p>\u201cHorse isn\u2019t your real name, is it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, his teeth white in the darkness, like a wolf\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cRoad name,\u201d he replied, leaning against the roof of my car. \u201cThat\u2019s the way things work in my world. Citizens have names. We have road names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople give them to you when you start riding,\u201d he said casually. \u201cThey can mean all kinds of things. Picnic got his name because he went all out planning some pansy-assed picnic for a bitch who had him twisted up in knots. She ate his food and drank his booze, then called her f**kwad boyfriend to come and pick her up while he took a leak.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced at his crudity, trying to understand.</p><p>\u201cThat seems...unpleasant. Why would he want to remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when the f**kwad showed up, Picnic shoved his head through a picnic table.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath. That didn\u2019t sound good. I wanted to ask if the guy had been all right but decided I probably didn\u2019t want to know the answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he gets drunk, sometimes his eyes go all wide and he looks f**kin\u2019 crazy, like Mad Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I replied, thinking about the man. I guess he did look sort of like Mad Max... I decided I didn\u2019t want to see him drunk.</p><p>Silence hung heavy between us.</p><p>\u201cSo aren\u2019t you gonna ask?\u201d</p><p>I studied him, narrowing my eyes. I had a bad feeling about this. But the words came out of my mouth, completely beyond my control.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you called Horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m hung like one,\u201d he replied, smirking.</p><p>I dropped down into my car and slammed the door shut. I heard him laughing through the open window as I peeled out of the driveway.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Sept. 17\u2014Present Day</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sis,\u201d Jeff said, the words muffled from his bloody, swollen lips. Was he missing a tooth? I looked around the room, unable to believe that these men\u2014two of whom I\u2019d cooked for, one of whom I\u2019d done a lot more than cooking for\u2014were actually threatening to kill my brother. Could this really be happening?</p><p>Picnic looked right at me and winked.</p><p>\u201cLittle brother\u2019s been a bad boy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing from us. You know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head quickly. A bag fell off my arm, apples bouncing out and rolling across the floor. One of them hit Horse\u2019s foot. He didn\u2019t glance down, just maintained that cool, thoughtful expression I\u2019d seen on his face so many times. It frustrated me\u2014I wanted to scream at him to show some f**king emotions. I knew he had them. Unless that had been a lie too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh. My. God.</p><p>My brother knelt in the middle of our crappy living room, bleeding and awaiting execution, and all I could think about was me and Horse. What the hell was wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d I said quickly, looking at Jeff\u2019s puffy, bruising face, silently pleading with him to burst out laughing at the big joke they were playing on me.</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t start laughing. In fact, his breath rattled through the room like a movie sound effect. How badly was he hurt?</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be working for us,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty good with that little laptop of his. But instead of working he\u2019s been playing at the casino with our f**king money. Now he has the balls to tell me that he\u2019s lost the money and can\u2019t pay us back.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated the last four words with jabs of his pistol\u2019s thick, round barrel into the back of Jeff\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYou got fifty grand on you?\u201d Horse asked me, his voice cool and casual. I shook my head, feeling dizzy. Oh, shit, this was why Jeff had tried to get me to ask Gary for money... But fifty grand? Fifty grand? I couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cHe stole fifty thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Horse said. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t get paid back right now, his options are limited.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were friends,\u201d I whispered, looking from him to Jeff.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet kid,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get who we are. There\u2019s the club and everyone else, and this stupid f**ker is not part of the club. You f**k with us, we will f**k you back. Harder. Always.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s mouth trembled and I saw tears well up in his eyes. Then he wet his pants, a dark stain spreading between his legs pitifully.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d said the guy with the mohawk and skull tats. \u201cI f**king hate it when they piss themselves.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at Jeff and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see your sister pissing herself, do you? What a little bitch,\u201d he said, disgusted.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to kill us?\u201d I asked Picnic, trying to think. I needed to make him see me as human, they said that on all the TV shows about serial killers. He had two girls, I\u2019d even seen their pictures. I needed to remind him of his family, of the fact that he was human and not some kind of Reaper monster. \u201cI mean, would you really kill people you shared pictures of your daughters with? One of them is about my age, isn\u2019t she? Can\u2019t we work something out? Maybe we can make payments or something.\u201d</p><p>Horse snorted and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, sweetie, this isn\u2019t just about money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could give a shit about the money. This is about respect and stealing from the club. We let this pissant f**k get away with it, they\u2019ll all start doing it. We don\u2019t let stuff like this slide. Ever. He pays with blood.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, feeling my own tears well up.</p><p>\u201cJeff, why?\u201d I whispered, shivering.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to lose it,\u201d he replied, his voice cracked and hopeless. \u201cI thought I could win it back, make it up somehow. Or that maybe I could hide it in the wire transfers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up,\u201d Picnic said, smacking the side of his head with his free hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk club business. Even when you\u2019re about to die.\u201d</p><p>I whimpered, feeling myself start to tremble.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way,\u201d Horse said to me, still casual. \u201cPaying in blood can mean different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to die for that to happen,\u201d I said, thinking quickly. \u201cMaybe you could burn down our trailer!\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him encouragingly. Fuck the trailer, I wanted Jeff safe. And me. Oh shit, if they killed Jeff they\u2019d have to kill me too.</p><p>I was a witness. Fuckity f**k f**k f**k!</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re gonna do that no matter what,\u201d he drawled. \u201cBut that\u2019s not blood. I can think of something that is though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jeff asked, his voice full of desperate hope. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, I swear. If you give me a chance I\u2019ll crack so many accounts for you, you won\u2019t believe what we can accomplish. I\u2019ll stop smoking, that\u2019ll clear my head, I\u2019ll do a better job...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as Horse laughed, and the mohawk guy shook his head and grinned at Picnic.</p><p>\u201cYou believe this ass**le?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeriously, douche, you aren\u2019t making a very good case for yourself, telling us just how much you been slacking.\u201d</p><p>Jeff whimpered. I wanted to go to him, to hold him and comfort him, but I was too scared.</p><p>Horse stretched his neck, dipping his head to each side, and then cracked his knuckles like he was warming up for a fight. Kind of made me think of an episode of The Sopranos, which would have been funny as hell if I didn\u2019t happen to know how that episode ended.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a couple of things clear,\u201d Horse said after a pause that lasted approximately ten years. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you, Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d I asked, not sure if I believed him. Jeff listened anxiously, blinking rapidly against the moisture in his eyes. I watched as a trickle of sweat rolled down his forehead, making a track through the still-oozing blood.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Horse said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, we aren\u2019t pissed at you. This isn\u2019t about you. You\u2019ll keep your mouth shut about this if you want to survive, and you\u2019re smart enough to know that. That\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can see just how seriously f**ked your brother is,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to kill him if he doesn\u2019t find a way to pay us back. I think he might be able to pull it off with the proper motivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jeff babbled. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back all of it, thank you so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll pay us back twice as much, f**kwad,\u201d Picnic said, kicking him viciously in the side with his heavy leather boot. Jeff pitched to the floor, keening in pain, and I flinched. \u201cThat\u2019s if we let you live, which is entirely up to your sister. If it weren\u2019t for her you\u2019d be dead already.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew to Picnic\u2019s face. I had no idea what he was talking about, but I\u2019d do anything to save Jeff. Anything at all. He was the only real family I had left, and while he was a dumbass, he was also a sweetheart who truly loved me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Horse snorted, his eyes wandering down my body, lingering on my boobs, then trailing back up to my face. I realized the rest of the groceries had fallen to the floor and my fists were clenched tightly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask what it is first?\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure,\u201d I said, studying him. How could such a beautiful man be so cruel? I\u2019d felt how gentle his hands could be, where was this coming from? Real people, people who laughed and shared meals together, didn\u2019t act this way. Not in my world. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems Horse here wants a house mouse,\u201d Picnic said. I looked at him blankly. He shot an annoyed look at Horse. \u201cShe\u2019s clueless, you sure about this? Seems like work to me.\u201d</p> <p>Mohawk guy smirked as Horse narrowed his eyes at Picnic. Tension filled the room and I realized that contrary to what I would have thought, things could probably get a lot worse pretty fast. What if they turned on each other? Then Picnic shrugged.</p><p>\u201cThis is your option,\u201d Horse said to me abruptly. \u201cYou want to keep dumbass alive, pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave. You do what I tell you, when I tell you, no questions and no bitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked blankly.</p><p>\u201cSo you can cook dessert for me,\u201d he snapped. Mohawk man burst out laughing. My mouth dropped open\u2014all this for dessert? I knew he liked sweets, but I didn\u2019t get it. Horse shook his head at me, wearing that frustrated look he got around me sometimes, like he thought I was a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you think?\u201d he said, voice strained. \u201cSo I can f**k you.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>July 8\u2014Nine weeks earlier</p><p>My phone buzzed. I grabbed it to find a message from Jeff.</p><p>Krissys 2nite. Dont wait up</p><p>If a text could give a shit-eating grin, this one would do it. I shook my head and laughed silently, shoving my phone back into my pocket. Jeff was getting laid tonight and feeling pretty pleased about it.</p><p>That worked out nicely for me too.</p> <p>It was the end of the day and only three kids were left on the playground. Gabby had started cleaning already so closing would be easy, and now I would have the trailer to myself. I decided I\u2019d stop and get a Redbox video on the way home, and maybe some ice cream. Life was a lot better now that I\u2019d gotten my first paycheck. When the last kid left, I checked with Gabby and discovered the cleaning was all done, as I\u2019d suspected. We waved goodbye to each other and I went out to my car. The Redbox was outside of Walmart, which was busy this time of night but not busy enough for me to give up on the ice cream. I settled on slow-churned French silk, which I assumed was practically a health food because the package said it had half the fat and one-third fewer calories than the regular kind. This, combined with the Johnny Depp flick in my purse, almost guaranteed an orgasmic evening.</p><p>My mood just kept improving as I drove home.</p><p>One of my favorite dance songs came on the radio, which kicked ass because I didn\u2019t have a plug for an iPod or even a CD player in my little junker (thus the Def Leppard incident when the Reapers had come to call). I almost got caught behind a slow-moving farm truck, but they pulled off to let me by. I car-danced my way down our long driveway through the orchard to find a single low-slung, black motorcycle parked outside the house.</p><p>Not part of the plan.</p><p>I got out of the car and looked around cautiously but didn\u2019t see anyone. Nobody near the table, nobody in the folding chairs I\u2019d set out in the newly cleared lawn area (I couldn\u2019t call it a lawn in good conscience). What the hell?</p><p>I walked cautiously to the front door, clutching my cell phone like a weapon. What I planned to do with it I wasn\u2019t sure, because if a murderer was waiting inside I wouldn\u2019t exactly have time to call for help. I debated getting back in my car and driving away, but part of me wondered if Horse had come back. You know which part\u2014that little nub between my legs, the bitch. The door swung open at a touch and I found Horse sitting at my counter, texting, all muscular and tattooed and incredibly hot.</p><p>I opened my mouth then snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get better locks,\u201d Horse said casually. \u201cIt took me about ten seconds to get in here.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, looking around the room, although I had no idea what I was looking for. Some kind of magical leprechaun to jump out and explain what the hell was going on?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Jeff,\u201d he said, setting down his phone. \u201cHe\u2019s got something for me. Where is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s off with some girl,\u201d I replied, still dazed. \u201cHer name is Krissy, he said he\u2019d be late. I\u2019ll try calling him.\u201d</p><p>He watched as I dialed Jeff. Straight to voicemail. I sent a text, hoping he was just busy and didn\u2019t want to answer. More nothing. I looked at Horse and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think his phone is on,\u201d I said. \u201cI can let him know you came by though.\u201d</p><p>Horse gave a short, harsh laugh that had nothing to do with humor.</p><p>\u201cI rode three and a half hours to see him,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe knew I was coming.\u201d</p><p>I smiled weakly.</p><p>\u201cUm, you know he\u2019s a great guy, but he smokes out a lot and can be kind of forgetful...\u201d</p><p>Horse narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to deal with that, so I decided to put away the ice cream. Then my stomach growled audibly. I\u2019d planned on eating a sandwich, but it felt weird not to offer him something.</p><p>\u201cYou want an omelet?\u201d I asked, figuring everyone loves breakfast for dinner.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d he replied. \u201cBeer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I said, opening the fridge. I was kind of surprised he hadn\u2019t just helped himself, considering he\u2019d already broken into the place. I handed him a bottle and started on the omelet. I\u2019d made some cinnamon rolls last week and froze half of them, so I pulled those out too, along with a frozen thing of orange juice concentrate.</p><p>I glanced up to watch him taking a long pull on his bottle, eyes following me, throat muscles working as he swallowed. I could lick right from that little dip at the base of his throat up to his jawline...</p><p>Maybe not juice, I decided. Now I needed a beer.</p><p>Horse just watched me as I cooked, not saying anything, which creeped me out and turned me on at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of work are you guys doing with Jeff?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s club business,\u201d he replied. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions like that, you\u2019ll get yourself in trouble.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noted. So much for conversation.</p><p>The omelet was done and I\u2019d microwaved the rolls, so I dished up for both of us, thinking of my movie wistfully. I didn\u2019t get to watch movies very often and it wasn\u2019t like I\u2019d invited Horse over. But I had the feeling he might not be quite as into Johnny Depp as me. Should I bring it up? He decided for me, sitting down on the couch and grabbing the remote.</p><p>\u201cYou coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I replied, following him into the living room. I planned on taking the armchair, but he patted the couch next to him with an air of challenge.</p><p>Never could resist a challenge.</p><p>He clicked through channels, stopping on another one of those fights with the big cage. I sighed and decided I wouldn\u2019t share my ice cream with him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like MMA?\u201d he asked, taking a bite of his cinnamon roll.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I replied, leaning back into the cushions.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cLotta chicks don\u2019t,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut a lot do. All those sweaty bodies, you know?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at me, the slightest trace of humor in his eyes, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he was teasing me or not. I decided to just go to my room and eat there, but he reached out a hand to catch my arm, stopping me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I know you have business with Jeff and I\u2019m really sorry he flaked on you, but I don\u2019t have the energy for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>I waved a hand around, encompassing him, the TV, etcetera.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand if you\u2019re teasing me or not and it\u2019s confusing. And you took the remote.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cSo you pick what we watch,\u201d he replied lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal, Marie.\u201d</p><p>He handed over the clicker, giving me a smile that actually reached his eyes. I studied him\u2014this was a new side to Horse and I liked it. He was still a big, tough bad guy (or at least not a good guy, I was pretty sure of that) but he honestly seemed relaxed and ready to let me out of whatever little mind game he was playing.</p><p>\u201cActually, I got a Redbox movie,\u201d I said after a pause. \u201cIt\u2019s the new Johnny Depp.\u201d</p><p>He smirked but gestured magnanimously toward the screen.</p><p>\u201cPop it in.\u201d</p><p>Unexpectedly, watching the movie with him was fun. During a fight scene he told me why it wouldn\u2019t have worked in real life (sort of scary that he knew so much about hand-to-hand combat), but he didn\u2019t tease me or anything during the sex scenes. When it ended we ordered another one on PPV. This time I let him pick, and to his credit he went for a thriller with a touch of romance that looked good to both of us without even pausing to scope out the p**n . About halfway through I started getting a little cold, so I got up and grabbed a blanket. I figured I might as well share my ice cream too, so I filled bowls for both of us. When he finished he grabbed the bowls, set them on the table and pulled me across his lap, then sort of rolled over until he could lie back on the couch with me and my blanket on top of him.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t protest. He felt good, and while one hand rubbed up and down my back slowly, he didn\u2019t cop a feel, which made me feel safe. In fact, I really didn\u2019t want to get up or even acknowledge how much I was enjoying being held.</p><p>A man\u2019s arms around me felt good.</p><p>In fact, they felt so good I fell asleep.</p><p>I woke up in my room, confused. I was in bed with Gary. Why was Gary here? Then I realized the body cradling mine was far too big to be Gary\u2019s and the arm across my stomach had more muscles than my future ex had in his whole body. It also had a black tribal tattoo around the wrist.</p><p>That woke me right up.</p><p>Horse lay in bed with me. I didn\u2019t have any pants on, just my shirt and panties. No bra. I brushed my leg against his to discover he didn\u2019t have pants either, and I felt his giant, erect penis poking my ass.</p><p>\u201cHorse\u201d indeed.</p><p>It\u2019s just morning wood, I told myself. He\u2019s probably not even awake.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweet butt,\u201d he whispered in my ear, the warmth of his breath sending blood straight to my naughty bits. His words annoyed me though. Opting for the safer emotion, annoyance, I tried wrenching away from him. He hardly noticed my attempt, which bugged me even more.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d I muttered sulkily. \u201cWho calls a woman that?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, the sound low and warm in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really want to know,\u201d he replied, kissing the back of my neck and reaching down with one hand to press against my stomach. My panties went moist, and I wiggled against his big tool, wondering if I\u2019d lost my mind.</p><p>Body and brain fighting for control, winner take all.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, brain pulling ahead for the moment. \u201cWhat do you mean I don\u2019t want to know? I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t matter, why won\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>In answer, he slid his hand lower, catching the hem of my shirt and pulling it up, running the tips of his rough, calloused fingers across my belly. Oh very nice... My brain decided we could talk about the sweet butt thing another time. I squirmed my rear and he flexed his hips, rubbing his now-epic erection against the crack of my ass. His hand moved north, cupping my breast, plucking at the nipple as he kissed the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cOh shit...\u201d I murmured. \u201cThat feels amazing, Horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust getting started, babe,\u201d he murmured. He sucked my earlobe into his mouth and I moaned. My brain switched off entirely, ceding control to my body, which wanted him inside me.</p><p>Immediately.</p><p>I turned and slid down so my back lay flat on the bed, wrapping my hand around his neck and pulling his mouth down to mine. He\u2019d been tender so far, so I didn\u2019t exactly expect what happened next.</p><p>He took my mouth hard and fast, rolling on top of me and wedging between my legs. I opened for him and he thrust his tongue in forcefully, plunging it in and out as his hips started grinding against mine. Just two layers of thin fabric separated us as his c**k smashed against my clit, almost brutal in intensity. I shivered, lust and desire bursting through me, trying to see if I could lift my hips and move with him. In the process I accidentally pushed against his chest, which he apparently interpreted as me trying to push him away.</p><p>Horse pulled away from my mouth and growled, eyes dark with desire and a need so strong I froze. He looked like an animal in heat, a point his hard prick seemed to be determined to impress in its own way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge here, don\u2019t forget it,\u201d he stated.</p><p>I nodded, mesmerized. I didn\u2019t complain as he reared up just enough to rip my shirt up and over my head, taking my arms with it. Instead of pulling it off all the way, he tangled it around my wrists, holding them captive with one strong hand above my head as he slid lower, mouth taking my nipple and sucking it in deep. Sensation exploded through me and I moaned. Loud. Aching emptiness grew between my legs and I imagined him thrusting into my body, stretching me open wide as he took his pleasure.</p><p>Horse fumbled at his waist with his free hand, sliding down his boxers. Then he thrust his hips between mine again. Oh shit, that felt so good. Now his c**k head pressed right against my slit through my panties instead of stroking the length along my clit. This created a whole new sensation as the thin fabric stretched against the unbearable pressure, actually pushing into my body with the tip of his c**k before the fabric stopped up.</p><p>I bucked against him, desperate for more.</p><p>He pulled his head up from my breast and leaned up and over me, still holding my hands captive. I twisted, aching and raw.</p><p>\u201cFuck me, you\u2019re a hot piece of ass,\u201d he muttered. I closed my eyes, trying to catch him with my hips, whimpering for him to take me.</p><p>\u201cHold your hands over your head or you\u2019ll pay,\u201d he ordered, pinning me with his intense, green gaze.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, more than willing to do anything he asked. I hadn\u2019t felt this turned-on in forever, hovering within spitting distance of the Big O in less than five minutes.</p><p>It had never been like this with Gary.</p><p>Horse let my hands go, sliding lower, rubbing his nose along my belly as I twisted, then his hands caught the sides of my panties and tugged them down. I kicked one foot free, spreading my legs wide. He didn\u2019t hesitate, latching on to my clit with his mouth as he thrust two fingers into me hard. No warning, no preparation, just the rough pads of his fingers attacking my G-spot.</p><p>Goddamn. This was better than my special pink vibrator, the one with two heads and the wiggly thing. My body stiffened and I grunted, toes curling. It was right there, just out of reach.</p><p>He pulled his mouth away and laughed.</p><p>\u201cKnew it\u2019d be like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get inside, you\u2019re tight as f**k so it might hurt the first time. But I\u2019ll stretch you out a little and then holy f**k, it\u2019s gonna be good. Time to come.\u201d</p><p>His mouth came over me again, sucking deep. His fingers starting thrusting in and out and I grunted, muscles trembling as I stiffened. So close. He paused again, but I didn\u2019t open my eyes to see what he was doing. Maybe I should have, it would have given me some warning. When he started f**king me with his fingers again, he found my ass with his other hand. I screamed as he thrust a finger in my back entrance, exploding into his mouth as my back arched off the bed.</p><p>It took me a couple minutes to come back to myself.</p><p>I opened my eyes to find him beside me, up on one elbow, studying me not with satisfaction but brooding, determined need. I blinked at him, dazed.</p><p>\u201cGonna f**k you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I whispered, dazed. \u201cNot sure I\u2019m gonna be able to participate too much, think you blew a circuit or something.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a look of grim satisfaction. Then he carefully positioned himself over me, reaching down between us to position his wide c**k head against the lips of my slit. I came to my senses.</p><p>\u201cCondom!\u201d I gasped, pushing at his chest. \u201cStop! We need a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant you bareback,\u201d he muttered, narrowing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m clean.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you are, but I might not be. Gary was cheating on me.\u201d</p> <p>That caught his attention, and his eyes softened. He reached up and brushed his thumb against my cheek, where the bruise had been.</p><p>\u201cHe gave you that mark, yeah?\u201d he asked. I nodded. \u201cYour brother said he\u2019s history. That right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again, looking anywhere but his face, which wasn\u2019t easy with him right on top of me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Gary. Do you have a condom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, out in my saddlebags,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve it or not, I didn\u2019t entirely plan on this.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, rolling off me and flopping on his back. I turned on my side and looked down to see his c**k for the first time.</p><p>\u201cOh my god...\u201d</p><p>It was huge. I mean, huge. Not just long, but thick and hard and flushed bright red so it looked almost angry. It curved up, wider in the center of the shaft before narrowing under the ridge of his head.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help myself. I reached down and traced the length, mesmerized by the heat of his soft skin over something so hard and formidable.</p><p>\u201cTold you why they call me Horse,\u201d he said. I dragged my eyes away to look at his face, reading satisfaction mixed with his desire.</p><p>\u201cThey make condoms that big?\u201d I asked, halfway serious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSaying this goes against everything I believe in, but you\u2019d better let go of my dick.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off the bed, reaching down to grab his jeans, pulling them on over his length with some effort.</p><p>\u201cGoin\u2019 outside to my bike. Don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>He opened the door, then stopped in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said, sounding resigned.</p><p>\u201cThe sweet butt\u2019s a screamer, I like that,\u201d I heard a man\u2019s voice say from the living room, right outside my door. Oh shit. I grabbed the sheet, jerking it up and around me. I couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019d had an audience. The walls in this place were paper thin, they must\u2019ve heard everything.</p><p>I turned and moaned into my pillow.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a hot little bitch,\u201d said another voice. \u201cShe ready for another round? I\u2019ll take a piece.\u201d</p><p>Oh my god.</p><p>Horse walked out, slamming my door behind him. I heard him snarl something. Then laughter, followed by a thudding noise and a grunt. More laughter. The front door opened and slammed shut. A minute later Horse opened my door and came back in the room, carrying a leather bag. He sat down on the bed, digging in it and pulling out a handful of condoms, tossing them toward me.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Horse stood and pulled off his jeans, climbed up and over me on the bed on his knees, c**k thrusting aggressively. He narrowed his eyes and I shook my head quickly, feeling frantic. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached down, fisting himself and a droplet of pre-come beaded on his slit.</p><p>\u201cI know you want this.\u201d</p><p>I did, but not with an audience. I shook my head again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this with a bunch of guys in my living room. When did they get here? I didn\u2019t hear any bikes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCame in a cage,\u201d he replied, squeezing himself hard, sliding his hand up and down. I\u2019d never seen anything sexier in my life. He sucked in a ragged breath and I saw the pulse in his neck beating fast. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Open the f**king condom. I want to feel you slide it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Horse stilled, and something dark and heavy rolled into the room with us.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I repeated, my voice small. \u201cI heard what they said. I didn\u2019t like it and I don\u2019t want to have sex with them around.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly and deliberately, Horse let go of his c**k and leaned down over me, bracing his hands on either side of my face as he got real close. He held my gaze, eyes cold and hard.</p><p>\u201cI f**k when I want and how I want,\u201d he said. I shivered. This was the intimidating man I\u2019d met that first day. I\u2019d forgotten how much he terrified me. \u201cSo do my brothers. It\u2019s my job to worry about them, not yours. You worry about taking care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again, scared but determined. \u201cWhat we did earlier was incredible, and I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get your turn. But I\u2019m not having sex with an audience. Period. Get off my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a mistake,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cGet off the bed,\u201d I repeated, holding my ground. I reached up and pushed at his chest. He exploded off me at the touch, spinning around to punch the wall. Then he grabbed his jeans, pulling them over his raging c**k commando-style. His cut came next, sliding over his bare torso. He grabbed the saddlebag and stalked out the door, slamming it so hard behind him I heard something crack.</p><p>Then I was alone in bed, stunned and covered in unopened condoms.</p> <p>An hour later, Jeff knocked cautiously at my door.</p><p>\u201cMarie, you okay?\u201d he asked, voice quavering a little. \u201cUm, did you know your door is cracked down the middle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied softly, sitting in the middle of my bed, knees pulled up to my chest. I\u2019d already gotten dressed and texted Denise, telling her I felt too sick for work. I\u2019d heard Horse\u2019s bike leave, heard Jeff and the guys arguing about something. Heard a truck peel out of the driveway. Now I just sat, trying to process what had happened.</p><p>I\u2019d never been with anyone but Gary.</p><p>Horse had blown me away, first with his gentleness and then his skill. But he\u2019d followed it up by scaring the crap out of me, not to mention doing some serious damage to the room. Which one was the real man? Would I ever see him again?</p><p>Did I want to see him again?</p><p>\u201cMarie, can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, looking around the room. Horse\u2019s black t-shirt, emblazoned with the Reaper\u2019s symbol, lay crumpled on the floor next to his boxers.</p> <p>A neat pile of condoms sat on the bedside table.</p><p>Jeff didn\u2019t need to see any of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to sleep for a while,\u201d I told him after a long pause. \u201cLet\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Sept. 17\u2014Present Day</p><p>I gaped at Horse.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re threatening to kill my brother just so you can sleep with me?\u201d</p><p>Mohawk man walked casually over to Horse, draping an arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cute, but not real bright, brother,\u201d he said, glancing toward me with a smirk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me take her for a ride, get her trained up for you?\u201d</p><p>He gyrated his hips suggestively and the rest of the guys snickered. Horse turned fast, punching him in the stomach. Mohawk man doubled over but managed to stay standing as Horse grabbed my arm and jerked me out the door. He marched me away from the trailer into the orchard until we\u2019d gone a pretty good distance, then pushed me back against one of the trees, leaning into my face and grabbing my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep with you,\u201d he said, saying every word slowly and carefully, shaking me a little for emphasis. \u201cI want to f**k you. Sleeping, cuddling, all that other shit is for girlfriends and old ladies. You\u2019ve made it pretty goddamn clear you aren\u2019t interested in any of that, so let\u2019s get this straight. I\u2019m threatening your brother because he stole from the club, which had nothing to do with you. You steal from the club, you pay in blood. You\u2019re his blood. We take you, he pays. Fucking you is just a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re taking me to show that people shouldn\u2019t steal from the club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 miracle, she gets it,\u201d he muttered to no one, throwing up his hands. \u201cYour brother\u2019s lucky, because I wanna stick my dick in you more than I wanna kill him. Otherwise this wouldn\u2019t be worth the trouble. If Jeff-hole gets his shit together and pays back the club I might let you go\u2014after I\u2019m done with you. If he doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll find some other use for you. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cNo games, no bullshit,\u201d he said. Then he stepped back, running his hand through his hair roughly, pacing away from me. I started to follow him but he turned back around toward me. \u201cYou do this, it\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m not raping you. You\u2019re making a decision to pay for your brother\u2019s mistake on your back. You get me?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly much of a choice, considering the gun pointed at my brother\u2019s head. I didn\u2019t say it out loud though. If the Reapers were willing to give us an out, I\u2019d take it and call it whatever he wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Horse said, glaring at me. \u201cYou call it off any time you want. I\u2019m not gonna lock you up and watch you every minute. You make this deal, it\u2019s up to you to keep it. And you don\u2019t have to make the f**king deal. Your brother\u2019s an idiot and he knew what he was getting into. This isn\u2019t your mess and it\u2019s not your job to bail him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to talk me out of it?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t. I meant what I said. I\u2019d do anything for Jeff. Anything.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched as he turned, growled and kicked one of the trees so hard it was a miracle he didn\u2019t break a toe. Then he marched me back to the trailer.</p><p>We went inside to find the other guys sitting around, drinking beer and talking. Jeff lay on his side in the middle of the room, crying silently, the bruises covering what I could see of him getting uglier by the minute. Horse ignored all of them, pushing me into my bedroom and closing the door he\u2019d cracked behind us. He ripped open my closet door, found a backpack and thrust it at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got thirty minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019re on my bike and we\u2019re headed home. Grab anything you want to keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, hoping he would leave me to pack in peace. Instead he leaned back against my still-cracked door, watching as I dug through my closet. I decided to go light on the clothing. I could always get more stuff to wear, but I wanted my pictures and what few keepsakes I\u2019d managed to take with me from Gary\u2019s. It was depressing to realize just how little I had.</p><p>I pulled out my shoebox of papers, tossing it on the bed. The box tipped over, spilling out photos. I ignored it, turning back to dig through the closet again. My mom had a pretty nice pair of leather boots in there somewhere, and while I\u2019d never been a boot person, it seemed like wearing something to protect my legs might be important on a bike.</p><p>Horse sat on the bed, flipping through the photos. I ignored him, tugging at my cargo capris when they rode down, showing off my thong. Why had I decided to wear it today?</p><p>\u201cYou wear that shit for him?\u201d Horse asked, his voice like ice. I turned and looked up to find him holding up a wedding picture smeared with dried blood. Me and Gary. So f**king young.</p><p>\u201cWear what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat butt floss,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhy the f**k are you wearing a thong to work at a daycare? Are you seeing him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I burst out, horrified. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since he beat the shit out of me, you should know that. He hasn\u2019t called me, nothing. When I get all the papers ready, Denise\u2019s husband said he\u2019d serve them for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keeping this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, studying the picture. I\u2019d had so many hopes and dreams then back then, and I let a man destroy them. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget. At least not yet.\u201d</p><p>Horse dropped the picture without a word and I kept packing, glancing at my phone periodically to check the time. Finally I surveyed the growing pile on my bed, sad that my entire life took up such a small space. All I had left to grab was bras and panties, which I really didn\u2019t want to dig through with him watching me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t exactly have a choice though.</p><p>I stood up and opened my underwear drawer. There wasn\u2019t a lot, but if I was going to be Horse\u2019s...um...whatever...some pretty panties might come in handy. He came up behind me, reaching down and cupping my hips in his big hands, pulling me back into his body as he leaned over me. He took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI love how your hair smells,\u201d he said gruffly as his hard c**k pressed against my butt. I heard Picnic and the others talking in the living room. Jeff was out there, waiting to see if they were going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI have ten minutes left,\u201d I murmured, my voice tense. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Horse let go of my hip, grabbing my hair roughly and twisting my head around to the side. His lips covered mine, taking me hard, tongue thrusting in and out. I moaned, collapsing against him. His other hand reached around to my front, ripping open the buttons on my capris, and I heard one clatter against the floor. His fingers plunged into my panties, sliding roughly along my clit before sinking into me. I moaned, despising myself because it turned me on so much.</p><p>He pulled his mouth away from mine, pinning me with his gaze. I couldn\u2019t breathe, his eyes were so intense\u2014full of desire and lust and anger, all directed at me.</p><p>\u201cThis pu**y,\u201d he said, fingering me. I moaned in response, ashamed at how easily he made me wet. \u201cThis pu**y is mine. You are mine. I\u2019ll f**k you when and where I want, and you can either take it or get the f**k out. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, shivering. I wanted to hate him but my body disagreed. He kept his hand in my hair, holding me tight as he stroked me repeatedly. My legs weakened and I whimpered, desperate for relief. That\u2019s when he took my mouth again.</p><p>Now his tongue thrust in time with his fingers. The flesh between my legs tightened, muscles flexing all over my body. Horse stroked harder and I quivered on the edge. He pulled his mouth away from mine, dropping his lips to my neck, licking and sucking as I thrust my hips against him, desperate to come. Then he bit my neck and I moaned.</p><p>Loud enough to be heard in the other room, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>Horse pulled his hand out of my pants and stepped back. I froze in disbelief, my panting breath loud in the room. When I turned to him, shaky, he gave me a smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes. Then he slowly and deliberately lifted his fingers, licking off my juices.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care how good you taste, you don\u2019t call the shots,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe clear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour rules,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cOr I leave. And what happens if I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you?\u201d he said. \u201cNothing. You\u2019re with me of your own free will. But the club has to be paid in blood, Marie, not even I control that. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly.</p><p>He pushed me gently to the side and opened my lingerie drawer, digging around in it. He pulled out several thongs and a teddy, tossing them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need these,\u201d he said. I nodded as he turned back to the drawer, trying not to think of what else he would find in there. I winced as he stopped suddenly, thinking I had the shittiest luck on earth because this wasn\u2019t going to be pretty.</p><p>He pulled out the bundled black Reapers t-shirt he\u2019d left crumpled on my floor after that disastrous night he\u2019d spent in my bed, hefting it as he glanced toward me with a question in his eyes. I shook my head, blushing fiercely, reaching out to take it.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t hand it over. Instead he unrolled it, eyes widening as he found the bright-pink jelly vibrator with the dual heads, one for my clit and one for my G-spot. We both stood there silently, looking at it. Then he rolled it back up and handed it to me, eyes full of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cPack the shirt and the toy,\u201d he said, watching as I stuck it in the bottom of my backpack. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been more embarrassed in my life. I didn\u2019t meet his eyes as I dumped the rest of my things in, zipped it up and threw it over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou want anything else from the living room or kitchen? It won\u2019t be here if you try to come back.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, still unable to speak. Stupid, stupid, stupid...</p><p>He leaned in close and whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNext time you want to play with your pretty pink toy, you do it while I\u2019m watching. If you\u2019re a good girl, I\u2019ll let you wear the tee. Got it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. We walked out through the living room, past Jeff and the Reapers, and out the front door.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Aug. 13\u2014Six weeks earlier</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect to see Horse again after the abrupt end I\u2019d called to our lovemaking. Picnic, Max and another guy called Bam Bam had been to visit a couple of times. Jeff seemed happy enough to see them, and they all loved the food I cooked. After they\u2019d leave though, Jeff would always get real quiet and touchy. He\u2019d also started going to the casino more often, which worried me.</p> <p>He never came home acting like a man who\u2019d won.</p><p>But even though I sensed something was wrong, I had come to enjoy their visits. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted Horse to come back or not. Every time I saw bikes in the driveway, I was terrified I\u2019d see him and disappointed when I didn\u2019t. I dreamed about him all the time, and more than once I\u2019d re-lived our incredible morning together with my vibrator.</p><p>Apparently he\u2019d forgotten about me though. I wasn\u2019t about to ask any of the other guys about him. I couldn\u2019t stand pity, and that was about the best I could hope for from them. During this time, Jeff seemed more and more detached, smoking out constantly and barely talking to me or eating. I worried about him, of course, and today I was particularly frustrated because he\u2019d promised me he\u2019d stay sober.</p><p>You see, today I planned to go pick up my stuff from my old house.</p><p>Yesterday had been my day off, and I\u2019d driven to the Women\u2019s Center in Kennewick to try to figure out how to divorce Gary. I couldn\u2019t afford a lawyer but I didn\u2019t want anything from him, so I figured it would be quick and easy. If I got lucky, I wouldn\u2019t even have to see him. I could just send over the papers for him to sign.</p> <p>But the super-sweet woman who met with me, Ginger, shared some hard truths. For example, when I left, I\u2019d grabbed my purse and a bag full of clothing. But I hadn\u2019t gotten my social security card, my birth certificate, the title to my car or my pictures or keepsakes or anything. And she was right when she pointed out that while I might not care about any of that stuff now, I might need it down the line. I certainly shouldn\u2019t trust Gary with it.</p><p>She made a good point.</p><p>She also wanted me to file for a restraining order against him, but I knew Gary. A restraining order would piss him off in a big way. Right now he wasn\u2019t messing with me. If I provoked him like that he might find me and hurt me again, so I came up with a plan to go to the house and get my stuff when I knew he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>Every Monday he played poker with his buddies. He didn\u2019t even skip out when his mom died. If I went on a Monday I\u2019d be safe, unless I ran into Misty, who was not only his new whore, but who\u2019d worked at the grocery store with me for two years. Last time I checked, she had a regular Monday night shift. Even if I ran into her, I figured she\u2019d stay out of my way\u2014it wasn\u2019t like I was a threat to her, and I wasn\u2019t afraid of her. She might be taller than me, but she was a frighteningly skinny thing who took her manicure way too seriously to get in a cat fight. In fact, the longer I was free from Gary, the more pity I felt for her. I\u2019d already slipped out of the noose, but her?</p><p>She\u2019d been stupid enough to take it from me, put it around her own neck and tighten it up.</p><p>Still, just in case, I wanted Jeff to make the two-hour drive back home with me to Ellensburg, where I\u2019d lived with Gary for the past three years. I wasn\u2019t in any real danger, but I still had nightmares about him hitting me. I felt ashamed and embarrassed too. I hadn\u2019t even given notice at Safeway. Even if I didn\u2019t see Jeff, what if I ran into my old boss?</p> <p>I didn\u2019t want to face anyone.</p><p>When I pulled up to the trailer after work, I found Jeff passed out on the couch with his pipe on the floor next to an empty baggie and four beer bottles. I tried waking him up but he was completely faded. Even if I managed to take him with me, he wouldn\u2019t be any help.</p><p>So I decided to go by myself.</p><p>And yes, I realize now how incredibly stupid that was.</p><p>Trust me.</p><p>Pulling up to my old house was surreal.</p><p>Everything looked the same, but somehow smaller and dirtier. Same ratty lawn, same faded and peeling paint, same battered Mustang up on blocks in the driveway. All in all, it made me feel pretty good about my decision to leave.</p><p>Our trailer might be crap, but at least it was in the middle of an orchard. My dad had worked for the owner, John Benson, and part of his compensation included use of the old trailer. When he\u2019d left, John had taken pity on us and let us stay for very low rent, seeing as he didn\u2019t really need it for anything else anyway. I think at some point he and my mom had a thing, but I didn\u2019t know the details and I didn\u2019t want to know them. We did our own repairs, kept a low profile and things worked out okay.</p> <p>I parked my car in the street, pleased to note Misty\u2019s car wasn\u2019t there and I couldn\u2019t see any lights. None of the neighbors were outside so I didn\u2019t have to make awkward small talk with anyone. It wasn\u2019t that kind of neighborhood anyway\u2014you know, where people look out for each other or have a neighborhood watch.</p><p>I had a moment of worry when the door wouldn\u2019t open. I thought maybe he\u2019d changed the locks, but then it popped loose. Everything looked the same inside, but messier. Apparently Misty wasn\u2019t much of a house cleaner. I giggled, figuring that had to drive Gary crazy.</p><p>Jackass.</p><p>I found my papers easily enough, everything except the car title. I kept a shoebox of keepsakes and photos in the closet in our spare bedroom. It hadn\u2019t been disturbed, so I carried it out to the car and put it in the hatchback, then gave in to temptation and went back inside. I figured while I was there I might as well see if any of my clothes were around, or if Misty had thrown them out.</p><p>Surprisingly, she hadn\u2019t. I found them neatly bagged and labeled on the back porch. Convenient. It took four trips to get it all in the car, and then I went in one last time. I wasn\u2019t sure what I was looking for... Maybe some kind of closure? He still had our wedding picture up on the wall, right next to the one from our senior prom. I studied myself in them, wishing I could go back in time and give myself some friendly advice, something along the lines of run away and never, ever look back!</p><p>For some reason I couldn\u2019t explain, I pulled the wedding picture off the wall, snapped off the back of the frame and took it out. It wasn\u2019t anything special, just a five-by-seven snapshot. We didn\u2019t have a real photographer at the wedding.</p><p>Still, it was a good picture.</p><p>Gary looked young and handsome, and I looked fresh and pretty and full of excitement for the future. I don\u2019t know how long I stood there, lost in my thoughts, but I didn\u2019t notice when Gary walked into the house, reeking of beer and smoke, until he threw his keys down on the coffee table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I spun around, jaw dropping. My hands trembled so much I dropped the picture.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi, Gary?\u201d I managed to whisper.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the day you f**ked me over,\u201d he said, tilting his chin toward our wedding picture. His face was bright red and I saw the vein in his forehead start to pulse. He was angry. Really angry. \u201cI could have been anything, but you needed a wedding ring and now I\u2019m stuck in this cow town with nothing. Great f**king plan, Marie. Hope you\u2019re proud of yourself.\u201d</p><p>I watched him warily as he stalked toward me, trying not to give in to panic. The last time I\u2019d seen him was when he backhanded me across our kitchen. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the terror and sense of helplessness that hit me at the memory, paralyzing my body. I forced myself to think. Could I make it past him and through the front door? He laughed.</p> <p>\u201cYou here to f**k me over again, cunt?\u201d</p><p>The words were slurred. Gary was drunk. Seriously drunk. Maybe even blackout drunk.</p><p>I needed to get out of here. Now.</p><p>I made a break for it but he lunged at me, tackling me to the floor with the same strength and speed that made him our high school quarterback. My head slammed into the hardwood I\u2019d been so excited to discover last year when we\u2019d pulled out the carpet, pain exploding through me. Gary sat up, straddling me and grabbing the front of my shirt, pulling me up.</p><p>Then he started punching me.</p> <p>Details are fuzzy after that.</p><p>I spent a long time on the floor, moaning. Misty walked through the door at some point and started screaming. Gary lay passed out on the couch, oblivious as she helped me get up and walked me into the kitchen. She wanted to call the cops but I begged her not to\u2014I couldn\u2019t handle the humiliation of facing them, all the questions and pitying looks.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t want to like Misty.</p><p>I\u2019d felt devastated and betrayed when I learned she was sleeping with my husband\u2014the fight we\u2019d had about her led to him hitting me in the first place. But her touch was soft and gentle, the horror in her eyes genuine. She forced me to take some Tylenol when I refused to go to the emergency room. Then she went and threw everything of hers into three suitcases, crying big, silent tears the entire time. The Tylenol kicked in pretty fast, and while I couldn\u2019t help her haul out her things, I held the door for her. We locked it behind us and I watched as she loaded her car. Then she took my arm, walking me over to mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you won\u2019t let me call the cops?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe needs to pay for this. I knew he drank and his temper is kind of crazy, but I had no idea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to go home,\u201d I whispered. She took me in her arms, hugging me gently, and a small, detached part of my psyche marveled that my savior turned out to be a woman I\u2019d hated so much. Life is weird.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t come back here,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cA man who can do that, he might kill you next time. I\u2019m going to stay with my brother for a while, I think. He\u2019s a cop. I\u2019ll be safe, but Gary talks about you all the time, how much he hates you, how pissed off he is that you guys got married and he never did anything with his life. Please don\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be back,\u201d I said, and I meant it.</p><p>It was after three in the morning when I pulled up to the trailer. I must have the shittiest luck on earth, because there were five bikes parked outside, loaded down with saddlebags and bedrolls. I sat in the car just looking at them, exhausted. Every light in the trailer was turned on and I saw a flickering orange glow around the east corner.</p><p>They\u2019d built a bonfire. Apparently Jeff had sobered up enough to light up something besides more weed. I didn\u2019t have the energy for this. My body had stiffened during the drive, which made climbing out a challenge. I shuffled over to the door, hoping against hope that they were all out back by the fire so I could sneak in and collapse into bed.</p><p>No such luck.</p><p>I opened the door and walked in to find Horse, Max, Bam Bam and Jeff. I stood there for a minute, holding on to the frame to keep myself upright.</p><p>\u201cHoly f**k,\u201d Bam Bam said, and I nodded sagely.</p><p>Holy f**k indeed.</p> <p>Jeff just sat on the couch, opening and shutting his mouth like a fish. I didn\u2019t bother talking to him or any of them, just walked painfully toward my bedroom. Then Horse was next to me, very carefully picking me up, kicking open my cracked bedroom door and laying me down on the bed. He turned on the little bedside lamp with a click, washing the room with soft light.</p><p>I collapsed back against the pillow, tears of relief welling up in my eyes as I sank into the soft bedding.</p><p>Home. I\u2019d made it.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Horse asked, his voice colder than I\u2019d ever heard it. He sat next to me on the bed, eyes dead and face blank. I didn\u2019t want to look at him, couldn\u2019t handle the reality of him seeing me like this. I closed my eyes, blocking out his face.</p><p>\u201cGary,\u201d I muttered. \u201cMy husband. I went to get my stuff. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a doctor,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou call the cops?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to talk to anyone about it,\u201d I muttered. \u201cNobody. I\u2019m not going to the ER, he didn\u2019t break anything. I\u2019m just beat up, nothing serious.\u201d</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t say anything for a minute.</p><p>\u201cI gotta ask, babe. Did he rape you?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. A harsh, short bark of near-hysterical laughter burst out of my mouth. I hadn\u2019t even thought of that\u2014guess it could have been a lot worse. Thanks for that, Gary. Thanks for not raping me, douchebag.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe. Look me in the eyes and answer the question.\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to find him leaning over me, his face filled with terrible tension and a horrible, burning anger I didn\u2019t want to think about. I didn\u2019t have the energy to manage my own emotions, let alone worry about his.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t rape me,\u201d I said shortly, then closed my eyes again, letting myself drift away from the pain. After a time I heard footsteps enter the room, heard the low rumble of Picnic\u2019s voice, but I couldn\u2019t make out the words at first. He repeated them, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cAny witnesses?\u201d Picnic asked. I ignored him.</p><p>\u201cBabe, we need to know if there were any witnesses,\u201d Horse said, his voice insistent. \u201cAnyone see what he did to you? Have you told anyone at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, Misty,\u201d I whispered after a pause. \u201cMisty found me. She helped me get into my car. She wanted to call the cops but I wouldn\u2019t let her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Misty?\u201d Horse asked.</p><p>\u201cGary\u2019s new girlfriend,\u201d I replied, reaching up to explore my split lip gingerly. Even talking hurt. \u201cI actually kind of like her. She packed her stuff and took off. Not as stupid as me, got out quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel like a ride?\u201d Horse asked Picnic.</p><p>\u201cSounds about right,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get her cleaned up, make sure she doesn\u2019t need a doctor first.\u201d</p><p>That worked for me.</p><p>I drifted in and out after that. Cool water dabbed my face. Horse stuck some pills in my mouth and then held up a cup of water for me to swallow. Jeff sat next to me, holding my hand as the pain faded completely. Good pills, I mused. Definitely not Tylenol. Bikes roared and then I drifted away. When morning came Jeff called in to work, told them I\u2019d been in an accident and would probably need several days off. He tried to get me to eat some breakfast but I couldn\u2019t handle the thought of food. I decided to just lie in bed feeling sorry for myself. Around ten I heard the rumble of bikes again, but this time the whole crew didn\u2019t come inside, just Horse. He walked in and sat next to me on the bed without saying anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty tired,\u201d I said, refusing to look at him. I felt so stupid, so embarrassed. I knew Gary could get violent. They warned me at the Women\u2019s Center not to go back by myself, but I\u2019d felt so silly being afraid to visit my own house. \u201cI think you should go.\u201d</p><p>Horse stroked a finger along my collarbone, one of the only visible places on my body without ugly purple bruises.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt you again,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem, Horse,\u201d I replied. I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I just wanted to close my eyes and sleep, forget for a little while about what had happened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your problem anymore either.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice caught my attention, so I forced myself to look up at him. His eyes were bloodshot and the muscles in his unshaven jaw clenched. He lifted my hand and kissed it very softly. That\u2019s when I saw his knuckles.</p><p>They were completely torn up, crusted over with blood.</p><p>He followed my gaze, shaking his head slowly, offering me a strange, sad little smile.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask the question unless you want to hear the answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go, we\u2019re on a long run. California. If anyone asks, you were in a car accident, okay? Don\u2019t go into it any further than that, as soon as you give out too much information or complicate a lie, it\u2019s harder to keep up with it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even consider asking how he hurt his knuckles.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The Reapers passed through again a week later, heading back home. By then I was up and moving, although I still hadn\u2019t gone back to work. Denise had come out to visit me\u2014armed with chicken noodle soup and a basket of fresh veggies, including about twenty pounds of zucchini\u2014and declared that I couldn\u2019t watch kids looking like a punching bag. I\u2019d scare them. She promised to hold my job for me though, which I appreciated greatly, and even offered to give me overtime once I was presentable again to make up for the lost income. Her kindness made me cry.</p><p>Now I sat outside the trailer in a camp chair, reading an old romance of my mom\u2019s and listening to the roar of a bike coming down our driveway.</p><p>Horse.</p><p>The others weren\u2019t with him, and I didn\u2019t know what to say as he walked over to me. I still felt stupid and self-conscious. Not only had he seen me at my lowest, but I still looked like hell. Thankfully I\u2019d been right in my initial assessment of the damage\u2014nothing broken, nothing permanent.</p> <p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Horse said helpfully as he pulled up a lawn chair next to me. He sounded almost cheerful, which annoyed me. I glared at him and he smirked. \u201cStill got a sweet butt though.\u201d</p><p>I went from annoyed to pissed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do it. You\u2019re cute when you\u2019re pissed. Kind of like a wet kitten. Gets me hard.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. Horse leaned back in his chair, running his fingers through his dark, messy hair, grinning at me with that perfect mouth, stubble so long it had turned into a short beard. The man looked extremely pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cHear from the ex?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shook my head, deciding not address the \u201cgets me hard\u201d comment.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be bothering you again,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe guys will be here in a couple hours. They\u2019re grabbing some food, we\u2019ll camp here tonight before heading home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, that sounds good,\u201d I said. \u201cDoes Jeff know?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo, I just wanted to check on you,\u201d he said. \u201cIs he around?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cHe went to the casino with some friends, said he might crash at Krissy\u2019s tonight.\u201d</p><p>Horse\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, but I felt a distinct chill. Well, fair enough. I didn\u2019t like Jeff going to the casino either. He must have work for them he hadn\u2019t finished yet. Jeff had been going downhill fast the past few weeks, and I couldn\u2019t seem to do anything to halt it or help him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let that stop you,\u201d I added quickly. \u201cYou guys are welcome to stay here, especially if you\u2019re bringing your own food.\u201d</p><p>I meant it too. Even though he\u2019d scared the hell out of me that unforgettable morning, I felt safe around him, especially now. When I\u2019d been hurt, he protected me. I knew he\u2019d done something nasty to Gary. I supposed I should be upset about that, because violence never solves anything. But Gary deserved whatever he got and then some.</p><p>\u201cYou want anything to drink?\u201d Horse asked, taking in the empty plastic cup sitting next to me on a plastic milk crate. I smiled at him, trying not to wince as it pulled at my split lip.</p><p>\u201cIced tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d he said, snagging my cup and carrying it inside. He came back out with a second one for himself. We sat companionably for the rest of the afternoon, talking about all kinds of things. I learned he\u2019d grown up in a biker family and his father had been one of the first Reapers. His sister was married to Bam Bam. When I\u2019d first met them, the MC had seemed like a gang of thugs, but the way Horse described it was more like a family. A crazy, loud family that fought a lot and occasionally went to jail, but still a family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That I could understand\u2014after all, my mama was more than a little crazy and sitting in the county jail as we spoke. I still loved her to pieces.</p><p>I told him about the brochures I had in my bedroom from the community college in the Tri-Cities. They had a culinary arts program, and the people at the Women\u2019s Center had encouraged me to look into going back to school.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you like the daycare, but that\u2019s not a long-term thing unless you decide to open a center yourself.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, laughing.</p> <p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I said. \u201cThe kids are fun, but I can\u2019t imagine doing that for the rest of my life. Too many diapers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want kids of your own? Had enough diapers?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to be a single mom, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d I replied. \u201cMy mom\u2019s in jail right now for assault with a deadly weapon, which was pretty stupid of her, I admit. But she took good care of us growing up. She worked her ass off before she blew out her back and started drinking. Chronic pain, you know? But she never would have tried to run over that cop if she\u2019d stuck it out in the anger management program. I\u2019m still not sure why she went after the second guy, he\u2019s not the one who wrote the parking ticket...\u201d</p><p>Horse burst out laughing, biting it back quick.</p> <p>I shook my head, narrowing my eyes. He wouldn\u2019t meet my eye, taking a quick drink of his tea. Then I reached over and poked his side and another laugh escaped, which he tried to hide with a cough. I decided to let him off the hook.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said with a smile. \u201cEven Mom laughed when she finally calmed down, and thankfully she never came close to actually hitting them. It wasn\u2019t her finest moment, that\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s got another four months ahead of her though, which isn\u2019t nearly as funny.\u201d</p><p>We fell silent for a few minutes. Then he spoke again.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the kids,\u201d I looked up at the clouds. One of them looked kind of like my mom holding a cigarette. I smiled. \u201cActually, I think I\u2019d like kids. But not by myself and not if I can\u2019t stay home with them. Jeff and I had to be on our own way too much, and while I don\u2019t blame Mom for that, I want something better for my own family.\u201d</p><p>I looked over to find him staring at me intently. I blushed, though I couldn\u2019t say why.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want kids,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom would kill me if I didn\u2019t give her at least a couple of grandbabies. Never had an old lady though, not a keeper at least. Kinda hard to have one without the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d I replied, feeling more uncomfortable by the minute. \u201cTell me something. What\u2019s with the \u2018old lady\u2019 thing? Seems like a nasty thing to call someone you care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a term of respect,\u201d he replied. I shrugged, but he reached out and touched my shoulder, getting me to look at him. His expression was intent and focused. \u201cSeriously, a biker\u2019s old lady is like his wife. She\u2019s his woman, his property, and if anyone f**ks with her the entire club will come down on them. Hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProperty?\u201d I asked, wrinkling my nose. \u201cThat sounds even worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThings are different in the outside world, but the club is a tribe. If a woman isn\u2019t claimed, she\u2019s fair game. But when a biker brands her as his property, she\u2019s untouchable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t imagine being called property,\u201d I snapped. He blew out his breath, exasperated.</p><p>Before he could reply, we heard the roar of pipes in the distance. For once, his friends had good timing. They pulled into the yard with a rumble, carrying bags full of KFC chicken and biscuits. I don\u2019t usually eat stuff like that, but as the sun faded and they laid out their bedrolls, I couldn\u2019t imagine anything tastier than the plate of junk food balanced on my knees.</p> <p>None of them mentioned my bruises, which I appreciated. Picnic brought me a box of chocolate-covered dried cherries. They built a bonfire and we all sat around drinking beer and laughing until my head drooped. When I got up to go to bed, Horse followed me in and it felt natural for him to climb in beside me. He seemed to understand how sore I was and didn\u2019t so much as kiss me, although I felt his erection several times during the night. I felt safe in his arms. The next day they took off at first light while I was still half asleep.</p><p>That afternoon I got a text from Horse, telling me to look at the \u201cfavorites\u201d list on my phone.</p><p>He\u2019d programmed himself into it, right at the top.</p><p>Aug. 23</p><p>Horse: How\u2019s it going?</p><p>Me: Good. Kid barfed at me at work, but I managed to jump out of the way :)</p><p>Horse: Sounds like fun. Bike broke down here</p><p>Me: That sucks. You have a car?</p><p>Horse: SUV. Good for getting around, esp in snow. Hate feeling caged tho. What you doing?</p><p>Me: In yard, catching sun.</p><p>Horse: What you wearing?</p><p>Me: Nothing. Working on tan all over</p><p>Horse: !!!! You f**king me????</p><p>Me: LOL I\u2019m wearing a tee and shorts :-&gt;</p><p>Horse: Too good to be true. Going to try to make it down next week</p><p>Me: Give me heads up</p><p>Horse: I will. TTYL</p><p>Aug. 27</p><p>Me: Bored. Hows the bike?</p><p>Horse: Bored is better than barfed on. Bike up and running again.</p><p>Me: Congrats! Kind of excited, going out tonight. Friend Cara from HS came to visit from NY. Like old times</p><p>Horse: Out?</p><p>Me: Dancing in tri-cities. Some club. Gonna slut up and everything!</p><p>Horse: Huh. Be careful</p><p>Me: Always. Excited tho. Haven\u2019t gone out since Gary</p><p>Horse: Looking for new man?</p><p>Me: Um...not really. Just fun</p><p>Horse: Watch out and don\u2019t dress too slutty. Don\u2019t want trouble</p><p>Me: Had enough trouble, trust me</p><p>Horse: True. Send me a pic later</p><p>Me: OK</p><p>Me: So what you think? Too slutty?</p><p>Horse: Hot. Definitely too slutty. Go change.</p><p>Me: Prude :-P</p><p>Horse: Text me when you get home</p><p>Me: Night gone to shit</p><p>Horse: ?</p><p>Me: Jeff is sick, really sick. Asked me to stay home with him. Thought I might have to take him to the hosp but all right now</p><p>Horse: That sucks. He okay?</p><p>Me: Think so. Getting checked tomorrow, stomach pain</p><p>Horse: Sorry</p><p>Me: Me too. Cara leaving tomorrow, so no party for me...</p><p>Aug. 28</p><p>Horse: Hows Jeff?</p><p>Me: Fine, like nothing happened.

Hope visit is good</p><p>Me: Thanks</p><p>Horse: Send another pic?</p><p>Me: Um, not dressed up</p><p>Horse: Don\u2019t care. Send it. Want to see you today</p><p>Me: Okay :)</p><p>I hate the county jail.</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent way too many hours in the waiting room, although I know it\u2019s probably better than visiting a real prison. The county guys look at me like I\u2019m trash and occasionally they cop a feel while patting me down.</p><p>That\u2019s the price of seeing my mom.</p><p>They put me in a little room that had a built-in table, sort of like those tables at McDonald\u2019s where you can\u2019t move the chairs. But here the chairs are just stools and the whole thing is white. After a few minutes the door opened and Mom came in. She was wearing an orange jumpsuit, and even though it had to be the ugliest piece of clothing on earth, Mom looked fantastic. Seriously. My mom is hot, always has been, something that drove me crazy during high school. But from the way she walked, I could tell that her back was hurting worse than usual. She had a bunch of ruptured discs and no health insurance to fix them. The doctors wanted her to have surgery, but the county didn\u2019t want to pay for it, so she was stuck in limbo.</p><p>I stood and hugged her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mama,\u201d I whispered into her hair, which looked fantastic even though she didn\u2019t have any styling stuff or anything. How did her hair look better in jail than mine did after two hours fixing it? Just another part of the mystery that was my crazy, loving, incredibly-difficult-at-times mother.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d she replied, holding me tight. She smelled a little like cigarettes, which I know a lot of people find disgusting but I find strangely comforting\u2014so long as it\u2019s not totally filling our trailer with smoke. It made me think of when she\u2019d come home late at night after work when we were little. She\u2019d walk into the bedroom I shared with Jeff and kiss us both good night. That little hint of smoke was the smell of comfort and safety.</p><p>We separated and took seats.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s it going with you?\u201d she asked. I\u2019d put on lots of foundation to cover my bruises but her eyes flickered across them. \u201cGary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, flushing. \u201cI was stupid, went back there alone to get some stuff. He was drunk.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth tightened, eyes filling with tears of anger or frustration, I couldn\u2019t tell which.</p><p>\u201cI wish I was out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d kill that bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom! Don\u2019t talk like that, they\u2019re probably listening\u2014they\u2019ll think you mean it.\u201d</p><p>She cocked an eyebrow at me and I knew she meant every word. Mom had a temper, no question. That\u2019s what got her here in the first place. But I loved the fact that she always protected her chicks, back when we were little and now too. My mom wasn\u2019t perfect, but the woman could be an avenging angel when she needed to be, something more than one school bully had learned the hard way.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be bothering me again,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cA friend of mine had some words with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, actually a friend of Jeff\u2019s. He\u2019s a biker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Mom said. \u201cSince when does Jeff hang out with bikers? Gamers are more his speed, I\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since I moved back to the trailer,\u201d I replied, shrugging. \u201cHe\u2019s doing some kind of work for them. I don\u2019t know the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey good bikers or bad bikers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously.</p><p>\u201cUm, they\u2019re good to me. Kind of rough and they can get scary, but I\u2019m okay with them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, studying me. I shifted nervously, blushing again. Mom always saw right through me.</p><p>\u201cJust \u2018getting along\u2019 or something more?\u201d she asked. I shrugged again and she smirked.</p><p>\u201cWell, be careful. Bikers can be great, but the hardcore guys are living in a different world from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I picked up on that,\u201d I said wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, mostly just flirting.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to know all the details. Does anyone really want to tell their mom about their best orgasm ever?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news of my own,\u201d she replied with a gleam in her eye. Uh-oh, I recognized that gleam.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, unnerved.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve reconnected with someone,\u201d she said. \u201cA man. We\u2019re getting serious.\u201d</p><p>That caught my attention.</p><p>\u201cHow on earth are you doing that from jail?\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cI swear, you\u2019re like a magnet, how do you get so many guys after you?\u201d</p><p>She giggled, looking years younger than her age.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may be getting old but I\u2019m not dead yet,\u201d she replied. \u201cHe came to see me not too long after I got in here. In fact, he\u2019s been visiting me a couple times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohn Benson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d I muttered, stunned. \u201cJohn Benson, our landlord?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d she said, looking sheepish. \u201cYou may not know this, but he and I had a thing a long time ago...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I replied. \u201cI also know he was married.\u201d</p><p>She had the grace to look embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve made mistakes. But you should know we both felt guilty. That\u2019s why we ended it. His wife never knew. She\u2019s been dead for about three years now, car accident. John and I had been avoiding each other for so long it became a habit, but I guess when he read about me in the paper he started thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>Only my mother would end up finding love by trying to run over two cops. Clearly, John Benson was an idiot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe wants me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unsure what to say. Finally I managed to speak.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s good, Mom. How does he feel about what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I have my issues, but I\u2019m sober now, which has helped me sort things out,\u201d she said. That was true\u2014she\u2019d joined AA even before her little incident. We\u2019d confronted her about her drinking after Jeff found her passed out outside the trailer in the snow last winter. It was a miracle she survived. \u201cI\u2019ve realized now that I need to deal with my emotions or I get...upset.\u201d</p> <p>That was the understatement from hell.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to stay out of relationships your first year of AA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be almost a full year by the time I get out,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019d get out a little earlier for good behavior, but they\u2019re not cutting me any slack because of the cop thing.\u201d</p><p>We looked at each other, both thinking back to that day. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cI never do anything halfway, do I?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, smiling ruefully.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving in with him when I get out. That\u2019s good news for you and Jeff, I guess. You\u2019ll get to keep the trailer all to yourselves.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI guess if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt concerns me a little, but if you\u2019re happy, that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, the tension on her face easing.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, baby,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about telling you guys. You talk to Jeff for me? He hasn\u2019t been to visit in a month and I\u2019m worried. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>I thought about how to answer her question. I didn\u2019t know of anything specifically wrong with Jeff, but there was definitely something going on. How to explain that though?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been kind of edgy,\u201d I said finally. \u201cAnd lost some weight. But he hasn\u2019t talked to me about anything and when I asked he blew me off. Wish I could tell you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou tell him I love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him.\u201d</p><p>Sept. 1</p><p>Me: Well that was fun</p><p>Horse: ?</p> <p>Me: Went to see mom. She\u2019s good, but crazy news. Getting married</p><p>Horse: This a good thing?</p><p>Me: Not sure. He\u2019s the guy who owns our trailer. They used to have a thing, but he was married. Wife died couple years ago</p><p>Horse: Good guy?</p><p>Me: Cheated on his wife</p><p>Horse: One-time thing or pattern?</p><p>Me: Short term accord to mom. Says they both felt awful, ended it. Explains why we get the trailer so cheap</p><p>Horse: No shit</p><p>Horse: You like him?</p><p>Me: I guess. Always been nice to me. She\u2019s moving in with him when she gets out.</p><p>Horse: Then be happy for your mom.</p><p>Me: Gonna try</p><p>Sept. 3</p><p>Horse: Whens your next day off?</p><p>Me: Thurs. Why?</p><p>Horse: Want to visit</p><p>Me: I\u2019d like that :)</p><p>Sept. 6</p><p>I studied my face in the mirror critically, wishing I didn\u2019t feel so nervous. The bruises had faded, which was good, and you could hardly see where my lip had been split. There were still a few yellowish splotches but I covered those up with strategically placed makeup. I put on a pretty sundress\u2014nothing fancy, but bright and cheerful and it made my boobs look fantastic.</p><p>All in all, I looked human again.</p><p>Horse would arrive any time. The drive was a little over three hours, and he\u2019d texted me when he left at seven that morning. I couldn\u2019t define our relationship, but he wanted to visit me, not Jeff, and he was coming by himself. That had to mean something. And I couldn\u2019t be just a booty call when he\u2019d never gotten my booty, right?</p><p>I heard him pulling up and paused at the door, tugging up the bodice of my dress. Cleavage had seemed like a great idea earlier, but now I felt self-conscious. He knocked on the door.</p><p>\u201cYou there, sweet butt?\u201d he called. I opened the door and his eyes went straight to my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me sweet butt,\u201d I snapped at him and he grinned, reaching out a finger to poke my nose.</p><p>\u201cBitchy, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRude, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>We started laughing at the same time and he pulled me into his arms, giving me a welcome kiss that made me forget everything else. While his tongue explored my mouth, his hands roamed down to my rear, cupping my cheeks and pulling me up and into his hips. I felt his c**k against my stomach and sparks raced through me. Hard to believe I could make this handsome, intimidating biker so aroused.</p><p>Finally the need to breathe got the better of me, and I pulled away from him, taking his hand and drawing him in to the living room to the couch. He looked around, eyes pausing as they took in Jeff\u2019s pipe on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cYour brother here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still in bed,\u201d I said. \u201cNot really a morning person.\u201d</p><p>He gave a rueful laugh.</p><p>\u201cMe neither, got up too early this morning.\u201d</p><p>A thrill ran through me\u2014he\u2019d been eager enough to see me that he\u2019d gotten up early!</p><p>\u201cSo you have business down here?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cJust you, babe.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him like an idiot. So much for being cool.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDo you really have to ask?\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously. He might be gorgeous, but I couldn\u2019t just jump into bed with him, not like this. I needed a little warming up first.</p><p>\u201cUm, how about I show you around the area a little, maybe go down to the river or something?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a knowing look.</p><p>\u201cChicken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll play this your way. You want to pack a lunch or go out?\u201d</p><p>I thought about my bank balance\u2014growing, but still low\u2014and decided a picnic was the way to go.</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes and I\u2019ll have something pulled together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better change too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t ride a bike in that dress. Put on some jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never ridden a bike before.\u201d</p><p>Horse leaned over and gave me a quick kiss on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cLookin\u2019 forward to being your first, babe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>It took more like half an hour, but I packed a lunch, a blanket to sit on and some condoms (carefully zipped into a pocket in my purse), just in case. Horse handed me a black helmet that looked like what a German army guy would wear\u2014you know, the kind that flares out a little around the edges? I wasn\u2019t quite sure how to adjust it, but he put it on my head and fixed the straps carefully, like I was fragile and precious. I loved how that made me feel. Then I got on the bike behind him, which was an experience in and of itself. The Harley was big and wide, and I had to spread my legs around his hips. My naughty bits didn\u2019t miss the symbolism there. I wasn\u2019t quite sure where to put my arms, but he grabbed my hands and pulled them around to his stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHold tight,\u201d he said. \u201cTap my stomach if you need me to stop for some reason and watch out for the pipes. They get hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied nervously.</p><p>Then the bike roared to life and we pulled down the driveway.</p><p>How do I describe that first ride?</p><p>Well, for one thing, the bike vibrates. A lot. I suppose over time it would numb your rear, but for those first few minutes it felt like sitting on the world\u2019s biggest sex toy. It didn\u2019t hurt that my arms were wrapped tight around a hot, muscular guy who\u2019d made it clear he appreciated my assets. I squeezed him tight as we pulled out onto the highway, holding on for dear life as he opened the throttle.</p><p>I\u2019d promised to show him the sights, but he had his own agenda and apparently knew the area well already. After about half an hour, we pulled off the highway and headed up into the hills on a gravel road. This was much slower going and before long it turned to dirt. The next thing I knew, we turned down a narrow track that barely deserved to be called a road. It dead-ended at a turn-around. Horse killed the engine.</p><p>I dropped my hands, accidentally grazing his erection. I jerked my hand away, embarrassed, but he grabbed it and pulled it back, rubbing it up and down his length.</p><p>\u201cMissed that, babe,\u201d he said. I didn\u2019t reply, feeling strangely shy, but when he let my hand go I didn\u2019t stop touching him. I thought about his dick, how big it was, how hard it\u2019d been the last time I\u2019d seen it, all for me. I shifted on the seat, tilting my hips forward into the hard leather. It felt good to have my legs spread so wide... But I wanted to feel his shaft in my hand. I reached for his fly.</p><p>\u201cShit, babe, not gonna f**k you in the parking lot,\u201d he said, laughing. I squawked, jerking my hands away, embarrassed. \u201cGot a better idea. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>I hopped off the bike, knowing my face must be bright red. Horse grabbed our picnic stuff and one of his saddlebags, holding out his hand. I took it and he pulled me along a trail through the brush.</p><p>Now, you have to realize that eastern Washington isn\u2019t exactly the garden of Eden. It\u2019s mostly desert and scrubland, with low, rolling hills. But as I followed him along a gully between two of those hills, more and more green appeared, along with a little trickle of water. We hiked along the stream for about half an hour until we reached a small, round pond that gave off wisps of steam.</p><p>\u201cA hot spring!\u201d I exclaimed with delight. Horse looked smug as I ran to the edge, reaching down to trail my fingers through the water. \u201cHow did you know about this? I grew up around here and I\u2019ve never heard of this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all kinds of interesting things you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. I snickered. But I stopped laughing and started running when he dropped the picnic stuff and lunged toward me. I screeched and giggled as he caught me from behind, pulling me back to the ground on top of him and tickling me. He lay on his back, arms around my chest, legs around mine, and held me in place as he reached down for the hem of my tee. He jerked it up and over my head, pausing to tickle me again every few seconds.</p><p>Then his hands went down to the fastening of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d I yelled, but he just laughed and ripped them open. He got them loose and pushed them down over my hips. At that, I bucked hard and he let me go, which pitched me forward. Before I could even think he was on me from behind, jerking my jeans down my legs. He stood up, holding them out of my reach triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna pay for that!\u201d I yelled, still laughing. I stopped laughing though and started running as he dropped the jeans and lunged toward me again. That worked just about as well as it had the first time, which was not at all. He caught me up and threw me over his shoulder, carrying me over to the spring, giving my butt a little smack, saying, \u201cQuiet, woman.\u201d</p><p>I screamed \u201cNo!\u201d before I hit the water with a splash.</p><p>It was like jumping into a hot tub\u2014not too deep, but deep enough I wasn\u2019t in any danger. I surfaced, scowling at him and dropping my head back into the water to get the hair out of my face. Then I popped back up to glare at him some more.</p><p>Horse doubled over laughing at me.</p><p>I splashed him as hard as I could, which made him laugh more, then turned away to pout.</p><p>Mistake.</p><p>The splash he made jumping in nearly knocked me over, and then his arms came around me, pulling my back into the curve of his body. He\u2019d stripped down to his boxers. His hands slid over me, stroking my curves, and I melted.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re cute when you\u2019re wet,\u201d he whispered in my ear, sliding a finger down into my panties. He pushed my bra down with the other hand, rolling my nipple between his fingers as he toyed with my clit. I shuddered and arched my back as he flicked his finger faster and faster, playing me like a guitar. I guess I\u2019d been in a constant state of arousal all morning, because I came like a firecracker.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit...\u201d I moaned, collapsing against him.</p><p>He kissed the back of my neck, then turned me around to face him. I wrapped my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck, kissing him with everything I had. This time it was my tongue taking over his mouth as I dug my fingers through his hair. My bra was pushed down below my br**sts, ni**les chafing against his chest, and everything between us was all wet and slippery and delicious.</p><p>Finally he pulled away, sucking in a deep breath. I used the opportunity to reach down between us and grab his cock. He loosened his arms, making it easier for me to reach, and I pushed the fabric of his boxers down below the length of his erection. I cupped the underside of his penis, drawing the heel of my hand up and down along the edge of the ridge around the head.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby, that feels good.\u201d</p><p>Encouraged, I gripped him and started pumping up and down, faster and faster, until his hands tightened on my hips and his breathing grew ragged. I slid my hand down below, cupping his balls, rolling them in his sac, then drew them back up and squeezed him tightly around the base. He shuddered, grabbing my hand in his and jerking it up and down along his cock, way rougher than I would have done on my own.</p><p>\u201cFuck me...\u201d he muttered, resting his forehead against mine. \u201cLike that, babe. Keep going, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I pumped him as fast as I could, savoring his little grunts of desire and satisfaction. Then I felt a throbbing deep inside his shaft. His seed shot out between us through the water, and he grunted violently as he came. I caressed him slowly as he softened until he pulled my hand away, drawing it up and around his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so f**king hot,\u201d he whispered, lifting me and kissing the below my ear. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how hot you are. I hated thinking about you all slutted up and going out without me, letting some other guy hold you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I spent the night listening to Jeff moaning and barfing, so that was sort of a bust,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cNone of them would have come close to you anyway. But I still wish I\u2019d had more time to visit with Cara.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cJeff did what he had to do.\u201d</p> <p>His words struck me as odd.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needed you at home, so he asked you to stay even though he probably hated keeping you in, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right. He\u2019s been so good to me, it was the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>I laid my head against his shoulder and we sat there in the hot water, savoring the moment, urgency gone.</p> <p>Then his stomach grumbled so hard I felt the vibrations.</p><p>\u201cHungry much?\u201d I asked him, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI ate breakfast six hours ago,\u201d he replied. \u201cWanted to get here and see you. Would have come last night if I could\u2019ve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to end this, but maybe I should feed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue. Your cooking\u2019s almost as good as your hand jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse!\u201d I sputtered, blushing. I leaned back and splashed his face. He dunked me and we wrestled a little bit before finally climbing out to get some food.</p> <p>Fortunately it was in the nineties, so even sopping wet we weren\u2019t too uncomfortable. It felt sort of strange sitting down to a picnic lunch in my panties and bra, but I figured it wasn\u2019t much worse than wearing a bikini. Besides, my undies were pretty\u2014black, with eyelet lace and polka dots, and just a hint of a push-up on top. The panties were boy cut, high in the back across my butt, and I enjoyed feeling Horse\u2019s eyes on me as I set everything up.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anything fancy\u2014just some chicken sandwiches, veggie sticks and watermelon, with cream-cheese brownies for dessert\u2014but he seemed to appreciate it.</p><p>\u201cJeff\u2019s lucky to have you around,\u201d he said between bites. \u201cI wish I had someone taking care of me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live on your own?\u201d I asked, trying to sound casual. I didn\u2019t think he had a girlfriend, but we hadn\u2019t actually talked about it. Probably should have asked that before grabbing his dick in the pool.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>\u201cBeen on my own since I got out of the service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArmy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarines. Two tours in Afghanistan, that was enough. Came back, bounced around for a while, joined the club.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to ask how it had been overseas, but it wasn\u2019t exactly a question you just blurted out, so I just gave him a questioning look, hoping he\u2019d volunteer something. He caught my eye and smiled, eyes crinkling just a little bit around the edges. Seeing those tiny wrinkles reminded me that I didn\u2019t even know how old he was.</p><p>Hell, I didn\u2019t even know his real name. Double oops.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean your real name,\u201d I replied, shoving his shoulder playfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know you at all, it\u2019s weird. Tell me something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy real name is Horse, that\u2019s what I go by. That\u2019s what the people who know me use. But if you want to see my driver\u2019s license, have at it.\u201d He reached over, snagging his jeans and dragging them toward us. He pulled out the leather wallet attached to his pants with a chain, flipped it open and slid out his license. I took it and giggled when I saw his name.</p><p>Marcus Antonius Caesar McDonnell.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he replied, grinning. \u201cMom had me while Dad was serving time. Wasn\u2019t a long haul, but damn she was pissed at him for leaving her alone while she was knocked up. She loved history and was reading this whole big series about Rome, so decided f**k it and named me after some Roman general. Worst part? She didn\u2019t even get the name right. Marcus Antonius Caesar wasn\u2019t a real guy. Dad shit himself, but by the time he got out it was a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if that name kicks ass or is the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d I said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my name, therefore it kicks ass,\u201d he replied gravely. \u201cSeriously, though, I never used it. Dad\u2019s the one who named me Horse, first time he saw me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, even back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven back then,\u201d he said, looking smug. \u201cIt stuck. Mom hates it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it says here that you\u2019re thirty years old and live in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where the club is based?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where my charter is. The mother charter is down in Oregon, we\u2019ve got seventeen overall. Not the biggest, but we\u2019re dominant in our territory, which goes a long way. We\u2019ve got nomads all over the country too, and even some guys overseas fighting. The Reapers were founded by Marines after \u2019Nam, and that\u2019s still where a lot of our prospects come from.\u201d</p><p>Wow, Horse was suddenly a font of information. I decided to push my luck.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in a motorcycle club, babe.\u201d</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean what do you do for a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for the club, mostly. We have different businesses, pretty well established in our area. Got a pawn shop, a bar, a gun shop and a garage. I do the books.\u201d</p><p>That surprised me. I couldn\u2019t see Horse stooped over a ledger, counting money.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he replied, laughing. \u201cJust \u2019cause I\u2019m the picture of manly perfection doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have a brain. I\u2019m actually pretty good at math, took a few classes through the GI Bill and now you see me, a regular f**kin\u2019 accountant. Our finances are more complex than you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my brother\u2019s doing website design for your businesses?\u201d</p><p>The smile on his face died, and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s club business, babe, and not the kind we talk about. Enough questions.\u201d</p><p>With that he reached and caught me behind the neck, pulling me in for a kiss. I dropped my food, but I didn\u2019t mind because he draped me across his lap, lips exploring mine slowly. When the kiss ended, I smiled up at him.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI like how you change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I could be of service.

Love that sweet ass of yours.\u201d</p><p>I shook it at him, smirking, and he crawled over to me, cupping my cheeks in his hands, rubbing the inside curves where they met my thighs with the pads of his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hot, babe. Can\u2019t wait to get inside.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, pushing back at him.</p> <p>\u201cSo goddamn sweet,\u201d he muttered, dropping his head down to kiss the small of my back.</p><p>Sweet.</p><p>Sweet ass.</p><p>Sweet butt.</p><p>\u201cHorse, what does sweet butt mean?\u201d I asked suddenly. He stilled. \u201cI know you said you call me that to piss me off, but it means more. I know it does. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, babe, you\u2019re not one of them.\u201d</p> <p>Uh-oh. I pulled away from him, cooling a little. Didn\u2019t like the sound of that at all. I sat down, facing him, knees up to my chest, arms wrapped around them pointedly, and waited.</p><p>\u201cDrop it, babe,\u201d Horse muttered, sitting back on his heels. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good place, let\u2019s just let this flow like it should. You\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen a man tells me I shouldn\u2019t think, that\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d I said, narrowing my eyes. \u201cExplain. Now.\u201d</p><p>Horse ran a hand through his hair and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know much about the Reapers, do you? Or motorcycle clubs in general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about them,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, bikers\u2014bikers like us, part of a club for life\u2014are a different culture,\u201d he said after a short pause. \u201cWe\u2019re not regular citizens, we\u2019re more like a tribe that shares territory with citizens but only answers to our own kind. Everyone who\u2019s part of the tribe has their place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, wondering where this was going.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, this is gonna piss you off and then you aren\u2019t gonna let me stick my dick in you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to be so crude?\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cHave you met me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019d let you do it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he replied in a low, rough voice, raising his eyebrow at me. I blushed. Okay, yes, I\u2019d planned on it.</p><p>But that could change.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s two kinds of people, those who are in the club and those who aren\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the club, you\u2019re family, and we\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs. You got a cut and three patches, you\u2019re a member and you vote. We got prospects too, who aren\u2019t full members yet, but if they don\u2019t punk out, they will be eventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo women in the club,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cWomen hang around the club, but they aren\u2019t part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds pretty sexist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he replied with a shrug. \u201cDon\u2019t have to like it, but that\u2019s the reality in the MC world. Remember, we don\u2019t live in your world, we live in ours and the rules are different. Some clubs let women ride, ours doesn\u2019t. We\u2019re old school. Seriously old school. But that doesn\u2019t mean women aren\u2019t important to us.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the direction this was headed.</p><p>\u201cA man takes a woman, means to keep her, she becomes his property,\u201d Horse continued. \u201cWe covered that before\u2014it\u2019s a sign of commitment, of respect. It means he\u2019ll protect her and everyone else better keep their f**king hands off her or be ready to fight him and all his brothers. You do not want to f**k with a man\u2019s old lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds messed up, Horse.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, clearly frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re judging it by citizen standards, but we\u2019re not like you,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re a tribe. We live together, we die together and what\u2019s ours is ours. When times are good, we\u2019re all good. Bad times, we may eat shit but we eat it together. Most people can\u2019t handle that level of commitment. It\u2019s like when you\u2019re in combat and taking fire\u2014you have to trust that your brothers would rather die than let you down. You feel that kind of brotherhood during war but when you come back home people expect you to sit down and work in an office like it never happened. Men\u2014at least men like me\u2014don\u2019t work like that. I turned into something else in Afghanistan and I can\u2019t just pretend it didn\u2019t happen. In the club, they don\u2019t ask me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s intense,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d he said. \u201cI know this is hard for you, but I want you to understand. This is a different life, and we have our own rules and our own justice, but it\u2019s not bad. In fact, it\u2019s pretty f**kin\u2019 good. I got a nice house, make good money, have a great time almost every f**kin\u2019 day of my life. I\u2019m alive, babe. Ninety-nine percent of men are okay with following the rules and doing what they\u2019re told. We\u2019re the other one percent, so we built our own world with our own rules. You don\u2019t f**k with us, we won\u2019t f**k with you. But once you f**k us, you will pay.\u201d</p><p>I shivered, even though the air was warm. I reached over and grabbed my shirt, pulling it over my head. Horse\u2019s eyes followed me, holding an expression I couldn\u2019t begin to fathom.</p><p>\u201cSo finish it,\u201d I said, breaking the silence. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me this for a reason, I guess. What does sweet butt mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not all women attached to the club are old ladies,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cBeing an old lady is a big deal, like I said. You don\u2019t want to take some skank as your property if you aren\u2019t ready to throw down for her. But a man\u2019s still gotta get laid. That\u2019s what sweet butts are for.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I didn\u2019t like the sound of that.</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d I said, my voice cooling.</p><p>\u201cWe got women who want to be old ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cOr just like hanging around bikers. Maybe they want a place to crash for a while. They come around the club house and if they make themselves friendly enough we let them hang around. They clean up, take care of shit, and we sort of\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He paused, looking away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not gonna like this,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cTell me. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re pretty much public pu**y,\u201d he said. \u201cMan needs a woman, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for. Entertaining the brothers. Those are the sweet butts.\u201d</p> <p>I saw red.</p><p>\u201cYou jerk!\u201d</p><p>I got up and went for my pants. He reached for me, but I slapped his hand away, yanking up my jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m a whore!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I do not think you\u2019re a whore. I told you, I like pissing you off sometimes, it\u2019s hot. You aren\u2019t a sweet butt either. You see any other guys around here? Not exactly lookin\u2019 to turn you into Chinese handcuffs, Marie!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWHAT?\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what that meant, but I knew it wasn\u2019t good. I finished getting dressed and grabbed my purse, pulling out my phone. Great. No service.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Horse muttered, pulling on his pants and tee, then grabbing his cut and jerking it on. \u201cYou won\u2019t even listen to me. You aren\u2019t like them, babe. I know that. The guys know that. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you all call me sweet butt the first time we met?\u201d I demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we had anything between us then, so you didn\u2019t do it just to piss me off. Explain that, Mr. Badass Reaper!\u201d</p><p>He looked away, rubbing a hand along the stubble on his chin, then turned back to me.</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s what you looked like,\u201d he said finally. \u201cYou were waiting outside that trailer decked out like a f**kin\u2019 wet dream. We knew Jeff didn\u2019t have a woman, at least not one in particular. Just assumed, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBabe, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake. Me. Home.\u201d</p><p>He turned away and kicked a rock, sending it into the hot springs with a splash, running his hands through his hair again. I wished he\u2019d stop doing that, because it just made him look sexier and I didn\u2019t need to think about him being sexy right now.</p><p>I needed to remember the man was a pig.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take you home,\u201d he grunted, turning back toward me. \u201cBut I want to show you something first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means!\u201d I declared grandly, throwing my arms wide. \u201cPlease, do whatever it takes to get me out of here and away from you.\u201d</p><p>Horse stalked over to the leather saddlebag he\u2019d brought and opened it. He stood there, staring down inside it for what seemed an eternity, then glanced back at me.</p><p>\u201cYou need to know that I didn\u2019t just bring you here to f**k you, Marie.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that shit,\u201d he growled. \u201cI can get laid whenever I want, I don\u2019t have to drive four hundred miles round trip to get off. Women see the bike, they see the tats and the cut, they\u2019re all over that shit. Pussy is just pu**y, but you\u2019re different. That\u2019s why I had this made for you\u2014I wanted to ask you to come back with me, give club life a shot.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a black leather vest, much smaller than his, and held it up. On the back were two embroidered patches, reading \u201cProperty of Horse, Reapers MC.\u201d</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>His face tightened, eyes growing cold.</p><p>\u201cNever offered this to anyone else, babe. Not a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t offer it to me,\u201d I hissed. \u201cI hardly know you, but what I do know is that you\u2019re a sexist pig and you can go f**k yourself and your stupid club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult the club, Marie.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone stopped me mid-rant. All traces of my sweet Horse were gone and the scary biker stood in front of me in full standoff. My anger disappeared, replaced with terrible unease. I\u2019d forgotten how terrifying he could be.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s stop this,\u201d I said after a pause. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing, there\u2019s nothing good here. Let\u2019s just stop talking and leave before things get worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me. Get your shit.\u201d</p><p>Funny, but hiking to the spring had taken about thirty minutes. Hiking back felt like ten hours. The ride home was even worse. I worried about falling off the bike the whole time, but I\u2019d be damned if I was going to wrap my arms around him and rest my head on his back like before. I held the sides of his hips, trying to keep my lower body from touching his, which was all but impossible.</p><p>When we reached the trailer he didn\u2019t even bother getting off his Harley, let alone watch to see if I got in the door all right.</p><p>Horse just roared away without looking back.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Sept. 7</p><p>Me: Are you there?</p><p>Sept. 9</p><p>Me: Horse, we should talk. I don\u2019t want us to hate each other. I think we made a mistake, please call me. I miss you. Let\u2019s fix this</p><p>Sept 10</p><p>Me: Are you even getting these? Please, even if you hate me, call me. I need to tell you something</p><p>Sept. 13</p><p>Me: Okay, you win. Bye</p><p>Sept. 15</p><p>Things got a little dark after our trip to the hot springs.</p><p>Work was okay, but it wasn\u2019t like I loved what I was doing. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the kids were awesome, but it\u2019s tiring to be surrounded by little people constantly when they can\u2019t even wipe their own rear ends. And sometimes diapers blow out, which means exactly what you\u2019d think.</p><p>Good times.</p><p>Life with Jeff wasn\u2019t going very well either. It\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t get along, because we did. We didn\u2019t fight or anything. But he\u2019d stopped talking to me, didn\u2019t seem to work much and smoked more pot every day. I had my first hint of real trouble coming when he asked me how big my paycheck was. By this time I was buying all the food, which I didn\u2019t mind. After all, he\u2019d floated me when I first got here, and when I\u2019d gotten hurt too. But it wasn\u2019t like him to mooch, believe it or not. He\u2019d always paid his way and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d carried Mom a time or two.</p><p>Things came to a head right after the Reapers visited us again, this time without Horse. Jeff didn\u2019t warn me and it was hard to tell whether the visit was planned or not. I\u2019d learned my lesson\u2014don\u2019t ask questions unless you want to hear the answers. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think there were any good answers to the questions I had about their business relationship.</p><p>I came home from work to find bikes in the driveway. Horse\u2019s wasn\u2019t there. We were totally out of food and beer because I hadn\u2019t done my grocery shopping for the week, and I sighed in frustration. I decided to go and buy pizza instead of cooking because I had a little extra cash. I just didn\u2019t feel up to whipping something together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I walked in to find Picnic, Bam Bam, Max and Jeff standing around the kitchen bar in tense silence.</p><p>\u201cUm, hi?\u201d I asked, setting down my purse.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marie,\u201d Picnic said, and while his voice wasn\u2019t friendly, it wasn\u2019t cold either. I guess Horse didn\u2019t go home and talk too much shit about me. \u201cJust talking some business here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I see that,\u201d I replied. \u201cHow \u2019bout I go and grab some pizzas? Sound good?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds great, Marie,\u201d Bam Bam said. He reached around to his wallet, pulling out some bills and offering them to me. I was stunned.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cTake the money and don\u2019t forget beer,\u201d Picnic said, his voice short. Arguing with them didn\u2019t seem like a good idea, so I grabbed the bills and retreated. I took my sweet time getting the pizzas. I really, really didn\u2019t want to come back home too early, but after hanging out at the takeout place for forty-five minutes I got a text from Jeff telling me all was clear. I grabbed the pies and drove home, hoping Jeff\u2019s weirdness lately wasn\u2019t connected to the Reapers. I kept hearing Horse\u2019s voice in my head.</p><p>Fuck with us and we will f**k you back.</p><p>Jeff wouldn\u2019t be that stupid, would he?</p> <p>When I got back, I had another of those surreal moments that seemed to happen around the Reapers with alarming frequency. Earlier I would have sworn things were ugly between them and Jeff. Now everyone was friendly\u2014practically jolly\u2014and they welcomed me (or rather, the pizzas I carried) with the kind of cheer usually reserved for returning war heroes. I tried to give Bam Bam his change, but he wouldn\u2019t take it, telling me to use it for gas.</p><p>The evening followed a familiar pattern. We ate together and then they sat around drinking beer while I cleaned up. As the night went on, the jokes got dirtier. I drank several beers. They built a bonfire. Someone suggested tequila shots. I don\u2019t usually do shots, but it seemed like a fantastic idea when viewed through my beer goggles. But I\u2019d been up since early that morning and I had to be up again at seven to get ready for work, so eventually I decided to hit the sack.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t sleep. I kept thinking about the guys outside and how Horse should be with them. Then I thought about how it felt when he held me in those strong arms of his and we slept together, all warm and safe. That made me sad, and this was where things got ugly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u201d always say you shouldn\u2019t drink and text, whoever they are.</p><p>I should have listened to them. They\u2019re pretty smart.</p><p>Me: Horse, muss yu</p> <p>Me: Why dont anser?</p><p>Me: Horse like yur name. Horsey. I\u2019d like to rid u horsey, LOL. You sleeping? Or busy with someone?</p><p>Me: I know yur there. I bet you got a new gurl alredy. Screw you.</p><p>Me: Screw you and your slut. I hate you. Take yur club and shove it up yur ass I wudn\u2019t be yoor old lady for ten milion dollrs.</p><p>To say I was hung over when my alarm went off at seven that morning would be a bit of an understatement. I discovered the messages I\u2019d sent between barf two and barf three, and then that particularly nasty one after barf three. I wanted to crawl under the trailer and die, I was so embarrassed. Through the force of extreme will, I managed to get myself to work on time. Fortunately the head count was low for the day, so the kids weren\u2019t too loud and crazy. I kept thinking about those messages, trying to decide whether to call Horse and apologize, text again or what.</p><p>I finally decided to text. He probably wouldn\u2019t take a call from me anyway, and I couldn\u2019t blame him for that. But I couldn\u2019t just leave it like that\u2014I wasn\u2019t that kind of person. I drove home after work, grabbed a big glass of water and crafted my text carefully.</p><p>Me: I\u2019m really sorry about my messages last night. It\u2019s no excuse, but I was drunk and wasn\u2019t thinking. I\u2019m sorry I bothered you and I\u2019m sorry for the things I said. I was a bitch, it wasn\u2019t called for and I feel like shit. I promise, I won\u2019t bother you again.</p><p>I sat, holding my phone, not sure if I wanted him to reply or not. Shit, my head was killing me. Why did I drink the tequila? I couldn\u2019t handle tequila, I knew that. The last time I\u2019d done tequila shots I\u2019d stripped off my shirt and danced on the coffee table at a party that had thankfully been very small. Gary\u2019d stuffed dollar bills in my jeans and told me to drink more tequila. His friends had cheered me on and waved around their own money. Gary thought that kicked ass.</p> <p>Guess I couldn\u2019t claim there hadn\u2019t been warning signs that the man was a douche...</p><p>The door slammed open and I winced.</p><p>\u201cMarie, I gotta talk to you,\u201d Jeff said, sitting down heavily on the stool next to mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty hung over. I don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d I muttered, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important. I need money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019ve got a little in my purse,\u201d I replied. \u201cHow much do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot,\u201d he replied, not meeting my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m kind of in a bind.\u201d</p><p>That caught my attention, and I looked at him. Really looked at him. What I saw shocked me. He\u2019d lost at least ten pounds in the past couple weeks, and his hair clearly hadn\u2019t been washed in a couple of days. His face was sallow and his eyes dull\u2014not just hangover dull.</p><p>\u201cJeff, are you sick? You don\u2019t look good. I want to take your temperature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Marie!\u201d he burst out, slamming his hand down on the counter so hard I felt the trailer shake. I jumped, startled. \u201cWhy are you so damn pushy? I\u2019m not your kid, I\u2019m a grown man.\u201d</p><p>I froze. Jeff never yelled at me. In fact, Jeff never yelled, period. He\u2019d always been mellow and the pot didn\u2019t exactly work to change that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, reaching up and rubbing his shoulder, as if he\u2019d been carrying something heavy and his back ached. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t yell at you. But I really need some money fast, Marie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapital,\u201d he replied, not meeting my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got a business deal in the works, but I need startup cash. In fact, I need a lot of startup cash. Hell of an opportunity, I can\u2019t afford to miss it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, wondering if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You know I don\u2019t have money like that,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can have all I\u2019ve got, but it\u2019s about twelve hundred bucks total. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gary?\u201d</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That stopped me short.</p><p>\u201cGary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a community property state, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Jeff asked, shifting nervously. \u201cYou can call him and make him give you the money. Do it for me, Marie. I really need the cash.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head slowly, unsure I\u2019d actually heard him correctly.</p> <p>\u201cWell, for one thing, Gary never has any cash,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cHe spends it faster than he makes it, and it\u2019s not like we owned anything valuable. And for another, did you forget that the last time I saw him he beat the crap out of me?\u201d</p><p>Jeff leaned toward me, putting his hands on my shoulders, meeting me face-to-face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m desperate, sis. What about your house? Can you get a line of credit on your house?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head again, stunned. Had Jeff lost his mind?</p><p>\u201cThe house is already mortgaged to the hilt. We\u2019re probably upside down on the thing. What\u2019s really going on?\u201d I demanded. I didn\u2019t buy this \u201cbusiness deal\u201d thing for a minute, and I refused to believe Jeff had forgotten what Gary did to me. I couldn\u2019t deny it any longer\u2014something really wrong, really wrong was happening. Something bad enough to make my baby brother desperate.</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, shaking his head at me, turning away. \u201cI wanted to make this deal happen and thought you might help me. You\u2019re right, I shouldn\u2019t have asked you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>With that he turned and walked back out of the trailer. Seconds later his car started and he disappeared for the night. Seems so obvious in retrospect, but honestly\u2014I didn\u2019t see what happened next coming.</p><p>Not even a little bit.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho</p><p>Sept. 16</p> <p>Horse</p><p>Horse leaned back against the bed, watching Serena\u2019s ass as she rode his c**k like a rodeo queen.</p><p>Better than looking at her face. Not that Serena wasn\u2019t pretty, but she didn\u2019t hold a candle to Marie.</p><p>Now her... He could look at her face all day.</p><p>Most of his brothers wanted him to forget about the bitch. Women like her aren\u2019t worth the hassle, just grab some sweet butt to be your house mouse if random hookups aren\u2019t working for you. And if she gets on your nerves? Well, there\u2019s always another bitch waiting to take her place.</p><p>Serena stopped, turning to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou paying attention?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, babe, lost in my thoughts. Let\u2019s keep it up, okay?\u201d</p><p>He gave her ass an encouraging smack, and she smiled at him with carefully painted lips. The girl was a pro, no question there. Cunt like a vise, mouth like a vacuum. He\u2019d be crazy to consider giving up hot and cold running pu**y like this for an old lady who could be a certified bitch.</p><p>But what a bitch...</p><p>He never got bored around Marie, and that was the f**kin\u2019 truth. And he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get distracted with her on his cock. She might not be a pro like Serena, but she had the sweetest pu**y he\u2019d ever tasted. Damn, but he wanted to taste her again. The thought made him even harder.</p><p>An hour later, Serena was gone and Horse still hadn\u2019t budged from the bed. Time to head over to the clubhouse soon, but he just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Marie. They were going to discuss Jeff-hole\u2019s f**kups during church today.</p><p>Damn, Marie\u2019s f**kwad brother was an idiot.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t like they hadn\u2019t been patient.</p><p>Horse had started finding \u201cmistakes\u201d in the wire transfers almost three months ago. Small ones at first, a thousand here, five hundred there. Then they got bigger. Jeff had all kinds of excuses, from simple typos to running behind on his reports. But in the end, it all pointed in the same direction\u2014Jeff was running a skim. Fuckwit thought he could steal from the Reapers and live to enjoy it.</p><p>Just thinking about shit like this made Horse feel old.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like Jeff didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d gotten into. Hell, he\u2019d come to them. They\u2019d made it clear from the start that they wouldn\u2019t tolerate any bullshit and that the penalty for said bullshit would be high. The worst part would be the collateral damage. Marie. She loved that douche, really loved him.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t see a happy ending.</p><p>If Marie was his old lady, he might be able to protect her brother a little better. Give him a chance to save his ass. As it stood, the f**ker was toast, along with any chance Horse might have with Marie. Best-case scenario she\u2019d never figure out what happened to Jeff, spend the rest of her life wondering and suspecting that the Reapers\u2019d killed him.</p><p>Best case.</p><p>Worst case?</p><p>LEO would show up at her door to tell her that Jeff\u2019s body had been found in a shallow grave minus his balls and dick, an \u201cR\u201d for Reapers carved into his damned chest. But Marie didn\u2019t want them to \u201chate each other\u201d for what went down at the hot springs. That was the least of his worries, for chrissake.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Horse thought about how hot she looked in the picture she\u2019d texted him, the one where she was all dressed up to go out. Right on schedule his dick stood at attention, begging for a f**k as if Serena hadn\u2019t just wrung him dry.</p><p>Marie\u2019s picture was cute and sexy, just like her. She\u2019d taken it in the bathroom mirror, all dressed up to go party with her friend. Little black dress, showing off way too much of her cle**age. And her legs... He couldn\u2019t see all of those legs, but any f**ker standing next to her would see them and more if she bent over even a little bit. And those fishnet tights? Fuckin\u2019 A.</p><p>He reached down and grabbed his cock, sliding his hand up and down the length roughly. He hunted for his phone with the other, wanting to pull up the pic, but it wasn\u2019t on the bedside table.</p><p>Shit, he\u2019d left it at the clubhouse last night.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter, her image was burned in his brain. He\u2019d \u2019bout lost his mind the night she\u2019d sent it to him. She looked fantastic, no question. But his woman shouldn\u2019t be going out dressed like that without him there to protect her. Every man in the place would take one look at those legs and see themselves bending her over a table, shoving their dicks right up her ass.</p><p>The thought of her down and spread on a table made Horse gasp, pre-come dripping down his erection. He slid his hand up, smearing the fluid around, and started jacking himself seriously. He could see it already. He\u2019d walk up to her in the club, right behind her where she couldn\u2019t see. She\u2019d be talking to her girlfriend, laughing and sipping on some kind of pink girly shit, because Marie was all girl. Her lips would wrap around that straw, sucking down the booze like she\u2019d suck down his come after blowing him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Horse slid his fingers up, catching more of the pre-come oozing out and circled his head with it. Fuck, that felt good. What did it say about a man when jacking off to a memory felt better than a hot bitch like Serena doing a reverse cowgirl?</p><p>Horse felt a climax building in his swollen balls, a shitload of come just for Marie. She had the hottest mouth, the softest hands and a pu**y he\u2019d die for. He couldn\u2019t wait to blow all over her tits and make her rub it while she fingered herself.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t he managed to f**k her yet?</p><p>Time to fix that. He\u2019d walk up behind her, reach around and take the drink out of her hand, setting it on the table. Then he\u2019d grab her around the waist before she could complain, swinging her little body up into his arms and carrying her right into the bathroom.</p><p>Ass like hers was too hot to wait until they got home.</p><p>She\u2019d probably bitch a little when he bent her over, but he\u2019d shut her up, warning her to brace against the counter. Damn, but his girl could bitch about anything. The thought of Marie\u2019s face, all pissed off at him for calling her sweet butt, made his c**k jerk, and he had to stop moving for a second.</p><p>No good, blowing your wad before the best part.</p><p>After about a minute he\u2019d cooled off enough to let the fantasy play out.</p><p>He\u2019d push her over and slide his hands under that little dress, pulling it up until he saw the small of her back. Those fishnets would be hooked to a garter belt, with a black thong to match. He\u2019d reach down and push the narrow flap of fabric aside, sliding his finger into her cunt to feel just how hot and tight she was.</p><p>She might complain but Marie was always ready for him, no question. Horse let the fantasy take over again. Fuck...</p><p>In his mind he unzipped his jeans, pushing them down just enough to pull out his c**k and balls, rubbing his c**k head against the crease of her ass. She shivered, and he slid off those naughty little panties of hers, dropping them to the floor. She stepped out of them and set her high heels wide, tilting up her ass and inviting him right on in.</p><p>Be rude to turn down an invitation like that.</p><p>He reached down, grabbing the tip of his cock, sliding it along the slit of her pu**y a couple of times before settling himself. Then he took her hips in his hands, holding her tight, and thrust himself all the way in. She screamed, muscles tightening up around his cock. He should have taken it slower, she\u2019d probably never had a man so big inside before.</p><p>\u201cSorry, baby,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she whispered, sucking in deep breaths. He felt her membranes tighten around him, twitching and squeezing him harder than that goddamn masseuse from the spa in downtown Spokane. So f**kin\u2019 hot. Horse couldn\u2019t wait any longer.</p><p>Slowly he pulled out as she gripped him, muscles twitching. He retreated almost all the way, feeling her lips tighten around the rim of his head before slamming back into her.</p><p>Things got wild after that.</p><p>It took everything he had to stay upright as he f**ked Marie. She gasped each time he bottomed out, cunt wrapped around him so tight it almost hurt. Fuck, she felt good. Again and again he forced his way into her small body, until he felt his balls drawing up, ready to blow his load straight into her womb.</p><p>Marie was close too. She\u2019d gotten so wet and sloppy that every thrust squelched and she kept begging him for more, to f**k her harder. He leaned over, covering her body with his, bracing himself against the counter with one hand while the other searched for her clit.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>Horse thrust his finger against it, too far gone to be subtle or gentle. Apparently she didn\u2019t mind, because as soon as he touched it she blew up like a f**kin\u2019 bomb around him, screaming. It felt incredible, the way her entire body centered on him, gripping him, begging for his come.</p><p>He\u2019d give it to her too.</p><p>Horse released her clit, leaning both arms against the counter as he started really hammering her. Their grunts mixed as he took her, branding her as his and f**king her so hard she\u2019d feel his c**k in the back of her throat.</p> <p>Marie.</p><p>His girl.</p><p>His property.</p><p>Only his.</p><p>Horse blew up, coming so hard he forgot to breathe. He let his hand fall away from his cock, dropping the fantasy. Then he started laughing at himself right there in his bedroom, the sound anything but funny because f**king Marie in his head was better than f**king Serena for real.</p><p>Might as well shoot himself, get it over with.</p><p>Horse pulled up to the clubhouse, cutting it far too close for church.</p><p>One of the prospects stood in the parking lot outside, watching the bikes and keeping an eye on the gate. The Reapers bought the old National Guard armory fifteen years back. With its concrete block construction, walled courtyard and small windows it was perfect, both as a clubhouse and a fortress. Not that they\u2019d come under attack recently. The Reapers were indisputably dominant in the area, with all other clubs operating only with their blessing. That was the subject of the meeting.</p><p>Protecting that dominance.</p><p>Horse walked into the clubhouse, which was first and foremost a lounge and hangout area. There were rooms upstairs kitted out for overnight visits, of course, and some storage, but they never kept anything too sensitive there. At least nothing where LEO could ever find it. The cops didn\u2019t show up often, but the times they\u2019d brought warrants they hadn\u2019t found jack shit.</p><p>The girls needed to come through and clean the place out, Horse decided, looking around the clubhouse with distaste. Debris from last night\u2019s party still littered the tables, couches and the long bar along one wall. Most of them were probably still sleeping it off upstairs, although a dirty blonde wearing a tight jean skirt and halter top was passed out on the couch, legs spread wide. Thank God he didn\u2019t live here anymore; now that he had his own place he cringed at what used to seem normal in terms of hygiene.</p><p>Yup, getting old.</p><p>\u201cYou coming, bro?\u201d asked Ruger, a heavily tattooed and pierced man with a short mohawk. He stood by the door with another of their prospects, Painter. \u201cLast one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry,\u201d Horse replied. He handed his gun to Painter, who set it carefully on the counter with the others, next to a box full of cell phones.</p><p>\u201cYou got mine in there already?\u201d he asked. \u201cThink I left it here last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Horse nodded his thanks and walked into church.</p><p>Fifteen guys, all but three of their active, full-patch members, already sat around the big, scarred wooden table that had once decorated some fancy-assed conference room. Now it had a thousand nicks and little carvings in it, and a big RFFR painted in the center\u2014Reapers Forever, Forever Reapers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNice you could join us,\u201d said Picnic, sitting at the head of the table. \u201cThought Serena might have sucked you in. Get lost in that snatch of hers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five o\u2019clock exactly,\u201d Horse said, shrugging as he draped his large frame across an empty chair. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a precisely tuned, high-performance machine, unlike you and that crap-ass bike you ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Picnic said, grinning back. Then his expression grew more serious. \u201cOkay, boys, we got something important to deal with today. I think you all know we\u2019ve got a thief. Jeff Jensen, computer guy, out of the Yakima Valley. Got back from seeing him this morning, no progress at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the guy handling our offshore stuff, right?\u201d asked Ruger.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cComputer genius, knows his shit, our transactions are untraceable. God knows we\u2019re paying him for it too. But it\u2019s not enough. He\u2019s been skimming for months. Been tracking it down for a while now, already gave him opportunities to make it right, so it\u2019s not just a matter of him screwing up. Definitely skimming. It\u2019s small compared to our total volume, but we can\u2019t let shit like this happen. Bad for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe let one do it, they\u2019re all gonna try,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cWe start losing respect, next thing you know the girls at the Line\u2019ll be giving drinks and lap dances to another MC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the damage?\u201d asked Bam Bam.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re right at $50k,\u201d Horse answered. \u201cIt\u2019s been push and pull, he grabs a couple grand, then tries to pay it back. He\u2019s gambling, maybe using. I hate to lose him as an asset because we don\u2019t have anyone else in the fold to replace him. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve given him so many chances to make things right. But his losses are getting bigger\u2014as of last week he was only into us for $20k total, so it\u2019s escalating fast. We let him go much longer and we\u2019ll be down serious cash. He might even pull a runner on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should put him in the ground,\u201d Max said, voice firm and cold. Horse glanced at him, surprised to see his face flushed, the little muscle in his jaw flexing with suppressed emotion. Max was still on probation, and it wasn\u2019t usual for a guy in his position to talk so much during church. Max\u2019s blood tended to run hot though. He was one of the hardest men Horse had ever met, which was saying a lot. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything but lead this guy to the shitter and wipe his ass. He\u2019s always making promises, always got an excuse, but nothing ever changes. You should\u2019ve seen him last night. He\u2019s definitely tweaking. Time to cut our losses.\u201d</p> <p>The words hung heavy in the air.</p><p>\u201cHow much does he know about club business?\u201d asked Duck, a Vietnam vet who couldn\u2019t make the long runs anymore. He spent most of his time in the clubhouse drinking beer and telling the girls stories about back in the day when men were men and women knew their place. Horse didn\u2019t much like the man but he\u2019d still trust him with his life.</p><p>He\u2019d trust any of the brothers with his life.</p><p>\u201cToo much,\u201d Horse replied, his voice heavy. \u201cWay too much. He\u2019s a liability if we don\u2019t take out some kind of insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind insurance is good enough for a guy like that?\u201d asked Max, clearly spoiling for a fight, although damned if Horse could understand why. \u201cHe\u2019s a liar and a thief. The money we\u2019ve been feeding him for his work should be enough for anyone. Instead he\u2019s livin\u2019 in a shithole, smoking weed and waiting for his sister to bring home her f**kin\u2019 pathetic little paychecks. What kind of man lives like that? Even if he started playing it straight, we\u2019d never be able to believe him. Probably full of all kinds of crazy lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d Picnic murmured. He looked up at Horse, his face grave.</p> <p>\u201cWe in agreement here?\u201d</p><p>Horse glanced around the room, seeing Jensen\u2019s death written in every face. He couldn\u2019t argue with them\u2014the man knew way too much. He needed to be removed.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He thought about Marie, what she looked like when she was pissed at him, spitting fire like a little dragon. Damn, he wanted to get inside that woman. Once wouldn\u2019t be close to enough. As usual his dick stood up to salute the idea, but what really pushed him over the edge was the thought of Marie crying over that lame-ass bastard.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the sister?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d Picnic replied, voice carefully neutral.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gonna be my old lady. Some nice insurance there,\u201d Horse said, aware of the pointed looks several of the brothers gave each other. \u201cAnd when it\u2019s family, we take care of business different and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast I heard, she wasn\u2019t on board with that,\u201d Picnic replied slowly. \u201cGirl didn\u2019t even ask about you last night, Horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s precedent. Not all old ladies start out with their priorities in line, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be claimed if the president approves it and the members agree. It\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, thirty years ago,\u201d snapped Bam Bam. \u201cThey did all kinds of shit back then. We\u2019re livin\u2019 in a modern world, bro, you can\u2019t just kidnap some chick and take her home.\u201d</p><p>Duck snorted and slammed his hand down on the table, startling everyone.</p><p>\u201cYou pussies talk about the modern world like we give a shit about their rules. Remember who we are,\u201d he boomed. \u201cWe\u2019re men\u2014one percenters. Fucking kings of the MC world. We don\u2019t follow the rules, we make our own goddamn rules. My brother Horse wants a woman, wants her bad enough to come to the club and throw down for her. He ever done that before?\u201d</p><p>He looked around the room, glaring at each man in turn.</p><p>Horse bit back a grin. Duck on a roll, hadn\u2019t seen that one coming.</p><p>\u201cOur brother has come before this club and let us know his intention to take an old lady,\u201d Duck continued. \u201cThe situation is complicated. We all know he\u2019ll put the club first, so we hear him out and back his play. He may not always be right, but he\u2019s always our brother. You little cocksuckers need to think about that, \u2019fore I show up here one day and find you growing tits in place of your balls.\u201d</p><p>Duck sat back with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cHow \u2019bout you tell us what you really think, Duck,\u201d said Ruger, laughing and relaxing back into his chair. \u201cJesus.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Horse said, voice deadly serious. \u201cI may not always be right, but I am always your brother\u2014or at least I thought I was. A Reaper takes what he wants. You got my back?\u201d</p><p>Picnic sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot, you know that?\u201d he said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t part of our world, she\u2019s got no idea what to expect and she doesn\u2019t even want to try. It\u2019s not gonna end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my problem, now isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your problem so long as you keep it controlled and out of club business,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice kid, I like her. Good cook, f**king love that potato salad of hers. Puts bacon in it. It\u2019d be nice to have some of that shit with dinner next time we roast a pig. But that still leaves us to deal with her brother. Makes things more complicated.\u201d</p><p>Horse smiled. He\u2019d won\u2014this was just details.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s our insurance,\u201d he answered. \u201cLet the brother know that if he doesn\u2019t pay us back, he\u2019ll never see her again. Give him a few months, see how things play out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll find a way to pay us back?\u201d asked Picnic.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d Horse admitted. \u201cThe guy practically prints money when he\u2019s focused and sober. Enough motivation, he may come through for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHasn\u2019t so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves his sister,\u201d Bam Bam said quietly. \u201cHe\u2019s a weasel and a bastard, but he really does care about her. Seen it with my own eyes. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hang her out to dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make sure he knows\u2014he doesn\u2019t pay, she\u2019s in big trouble,\u201d Horse said. \u201cHe pays up, great. He blows this deal, we put him in the ground. Everybody wins.\u201d</p><p>Except Marie. But Jensen was a big boy and he\u2019d chosen to do business with and then screw over the Reapers MC. If it wasn\u2019t for her, f**ker\u2019d be dead already.</p><p>\u201cAnd the issue of respect?\u201d asked Ruger. \u201cWe have to cover our bases here. Can\u2019t look weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cBut taking a man\u2019s sister, holding her hostage? That\u2019s payment in blood, we spread it \u2019round the right places. It should do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting one thing,\u201d said Max. Horse looked at him, trying to read his mind. Something was up with Max. They all cared about club business, but this was a step beyond. Almost personal.</p><p>\u201cThe money,\u201d Max continued. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to let Horse have his little f**k toy, I don\u2019t give a shit about that. It\u2019s another to just sit back and lose fifty large. You guys may have money stashed somewhere, but I don\u2019t. We sure we want to risk that kind of cash on this asshat pulling through for us, on top of the risk of him running to LEO?\u201d</p><p>Horse narrowed his eyes at Max, who met them straight on. The man didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good point,\u201d Bam Bam said, his voice mild. \u201cOf course, we take him out now, we never see that money again anyway, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell maybe we wouldn\u2019t have our asses hanging out so far if Horse\u2019d done a better job watching him.\u201d</p><p>Picnic sat up.</p><p>\u201cCareful, brother,\u201d he said, his voice cold. \u201cHorse did his job. It was my call to let this play out, and I had good reason. That little shit made half a million bucks for this club, easy, in the last two years. You don\u2019t just throw something like that away if you don\u2019t have to. Fucker\u2019s got a gift, can\u2019t just replace him. That\u2019s why I like this idea, maybe we can still save the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not voting for it,\u201d Max said. \u201cWe need to put him down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I buy her?\u201d Horse said. Everyone turned to look at him, startled. \u201cI\u2019ll buy Marie from the club, and we give Jensen another shot. Fifty grand, outta my pocket and into the club account. We wait and see if Jensen comes up with the money and interest. He does, I get paid back, the club makes a profit. He doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s f**ked up,\u201d muttered Bam Bam. \u201cNo cunt worth that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a cunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all cunts,\u201d Max snapped. Horse caught his eye, staring him down.</p><p>\u201cPlay nice, boys,\u201d said Picnic. \u201cI think you\u2019re crazy, Horse, but this works for me. That good enough for you, Max?\u201d</p><p>Max dipped his head in agreement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with Picnic, you\u2019re crazy,\u201d said Bam Bam. \u201cShould be a hell of a show. She hates you, Horse. Jensen told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty pissed at her myself,\u201d Horse said. \u201cWe gotta work through that. But she\u2019s mine and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d</p><p>Picnic rolled his eyes and Ruger snorted.</p><p>\u201cNice to see youngsters acting like men instead of chorus girls,\u201d Duck grunted, looking around the table in approval. \u201cLet\u2019s vote. I want beer.\u201d</p><p>Horse left the meeting feeling pretty good. Paying out the money was gonna hurt, no question. But he\u2019d been thinking about putting up a new shop on the property, so he had the cash. He damned sure wanted Marie more than a shop. He couldn\u2019t wait to come home to her after a tough day, the smell of her cooking in the house, the sight of her in an apron and nothing else.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>Horse grabbed his phone out of the box, thinking he should have called her before now. He\u2019d gotten her sweet little text messages and knew she was hurting. Hell, he\u2019d wanted her to hurt, he could admit it. She\u2019d hurt him, so he let her dangle for a few days...</p><p>But now that them being together was a reality? Time to let it go. He stepped out of the clubhouse and into the sunlight, powering up the phone. It pinged repeatedly, letting him know he\u2019d missed a bunch of text messages from the night before.</p><p>Marie: Horse, muss yu</p><p>Marie: Why dont anser?</p><p>Marie: Horse like yur name. Horsey. I\u2019d like to rid u horsey, LOL. You sleeping? Or busy with someone?</p><p>Marie: I know yur there. I bet you got a new gurl alredy. Screw you.</p><p>Marie: Screw you and your slut. I hate you. Take yur club and shove it up yur ass I wudn\u2019t be yoor old lady for ten milion dollrs.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She\u2019d been drunk, no question. And when people were drunk they said stupid shit, but they also told the truth. Marie might want his body, but she definitely didn\u2019t want to be his old lady, despite all her sweet little texts to him trying to mend fences.</p><p>\u201cGoddamit!\u201d he yelled, throwing the phone at the concrete block wall of the clubhouse. It hit hard, shattering, as Ruger stepped outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProblem?\u201d he asked, raising a brow and looking from the phone to Horse.</p><p>Horse shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he said, tamping down his anger. He\u2019d made his choice, taken a stand in front of the club. He\u2019d play it out. But Marie was damned well going to pay him back that fifty grand one way or another. \u201cDecided it\u2019s time to get a new phone, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was wrong with the old one?\u201d Ruger asked, his voice mild.</p> <p>\u201cIt broke.\u201d</p><p>Sept. 17\u2014Present Day</p><p>Horse looked down at Jeff, feeling detached.</p><p>The man knelt in the middle of the floor, hands cuffed behind his back, Picnic standing over him with a gun. Blood ran down his face\u2014they\u2019d given him a decent beating, but not serious enough to need a hospital. Just bad enough to make him really, really uncomfortable and hopefully scare the hell out of Marie.</p><p>He\u2019d have a few permanent scars to help him remember not to f**k over the Reapers too.</p> <p>\u201cI wonder if sissy\u2019s gonna bail you out?\u201d Picnic asked Jeff. \u201cYou really screwed yourself this time, little man. Do you not know our motto? Fuck with us and we will f**k with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jeff whispered, eyes wild behind his puffing eyelids. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose, you\u2019ve got to give me another chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many chances do you need?\u201d Horse demanded. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep a straight face, listening to you talk.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s phone pinged on the counter, and Ruger picked it up.</p><p>\u201cText from Marie,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna be home in a few, leaving the store now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cText her back,\u201d Jeff said quickly. \u201cPlease, she doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this. Don\u2019t let this happen, just tell her not to come home for another hour. Don\u2019t let this be her last memory of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Picnic said, sounding exasperated.</p><p>Jeff shut up.</p><p>\u201cYou guys said this was a dump, but I didn\u2019t realize just how bad,\u201d Ruger said, leaning back against the wall, crossing his arms in front of him as he surveyed the room. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you let your sister live like this, f**kwad, especially given how much money we\u2019ve been paying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a shitty brother,\u201d Jeff mumbled. \u201cI know that. But don\u2019t hurt Marie, she\u2019s a sweetheart. Right? Never hurt anyone, doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sure she\u2019s sweet,\u201d Ruger replied, smirking. Horse shot him a dark look, but it didn\u2019t shut him up. Ruger grinned at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t seriously expect us not to f**k with you over this, Horse.\u201d</p><p>Horse shrugged\u2014he didn\u2019t, actually. What a mess. Fifty grand out the door for a woman who didn\u2019t even want him. He ran a hand through his hair. At least he\u2019d finally get to f**k her.</p><p>For fifty grand her cunt better be lined with gold.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pulling up now,\u201d Painter said from his station near the window. \u201cGot an armful of groceries. Should I help her carry them in?\u201d</p> <p>The men just looked at him, Picnic shaking his head in bemusement.</p><p>\u201cJoking, right?\u201d asked Ruger.</p><p>\u201cSorry, guess I didn\u2019t think that one through,\u201d Painter said. Horse had his doubts about the prospect\u2014still pretty young, and so green. Could take him years to earn his top rocker at this point. The door opened and Marie walked in.</p><p>She screamed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sis,\u201d Jeff said, the words muffled and broken. Marie looked around the room frantically, disbelief and shock written all over her face. Horse felt his c**k harden and decided he was one sick f**k. The woman was terrified and she didn\u2019t want him, yet she still turned him on. Of course, just about everything she did turned him on.</p><p>Everything but throwing his offer to take her as property back in his face. Fuckin\u2019 bitch and her text messages. He might\u2019ve paid fifty grand for her, but she claimed a million wouldn\u2019t be enough?</p><p>She should be grateful to him for saving her brother.</p><p>Picnic looked at Marie and winked. That was creepy, even to Horse, and it surprised him that she didn\u2019t have a heart attack on the spot. Good, he wanted her afraid.</p><p>\u201cLittle brother\u2019s been a bad boy,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing from us. You know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, a grocery bag falling, apples rolling on the floor. One hit Horse\u2019s foot and it took all his willpower not to kick it at Jensen\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, giving her brother a pleading look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be working for us,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cPretty good with that little laptop of his, sure you get that. But instead of working he\u2019s been playing at the casino with our f**king money. Now he has the balls to tell me that he\u2019s lost the money and can\u2019t pay us back.\u201d</p><p>He punctuated the last four words with jabs of his pistol\u2019s thick, round barrel into the back of Jeff\u2019s neck. Marie looked stunned, blinking rapidly. Horse could almost see the thoughts racing through her pretty little head.</p><p>\u201cYou got fifty grand on you?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>\u201cHe stole fifty thousand dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d Horse said. \u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t get paid back right now, his options are limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were friends,\u201d she whispered, eyes darting between Horse, Jensen and Picnic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet kid,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get who we are. There\u2019s the club and everyone else, and this stupid f**ker is not part of the club. You f**k with us, we will f**k you back. Harder. Always.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s mouth trembled, tears welling up in his eyes. Horse\u2019d been surprised the guy didn\u2019t start bawling earlier, to be honest. Then Jensen pissed his pants.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d muttered Ruger. \u201cI f**king hate it when they piss themselves.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the man and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see your sister pissing herself, do you? What a little bitch,\u201d he said, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill us?\u201d Marie asked, starting to tremble. She\u2019d lost the color in her face. Horse looked at Jensen, disgusted. What kind of ass**le put his sister through something like this\u2014not just this, here, but living in a dump like this, working all day changing diapers for minimum wage?</p><p>\u201cI mean, would you really kill people you shared pictures of your daughters with?\u201d Marie asked, studying Picnic\u2019s face. \u201cOne of them is about my age, isn\u2019t she? Can\u2019t we work something out? Maybe we can make payments or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Horse snorted and shook his head. Time to move things along.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, sweetie, this isn\u2019t just about money. We could give a shit about the money. This is about respect and stealing from the club. We let this pissant f**k get away with it, they\u2019ll all start doing it. We don\u2019t let stuff like this slide. Ever. He pays with blood.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes for second, and Horse saw the moisture hovering on her lashes. Shit, he hated women crying. No, he hated bitches crying, and Marie was just another bitch. He needed to remember that.</p><p>\u201cJeff, why?\u201d she whispered, and the heartbreak and despair in her voice made Painter flinch. Horse grew cold, dark rage building. How dare the little prick look at her like that, pleading with his eyes, and what did he do to deserve her loyalty?</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to lose it,\u201d he replied, his voice full of despair. \u201cI thought I could win it back, make it up somehow. Or that maybe I could hide it in the wire transfers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up,\u201d Picnic said, smacking the side of Jensen\u2019s head with his free hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk club business. Even when you\u2019re about to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another way,\u201d Horse said, deciding to lay things out for her. Might as well get it over with and make damned sure she understood her place. He\u2019d offered her better, but she hadn\u2019t wanted it. Now she\u2019d take what she got, and she better not complain about it. \u201cPaying in blood can mean different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to die for that to happen,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cMaybe you can burn down our trailer!\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him like she\u2019d won the cake at a cakewalk.</p> <p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re gonna do that no matter what,\u201d Horse drawled. \u201cBut that\u2019s not blood. I can think of something that is though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jeff asked, his voice full of desperate hope. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything, I swear. If you give me a chance I\u2019ll crack so many accounts for you, you won\u2019t believe what we can accomplish. I\u2019ll stop smoking, that\u2019ll clear my head, I\u2019ll do a better job...\u201d</p><p>His voice trailed off as Horse laughed, and the mohawk guy shook his head and grinned at Picnic.</p><p>\u201cYou believe this ass**le?\u201d he asked. \u201cSeriously, douche, you aren\u2019t making a very good case for yourself, telling us just how much you been slacking.\u201d</p><p>Jeff whimpered, and Horse saw Marie jerk forward, as if she wanted to go to him but thought better of it. That pissed him off even more. He wanted that kind of caring from her and she wasted it on her brother instead. But he was getting too worked up too fast, he needed to keep his cool. He took a second to slow down, stretching his neck from side to side, cracking his knuckles. That cleared his head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a couple of things clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you, Marie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d she asked, and the surprise in her eyes stabbed right through him. She thought he\u2019d hurt her, like her asshat ex, Gary. Might as well call him a monster. He forced himself back on track.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, we aren\u2019t pissed at you. This isn\u2019t about you. You\u2019ll keep your mouth shut if you want to survive, and you\u2019re smart enough to know that. That\u2019s not why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can see just how seriously f**ked your brother is,\u201d he replied. \u201cBecause we\u2019re going to kill him if he doesn\u2019t find a way to pay us back. I think he might be able to pull it off with the proper motivation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Jeff babbled. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you back, thank you so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll pay us back twice as much, f**kwad,\u201d Picnic said, kicking him viciously in the side with his heavy leather boot. Jeff pitched to the floor, keening in pain. \u201cThat\u2019s if we let you live, which is entirely up to your sister.\u201d</p><p>Now was the moment. Horse wondered if he\u2019d have to argue with her or just throw her in the truck, hands tied behind her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Well shit. That was a little too easy. Didn\u2019t she care about her safety at all? Nope, all she cared about was Jeff-hole. Horse snorted, disgusted, letting his eyes roam across her body. Fuck, she was hot. Even like this, straight from work, scared out of her mind. His Marie was small and curvy, with hair framing her face and tits heaving as she tried to control her fear. He\u2019d bet a thousand dollars she had no idea the top four buttons of her shirt had come undone, showing a hell of a lot of cle**age and the outline of her black bra.</p><p>His dick approved. It wanted to squeeze between those boobs and shoot out a pretty pearl necklace for her to wear. Horse took a deep breath, this wasn\u2019t over yet. He could f**k her tits later. Might be the first thing on his list.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to ask what it is first?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems Horse here wants a house mouse,\u201d Picnic said. She looked blank. Picnic sighed and looked at Horse. \u201cShe\u2019s clueless, you sure about this? Seems like work to me.\u201d</p><p>Horse glared at him, wondering if he could hit him without f**king up his plan. Probably not. He turned back to Marie, forcing himself to stay calm, collected.</p><p>\u201cThis is your option,\u201d he said, voice clipped. \u201cYou want to keep dumbass alive, pack a bag and climb on my bike when we leave. You do what I tell you, when I tell you, no questions and no bitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, so cute and confused and blank it pissed him off even more. Didn\u2019t she have any survival skills at all?</p><p>\u201cSo you can cook dessert for me,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. Seriously, she didn\u2019t get what was happening here? He shook his head, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you think?\u201d he said, the words grating and harsh. \u201cSo I can f**k you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re threatening to kill my brother just so you can sleep with me?\u201d Marie asked, her face stricken.</p><p>Ruger walked over to Horse, draping his arm around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cute, but not real smart. Why don\u2019t you let me take her for a ride, get her trained up for you.\u201d</p><p>Ruger pumped his hips lewdly toward Marie. Horse turned and punched him in the stomach, the prick. He\u2019d had too much of this shit, time to move along. He wanted Marie alone, naked, riding his cock. Enough with the pleasantries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grabbing her arm, he dragged her out of the trailer and into the orchard, pushing her back against one of the trees. She was breathing hard, making her boobs rise and fall, taunting him. He was pissed at Jeff, pissed at Ruger and pissed at Marie for being so damned perfect that she\u2019d pushed him to this after he should have cut her loose. He\u2019d offered her everything and she\u2019d thrown it back in his face, yet she was perfectly willing to pimp herself out for that f**kface of a brother.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep with you,\u201d he told her grimly. \u201cI want to f**k you. Sleeping, cuddling, all that other shit is for girlfriends and old ladies, and you\u2019ve made it pretty f**king clear you aren\u2019t interested in any of that,\u201d he said, thinking about the leathers he\u2019d gotten for her. What a joke. \u201cI\u2019m threatening your brother because he stole from the club, which had nothing to do with you. You steal from the club, you pay in blood. You\u2019re his blood. We take you, he pays. Fucking you is just a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re taking me to show that people shouldn\u2019t steal from the club?\u201d she asked, and he thought he saw a glint of understanding in her eyes. Finally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a f**kin\u2019 miracle, she gets it,\u201d he muttered to no one, throwing up his hands. \u201cYour brother\u2019s lucky, because I wanna stick my dick in you more than I wanna kill him. Otherwise this wouldn\u2019t be worth the trouble. If Jeff-hole gets his shit together and pays back the club I might let you go\u2014when I\u2019m done with you. If he doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll find some other use for you. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>Let her go? Not likely. Still, he had to play out the game. At some point she\u2019d talk to her brother again, and when she did, dickwad needed to hear the right message.</p><p>\u201cNo games, no bullshit,\u201d he said. He stepped away, trying to calm down, then turned back toward her. She looked terrified, clutching her hands together, tears streaming down her face. Suddenly he felt like an ass**le. \u201cYou do this, it\u2019s your choice. I\u2019m not raping you. You\u2019re making a decision to pay for your brother\u2019s mistake on your back. You get me?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, eyes full of condemnation. That shamed him, and he didn\u2019t like the feeling. Anger felt better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Horse said, glaring at her, daring her to defy him. Fighting would be better than just watching her silently sucking it up for her brother. Hell, he liked fighting with her. Made his dick stand up and take notice. \u201cYou call it off any time you want. I\u2019m not gonna lock you up and watch you every minute. You make this deal, it\u2019s up to you to keep it. And you don\u2019t have to make the f**king deal. Your brother\u2019s an idiot and he knew what he was getting into. This isn\u2019t your mess and it\u2019s not your job to bail him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trying to talk me out of it?\u201d she asked with quiet dignity. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t. I meant what I said. I\u2019d do anything for Jeff. Anything.\u201d</p> <p>Horse clenched his jaw and spun away from her, needing some kind of outlet for his anger and frustration before he did something really stupid. He kicked one of the trees and the throbbing pain in his foot helped him focus.</p><p>What exactly did he want from her, anyway? He needed her in his bed, in his house. She\u2019d made it clear she wouldn\u2019t end up there on her own. Was it his fault her brother was the biggest idiot on earth? Horse was offering them a lifeline, yet she judged him for it. Again. Just like she\u2019d judged him for offering her a place as his old lady.</p><p>Stupid woman didn\u2019t have the first clue what she needed but he\u2019d give it to her anyway.</p><p>Hopefully ten times a day.</p><p>Horse watched as Marie dug through her closet. The room felt too small, he couldn\u2019t breathe. It didn\u2019t help that every time she leaned over, her shirt rode up and her pants pulled down, exposing the black line of a thong he wanted to rip off her body with his teeth.</p><p>His c**k had gone from hard to painfully swollen. He adjusted it, trying to find a comfortable position, but the only place it wanted to be was pumping between her legs. Determined to drive him crazy, her ass wiggled at him every few seconds until he started to seriously wonder if he\u2019d come in his pants. Marie pulled out a shoebox and tossed it on the bed. It spilled open and he sat down and flipped through the photos, desperate for a distraction. He saw shots of her when she was a teen, her and Jeff decked out in swimsuits as kids, arms around each other. There was a picture of her at a school dance... And there was her wedding picture.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>He pulled it out, noting the streaks of dried blood staining it. So this was Gary. The guy looked like every played-out, high school jock-turned-bully on earth. Big and meaty, he probably ran to fat now that he didn\u2019t have a coach to kick his butt. He looked like an ass**le, holding the sweet and delicate Marie in his hands like some kind of county fair prize. Marie was gorgeous, but way the f**k too young. She wore a simple white dress and held a bouquet of daffodils. Douchebag wasn\u2019t even wearing a suit. Everything screamed cheap-wedding-between-kids-way-too-young, but Horse still felt a powerful wave of jealousy.</p><p>Gary had taken that pretty girl in the picture home, pulled off her dress and f**ked her.</p><p>Should\u2019ve killed the man when he had the chance.</p><p>Horse glanced over at Marie, who was still digging through the closet. Her thong teased him and he realized that she\u2019d probably bought the damned thing for Gary\u2014and she still had the picture of them together. The wave of jealousy turned tsunami, and Horse had a sudden vision of her meeting up with Gary, of him trying to change her mind about leaving. Women got back together with losers all the time.</p><p>\u201cYou wear that shit for him?\u201d he asked, holding up the wedding picture. She looked blank.</p><p>\u201cThat butt floss,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWhy the f**k are you wearing a thong to work at a daycare? Are you seeing him again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said, eyes wide. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him since that last time, you should know that. He hasn\u2019t called me, nothing. When I get all the papers ready, Denise\u2019s husband said he\u2019d serve them for me.\u201d</p> <p>Horse grunted, trying not to lose it. Of course she hadn\u2019t seen him again, the man beat the shit out of her. Marie wasn\u2019t stupid. And what about the ass**le who\u2019s kidnapping her? Horse wondered. What does she think of me? He pushed the thought away, focusing on the thong again\u2014once they got home, he\u2019d take her to Victoria\u2019s Secret, get her all new shit. None of Gary\u2019s sloppy seconds in his house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou keeping this?\u201d he asked, looking at the picture.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget, at least not yet.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the picture, disgusted, watching as she moved to her dresser. Every time she reached up, he caught flashes of her tiny little waist, swelling down into hips built to cradle his. Her figure was the ideal combination of small and curvy, every part adding up to perfection.</p><p>Horse wasn\u2019t sure how much longer he could take this. He needed a taste, just a taste. Now. He got up and stood behind her, taking her hips and pulling them back into his. Horse rubbed his c**k against her butt, so aroused it caused him physical pain. He leaned into her, smelling her hair. Impossibly, his dick got harder.</p><p>This woman was going to kill him.</p><p>\u201cI love how your hair smells,\u201d he muttered. He wondered what it would feel like trailing across his chest or wrapped around his cock. Better put that one on the list too.</p><p>Marie tensed.</p><p>\u201cI have ten minutes left,\u201d she said, her voice full of strain. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>That pissed him off, spinning him out of control. How much more of this did he have to take? She belonged to him now, he\u2019d paid fifty f**king thousand dollars for her. Hell, he\u2019d even gone to the mat to save her worthless brother from the club. He\u2019d offered her everything he had and she\u2019d thrown it back in his face.</p><p>Horse let go of her hip, reaching up to grab that hair and twisting her head around to the side. He covered it with his mouth, thrusting his tongue into her mouth like he wanted to thrust his c**k down into her cunt\u2014hard and fast, without mercy. She moaned, collapsing against him, and he slid his other hand down her stomach to her pants, ripping them open. Then his fingers plunged into her pu**y. He pulled back, wanting to see her face, watching as her breath came faster and she flushed with desire and need. The sight gave him savage satisfaction.</p><p>Marie was his property now.</p><p>\u201cThis pu**y,\u201d Horse said, fingering her roughly. \u201cThis pu**y is mine. You are mine. I\u2019ll f**k you when and where I want, and you can either take it or get the f**k out. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYes,\u201d Marie whispered, shivering as her eyes dilated. He felt how close she was to release, the flesh between her legs tightening. He took her mouth one more time, punishing her with his tongue and his fingers, dancing right on the edge. She thrust her hips at him and he ended the kiss, dropping his lips to her neck, licking and sucking, wanting to mark her for everyone to see.</p><p>He bit her and she moaned. Loud.</p><p>Gloating, Horse pulled his hand out of her pants and stepped back. His c**k was like a pillar of granite and his heart beat so hard he could feel it pounding in his forehead, but he\u2019d sent her a message about who was in charge. He lifted his fingers, slowly licking off her sweet juices.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care how good you taste, you don\u2019t call the shots,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe clear?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, flushed and needy, still quivering.</p><p>\u201cYour rules,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cOr I leave. And what happens if I do?\u201d</p><p>He forced his features to stay smooth.</p><p>\u201cTo you? Nothing,\u201d he said, but he knew better. If she left him, he\u2019d hunt her down and drag her back home by the hair if he had to. \u201cYou\u2019re with me of your own free will. But the club has to be paid in blood, Marie, not even I control that. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201dOkay.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her gently out of the way as he reached into the lingerie drawer, pulling out panties, bras and a teddy. He thought about Gary\u2019s hands on her, stripping these scraps of lace off her perfect body, and wanted to rip them apart with his bare hands. Instead he tossed them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need these.\u201d</p> <p>He saw something tucked in the back, black fabric with Reaper colors. What the hell? He reached in, grabbing it. It was his t-shirt, he realized, with something wrapped inside it. She\u2019d kept it. He pulled the bundle out and turned to Marie.</p><p>She blushed, holding out a hand.</p><p>Horse shook his head slowly and started unrolling. What he saw nearly sent his c**k punching through his jeans. It was a vibrator, and a beast at that. Not too long, but it split into two parts, one clearly designed to go inside and stimulate a woman\u2019s G-spot, the other for her clit.</p><p>Marie kept her toy wrapped in his t-shirt.</p><p>Oh yeah. He owned her now.</p><p>\u201cPack the shit and the toy,\u201d he said, barely able to get the words out. What would she look like, using that thing on herself? He couldn\u2019t wait to find out.</p><p>She threw everything into her backpack and zipped it shut, throwing it over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou want anything else from the living room or kitchen? It won\u2019t be here if you try to come back.\u201d It\u2019ll be burned to a crisp, along with any evidence your brother might have hidden here.</p><p>Marie shook her head, blushing fiercely. He leaned in close, whispering in her ear, \u201cNext time you want to play with your pretty pink toy, you do it while I\u2019m watching. If you\u2019re a good girl, I\u2019ll let you wear the tee. Got it?\u201d</p><p>Marie nodded. Horse took her arm and pulled her through the living room, past Jeff and his brother Reapers, out to his bike.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Marie</p><p>The ride to Coeur d\u2019Alene surprised me.</p><p>For one, it seemed to take forever because riding on the bike was work. I had to hold on and pay attention the whole way and given all I\u2019d gone through that day, it wiped me out.</p><p>On the positive side, I didn\u2019t have to talk to Horse.</p><p>We stopped twice at rest areas so I could pee and Horse could make phone calls. I watched him, feeling naked without my phone. They\u2019d taken it from me, along with my car keys, and I didn\u2019t get the impression I\u2019d be getting it back. Horse didn\u2019t tell me what the calls were about and I didn\u2019t ask. I also didn\u2019t know where the other Reapers were or how my brother was doing. All I cared about was staying upright on the bike.</p><p>By the time we pulled off the freeway in Coeur d\u2019Alene it was dark. I didn\u2019t pay attention to where we went or our route. I did notice that we drove through several populated neighborhoods near a very big lake before turning off on a narrow road through the woods. Buildings grew sparse. Horse pulled up to an old farmhouse, complete with quaint-looking outbuildings and a big red barn.</p><p>So not what I expected from a biker.</p><p>Horse cut the engine and I got off stiffly, trying to stretch.</p><p>\u201cIs this your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBought it three years ago,\u201d he replied, walking past me toward the wide, covered porch, which had a swing, for God\u2019s sake. Like something on a country postcard. It wasn\u2019t fancy or big, but it was very well cared for and I suspected it had been painted within the last year or so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grabbed my backpack and followed him through the front door. I found myself in a living room furnished in what could only be called \u201cman cave\u201d. Big flat-screen, giant comfy L-shaped couch, four different remotes on the coffee table and a poster on the wall of a naked woman straddling a motorcycle backward, flat on her stomach and cheek resting on the back seat.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known bikes and human women could have sexual intercourse, but that was the clear implication. Lovely.</p><p>There was a hallway going straight back to what I assumed was the kitchen. A flight of stairs hugged the left wall of the house, which is where Horse headed. I really, really didn\u2019t want to follow him.</p><p>\u201cGet your ass up here.\u201d</p> <p>All-righty then.</p><p>I trailed him up the wooden stairs, which were covered in the center with a runner so old you couldn\u2019t even tell what the original pattern had been. Horse flipped on the light and stood on a landing big enough to run the full width of the house, waiting for me. A person could\u2019ve put some chairs and a little table in there, but he just had boxes piled around. Three doors led to other rooms, two toward the back of the house and one toward the front. He pointed toward the front room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mine. Stay the f**k out of it unless you\u2019re invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s the bathroom, here\u2019s your bedroom. There\u2019s another bathroom downstairs if you need it, next to the kitchen. Don\u2019t flush the toilet if someone\u2019s in the shower, the pipes are old. Go put your shit away and meet me downstairs. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>I had a vision of him showering and me deliberately flushing, suddenly burning him. Maybe I\u2019m a bad person but it made me smile. Horse narrowed his eyes at me, suspicious. I ignored him and went into my room. It was small and plain, with aged and scuffed wood floors, cream-colored walls with old-fashioned trim and two sash windows. A queen-sized bed took up most of the space, covered with very modern bedding\u2014you know the type, one of those bed-in-a-bag things with a giant fluffy comforter that you can get for cheap at Walmart. There was a small dresser against the wall opposite the door with a mirror. A small closet stood open on the right.</p><p>The place was lifeless, which I appreciated in a way. It would be easy to put my stamp on it, even given how little I owned. I liked the idea of having my own space, separate from Horse and all the confused feelings of anger and lust that came to life whenever I saw him.</p><p>I unpacked quickly because I was hungry too, and the last thing I wanted was for him to come looking for me in the bedroom. I still wasn\u2019t sure what his expectations were for the night. Probably not good to give him more ideas than he already had.</p><p>When I went downstairs, I found the TV on to some sports network but no sign of Horse, so I wandered back toward the kitchen. Sure enough, a door on the left led to a small bathroom under the stairwell. Double pocket doors defined the dining room opposite, which held a full-sized pool table instead of a dining room table, complete with a light hanging over it with beer logos. Definitely man cave.</p><p>That\u2019s why the kitchen startled me so much.</p><p>I reached the end of the hallway to find what had to be the cutest kitchen I\u2019d ever seen\u2014like something out of a country-style magazine. Serious reality disconnect... Horse stood in front of the fridge, pulling things out and putting them on a large, wooden butcher\u2019s block in the center. A wrought iron rack dangling pots and pans hung high above it and there were stools all around.</p> <p>In a normal kitchen that would have taken up a ton of space, but this one was so huge you hardly even noticed. Horse had an old-fashioned farm kitchen, practically a living room in and of itself. Off the back I could see a door leading through a mud room. The walls were bright yellow with cutesy, chicken-themed wallpaper edging near the ceiling. The curtains over the windows were sunny, gingham-checked ruffles edged with lace.</p><p>\u201cWho helped you set up the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom,\u201d he said, not looking at me. \u201cShe wanted to do the whole house, but once I saw this I made her stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s a lovely room, Horse,\u201d I said, heroically holding off a laugh. It felt good to tease him\u2014it eased the tension just a bit. Horse turned and looked at me, all badass biker in his boots, jeans and leather Reapers\u2019 cut, face black with stubble and hair tossed by the wind.</p><p>\u201cI made her stop because I don\u2019t have a pu**y and I didn\u2019t want to start growing one,\u201d he replied, voice testy.</p><p>Fair enough. I couldn\u2019t keep the smirk off my face though.</p><p>\u201cMake me some food, I\u2019m gonna go take a shower,\u201d he ordered. My mouth opened automatically to protest his tone, but I caught myself and snapped it shut. Horse held the power in this relationship, not me. It would be easy to forget that\u2014I\u2019d gotten too comfortable around him.</p><p>I searched through the fridge and cupboards, finding enough food for sandwiches. I would need to hit the grocery store soon if we didn\u2019t want to starve. By the time he finished his shower I had everything ready and had spent several minutes debating whether or not to start eating without him. Fortunately Horse came back down before I could make the decision, hair all wet and slicked back. Without a ponytail it just brushed the tops of his shoulders. He wore a faded pair of sweats low on his hips and nothing else.</p> <p>Damn.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I stared at him, just taking in the tattooed, muscular glory that was Horse almost naked. He broke the spell.</p><p>\u201cGlad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cMy body,\u201d he replied, smirking. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one you get to look at or f**k, so it\u2019s good the package works for you.\u201d</p><p>I blushed fiercely, turning away to grab the plates and put them on the block. He took a seat and grabbed his sandwich. I did the same, trying my hardest not make eye contact with him. That was more difficult than it looked because he sat right across from me. He was big and bare-chested and I really, really wanted to take a closer look at those tattoos. I\u2019d seen them before, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d he asked, standing and walking over to the fridge.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d I replied, giving myself permission to check out his ass. Nice. He caught me looking as he turned around, but just handed me the bottle and we ate in companionable silence. I drank a second beer and started to feel a lot more relaxed. After we finished eating, he helped me load the dishwasher, perfectly civilized. Sometimes it felt like Horse was two different people\u2014a badass biker jerk who gave lots of orders and a sweet, sexy man who made my body feel things Gary couldn\u2019t even imagine, let alone spark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which guy was real?</p><p>\u201cYou want a shower?\u201d Horse asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d I replied. \u201cBeen a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the bathroom upstairs, it\u2019s nicer than the one down here.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and left the kitchen, where Horse wiped up the table and counter like a perfectly normal person. So weird.</p><p>Just my luck\u2014no lock on the bathroom door.</p><p>On the bright side, the bathroom had clearly been upgraded at some point in the recent past. In fact, looking around I was pretty sure it had been another bedroom at one point, that\u2019s how big it was. All the fixtures matched the house perfectly\u2014big, claw foot tub, and old dresser/vanity that had been converted by putting in a sink basin surrounded by a marble top. There was a sash window on one side, and the fact that it didn\u2019t have real shades bothered me until I realized there wasn\u2019t a chance of anyone ever seeing me in here. Just too far up and in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>In addition to the tub was a giant, modern shower stall with jets on both sides and a long bench. It should have been out of place, but somehow it all fit together. The best part? A big skylight that would illuminate the entire room beautifully when the sun was out. I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how a bathroom like this wound up in an old farmhouse.</p><p>Horse\u2019s laundry still sat in a pile on the floor, so I picked it up and threw it in the hamper. I figured I would probably be doing the laundry and wondered if he had a washer and dryer. I hadn\u2019t seen any, but I hadn\u2019t seen the mud room yet. All in all, the house might be a little rough in places but it was definitely comfortable. Certainly better than the trailer, and with a lot more potential than the place I\u2019d shared with Gary.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>So, the lack of lock was a problem, and as much as I wanted to give that tub a test run, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it. Instead I stripped down and hopped in the shower, where I was pleased to find shampoo, conditioner and body wash. They weren\u2019t my usual, but they\u2019d do until I could get to the store. Thankfully the shower had lots of hot water, although it took awhile to reach the second floor. I soaped up my hair and rinsed it, then followed with conditioner.</p><p>The door opened and Horse stepped in as I started with the body wash. I should have seen it coming, I mean how predictable? I\u2019d been worried about the tub but honestly didn\u2019t see the shower thing coming. I guess I\u2019m too pragmatic\u2014he\u2019d already showered, why would he want to shower again?</p><p>Duh.</p><p>Anyway, I shrieked when I saw him, a shriek he shut down quickly enough by grabbing me and lifting me up into his body. I wrapped my legs and arms around him instinctively as he pushed me against the shower wall. Then he took my mouth and I no longer had any doubts how this evening would end.</p><p>How to describe that kiss?</p><p>Well, it was rough and deep. His tongue thrust into me over and over, and I felt his penis gliding across my slit as he restlessly pumped his hips in time with his tongue. I\u2019d love to say I didn\u2019t enjoy it, that I was a poor little victim of the Big Bad Biker, but that straight up isn\u2019t the truth. I caught fire and would have rubbed myself against Horse like a cat in heat if he weren\u2019t holding me tight. As it was, I dug my hands in his hair and I tilted my head to take him deeper.</p><p>One of his hands slid down my back, moving along the crack of my ass. He grazed over my rear entrance and I jumped, but he kept moving down. Then his fingers entered me, and I gotta be honest here, it kicked ass. Horse\u2019s c**k slid back and forth along my clit from the front and his fingers delved deep inside from the back. He went after my G-spot first, sending me into shuddering convulsions just short of coming. Then he pulled his mouth away from mine and pinned me with his eyes as his fingers f**ked me. That\u2019s when the torture began.</p><p>He worked me just to the point of orgasm over and over. I whimpered and moaned, desperate for him to give me more, but he just watched my face with that cold expression of his. I hated that look but there was something about it that turned me on too. He controlled every touch, every bit of stimulation taking over my body, and he wasn\u2019t merciful. Finally he pulled his fingers away from me, hoisting my body higher until my hips were halfway up his chest. His mouth took my nipple right as his finger pushed into my ass and I moaned, stiffening against his invasion.</p><p>He ignored me, focusing on my nipple, sucking it deep into his mouth as his finger explored my rear, something entirely new to me. I always thought it would hurt to be touched there, but however rough he was with my breast\u2014and he was rough, make no mistake, alternating between sucking, licking and little tiny bites\u2014he kept his finger in my back passage gentle. I was so turned-on now that I couldn\u2019t begin to process everything I felt. Pressure built in me and I felt my orgasm coming. I stiffened, bracing myself and tensing tight around his finger.</p><p>That\u2019s when he pulled away and set me down without warning.</p><p>I swayed on my feet until I found my balance while he steadied me. Every nerve in my body was strung tight, jangling and overstimulated. I whimpered in protest, but he just gave me a smile that could have frozen lava.</p><p>\u201cPayback\u2019s a bitch, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he whispered, pulling away from me to sit down on the bench, legs spread wide. Bastard. If I\u2019d had any doubts about his arousal before now, the sight of him now destroyed them. His c**k was long and hard, his balls drawn up tight, showing just how close he was to the edge.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees,\u201d he ordered, his voice harsh.</p> <p>I knelt slowly before him, feeling like a slave wench servicing her conqueror, which I guess wasn\u2019t too far off. I took his c**k in both hands, smoothing up and down it as I looked up at him. I licked the little notch on the underside of the head, flicking my tongue rapidly.</p><p>\u201cFuck me...\u201d he groaned, and I couldn\u2019t tell if it was an order or just an expression of how good it felt. He reached down and tangled his fingers in my hair, urging me to wrap my mouth around his cock. Sounded good to me. I opened my mouth, sucking him in as deep as I could, which wasn\u2019t very far because he was so large. Still, what I could take I worked with my tongue, bobbing up and down on him as my hands got into the action. I used my right to jerk him off in time with my mouth. The left I dropped down to his balls, alternately rolling and gripping them. His c**k got harder and he started jerking his hips toward me a little with each stroke, holding my hair so tightly it hurt.</p><p>Horse leaned back, head turned to the side, eyes closed and an expression of infinite need on his face\u2014that\u2019s when I realized just how much power I held over him. He couldn\u2019t take that from me. So long as he wanted my body, I had my own kind of control. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holy shit, that turned me on.</p><p>I let go of his balls, reaching down between my legs to finger myself. Faster and faster I worked, until I heard him giving little grunts of encouragement and I felt little pulsing twitches start at the base of his cock. My legs quivered as I hovered right on the edge of my own explosion.</p><p>Then Horse came in my mouth, something I\u2019d been fantasizing about for months. He didn\u2019t do it halfway, just like everything else in his life. I\u2019ve only ever given a blowjob to one other man\u2014Gary\u2014and it was nothing like this. After he finished, I kept sucking on him as I rubbed my own clit hard. He didn\u2019t soften completely, although the urgency was gone. Unfortunately, that\u2019s when he noticed what I was doing with my hand.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he ordered, reaching down to grab my arm, pulling me to my feet in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHorse, please,\u201d I begged.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how much time I\u2019ve spent jacking myself off, thinking of you?\u201d he asked, still sitting. I shook my head, startled by the question. \u201cAny idea what it felt like that time you pulled away from me? Blue balls don\u2019t come close to what you did to me, babe. Enjoying watching it happen to you for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t make love with you when there was an audience. I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love? Don\u2019t fool yourself, this is about f**king, Marie,\u201d he said. That hurt, hurt way more than I could have expected. Then he made it worse. \u201cAnd get used to the idea of an audience, because I\u2019m not gonna let you off easy just because you\u2019re squeamish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked, stiffening.</p><p>\u201cIn my world we don\u2019t follow the rules, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about me my brothers don\u2019t know. Remember what I told you while you were packing your shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah,\u201d I whispered, mesmerized as he leaned forward, nuzzling between my legs, flicking his tongue over my clit twice, which was almost enough to sent me over.</p><p>But not quite.</p><p>I shifted restlessly, wishing I could bring my legs together, squeeze them just enough to finish the job, but he wouldn\u2019t let me.</p><p>\u201cThis is my pu**y,\u201d Horse said, reaching up inside me with two fingers, rubbing against my inside wall purposefully. I shivered. \u201cI\u2019ll f**k it when I want and how I want. We party with the club and I get horny, you spread for me and you don\u2019t bitch about it. That means against a wall, on the floor, in the middle of the f**king grocery store, you give it to me when I want or this deal is off. Get it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, torn between anger at his words and desperation for his touch. Fortunately he stopped talking and sucked on my clit. I blew about ten seconds later, my moans echoing in the shower as I came. It took everything I had to stay on my feet, and even then I gripped his shoulders hard enough to leave marks.</p><p>He left me to finish washing, which consisted mostly of getting the conditioner out of my hair and my heart rate down to normal. I wrapped my hair in a towel and pulled on sweats and a ratty t-shirt to go back to my room. The door to Horse\u2019s room was closed and the house was silent. That surprised me somehow. I guess I expected to see him again, that he\u2019d want more from me. I knew he liked sleeping together, we\u2019d done it twice and he\u2019d held me all night both times. That\u2019s when it really sank in.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t want me in his room because I wasn\u2019t his woman. He\u2019d offered me that and I said no\u2014now my job was to service him and stay out of his way. Suddenly having my own room wasn\u2019t looking so good. I actually felt lonely for the jerk, wishing he\u2019d spend the night with me. But Horse had made himself clear\u2014cuddling was for girlfriends and old ladies.</p><p>Now I was just a quick f**k, and it was my own damned fault.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>A hand slid into my sweatpants sometime during the night, fingers grazing my clit as a mouth claimed my breast. I moaned, sleepy and unsure if this was a dream or not. Then the hand left me to pull down my sweats. I opened my eyes, awake now, trying to figure out what was happening. A man was on top of me. Gary? I opened my mouth to scream and a hand covered it even as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cNo more sleeping in shit like this,\u201d Horse murmured as he pushed his leg between mine. \u201cYou sleep naked or in something sexy, no excuses.\u201d Then he kissed me gently below my left ear, nuzzling my neck. He pulled his hand from my mouth and I punched his shoulder.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cover my mouth!\u201d I hissed.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t want you screaming and rupturing my eardrum, babe,\u201d he replied, his voice low and sexy. He pressed his hips into the cradle of mine and I shuddered. How could he piss me off so much and turn me on at the same time? It wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cYou gonna behave or should I tie you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah, I\u2019m serious,\u201d Horse replied, reaching down to find my clit. I arched up and moaned, because no matter how angry he made me, my inner slut wanted him. Bad. \u201cI\u2019m the boss. You remember that or I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><p>He caught my hands and pulled them roughly over my head, holding them prisoner with one hand while his other worked me like he\u2019d done in the bathroom. My body was starved for this, still wound up from earlier. I\u2019d been too paranoid to touch myself after the shower, nervous he\u2019d come into my bedroom and discover me. I don\u2019t know why keeping that part of myself from him seemed so important, but it was.</p><p>In less than a minute, he had me primed and ready. He pulled away and I heard the crinkle of a condom wrapper tearing. Horse muttered a curse in the darkness before coming back, catching my hands and pinning them on either side of my head as he lined up his c**k with my opening.</p><p>Horse had a big dick\u2014I knew this. But I didn\u2019t truly grasp the implications until he started pushing into me, slow and steady, no hesitation and no stopping. I squirmed against the bed as he filled me, the satisfaction of feeling full tempered with little twinges of pain as he stretched me wide. I could just make out his features in the faint moonlight streaming through the window\u2014a mask of determination and desire that overwhelmed me. Then he hit bottom, balls-deep in my body. My muscles twitched around him, little tremors running through me as I struggled to hold him.</p><p>\u201cGotta get used to me, babe,\u201d he murmured, dropping kisses across my face before taking my mouth again for the first time without urgency. \u201cI\u2019ll take it slow.\u201d</p><p>And he did. Gradually I felt myself relax around him, and when he started stroking, that big c**k of his rubbed against me in places I hadn\u2019t even realized existed. Gradually he moved faster and I started lifting my hips to meet his, body eager for more. Usually I don\u2019t come from vaginal sex alone\u2014I need more stimulation for my clit. Horse was different though, because his body was big enough to spread me wide open, exposing my center to the delicious slide of his erection as he pumped in and out of my body. Having my arms pinned wide added to the experience because I couldn\u2019t do anything to stop him. I had to take what he gave me, no arguments, and that was weirdly liberating\u2014utterly guilt-free sex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t think even a minute went by before I came, arching my back up from the bed, every muscle in my body squeezing hard enough to hurt.</p><p>That\u2019s when he let go and started f**king me for real.</p><p>Horse went from gentle lover to biker thug, rising on his knees as he released my arms. He grabbed my waist, lifting and tilting my pelvis to provide a better angle as he literally f**ked himself with my body. I have no idea how much time passed, but I know at one point I reached down and rubbed my clit, chasing a second orgasm. When it hit and I clenched around him again, he fell over the edge, exploding inside me. He dropped me back down on the bed, covering me as his c**k bucked and shuddered his release.</p><p>Holy shit.</p> <p>We both stilled, panting as we recovered. Then Horse rolled off me, stood up and pulled off the condom, tossing it in the little trash can next to the dresser. He walked out of the room without a word, leaving me in the darkness.</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt more alone in my life.</p><p>I woke up to bright sunlight and silence.</p><p>Rolling out of bed, I winced at the soreness between my legs, although I couldn\u2019t say I regretted it. I\u2019d never come like that before, not even with my vibrator. I pulled on a tank with a shelf bra and jeans without panties. I hadn\u2019t thought to rinse my others out last night, and I certainly wasn\u2019t going to put them back on dirty. Horse may have declared my privates a panty-free zone, but we needed to have words about that. No way I wanted to go commando permanently.</p><p>I hit the bathroom and then walked downstairs, listening for sounds of life.</p> <p>\u201cHorse, you here?\u201d I called. He didn\u2019t answer, but I heard the clicking sound of a dog\u2019s toenails on the wooden floor. I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with dogs, and this one sounded big to me.</p><p>Horse wouldn\u2019t leave me alone with a violent animal, I told myself firmly. He might be a jerk but he didn\u2019t want me dead. I peeked over the banister, poised to run back up to my room if it turned out to be a monster. Instead I found a mid-sized dog with long silver-black hair broken by white streaks looking up at me hopefully. Its mouth hung open in a wide puppy grin, tongue flopped to the side.</p><p>Not exactly a killer.</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d I said softly, working my way down the stairs. The dog watched me intently, mouth closing as it took on the fixed look of a herd dog at work, ready for anything. I reached the bottom of the steps and held my hand out low. The dog approached me, sniffed my hand and then started butting against it for a scratch. I obliged as the dog melted to the floor, writhing in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not much more than a puppy,\u201d I murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you fly when you jump\u2014do you like chasing sticks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful what you say to him,\u201d Horse said. \u201cYou start making promises, he\u2019ll hold you to them. Takes a hell of a long time to tire him out too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were here,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cNot all of us make noise constantly,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sounded like a herd of moose up there.\u201d</p><p>I scowled.</p><p>\u201cI did not sound like a moose,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the floors are old and creaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you sounded like a moose,\u201d he replied, an almost friendly expression on his face. \u201cI said you sounded like a herd of moose. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cI made breakfast,\u201d he said, jerking his chin toward the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s not much. I want you to take over the cooking and shit, but I was hungry and you weren\u2019t moving.\u201d</p><p>I blushed, thinking about why I\u2019d been tired, and he gave a low, satisfied chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Ariel, by the way,\u201d he added, jerking his chin toward the dog. \u201cBut I call him Ari.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou have a boy dog named Ariel?\u201d I asked, not quite sure I\u2019d heard him right.</p><p>\u201cMy niece named him,\u201d Horse replied, shrugging. \u201cWould break her heart to change it and I figure the dog doesn\u2019t give a shit. I can live with Ari.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, biting the side of my cheek. Once again, the badass biker was a mystery. He issued threats, carried a gun that I was pretty sure he knew how to use, and he let his little niece name his dog after a mermaid.</p><p>Split personality, no question.</p><p>Breakfast wasn\u2019t fancy but it was surprisingly good. He\u2019d made French toast with some ham on the side and wedges of ripe, juicy cantaloupe. The meal followed the same pattern as the night before, except this time he told me to put together a shopping list after we finished. Then he disappeared, taking the dog with him.</p><p>I spent about an hour working my way through the kitchen, making notes of what he had and what he needed, surprised to find that while he didn\u2019t have a ton of fancy gadgets, what he did have was solid and high quality. Same with the pots and utensils. By the time he came back I had a list long enough to fill both sides of the paper. He looked at it, raising an eyebrow, but didn\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cRig\u2019s out front,\u201d he said, starting toward the door. I followed him hastily, wishing I had my purse but not entirely sure he\u2019d wait for me if I went to find it. Ari danced between us and tried to jump up into the dark-green Tahoe parked next to the house.</p><p>\u201cNo f**king way,\u201d Horse said to Ari, and the dog barked at him, clearly pleading.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, voice firm.</p><p>Ari slunk away, looking pitiful.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tie him up or anything?\u201d I asked as we started down the driveway.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Horse said. \u201cI\u2019m far enough out that I don\u2019t need to worry about kids or strangers hurting him. He knows where his house is and I guess if he decides to run off that\u2019s his choice. So far he seems happy to stay put.\u201d</p><p>Kind of like me, I realized. I could leave at any time, but I wouldn\u2019t and Horse knew it.</p><p>He surprised me by pulling onto the freeway after we hit Coeur d\u2019Alene, driving across the border into Washington. After about twenty minutes he exited near a giant mall, pulling around and parking without a word.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were getting groceries,\u201d I said, confused.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cGotta get some other stuff first.\u201d</p><p>I followed him into the mall and couldn\u2019t help but notice how much attention he got\u2014most of it from women. I got that, because Horse was a hell of a sight. Tall, tattooed, hair back in a ponytail and wearing his cut over a shirt so faded you couldn\u2019t tell what the original design had been. Jeans showcased his exceptionally fine ass, and the chain dangling across his hip attached to his wallet completed the picture perfectly. Men noticed him too. Most of them got out of his way, even the young toughs wearing gang colors and pretending to be badasses. I couldn\u2019t decide if it felt more like walking with a superhero or a super villain\u2014either way, people cleared out of path fast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tagged along without question until we stopped in front of Victoria\u2019s Secret. Then I crossed my arms and shook my head.</p><p>\u201cOh hell no. I\u2019m not going in there with you. We can hit a Walmart or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want you wearing shit that you wore for Gary,\u201d Horse replied, draping an arm around my neck, pulling me into his body. He leaned over and spoke directly in my ear, voice husky. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you never wear panties again, but I know women are weird about that. Here\u2019s the compromise. I\u2019m gonna buy you new shit, but only shit I like. You\u2019re gonna wear it until I pull it off to f**k you. Everyone wins.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, then snapped it closed. I needed panties and bras, and I didn\u2019t have my own transportation. I\u2019d been smart enough to shove my cash and debit card into the backpack last night, but that money had to last until I got another job.</p> <p>Shit, I\u2019d forgotten about work.</p><p>\u201cI need to call my boss,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou scheduled to work today?\u201d he asked, sliding his hand up to tangle it in my hair. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNo, not until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you call her when we get home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I going to tell her?\u201d I fretted. \u201cShe\u2019s been so good to me, she doesn\u2019t deserve to have me just disappear on her without notice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you got kidnapped by a biker and now you\u2019re a prisoner in the mountains,\u201d he said, leaning over and catching my mouth with his in a long, slow kiss that left me shaky. Before I could collect my thoughts, he grabbed my hand and tugged me into the store. I pulled back, still not too happy about the idea. He turned toward me, put both his hands on my shoulders and leaned in to me, face to face.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I can\u2019t wait to see you in some of this shit,\u201d he said. \u201cYour old job is not my priority here. I don\u2019t give a f**k what you tell her so long as she doesn\u2019t file a missing persons report and make my life a pain in the ass. She does, things aren\u2019t gonna go well. We clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, biting my lip. His eyes caught on my mouth and grew dark, so I quickly pulled away and wandered toward a rack of panties\u2014simple ones. Pretty but not slutty, plain cotton hip-huggers. Horse followed me, watching as I picked out a couple and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGet a few of those, you\u2019ll want \u2019em when you\u2019re on the rag,\u201d he muttered, fingering one distastefully. \u201cBut the rest of the time I want you in something sexier.\u201d</p><p>His tone didn\u2019t leave any room for negotiation, so I didn\u2019t bother arguing when he turned me bodily and pushed me toward the racks of higher-end stuff. A saleswoman came up to us, all fluttering lashes and smiles for Horse. Before I knew it, I was in a changing room with her, she had measured me and there was a pile of stuff for me to try on. Horse wanted to come in too, but I held my ground, so he waited outside and I called him in to look at each set once I had it on. I don\u2019t know what the store policy was on couples in the rooms alone, but apparently it didn\u2019t apply to giant bikers.</p> <p>Unfortunately, this meant that he made the final decision on both what I tried on and what he planned to buy. In the end, I had six new pairs of sexy panties with matching bras, in addition to six pairs of plain cotton ones. Some of them were thongs, some were boy cut high across my ass, but all of them showed off my figure in a way that even I had to admit was hot. Then he started picking out corsets and nighties. Some of them looked like something from a bordello, all black lace, cutouts and bright red satin. Others were more tasteful, including a long, lacy nightgown and matching silk robe that looked almost virginal. My favorite piece was an ivory corset and bustier trimmed with faintly pink ribbons shaped like tiny roses. There were matching panties, and the look on Horse\u2019s face when he saw them turned me liquid.</p><p>We ended up spending more than a thousand bucks. I almost had a heart attack, but Horse just ignored me as he paid the girl in cash. I don\u2019t know whose eyes were wider when he pulled out that wad of bills, hers or mine. Then he handed me a black pushup bra and matching thong, saying, \u201cGo put them on.\u201d</p><p>I did what he said.</p><p>I figured that was the end of our shopping, but when we got back in the car he drove me to a motorcycle dealership. There he bought me a couple of Harley-Davidson tank tops that were way, way tighter than anything I\u2019d ever worn in public before and a lightweight leather jacket. Next we stopped at a place called the Line\u2014a strip club with an attached store full of women\u2019s clothing. Apparently it belonged to the Reapers, and while the place wasn\u2019t open yet for the day, the staff had arrived and were busy getting ready.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this place,\u201d I told him as I followed him through the club toward a door in the far wall. Everywhere I looked were girls wearing almost nothing, some of them naked except for thongs and high heels while others wore silky robes. A few of them took his arm, pressing against his side. Some looked at me speculatively. One reached down and slid her hand over his fly, squeezing as she kissed his neck.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d Horse said, clearly annoyed. She pouted and turned, glaring at me. \u201cFuckin\u2019 bitches,\u201d he murmured, unlocking a door leading into the store next door.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t open for the day and I was thankful for that. This place made Vicky\u2019s Secret look like a burkha warehouse. Edible panties, stripper heels, leather and lace and sex toys everywhere, including a few that made Horse\u2019s equipment look small, which kind of frightened me. I literally couldn\u2019t find a safe place to put my eyes, so I watched Horse instead as he picked out an outfit best described as \u201cpost-modern slut\u201d. It included a dark-brown leather corset/bustier that stopped mid-stomach, exposing my bellybutton and the curves of my waist. He threw in a skirt so short I seriously wondered if I\u2019d get arrested if we went out in public.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wear this,\u201d I told him, shaking my head as I looked at myself in the mirror. He stood by the counter, ignoring me. \u201cI can\u2019t, Horse. I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear it,\u201d he replied, obviously preoccupied as he wrote something in a ledger.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me, taking in my belligerent stance. His eyes narrowed and we stood frozen for nearly a minute, neither of us blinking or giving an inch.</p><p>\u201cWe gotta go over the rules again?\u201d he asked finally. \u201cBecause the way I remember things, you were begging to do whatever it took to save your pansy-ass brother, despite the fact that he came to us, asked us to back him and then screwed us over. In my world, that\u2019s a prepaid funeral. You changing your mind about our deal? Door\u2019s right over there, babe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d I said, voice low and unsteady. \u201cYou can be so nice sometimes. Why do you do this?\u201d I asked, gesturing to the horrible outfit he\u2019d picked. \u201cDo you really hate me so much? I don\u2019t think I deserve this, Horse.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, reaching up and gripping the bridge of his nose between a thumb and forefinger.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cYou piss me off, but I can live with that. Hell, f**kin\u2019 turns me on most of the time. But you just don\u2019t understand all that\u2019s happening here and I can\u2019t tell you without f**king things up. If this bothers you I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s a good reason for it. You\u2019ll just have to trust me.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to the ledger, ignoring me for another minute. I watched him, seriously considering whether or not to back out of our deal, but I couldn\u2019t do that to Jeff. He needed me.</p> <p>\u201cShit, I forgot,\u201d Horse said suddenly. \u201cYou need some shoes too. Go pick something out. Doesn\u2019t matter which ones, any of \u2019em will do.\u201d</p><p>Happy for a distraction, I wandered over to the wall of shoes, thankful that for once I could pick for myself. Then I realized why he didn\u2019t bother telling me what to get, because each and every pair were clearly designed for stripping and nothing else. I settled on a pair of patent leather Mary Janes that would have looked almost demure if they didn\u2019t have a four-inch spike heel.</p><p>Amazingly, almost every other shoe had even higher heels, some of them on platforms so tall I doubted I\u2019d be able to take a single step wearing them. I grabbed the shoes and gave them to Horse, who didn\u2019t say anything. His eyes darkened though, and he reached down to adjust his pants. I felt a little thrill of desire and power roar to life, which bugged the crap out of me. Why couldn\u2019t I decide whether I liked him or hated him? How could I go from being angry to horny so incredibly fast? It wasn\u2019t fair. I changed back out of my clothes and he bagged them, along with some teeny tank tops and baby doll t-shirts that read \u201cSupport your local Reapers Motorcycle Club\u201d.</p><p>At least the trip to the grocery store wasn\u2019t bad. It took us about an hour to get everything on the list. Once again, people took care to stay out of his way, which worked just fine for me. We didn\u2019t even have to wait in line to check out, everyone just waved us ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cIs it always like this?\u201d I asked him as we loaded up the groceries.</p> <p>\u201cUsually,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe\u2019re not the biggest club, but we\u2019re definitely in charge around here. So long as they give us respect, it\u2019s all good. Not many citizens up for taking on a Reaper, that\u2019s for damned sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if they do?\u201d I asked. He gave me a sharp look.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Stupid question.</p><p>When we got home Horse insisted on unloading the groceries, telling me to go upstairs and put away my new things. While just thinking about the stripper skirt gave me hives, I had to admit that the shoes made me feel sort of sexy. I couldn\u2019t resist trying on the bustier again, which wasn\u2019t so bad with my hip-hugging jeans. I couldn\u2019t see my whole body in the mirror on the top of the dresser, but I saw enough to know I looked good.</p><p>Really good.</p> <p>Once I finished pulling off tags and putting things away I wandered downstairs. Horse was gone, but I found a note on the table.</p><p>Got shit to do\u2014hang out and make yourself comfortable. I\u2019ll be back around seven. Have dinner ready. We\u2019re going out tonight.</p><p>Not exactly the master of conveying information.</p><p>I grabbed Horse\u2019s cordless house phone and a book, then settled myself on the front porch to call Denise and let her know I wouldn\u2019t be back to work. I felt like a complete ass when I told her I couldn\u2019t give any notice. She didn\u2019t buy my excuse for a minute.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me, Marie. Your trailer burned down last night and now you tell me you\u2019re living with some man you barely know? What\u2019s really happening? Tell me why I shouldn\u2019t call the cops.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to do, but I tried to put just the right amount of concern about the trailer burning into my voice while still sounding happy about my new circumstances.</p><p>\u201cJeff called me last night and told me about the trailer,\u201d I said, trying to sound earnest and sad. \u201cHe said he started it, I guess he left his pipe on the floor before going on a beer run. I\u2019m bummed that it burned down but I\u2019m lucky because I already had all my stuff packed up and moved out. Jeff told me he\u2019s crashing with a friend. He doesn\u2019t want me to come back, says it\u2019s his problem and he doesn\u2019t have a place for me to stay anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Denise said, although clearly she didn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the whole story, but I guess it matches the newspaper story. Marie, I hate to say this, but I\u2019m not going to be able to give you a reference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d I replied, feeling depressed. She sighed heavily.</p><p>\u201cYou call me if you need me. I\u2019ll respect your decision but things go bad fast sometimes. I\u2019ll drive up and get you any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Denise,\u201d I said, eyes watering up. I didn\u2019t deserve her kindness, yet she offered it without strings. As I put the phone down, I decided that sometimes kindness hurts more than getting hit physically.</p><p>Go figure.</p><p>True to his word, Horse disappeared until a little before seven. I spent my time alone reading and exploring the property. There were several outbuildings, including an old barn and a bunkhouse. The barn had been cleared out and converted into a shop where Horse seemed to be rebuilding a couple of different bikes. I found a fridge out there with some beer in it, which made me think of Picnic, Max and Bam Bam visiting me and Jeff in better times. Horse also had a big fire pit out back, surrounded by stumps that appeared to do double duty as seats and chopping blocks as needed. There were four picnic tables too, obviously hand-crafted.</p><p>I guess Horse was good with his hands in more than one way.</p><p>I fixed chicken and dumplings for dinner, one of my favorites because it always filled the house with a welcoming and comfortable smell, perfect for day\u2019s end. I heard Harley pipes outside and then Horse walked in through the mud room.</p><p>\u201cSmells great in here,\u201d he said, wrapping his arms around me. I leaned back into him, enjoying the feel of his body against mine. Apparently nice Horse would be joining me for dinner instead of his evil twin. \u201cAfter we eat, we\u2019re going out. I want you to wear the clothes we picked up at the Line.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stiffened, pulling away from him. So much for nice Horse. He sighed but didn\u2019t pull me back. Instead he walked over to the stove and peeked into the simmering pot. I glared at him, deciding he could serve his own damned food. He shrugged, taking a bowl and filling it before he put some salad on a plate. He carried it all to the table, sitting down and tucking in.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna eat?\u201d he asked after a couple of minutes.</p><p>I wanted to tell him to go to hell with his strippers and their lurid, nasty clothing, but my stomach picked that moment to growl, totally ruining the moment. I grabbed food and sat down across from him.</p><p>\u201cThis place we\u2019re going tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another MC\u2019s clubhouse, Silver Bastards, outside of Callup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Callup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver Valley, between here and Montana. Middle of nowhere, really. They\u2019re a Reaper support club, run the valley for us.\u201d</p><p>That led to about a hundred questions, all of which I suspected would fall under the category of \u201cclub business\u201d. I decided to focus on logistics instead.</p><p>\u201cHow am I getting there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack of my bike,\u201d he replied, like the answer was obvious.</p> <p>\u201cIn that skirt and those heels? Not a good plan, Horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the most comfortable,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut we need to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta make the right impression,\u201d he replied. \u201cEnough questions. Listen up\u2014when we get there, you stick with me, and I mean all the time unless I tell you otherwise. You got no property patch, you\u2019re not an old lady. Every biker in the place\u2019ll tag you in the first five minutes. That means open season, and wearing clothes like that will attract a lot of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t make me wear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do what you\u2019re told. Don\u2019t take a drink unless I okay it. Don\u2019t dance with anyone. You gotta pee, you tell me and I\u2019ll walk you back to do it. Some bitch gets in your face while you\u2019re in the bathroom, you scream loud so I can hear you. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>I agreed, not liking the sound of this at all.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs and get ready now. Your hair\u2019s gonna be blown to shit on the bike, so don\u2019t worry too much about it. I want to see a lot of makeup though. And don\u2019t bother bringing a bag, just your ID. I\u2019ll carry it for you.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced. Of course he\u2019d carry it for me. Stupid stripper clothes didn\u2019t exactly come with pockets.</p><p>This was gonna suck.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>I don\u2019t know quite what I expected from the Silver Bastards\u2019 clubhouse. Some dark pit full of bikers and sluts screwing on tables maybe, or drugs changing hands in the street out front while armed guards with machine guns patrolled restlessly.</p><p>Not so much.</p><p>We pulled up around ten at a low, squat building that looked like every other small-town bar on earth. It sat outside the thriving metropolis of Callup, Idaho, located just six short miles from Bumfuck, Egypt. I saw a faded sign reading \u201cSilver Bastards\u201d over the door, and there had to be at least thirty bikes parked out front. A couple of guys hung outside, watching over the bikes, and when Horse pulled up they exchanged friendly grunts.</p> <p>\u201cProspects,\u201d he murmured, putting his arm around my neck possessively and pulling me tight into his side as we walked through the door. His body heat felt good. Even with my jacket (left with the bike, of course\u2014wouldn\u2019t want to risk covering up that classy corset!) the ride had been chilly. \u201cSee how they only have a bottom rocker, not three patches? That\u2019s how you tell. They watch the bikes, run errands, shit like that. They\u2019ll keep an eye on my bike even though they aren\u2019t Reapers because this is a support club.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t too sure what all that meant, but remembering his warnings about club business, I didn\u2019t ask. Inside, the mountain-side watering hole motif continued. Scuffed wood floors, a long bar on one wall with a hallway beyond, presumably leading to rest rooms. Lots of high tables with stools stood in the center of the room, with couches lining the walls and arranged in groups for conversation. The music was loud but not too loud, and several women dressed remarkably similar to me were dancing in an open area toward the back. A guy stood behind the bar, and when he turned away I saw he was another prospect.</p><p>Men stood up as we walked in, all rough-looking, all wearing cuts. A girl in a bikini top and Daisy Dukes asked us if we wanted anything to drink. The guys didn\u2019t speak to Horse unless he spoke first, which was weird, because clearly they were eager to talk to him. I decided Horse must be the biker equivalent of visiting royalty. He did say this was a support club, so the attitude of respect and deference must be part of that. Strange that a whole different world of bikers, complete with their own bars and laws and leaders, could exist without regular people like me even knowing about it\u2014yet here we were, smack-dab in the middle of that world.</p><p>I stayed close to Horse as he exchanged back-thumps and manly hugs with some of the other guys. Then he grabbed my hand and pulled me behind him toward a couch against the back wall, which magically cleared for us. I nearly fell over trying to keep up in my ridiculous heels. He took a spot on one end, spreading out and relaxing as he pulled me down onto his lap sideways, my back against the arm rest, legs dangling down over his. His left arm cradled me and he dropped his right hand down to my leg, fingers sliding up the inside of my thigh. This pushed my skirt high enough that the big, burly man who sat down on the other side of the couch had to see my bright-red thong-style panties. Not cool.</p><p>I leaned over and whispered in Horse\u2019s ear, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just pee on me and get it over with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flip me any shit, Marie,\u201d he replied softly. \u201cYou wanna fight with me, do it in private. It makes me hard when you run that mouth of yours. Right now I\u2019m picturing it wrapped around my cock. That\u2019s between you and me. But tonight, in public, you do what I say or things will get ugly. Nobody insults a Reaper in front of an audience, not without consequences, and they are always extreme.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my thigh for emphasis, brushing a fingertip against the front of my panties to make his point. His c**k grew under my ass and I shivered. Horse talking tough turned me on in a way that my brain insisted was flat-out wrong. My body remembered exactly how good it felt to take him inside though, and it wouldn\u2019t be happy until he filled me up again. At least I wasn\u2019t the only one suffering. I wiggled a little more to get back at him, enjoying the sharp intake of his breath as my butt teased his dick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cKelly, get your ass over here with a drink for the man,\u201d the guy next to us bellowed. He was probably ten years older than Horse, with just a hint of gray in his hair. A lot of the bikers seemed to wear beards, but his face was clean-shaven, and he wasn\u2019t shy about checking me out. I didn\u2019t get the impression that his appraisal was personal though. More like he was sizing me up, trying to judge me on some level I couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Bikini girl showed up with a tray full of beers and shots, which she unloaded on a little table in front of us. The guy next to us handed a beer to Horse, who reached around me to take it in his left hand. The man offered me a beer next. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do, so I looked to Horse.</p><p>\u201cHave at it,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cDamn, that didn\u2019t take long,\u201d said the other man, laughing. \u201cMousie knows her place, I take it?\u201d</p> <p>I stiffened, and Horse\u2019s hand squeezed my thigh again in warning.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s learning,\u201d he said. \u201cGonna be interesting. You heard the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard something. This is her, I take it?\u201d the man replied, glancing toward me. I chugged down almost half my beer, more than ready for a little liquid courage.</p><p>\u201cCollateral,\u201d Horse replied and his friend grunted. They ignored me as they started talking about people I didn\u2019t know, so I let my eyes wander around the room, starting with the guy sitting next to us. He had tousled, deep-brown hair and greenish eyes. His cut had \u201cPresident\u201d written on it, along with a one-percenter patch and a few others I didn\u2019t recognize. Picnic had a president patch too, but I\u2019d never seen anything identifying Horse as an officer. The Reapers must be pretty powerful if a regular guy like Horse got this much respect from the president of another club. I took another long chug of my beer, surprised to discover I\u2019d finished it. That seemed funny to me, and I had to catch myself before I burped.</p><p>What can I say? I\u2019ve always been a lightweight.</p> <p>I looked longingly toward the remaining beers on the table, thinking another would really hit the spot. Bikini girl reappeared, winding her way toward the couch. She leaned down low to take my empty, boobs hanging right in Horse\u2019s line of sight, ass pointed at the other guy. That sort of pissed me off, but when I tried to glare at her she just offered a friendly wink and handed me another beer.</p><p>Not such a bad sort, I decided.</p><p>I glanced at Horse, catching his eye before I started drinking again. He nodded absently, fingers starting a slow slide back and forth across my thigh as the conversation continued. The guys ignored me for the most part as they shot the shit, talking bikes and business, using words that had to be code because the conversation didn\u2019t make any sense to me at all. Occasionally other men walked up and took a chair for a while, then they\u2019d drift away. Certain words and phrases jumped out at me as being potentially important, but I couldn\u2019t put it all together. Respect. Something about a charity run for toys (which seemed totally out of sync with the criminal-biker-vibe hanging in the air). Meeting up with the Mexicans, whoever they were. Border patrol and \u201cfucking homeland security\u201d.</p><p>I tuned them out because there were far more interesting things to do. Drinking a third beer, for one. Watching the crowd. There had to be fifty or sixty people in the room. Most of the men wore Silver Bastards cuts, with big patches on the back that had a stylized picture of a man with a pickaxe, flames shooting out behind him. There were lots of women around too. Most of the women were dressed like me\u2014slutty as hell\u2014and they circulated through the crowd, handing out drinks, picking up empties and occasionally settling in to make out with one of the Silver Bastards. There was a lot of groping, and not limited to individual couples. The guys seemed to have a real thing for being double-teamed. I saw several girls disappear down the back hallway, giggling as men dragged them away.</p><p>Then the front door opened and a tall blonde woman with tasteful makeup and an air of authority walked in. She looked around for a minute, spotted us and cut straight through the crowd. She was different from the other women, anyone could see it. For one thing, she wore jeans that were tight enough to show her figure, but not painted on. She had on a black tank top with a Silver Bastards\u2019 emblem on it, which displayed her rather well-developed cle**age perfectly. Her hair had been highlighted by a professional who knew his shit and she wore a black leather vest.</p><p>Most of the women circulating seemed to get their asses grabbed regularly, but nobody tried it on the blonde. Men moved out of her way, several of them calling out a welcome, but I didn\u2019t catch a single one checking out her boobs or ass.</p> <p>The president-guy sitting next to us stood up as she walked our way, a look coming over his face that could only be described as deep satisfaction. She ignored everyone else as she reached him. He pulled her close, one hand tangled in her hair and the other on her butt as he gave her a long kiss so intimate I felt embarrassed to watch them. He reached down with both hands now, urging her to wrap her legs around him as he lifted her high and nuzzled between her br**sts. She laughed and smacked him. As he turned and set her back down I made out the patches on the back of her vest.</p><p>\u201cProperty of Boonie, Silver Bastards MC\u201d.</p><p>Horse\u2019s hand tightened on my thigh again, and I didn\u2019t dare look at him. For the first time, I almost got what he\u2019d been trying to tell me. This woman, Boonie\u2019s property, fell into a whole different category from the rest of us girls, and it showed. Her man clearly thought she was the shit, and he wasn\u2019t afraid to let everyone know it\u2014even I could see the invisible aura of untouchability surrounding her.</p><p>So that\u2019s what Horse had offered me...</p><p>His hand fell away from my thigh and he urged me to my feet. He stood and waited until the president and his blonde stopped making out, turning to face us.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, this is Marie,\u201d Horse said. She looked me up and down, eyes questioning.</p><p>\u201cHey, Marie,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou\u2019re new around here, I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Horse, unsure if I should be talking to her or not.</p> <p>\u201cGo with Darcy,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe\u2019ll take good care of you. Boonie and I need some privacy.\u201d</p><p>I must have looked a little panicked, because he leaned over and whispered in my ear. \u201cShe\u2019s Boonie\u2019s old lady, she won\u2019t let anything happen to you. You stick to her like shit on a blanket. Tell her why you\u2019re with me, about your brother and the money. Got me?\u201d</p><p>I agreed. Darcy offered me a soft smile, then leaned up for one more kiss from Boonie before gesturing me to follow her. Horse smacked my butt as I walked away, making me jump. I felt immediately exposed, men\u2019s eyes falling on me speculatively as Darcy led me down the back hallway. We passed some bathrooms and seeing them made me aware of my full bladder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan we make a pit stop?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she replied, pushing open the door for me. I don\u2019t know what I expected, some kind of setup with stalls and a couple of sinks. Instead I found a single, dingy room with a toilet and sink. She followed me in, which surprised me. I must\u2019ve had a funny look on my face because she laughed softly. Of course, I usually hit the bathroom with my friends when we went out, but I didn\u2019t even know this chick.</p><p>\u201cOh, sugar, we got no secrets here and privacy\u2019s hard to find. What\u2019s a girl like you doing with Horse?\u201d</p><p>I stood there, uncertain whether to answer or pee first. I decided to multitask, pulling down my panties.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m with him because my brother owes the club a lot of money,\u201d I said, going as quickly as I could. I pulled up my panties and found her staring at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with him because your brother owes money?\u201d she asked very carefully, crossing her arms over her chest. \u201cExplain. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I guess my brother was working with the Reapers on something, I don\u2019t know what,\u201d I said, feeling incredibly uncomfortable. \u201cThey found out he was stealing from them. They decided to kill him, but Horse wanted to f**k me and so they gave him another shot to pay the money back. I\u2019m the collateral. Something about paying in blood.\u201d</p><p>She just looked at me for a minute, eyebrows raised, and I shuffled nervously, wondering if I\u2019d said too much. Then her face softened.</p><p>\u201cOh you poor baby,\u201d she said, reaching out and pulling me into her arms. I started telling her everything about me and Horse in a disjointed tumble of words. I didn\u2019t know this woman, but it felt so good to talk about it. At some point I cried, and she just held on and rubbed my back, making soothing noises until I settled down into snuffles and hiccups. A woman\u2019s voice called through the door, demanding that we get our asses out. Now. Darcy yelled back, \u201cGo pee outside, you f**king skank!\u201d</p> <p>That startled me out of my little pity party. I pulled away, wiping my eyes, fingers dark with mascara. I\u2019d piled on the makeup just like Horse\u2019d asked. Wasn\u2019t going to be easy to fix that.</p><p>\u201cUm, how did you know she was a skank?\u201d I asked, voice wavering. Darcy smiled at me encouragingly, holding my shoulders and looking down into my face with a grin.</p><p>\u201cDarlin\u2019, they\u2019re all skanks,\u201d she replied, smiling. \u201cYou and I are the only females in the entire place that aren\u2019t human petri dishes. Old ladies aren\u2019t into bullshit parties like this, and despite what the boys might pretend in public, a man who f**ks around on his old lady at one is gonna discover just how cold things can get at home. We don\u2019t tell them what to do. We just tell them what we\u2019re gonna do and let them figure it out for themselves. The system works.\u201d</p><p>I giggled a little bit at that, feeling better than I had since arriving.</p><p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t get is why he brought you here,\u201d she said, grabbing some paper towels and dabbing at my face. I turned toward the mirror, but she stopped me. \u201cTrust me, babe, you don\u2019t wanna see what you look like right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here either. And I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with me and Horse. For a while things were great. Well, great on and off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why are you \u2018off\u2019 at the moment?\u201d she asked, biting her lip as she carefully wiped below my eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think I hurt his feelings,\u201d I said. She stopped, giving me a look of patent disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt his feelings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I wouldn\u2019t be his old lady for a million bucks. By text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. That\u2019s a big deal, kid.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe told me it was, but I blew him off when he tried to explain. He stopped talking to me and I got drunk and sent him a bunch of texts and that\u2019s when things really fell apart. Then I found the Reapers holding a gun to my brother\u2019s head and Horse told me they\u2019d give Jeff another chance if I came with him, so I did.\u201d</p><p>Amazingly, Darcy didn\u2019t accuse me of making it all up or some other normal, reasonable reaction to my crazy story.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, you can look now,\u201d she said. I was impressed with what she\u2019d accomplished. My eyes were smudged from the mascara but she\u2019d blended it so they looked more smoky than scary. Darcy put her hands on my shoulders, meeting my gaze in the mirror as she stood behind me.</p><p>\u201cHorse is a good man,\u201d she said, and I didn\u2019t doubt her sincerity. \u201cBut he\u2019s clearly f**ked in the head. This is not good shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d I replied. \u201cHe told me that if I didn\u2019t want to be an old lady he wouldn\u2019t treat me like one. I apologized for the texts I sent but I don\u2019t think it mattered.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little laugh then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re right\u2014you bruised his precious little man feelings. But he can\u2019t just acknowledge that, they never do.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back at her, but it died as I thought about Jeff.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my brother?\u201d I asked. \u201cGot any insight into that one?\u201d</p><p>She sobered and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in deep shit. Wish I could tell you something else, but the Reapers don\u2019t f**k around when it comes to their rep. They lose that, we\u2019re all at war. Lotta clubs just waiting to step in and take over this territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Horse said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a piece of advice, whether you want it or not. Your brother\u2019s a dead man unless he makes things right with the club. Horse can\u2019t change that and you can\u2019t either. Sounds like you\u2019re buying him some time, but don\u2019t think for a minute that they won\u2019t follow through if he doesn\u2019t pay them. So remember\u2014it\u2019s not your fault if things don\u2019t go well for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m the only reason he\u2019s still alive. Horse told me I can leave any time, but if I do, that\u2019s it for Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t leave,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut don\u2019t fool yourself either. This isn\u2019t about you. Now we\u2019re going back out, so put on your game face. Horse brought you for a reason, probably to scare the crap out of every guy here who\u2019s got a sister. They see you, they won\u2019t think Jeff is getting off easy. I know Horse well enough to know this isn\u2019t his usual thing. I doubt you\u2019ll get dragged out like this again unless your brother tries to make trouble. Think he will?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a smart guy, but he wasn\u2019t smart enough not to steal from the Reapers,\u201d I said, shrugging. \u201cI guess it could go either way. Something\u2019s gone really wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>Someone pounded on the door again. Darcy walked over, opened it wide and glared at the drunken girl standing outside. She leaned over and vomited on the floor.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hate parties like this,\u201d Darcy muttered, grabbing my arm and carefully stepping over the puddle. I hopped along with her as she dragged me down the length of the hall into a room with a giant table. Horse and Boonie sat studying some papers.</p><p>\u201cYou boys need more time?\u201d</p><p>Horse leaned back, eyeing me as Boonie broke into a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said, standing and walking toward Darcy. \u201cMissed you, babe. I hate it when you\u2019re out of town. Next time make your mom go by herself, okay?\u201d</p><p>Darcy murmured some reply I couldn\u2019t make out and they fell into another clinch even more intense than the first. Boonie lifted her and set her butt on the table. That appeared to be our cue to leave, because Horse came over and took my hand, drawing me back out into the hallway.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Talking with Darcy made me feel both better and worse. What she had with Boonie looked pretty good. They seemed to keep focused on each other despite the chaos around them. Horse had offered me the same deal and I\u2019d thrown it back at him, with prejudice. Still didn\u2019t excuse kidnapping me. As we left Darcy and Boonie behind, a woman stumbled over to the wall across from us, bracing against it as she threw up noisily.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go outside for some air, or back into the bar?\u201d Horse asked, arm hooked around my neck, casually dominating me without even trying. He didn\u2019t seem to notice the barfing.</p><p>\u201cSome air might be good.\u201d</p><p>He led me down the hall to a propped-open door. Beyond it was a cleared area, surrounded by a six-foot chain link fence. A huge bonfire lit up the place and I saw a lot of people smoking. My nose told me it wasn\u2019t all tobacco. That made me think of Jeff rather wistfully. He was so smart\u2014why did he get himself into this situation? He could do anything if he put his mind to it.</p><p>Horse pulled me over toward the back of the fenced area, still part of the party but outside the ring of light from the bonfire. He sat down in the grass, leaned back against the fence and tugged me down to sit between his legs. He wrapped his arms around me, pulling me back against his chest. It felt good. Of course it always felt good when he held me, even when he was being a total ass**le.</p><p>\u201cYou and Darcy have a good chat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I replied. \u201cVery educational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou give her the whole sob story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll pass it on to the right people. Word\u2019ll get out where it needs to go.\u201d</p><p>We fell into silence for a while. I watched a couple of guys drag out some big speakers, fiddling with the wires until classic rock burst out. Zeppelin, that kind of thing. Made me think of my mom. Not my favorite but it fit the night somehow. Girls started dancing around the fire, stumbling drunkenly into men who swung them up and around before dragging them off into the darkness. Horse\u2019s hand slid down to my breast, reaching in to pop it out the top of the corset. I would\u2019ve been utterly humiliated but I didn\u2019t think anyone could see us so far out of the light and I had the start of a good buzz going. I knew there were other couples around us but I couldn\u2019t see them, so we were probably safe from the audience.</p><p>That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t protest as his other hand pushed up my skirt and slid aside my panties to tickle my clit. I just leaned back into him, closing my eyes and focusing on the sensation as he coaxed me to life. Then I heard a shrieking noise and opened my eyes. A couple pulled away from the fire, close enough to us that we could see and hear them, but not so close that they noticed us.</p><p>The woman knelt in front of the man, unzipping his pants and pulling his c**k free. He grunted as she started sucking him off expertly, bobbing her head up and down while working his c**k with both hands.</p><p>Live p**n , right in front of me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away. I\u2019d fallen into a strange and terrible world where people didn\u2019t follow the rules, and instead of being horrified at what I saw, I felt myself getting wetter under Horse\u2019s fingers. It affected him too\u2014he was hard as a pike behind me. I knew he wanted me, not those girls around the fire, because it was all too clear he could have any of them whenever he wanted. A second man joined the couple in front of us and I perked up, fascinated. The first dropped down to his knees, the girl still working him, although with just her mouth now because she\u2019d fallen to her hands and knees. The position pushed her ass into the air and the second man dropped down behind.</p> <p>They formed the perfect silhouette of debauchery. The man in back pushed aside the flouncy little skirt she wore, gripping her panties and actually tearing them apart. I stiffened as Horse\u2019s finger hooked into me and he whispered in my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou like that, baby?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but I couldn\u2019t seem to say anything. If I kept quiet, I could pretend this was all some dream where I didn\u2019t have to take responsibility for my actions. The woman took the man\u2019s c**k deeper into her throat, his hands coming up to hold her head as he started moving his hips. The second man\u2019s c**k came out of his pants, and while he wasn\u2019t as big as Horse, he was plenty big. He grabbed her hips, centering on her opening and thrusting in with one powerful motion. Her entire body stiffened but she didn\u2019t cry out.</p><p>Probably because her mouth was too full.</p><p>The men slid in and out, creating a kind of weird rhythm, alternately filling her at both ends. I felt myself stiffening, tingles racing through my body as Horse popped out my other breast to twist and pinch the nipple while he drew his fingertip over and across my clit repeatedly. My hips lifted, encouraging him to do more. Clearly he got what I wanted, because he sped up to match the trio giving the show. The bikers f**ked her hard now and I wondered how she took it without feeling pain. She obviously didn\u2019t mind, because she didn\u2019t struggle at all\u2014not even when the guy behind her pulled out and centered his c**k on her rear entrance, rubbing the tip around to lube her with her own fluids. She pulled her mouth free, dropping her head low, and groaned.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered. Horse laughed in my ear as the man pushed slowly into her. His friend took her by the shoulders, bracing her as his buddy conquered her ass, inch by inch. Horse reached down with both hands, grabbing my thighs from the inside, pulling me up and onto his lap so my ass cradled his jeans-covered cock. The girl gave a startled grunt as the man bottomed out. I watched as she twisted, pinned by his cock, arms and legs quivering from the strain of taking him, but she didn\u2019t protest or fight back. To my amazement, she opened her mouth and caught the other man in her mouth again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they started moving this time, I saw her stiffening a bit each time the c**k in her ass hit bottom. The man reaming her stroked her back almost tenderly as he f**ked her deep. The guy in front jerked and came, hips bucking. He pulled free and she collapsed forward onto the grass, face down, ass still in air. By this point I felt so wound up I knew it wasn\u2019t a matter of if I\u2019d come, but when\u2014now or after the little show in front of us ended. Horse must have sensed the same thing, because he slowed and stopped as the man in the back abruptly shoved the girl flat into the ground, covering her as he went to town on her ass. Over and over he pounded her\u2014so hard I worried he\u2019d hurt her. But she didn\u2019t complain or protest, and she definitely could\u2019ve. This was no rape.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to know what a sweet butt is?\u201d Horse whispered in my ear, pausing a second to trail his tongue along the shell of my ear. I shivered, twitching around his fingers deep inside. \u201cThat\u2019s a sweet butt. She\u2019s here to take c**k and clean up after the party. Anyone who wants her can have her. Do you think for one minute that I see you like that? That I ever could?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, almost afraid to ask the one question burning through me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, starting to move his fingers again. I shuddered against him, muscles deep inside clenching as I wound tightly toward orgasm.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do that to me?\u201d</p><p>He gave a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cGotta be specific, babe. You mean f**k you in the ass or share you with another guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither,\u201d I whispered, wiggling my hips as my butt rubbed his penis, the layers of fabric keeping his skin too far from mine. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to share me, Horse.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, just rubbed my clit harder. I squirmed against him as he caught a nipple and rolled it between his fingers. In front of me the man stiffened, thrusting one last time. He grunted as he came. Then he rolled off her to the side. She caught his arm, reaching over to kiss him. He pushed her away, laughing, and stumbled to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that, Horse,\u201d I said, shivering with a mixture of physical need and fear. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t give me to them. I couldn\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna share you, Marie,\u201d he whispered, digging his fingers deeper, grinding against my clit with the heel of his hand. Pleasure pulsed, hovering just out of reach.</p><p>\u201cI told you before, this is my pu**y,\u201d he continued, softly but with a hint of threat too. \u201cI f**k you, nobody else does. Which hole I f**k is up for negotiation.\u201d</p><p>At his words I tipped over the edge, moaning as stars exploded through me, grinding his c**k with my ass. I collapsed against him, panting. He lifted me, laying me down in the grass flat on my back. Now the panties getting ripped were mine as he covered me, pulling out his c**k and slamming it into my well-lubed center without a word. I moaned achingly. I had no idea if anyone could hear me but I didn\u2019t care at all. I just wrapped my arms and legs around him as he pumped furiously into my body. That dick of his was huge, but it felt good and I\u2019d loosened up a lot because taking him didn\u2019t hurt at all. It felt great, and I loved the way his girth pushed me open, stimulating my clit like nothing I\u2019d ever felt before. It didn\u2019t take long for me to shoot over the edge again, and he followed right after. I felt his hot seed spurting deep inside and moaned as my body slowly recovered.</p><p>That\u2019s when I realized he hadn\u2019t used a condom.</p><p>I pushed him off, sitting up and trying to pull my skirt down so that I didn\u2019t give the entire party a crotch shot. He leaned up on one arm to stare at me speculatively.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem now?\u201d he asked. I narrowed my eyes, wondering if he\u2019d \u201cforgotten\u201d on purpose. Apparently Horse liked riding bareback. \u201cI know something\u2019s crawled up your ass, so spill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t put on a condom!\u201d I hissed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been tested yet, I\u2019m not even on the Pill, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached out, wrapping his hand around the back of my neck and pulling me to him for a kiss, ending the conversation. He didn\u2019t stop kissing me for a long time. Then he let me go and smiled.</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal. We\u2019ll get you to a doc tomorrow, get you tested, make sure you\u2019re clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on birth control, Horse,\u201d I said through gritted teeth. \u201cWhat if I got pregnant? I\u2019m not having an abortion, you can\u2019t make me. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>He looked me right in the eye.</p><p>\u201cBabe, the odds you get pregnant this one time are pretty damn low. But if it happens, we\u2019ll deal with it, okay? I like kids. I could do worse. Tomorrow we get you fixed, then we move forward. Not a lot of sense in freaking out because we can\u2019t exactly go back in time and slap that condom on, now can we?\u201d</p><p>I studied his face, calm and reassuring, incredibly handsome in the firelight. He smiled, encouraging me. I smiled back at him, forcing myself to breathe.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he repeated. \u201cMarie, I swear, you\u2019re crazy sometimes, but once I get my dick in you I couldn\u2019t care less. Just calm down and relax, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He rolled off me, rising to his knees to tuck himself away and close up his pants. Then he leaned back against the fence. I pulled down my skirt as far as it would go, sitting back between his legs carefully, keeping my own shut tight. We sat like that for a long time, listening to the music and watching the fire. Couples disappeared and reappeared, their soft laughter filling the occasional lulls in the music.</p><p>Apparently we weren\u2019t completely hidden from view, because one of the prospects stopped by every once in a while to see if we wanted more to drink. Horse nursed a beer slowly, but I ended up downing two more, bringing my total up to five. By the time I\u2019d grabbed a sixth, I\u2019d stopped worrying so much about someone seeing up my skirt. As I started a seventh, I sat forward and started singing and moving my body to the music. Horse laughed, but he stood and pulled me to my feet, apparently enjoying the show as I spun in the firelight. Everything was great and I was starting to think about a pee run when I heard a loud bang and the ground next to me exploded with a crack like thunder.</p><p>Gunfire.</p><p>Horse tackled me, rolling us away from the area as a second shot rang out, apparently hitting the speakers because the music stopped. Yet another shot went off. Men shouted, women screamed and I sobered right the hell up. Horse pushed me behind a big rock and then he was up and running, tackling a guy standing near the fire. The gun flew out of the shooter\u2019s hand and another man grabbed it, popping out the magazine and clearing the slide with a loud click. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I peeked up and over the bench to see Horse dragging the shooter to his feet by the front of his shirt before punching him hard in the face. I heard panting nearby, and a girl I hadn\u2019t even realized was crouched next to me gave a squeak of fear. It was Miss Double Penetration, and she wore a streak of dirt across her cheek and a look of total shock on her face.</p><p>I imagined my own held a similar expression.</p><p>I reached out and took her hand. She squeezed it back as Horse methodically beat the shit out of the shooter, yelling at him between blows.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t f**king shoot a gun at my woman!\u201d he shouted, taking a final shot at the guy\u2019s gut as the man collapsed in the dirt. Horse stood over him, panting, furious, and I had another of those eye-opening realizations that seemed to happen so often lately.</p> <p>Horse was capable of violence. Terrible violence. I wasn\u2019t sure if this guy was going to survive. I\u2019d known it intellectually, seen him with a gun, but this was different. This was right in front of me, real and visceral and scarier than anything I\u2019d ever seen. The girl next to me started crying shocked tears. I felt them running down my face too. The guy was definitely down, but Horse rolled him over and kicked him again in the nuts with enough force to dent metal. The horrific scream he gave tore through my soul.</p><p>Horse stood back, chest heaving, glancing around in disgust. Everyone seemed frozen.</p><p>\u201cThis cocksucker missed my girl by about six inches,\u201d he announced, looking around at the crowd. \u201cI should put him in the ground, but it\u2019s not worth my f**king time. Next time I won\u2019t be so forgiving, you got me?\u201d</p><p>Around him men nodded, murmuring their agreement. I heard someone throwing up off to the right, back in the darkness. I hugged the girl next to me and she hugged me right back, all differences between us forgotten. Horse left the circle of firelight, reaching out to take the now-unloaded gun from the man who\u2019d grabbed it before. Then Horse grabbed the clip, slammed it back into the gun and pulled back the slide with purpose. He turned and carefully aimed the gun at the man\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cNot so f**king fun now, is it?\u201d he snarled. The man gibbered, whimpering and shaking. Lightning fast, Horse tilted the gun to one side of the man\u2019s head and pulled the trigger. Dirt exploded next to his face.</p> <p>\u201cMarie, get your ass over here.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to move, but I really didn\u2019t want to piss Horse off even more. I gave the girl a quick hug and stood shakily. I realized about a second later that the stripper heels just weren\u2019t going to work, so I kicked them off and scuttled over to Horse. He tucked the gun into the back of his pants, grabbed my hand and dragged me back through the clubhouse. Boonie caught up to us, but Horse just snarled at him when he tried to talk. Darcy followed behind, eyes darting between us.</p><p>Horse pulled out the gun again when we reached his bike, letting the magazine drop and clearing the slide. Then the entire thing went into one of his saddlebags. We climbed on the Harley and took off into the night.</p><p>I didn\u2019t notice the cold at all on the ride home. Go figure.</p><p>We got back to the house way too fast. I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with Horse or what I\u2019d witnessed. That guy had to be hurt, bad. I hoped to hell they got him to a hospital, although that might make things worse for us\u2014the cops would come after Horse. Where would that leave me?</p><p>Safe, a little voice whispered deep down inside.</p> <p>We pulled up to the house and he killed the bike. Silence fell between us and I had no idea what to do or say. Wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d felt this way either. We seemed to be following a pattern. Outstanding sex. Violent outburst. Cold war.</p><p>At least I wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d pissed him off this time.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t say a thing to me as we walked into the house. But when the door shut behind us and he slid the bolt home he turned to me, eyes burning with something dark and terrible. I froze, pinned by that gaze, understanding what it must feel to be a deer at the moment the hunter pulls the trigger. He shook his head and pulled me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t f**king believe he almost shot you,\u201d he muttered, gripping me so tight it hurt. Then he picked me up and carried me over to the couch, falling back on it and draping me over his body. I collapsed against him, a rush of tears bursting out of me. I don\u2019t know what it was, relief maybe? Horse rubbed my back, making little soothing noises, and eventually I stopped crying. Then I realized my skirt had ridden up and my bare ass was hanging out. I tried to pull away from him but he wouldn\u2019t let me. Instead he took my face in both his hands, forcing me to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that f**kwad. Boonie should be ashamed of himself, letting that shit happen in his house. He wasn\u2019t even a member of the club. You almost got shot by a goddamned hangaround.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Horse. Really. It scared me but I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI scared you too,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe. But it had to be done. I couldn\u2019t let that guy get away with that any more than I can let your brother off the hook. This is my reality and it\u2019s ugly sometimes. Dragging you into this, I should be sorry. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not gonna let you go, Marie. I\u2019m keeping you and I don\u2019t care if I go to hell for doing it. I don\u2019t care about anything but f**king you.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he pulled my mouth down to his, kissing me hard, tongue thrusting in and taking command. He sat up slowly, swinging his legs off the side of the couch so that I had to straddle him. He thrust his lower body up at me, hands holding my hips as he rubbed the ridge of his jeans-covered c**k against my bare clit. In all the excitement I\u2019d forgotten I was naked under my skirt. Now his fingers reached between us, dipping into my wet opening and sliding around. Suddenly he pushed me up and lifted his hips. I grabbed his shoulders to steady myself as he slid his jeans down, freeing his cock. He took it and rubbed the tip through my wetness, then lined it up with my slit.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said,\u201d Horse told me, his face tight and cold. \u201cYou belong to me. Nobody else gets in this pu**y. You got that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded quickly, biting my lip.</p><p>\u201cGive me the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong to you,\u201d I whispered as he took my hips, gripping them firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody gets in this pu**y but you, Horse.\u201d</p><p>He held my eyes as he pressed my hips down, forcing his c**k deep as I cried out. Even though he\u2019d f**ked me once that night, this new angle hit me deeper than he\u2019d ever gone. I screamed when the tip of his c**k hit my cervix and spasmed around him. I don\u2019t know if it was pleasure or pain or what, but as he slid me up and then down again, hard, I exploded around him with a cry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPut your hands on my shoulders and ride me,\u201d he grunted as I recovered. I did what he said, taking over the rhythm as his hands bit deep into my ass. Every stroke slammed my clit into his pelvic bone, every thrust hit my cervix, and almost immediately I spiraled up again toward another orgasm. His hand dug down between the cheeks of my ass and then his finger went inside me from behind. He thrust it deep, controlling how I rode him as I moved faster and faster. Suddenly he groaned and stopped me, grabbing my hips and standing up to turn me toward the couch, pulling me off his c**k and setting me down.</p><p>\u201cKneel, facing away from me,\u201d he said, voice icy. I shivered, but the look on his face was full of an intensity I\u2019d never seen. Slowly I did as he asked, kneeling on the couch and leaning forward to brace my arms against the back. Once again his c**k entered me, sliding in and out slowly several times. Then he pulled it free and slid it higher, pressing it against my anus.</p><p>I froze as he nudged me, trying to breach my opening. I quivered as he absently rubbed one hand up and under the skirt I still wore, as if to soothe me. He started to work the head in and it hurt. A lot. I shivered, thinking of Jeff, telling myself I had to go through with it if I wanted my brother to live. But everything Horse had done to me so far\u2014at least everything sexually\u2014I\u2019d wanted.</p><p>This felt like rape.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d I whispered, knowing I couldn\u2019t stop him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can handle it if you do this to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Horse stilled and I stopped breathing. I felt the tip of his c**k nudge my opening again and he groaned. Then he dropped it down and plunged back into my pu**y. It\u2019s a good thing he grabbed my hips and held me as he started thrusting because I think I would have collapsed in relief. Then his clever fingers found my clit and I forgot to be upset with him. My arousal returned with a rush and I gasped, dropping my head down against the back of the couch as need spiraled up into me fast and hard.</p><p>I came with a desperate cry as Horse joined me, hot seed shooting deep inside my body. We stayed that way, joined, panting. Finally he pulled out and dropped back down on the couch next to me. He grabbed my arm and pulled me across his lap, taking my chin and kissing me one last time. When it ended, I opened my mouth to say something and realized I didn\u2019t know exactly what to say. Thank you for not raping me because my brother owes you money? Um, no.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sleep,\u201d he said, lying back and pulling me over his body. He reached up and grabbed the blanket draped across the back of the couch, managing to cover both of us with it. Then his hand wrapped about my ass, sliding between my cheeks, rubbing across my rear opening absently.</p><p>\u201cSomeday,\u201d he whispered softly in my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you. Not until you\u2019re ready for me... But someday I\u2019m going to own all of you, Marie. You\u2019re all mine, babe. Knew it the first time I saw you. Couldn\u2019t give you up if I tried.\u201d</p><p>I pretended not to hear him. It took me a long, long time to fall asleep.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>A loud, pounding noise woke me abruptly. I had no idea where I was or what was happening. Horse groaned and I did too. My head hurt like hell. Too much beer...</p><p>Oh shit. The party. The sex. Horse beating a man almost to death. This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cHorse,\u201d I whispered. More banging. Someone was outside the front door. His eyes opened, taking me in all rumpled and sleepy. He smiled and his hand squeezed my ass as I felt the evidence of his appreciation grow under my stomach.</p><p>\u201cShut the f**k up!\u201d he yelled toward the door, making me flinch. The pounding got louder. Horse rolled me to one side so he could get up and started toward the door, tucking his morning erection into his pants with some effort. Clearly he planned to make the noise go away.</p><p>\u201cHorse!\u201d I hissed. He glanced back at me, his expression questioning. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the cops. They\u2019re here to arrest you. Should you just open the door like that? Shouldn\u2019t you go out the back or something while I delay them?\u201d</p><p>That made him smile and he shook his head, bemused.</p><p>\u201cMarie, babe, we\u2019re not on TV,\u201d he said, a hint of laughter in his voice. \u201cWhat happened last night was club business. No cop\u2019s ever gonna hear anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou almost killed that guy,\u201d I replied, eyes wide. \u201cPeople tend to notice stuff like that, club business or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d he said, shaking his head again. \u201cWe handle things like this our own way. If I\u2019d roughed him up for no reason, it would start a shit storm like you can\u2019t imagine. But a f**king hangaround shooting at a Reaper\u2019s woman? Drunk and out of control? He\u2019s lucky I got to him before Boonie. Fucking insult to the Silver Bastards, as much as me. Hell, for all I know, Boonie finished the job after I left. Now run upstairs and put on some clothes. I love that look on you, but your pu**y\u2019s flashing me and I don\u2019t feel like sharing. Think we covered that already.\u201d</p><p>I blushed and jumped up, having totally forgotten my lack of panties, or even a real skirt. As I ran up the stairs, I heard Horse laughing out loud as he opened the door, and then the clomping of boots as people walked in. I pulled on some jeans and one of my new Harley Davidson tank tops, which actually looked pretty cute and not nearly as slutty as I thought it would. Then I gave my teeth a quick brush and washed my face. The rest of me needed washing too, but I didn\u2019t want to miss anything downstairs so I twisted my hair on top of my head and walked back down.</p><p>The living room was empty but I heard voices in the kitchen so I followed them. Horse was pouring freshly brewed coffee for Max and Picnic. All three men looked up as I walked in. Picnic grinned at me. Max stared at me intently, like I was some puzzle he couldn\u2019t quite solve. I nodded, uncertain of my position but wanting to hear any news they might have.</p><p>\u201cHear you had some fun last night,\u201d Picnic said, leaning back against the counter. He wore his gray t-shirt, black leather boots and cut casually, but as always, his looks struck me. That grin didn\u2019t help. I couldn\u2019t quite reconcile the man who stood before me casually drinking coffee with the biker who\u2019d held a gun to my brother\u2019s head two days ago.</p> <p>\u201cHorse tells me you\u2019re worried about him getting in trouble,\u201d Picnic said, smirking. \u201cThought we might be the cops.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, unsure what to say.</p><p>\u201cNo worries, darlin\u2019. Horse did the right thing, Boonie already called, explained everything,\u201d Picnic said, grimacing. \u201cDamn, this coffee tastes like ass, Horse. So Marie\u2014for what it\u2019s worth, Boonie feels like shit about what happened. And knowing Darcy, he\u2019s gonna catch more shit about it for a long time. Apparently she\u2019s taken a liking to you, wanted to be sure and let you know you can call her any time. Bitch woke me up at seven in the f**king morning to give me the message.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head, looking annoyed. Apparently Picnic liked his sleep.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Boonie hear you call his woman a bitch,\u201d Horse said dryly. \u201cMan\u2019s whipped, might take offense. Remember last time?\u201d</p><p>The guys all laughed and I felt completely out of my depth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have her number,\u201d I said, deciding to focus on little details\u2014like Darcy\u2019s phone number\u2014rather than the fact that we were calmly discussing Horse almost killing a man with his bare hands last night.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your new phone,\u201d Picnic responded, grabbing a large, padded envelope from the counter and tossing it to me. I managed to catch it, awkwardly, and opened it to find my car keys, a cell phone and a section of newspaper folded open and highlighted. I pulled out the paper first. It only took about four short sentences to describe the total destruction of our trailer by fire. Resident Jeff Jensen was uninjured, had been found outside, inebriated. No official cause yet, but the fire appeared to be the result of a pipe left burning on the carpet.</p><p>My hands shook as I put it back in the envelope.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart,\u201d said Picnic, and he actually sounded like he meant it. \u201cBut we had to get rid of any evidence. Also part of the message to other clubs. Either your trailer or your brother.\u201d</p><p>I agreed, remembering how I\u2019d suggested burning the place myself. Anything to protect Jeff. The trailer was just a place to live, and not much of one to be honest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to visit my mom at some point,\u201d I said to Horse. \u201cCan I do that? She\u2019ll be really worried and she doesn\u2019t have a way to get hold of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can write her,\u201d he said. \u201cGive her your new phone number if you like, she can call collect after that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the phone. It wasn\u2019t fancy, but it wasn\u2019t crap either. I turned it on and touched the address book icon. It already had several entries. Horse, Picnic, Darcy and \u201carmory\u201d, whatever that was.</p><p>\u201cWhat about my old phone?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy a new one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needed a new account for your own protection,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t the only people your brother pissed off. Hearing new rumors all the time. This is safer, you should cut contact for a while. Horse will fill you in after we give him the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to call anyone I want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on whether you want them to stay alive,\u201d Picnic said, shrugging. \u201cFar as I\u2019m concerned, make that first call to your brother. Educational experience for both of you.\u201d</p> <p>I powered down the phone and stuck it in my pocket quickly.</p><p>\u201cCar\u2019s outside,\u201d Picnic added, like this was just some normal social visit. \u201cPainter drove it up here the other day. Piece of shit, broke down on him twice so I had the guys at the shop fix it up for you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled out the keys and felt better immediately. Now I had a way to leave. I liked that idea a lot.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries,\u201d said Picnic, shrugging. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid, Marie. Got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201dOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that stuff in the barn for you to pick up,\u201d Horse said to Picnic, watching me with speculative eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when I get back,\u201d he told me. \u201cWon\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>The three men headed outside without another word. I clutched the car keys and ran my fingers over the bump the phone made in my pants. I had my car, I had a phone and I had a little bit of money in the bank. I could call Jeff if I wanted, or just send him a text to make sure he was all right.</p> <p>I could just drive away and never look back.</p><p>Instead I fixed breakfast, finishing up just as Horse walked back into the house. Ari followed him in from outside, looking at the food-filled counter hopefully.</p><p>\u201cGood timing,\u201d I said. \u201cFood\u2019s ready. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said, but he didn\u2019t sit at the table. He came over and wrapped a hand around my neck, pulling me in for a long, slow kiss that tasted like coffee and sex. Every time he touched me I melted. It wasn\u2019t fair. I wrapped my arms around him and Horse reached down, lifting my butt and setting me on the counter. I opened my legs and he nestled up between them.</p><p>Unfortunately, he stopped kissing me, pulling away to cradle my face between his hands, examining my face.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded. He closed his eyes and then shook his head before opening them again.</p><p>\u201cThis sucks. Last night was crazy and I scared you, and now I have to tell you something bad,\u201d he said. I stopped breathing. What more could be wrong? I was overloaded already.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s stupider than we thought. He\u2019s got other shit in play, shit we didn\u2019t know about until this morning. You call him, it\u2019s really not gonna help. If he\u2019s smart he\u2019s already ditched his phone and gone off the grid, but I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in his intellect at the moment.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, to say something. Horse pressed his finger against my lips, silencing me.</p><p>\u201cNot done yet, babe. Believe me when I say talking to him isn\u2019t a good idea for either of you. These guys he\u2019s pissed off, they aren\u2019t gonna give him a second chance if they catch him, and he\u2019s sure as f**k used up his second chance with us. Whole damn cartel\u2019s after him. You want to keep him safe, you don\u2019t reach out to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad shit?\u201d I whispered. He nodded, face sober. \u201cLike, a drug cartel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery bad shit with an exceptionally nasty drug cartel. Shit that\u2019s gonna get him dead very soon. Shit worse than anything he\u2019s got with us, which comes as a huge f**kin\u2019 surprise to me, considering how f**ked he was already. These guys...\u201d He shook his head slowly, swallowing hard before continuing. \u201cThese guys are not the good guys. You aren\u2019t safe if you\u2019re anywhere near him, and you aren\u2019t safe if they think they can use you to find him. You use that phone to call him, they track it... Let\u2019s just say they won\u2019t be offering him a chance to make things right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t call Jeff, why did you give it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause believe it or not, keeping you hostage and completely out of communication with the rest of the world isn\u2019t exactly a long-term plan,\u201d he replied, smoothing my hair behind my ears. \u201cMight work for a while, but sooner or later it\u2019ll blow up in my face. I know it\u2019s hard to believe because I\u2019m such a giant ass**le, but I don\u2019t want you to be unhappy. So it\u2019s up to you to protect him by not drawing him out. It\u2019s up to me to protect you, which includes educating you on just how bad things are for him. And I gotta tell you, he pulls shit that comes down on you, time\u2019s up. He\u2019ll be in the ground up there in those mountains and nobody will ever find his body. You got me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo I get a vote in how we handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just expect me to do what you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>I wanted to argue with him some more, but I couldn\u2019t think of a damn thing to say. I didn\u2019t like him being in charge, but that was the nature of our arrangement. And I didn\u2019t know whether to believe him about Jeff or not. If he was lying, I didn\u2019t get to talk to my brother and that sucked.</p><p>But if he told the truth and I called, Jeff might die.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t contact Jeff,\u201d I said. \u201cBut at some point I really want to go see my mom. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou write your mom that letter, I\u2019ll see that she gets it. Just don\u2019t write anything about your brother. You with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201dYeah.\u201d He looked down at my mouth like he wanted to kiss me, but I turned my head away.</p> <p>\u201cBreakfast is ready,\u201d I said, pushing at him. He stepped back and I hopped down, grabbing plates. We sat and ate together and I didn\u2019t say anything. I was too busy rolling the situation over in my head and trying to make sense of it. Things had looked simple when Picnic held a gun to Jeff\u2019s head.</p><p>Go with Horse, save Jeff.</p><p>Now Jeff was in even bigger trouble\u2014assuming Horse wasn\u2019t lying to me. I was his collateral, except sometimes he treated me like a hostage and sometimes he gave me fantastic orgasms. We had our own separate rooms but we\u2019d slept downstairs together. Oh, and he almost killed a guy who almost shot me after definitely having public sex with me at a party. Sex I enjoyed.</p><p>Nope, nothing weird going on here at all.</p><p>\u201cHow would you feel about me going to town for a while, by myself, today?\u201d I asked, tracing the grain in the wooden block with my finger. Might as well test this arrangement a little, see if I actually had the choices he said I did. If I could really leave.</p><p>\u201cI guess that depends on what your plans are,\u201d he replied slowly. \u201cI have to go by the armory today. You can ride in with me if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d rather go on my own,\u201d I said, stealing a quick glance at him. He sat back, relaxed, thoughtful. The silence stretched between us and I couldn\u2019t take it any longer. Too much quiet, too much weirdness. \u201cI want to start looking for a job as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need a job for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo earn money?\u201d I said. He stared at me. \u201cYou know, green stuff to exchange for goods and services?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this shit going down around you and the thing you\u2019re gonna focus on is finding a job?\u201d he asked, raising his brows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than sitting around and thinking about all this shit going down around me,\u201d I snapped. I suddenly wanted something normal, something that I controlled. Wanted to be alone and think somewhere that I wasn\u2019t surrounded by him, his sexy smell or his things.</p><p>\u201cYou need money, let me know and I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou need shit to do, take care of the house and cook. No job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that because of my brother or because you don\u2019t want me working or what?\u201d I demanded, the words tumbling out so fast he didn\u2019t have a shot at answering before I hit him again. \u201cI thought you said this is all my choice. What are the limits of this little arrangement? You gave me a phone and my car, so why can\u2019t I get a job? How long will this go on? How will I support myself when it\u2019s over? Everything is up in the air and I can\u2019t call Jeff and my mom doesn\u2019t know where I am and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Horse stood up and reached across the butcher block and pulled me over to him. He kissed me, hard, shutting me up. A dish fell to the floor and shattered, but he just maintained his assault on my mouth, falling back into his chair, pulling me down onto his lap and arranging my legs on either side of his hips. He kept kissing me as he rubbed his hands up and down my back, soothing me. Finally he stopped, and I stared into his eyes, emotionally exhausted.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cFreak out over stuff you can\u2019t control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m just supposed to do nothing and wait for my brother to get killed by these really bad guys? That\u2019s assuming you don\u2019t kill him first, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re supposed to take care of yourself and keep safe, so that if your brother pulls his shit together he\u2019ll have a sister alive to celebrate with,\u201d he replied, his voice serious. \u201cAnd in the meantime you can keep busy taking care of me. Cook, clean, all that crap. I\u2019ll watch your back and maybe we\u2019ll get through this without everything blowing up in our faces, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCook and clean. Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, shaking his head, sighing.</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know what women do all day,\u201d he said, shrugging. \u201cFigure it out, keep yourself busy doing something else then. You can start by hitting up the clinic today, get on the Pill, get tested. Only a couple of rules. Don\u2019t call your brother, don\u2019t disappear on me, and keep wearing tank tops like this one, because I really like what they do for your boobs.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, kissing me at the base of my throat, then sliding his nose down the front of that tank, nuzzling my cle**age. I softened against him, hating how easily he could distract me, but my body didn\u2019t care one bit. It liked the idea of going for a ride. He was right, I needed to get on some birth control asap\u2014not to mention get tested for STDs. Thanks again, Gary. If I did have something, I guess Horse\u2019d be out of luck, because we\u2019d swapped a hell of a lot of fluids in the past forty-eight hours.</p><p>\u201cMost women work all day, Horse,\u201d I murmured as his hand grabbed my butt, tilting my pelvis into the always-impressive erection he seemed to have permanently installed in his jeans. Was the man even human? \u201cThey have jobs or take care of kids, which is a job all by itself. I\u2019d go crazy stuck here alone, and I get the impression that sooner or later you\u2019re going to have to do some work yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday,\u201d he murmured, reaching up and pulling down my tank and bra, freeing my breast. His warm breath teased my nipple and I squirmed, trying to think.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday. I need to get back to work today,\u201d he said right before he sucked my nipple deep into his mouth. Oh damn, that felt good. Every tug of his lips shot fire through my body, tightening things between my legs. I felt my hips start to rock against his, thinking there was far too much clothing between us. I wanted to forget about this whole situation\u2014an orgasm or two would go a long way toward making that happen. The world lurched as Horse picked me up, walking me into the living room. Then I was on the couch, sliding out of my pants. About two seconds later he had his c**k out, grabbed my hips and lined the head up with my slit before shoving it straight into me without a word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holy f**k I needed that, even though I was sore and swollen.</p><p>The weight of his lower body pressed me back into the couch as his arms braced on either side of me. He took long, slow strokes, steady and relentless. I wrapped my legs around his waist, wondering if I\u2019d gone crazy. So many things happening, yet he only had to touch me and I lost myself in him again and again. This wasn\u2019t like any sex we\u2019d had before. It wasn\u2019t fast, it wasn\u2019t hard and it wasn\u2019t urgent. It was relentless, however. Every time he hit bottom, every time he stretched me open, sliding his c**k along my clit, I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming. I wanted him to go faster, pound me hard so I\u2019d fall over the edge and get the relief my body needed. Fuck out my frustration in general.</p><p>I reached down, urging him to go faster. He ignored me, pumping at his own speed, the corner of his mouth turning up as I glared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou still pissed at me for last night, babe?\u201d Horse asked. \u201cYou wanna fight about it? Now\u2019s a great time. I\u2019m in a pretty good mood, probably agree with anything you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d I muttered, straining up toward him. Dammit, I needed to come. He must too. If he was any harder he\u2019d start popping blood vessels, the bastard, yet he just smirked at me and went even slower.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he replied, grinning openly at me now. \u201cBut I\u2019m the bastard f**king you and pretty much your only hope of getting off, so you might want to stop trying to kill me with those eyes of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was referring to myself,\u201d he replied, thrusting deep before stopping. He grabbed one of my hands, then the other, pinning them on either side of my head as I squirmed.</p><p>\u201cJust do it!\u201d I demanded. He dropped his mouth down, taking mine in a long, slow kiss. I tried to thrust my tongue into his mouth, wiggling against him. I wanted more and I wanted it now. He pulled back, and now his face wore a definite smirk.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I gritted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think you need to explain to me. Otherwise I might just give up and go away.\u201d</p><p>I closed my mouth and squeezed my inner muscles around his dick as tight as I could, gloating when he stiffened and groaned. I let go and then started squeezing him in a slow and steady rhythm. Two could play this game.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Marie,\u201d he moaned, then pushed my hands down deep into the couch as he lifted himself, finally thrusting into me like I needed. I still couldn\u2019t move much, but that didn\u2019t matter because the games were over. Now he hit me with deep strokes, each one more forceful than the last. I felt my muscles growing tight as I lifted my hips to meet his. Oh damn... I was close\u2014so incredibly close. He pushed my hands together over my head, imprisoning them as he hammered home. I hovered right at the edge then slipped over, screaming out my orgasm.</p><p>I have no idea how long it was before Horse came, because I was floating in my own little world. He collapsed on top of me, managing to keep enough of his weight to one side that he didn\u2019t crush me. Our breathing slowed. Then he leaned up on one elbow, sliding me so we lay face-to-face.</p><p>If I\u2019d spent a million years trying to guess his next move, I still wouldn\u2019t have seen it coming.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go down to the community college and pick up an application,\u201d he said. That broke right through my post-coital haze.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re not going anywhere any time soon, and you need something to do. You told me you want to go to school, so look into going to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d I said, shaking my head. Horse\u2019s reality and mine were two very different things. Why were we even having this conversation, let alone right now? \u201cI can\u2019t just go to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell it costs a lot of money, for one thing,\u201d I snapped. \u201cAnd right now I\u2019m worth a total of eleven hundred bucks if I\u2019m lucky. You have to do tests, you have to apply and get accepted and even then you have to... I don\u2019t know, you have to do all kinds of stuff. And my brother\u2019s in big trouble, I don\u2019t have time for school...\u201d I ran out of steam at that point, so I glared at him instead. He kept changing things on me and I couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything about Jeff,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cBut the rest? You gotta do that shit to get into school, start doing it. Go down there, see what it takes. Get the papers and fill them out. It\u2019s not gonna happen if you sit around listing all the reasons it can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018I don\u2019t have any money\u2019 did you not get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of \u2018I\u2019ll give you money if you need it\u2019 did you not get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse, that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here, Marie, and I know you like to earn your own way. But\u2014and don\u2019t get pissed when I say this\u2014you don\u2019t have the skills to make good money, which means any job you get is going to be minimum wage, despite the fact that you\u2019re smart and hardworking and could do just about anything if you had the chance. But you won\u2019t have a chance without some education, so you might as well start now.\u201d</p><p>He trailed his hand down along my body as he spoke, fingers tracing my curves, pulling my hips closer into his. I shook my head, wondering if I\u2019d lost my mind. Jeff might get killed, I\u2019d just had mind-blowing couch sex with his potential killer and now I was supposed to apply for college.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious? You want me to go to school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he challenged. \u201cSo long as you take care of shit around here, I\u2019m fine with it. Might want to move on that whole divorce thing too while you\u2019re at it. Club\u2019s got a lawyer, I\u2019ll set up an appointment for you. I can pretty much guarantee your ex won\u2019t put up a fight.\u201d</p><p>He smiled when he said it\u2014not a nice smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go check it out,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cThis is weird, you get that? You kidnapping me, holding me hostage and then sending me to school? This isn\u2019t how things like this usually work.\u201d</p><p>Horse grinned at me, eyes lazy and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cJust roll with it,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd keep doing whatever exercises you do to make your cunt squeeze like that. They got a college degree for that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pig,\u201d I whispered back. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far bein\u2019 a pig works for me, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cGotta go now. Check out the college. Hit the clinic and get some pills. Don\u2019t call your brother. Cook something f**kin\u2019 great for dinner and don\u2019t wear any panties. That\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>With that he pushed himself up off the couch. I watched him pull up his pants, stunned and bemused. He walked out the front door. I heard his bike roar to life and then I was on my own.</p><p>That whole cooking dinner/no panties thing didn\u2019t quite work out.</p> <p>My trip to Coeur d\u2019Alene was great. I didn\u2019t really know my way around, but it wasn\u2019t hard to find downtown. It was right next to the great big giant lake that gave the place its name, sort of a \u201conce you drive into the water you\u2019ve gone too far\u201d kind of situation. I stopped off and bought a cup of coffee and a bagel at a little coffee shop right down on Sherman Avenue, the main strip through town. The waitress there helped me find the college campus\u2014surprisingly, just a few blocks away, also on the lake. I ended up walking there along a broad, paved trail that had a beach on one side and a really pretty park on the other. Everywhere I looked there were kids running around and having a good time, punctuated by painstakingly casual groups of teens in tiny swimsuits trolling with their friends. Just offshore, a seaplane took off from the water. Farther along I saw someone parasailing.</p><p>The trail took me into a residential neighborhood and then I started seeing college buildings. From there it was easy to find the admissions office. I talked with a lady for close to an hour and left with a handful of brochures.</p><p>On the walk back I saw a bank, so I went and checked my balance on their ATM. Exactly $1,146.24 total. Seeing my balance felt good, and I got out $200 in cash, just in case. Horse said he\u2019d give me money, but I hadn\u2019t given up on finding a way to earn my own. It might be okay to play house with him for a while, but I wasn\u2019t stupid enough to think I should count on him. I couldn\u2019t define what we had, and I couldn\u2019t afford to fool myself about my situation. I was a still-married woman held as collateral by a motorcycle club for her brother\u2019s debt.</p><p>I might have to leave town in a hurry at some point.</p><p>I finished up by visiting the women\u2019s clinic and got a prescription, reminding myself I was way too early in my cycle to seriously worry about a pregnancy. That seemed like enough for one day, so I headed home to start dinner. Horse hadn\u2019t said what time he\u2019d be back but I didn\u2019t want to call and ask. That would be a little too real or something. Playing house scared me.</p> <p>There were two strange cars in the driveway when I pulled up\u2014a small, red convertible and a classic Mustang, beautifully restored. I parked my little car next to them, wondering who I would be dealing with now. No sign of Horse\u2019s bike, and he hadn\u2019t mentioned someone coming to visit either. I pushed through the front door to find four strange women sitting in the living room, laughing and drinking beer. All of them had that biker chick vibe going on\u2014not slutty, but definitely not shy about showing some skin. They smiled and started coming toward me. Thankfully, Darcy walked in from the back of the house, carrying a tray with a bowl of chips and some dip on it.</p><p>\u201cMarie! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back, we weren\u2019t sure how long you\u2019d be!\u201d she said, setting down the tray on the coffee table and pulling me into her arms. It was a little overwhelming but it felt good too. Then she let me go and turned me toward the other women, who\u2019d collected around us.</p><p>\u201cGirls, this is Marie,\u201d Darcy said, wrapping an arm around my shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s Horse\u2019s property now, think I filled you in on that. Marie, this is Cookie, Maggs, Dancer and Em.\u201d</p><p>I smiled uncertainly at the women as they crowded forward, most of them hugging me and kissing my cheek. They ranged in age from Em, a young girl who looked strangely familiar to me and had to be in her early twenties, to Darcy and Maggs, both of whom were probably in their forties.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d said Cookie, taking my arm and pulling me toward the couch. Dancer grabbed my purse and hung it on a hook by the door. Maggs handed me a beer and they settled like a flock of birds, watching me. Awkward... I couldn\u2019t even remember all their names, let alone think of anything to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dancer,\u201d said a tall, black-haired woman with chocolate-brown skin. Her features were sharp and she wore her hair long and straight down her back. She looked Indian to me, and I wondered if she was part of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe. I\u2019d seen several historic markers around town, and a lot of them seemed to be sponsored by the local tribal casino. \u201cI\u2019m Bam Bam\u2019s old lady.\u201d</p> <p>That startled me\u2014Horse was pretty darn pale to be this woman\u2019s brother, but he\u2019d said his sister was married to Bam Bam.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Horse\u2019s sister?\u201d I asked. Then I blushed, realizing how rude I must sound. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cHalf-sister,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m Coeur d\u2019Alene, he\u2019s not, but it works. Bam and I have been together forever, got three beautiful little babies to prove it. I\u2019m really happy to meet you, honey.\u201d</p><p>I smiled a little uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how much you know,\u201d I started to say, thinking I should probably clear things up pretty quick here before they got the wrong impression.</p><p>\u201cWe know it all,\u201d said Maggs. She was petite with shaggy blonde hair, bright eyes and a great big smile. She reminded me of Goldie Hawn. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but Darcy told us. I mean, some of it\u2019s club business and we don\u2019t have those details, but she told us everything you told her.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I guess I hadn\u2019t exactly sworn Darcy to secrecy, but I hadn\u2019t expected her to make all the details public either. Maggs reached forward and took my hand, rubbing it between hers with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cOh honey, don\u2019t worry,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re all family here. If you\u2019re with Horse, you\u2019re with us and trust me, these boys cause enough trouble that they need all of us to keep them straight. It\u2019s a group effort.\u201d</p> <p>The others murmured agreement.</p><p>\u201cOld ladies have to stick together,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThings can get rough, but no matter what we have each other. This is your family now, and we\u2019re here to welcome you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Horse\u2019s old lady,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am, but we\u2019ve only been together for a couple of days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBam says Horse is crazy for you,\u201d Dancer said. That caught my attention in a big way. \u201cNever seen him this way. You may not get this, but my brother doesn\u2019t exactly have trouble finding women. He doesn\u2019t need to drive across the state to get laid, Marie. And this collateral bullshit? The club doesn\u2019t work that way, this is a special situation. He\u2019s never brought anyone home before. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, still uncertain.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a rule of his, actually. \u2018No bitches in the house.\u2019 Drives me crazy, he\u2019s such a dumbass, sexist pig about it. Been that way since high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow is right,\u201d chimed in Em, a tall, slender girl with a shy smile. \u201cI never thought Horse would hook up with someone. We\u2019re excited to have you here. I\u2019m Picnic\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your pictures!\u201d I said, placing her now. I could see Picnic\u2019s features in her face, although softened and feminine. \u201cHe showed them to me once when they came to visit. He\u2019s really proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she replied, blushing. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you here. Dancer\u2019s right, the club is like a family and sometimes it feels like we\u2019ve got a lot more brothers than sisters. We\u2019re excited to get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding!\u201d chimed in Cookie, a bouncy, petite girl who had bright red curls, green eyes and lots of freckles. \u201cI\u2019m Bagger\u2019s old lady. You haven\u2019t met him, he\u2019s over in Afghanistan right now. We girls have to stick together, for sure. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if I didn\u2019t have Maggs and Dancer and the others to keep me sane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that means it\u2019s my turn,\u201d Maggs said. \u201cI\u2019m with Bolt, you haven\u2019t met him yet either. He\u2019s down in Kuna, at the prison.\u201d</p> <p>That caught my attention. Why was her man in prison? I felt for her, thinking about visiting Mom in jail. Prison had to be so much worse, and for longer too. I knew for myself that good people could do stupid, stupid things.</p><p>\u201cMy mom\u2019s in jail right now,\u201d I told her, taking her hand. \u201cShe\u2019s going to get out in a few months though. Have you been on your own for long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years now,\u201d she replied, looking momentarily tired. \u201cBut we\u2019re working on an appeal. I know everyone says this, but Bolt honestly didn\u2019t do what he went down for, and we can prove it. It\u2019s actually been kind of a big case. Every time there\u2019s a hearing we have reporters come around like a bunch of f**king scavengers\u2014there\u2019s a big scandal about prosecutorial misconduct and mishandling DNA evidence. At least I don\u2019t have to deal with it alone though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d said Darcy. \u201cNone of us are alone. And this isn\u2019t all the girls either. This is just the posse I managed to round up on short notice. Between the Reapers and the Silver Bastards there are about fifteen old ladies, and we stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about those girls at the party last night?\u201d</p><p>Em made a gagging sound.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re definitely not family,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cBunch of sluts and losers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them are nice girls,\u201d Cookie protested. \u201cI met Bagger at a club party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a real party,\u201d said Em. \u201cNot one of those drunken f**kfests my dad likes to pretend I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever they are, they aren\u2019t old ladies,\u201d said Dancer firmly. \u201cThey aren\u2019t like us, and you aren\u2019t like them,\u201d she added, catching my eye.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d said Cookie. \u201cWe decided you probably need a break, so it\u2019s ladies\u2019 night. We\u2019re going to take you out and show you just how much fun your new sisters can be.\u201d</p><p>I sat up straight, shaking my head and leaning forward to set down my untouched beer. They might not understand my situation, but I certainly did. Going out to party was not on the agenda. Horse left me with orders and I intended to follow them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Horse would like that,\u201d I said. \u201cHe told me to make dinner, I think he was planning something...\u201d</p><p>I trailed off as Dancer walked over to my purse, pulled out my phone and scrolled through the numbers, hitting one and putting it on speaker. It rang and then I heard Horse\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cBabe, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your sister,\u201d Dancer announced, flashing an evil grin. \u201cWe\u2019re kidnapping Marie and taking her out tonight. You\u2019ll just have to jack off if you get horny. She\u2019ll be busy.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause from the phone.</p><p>\u201cGive the phone to Marie,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>I lunged for it, but Dancer tossed it to Cookie, who jumped up on the couch to hold it out of my reach. \u201cToo bad! I\u2019ve got a cooler full of jello shots and a flask, so we\u2019re gonna have fun fun fun! You might as well camp out at the armory tonight, stud.\u201d</p><p>The girls all laughed, but I felt a little sick. I couldn\u2019t afford to piss Horse off. They might think I was part of the \u201cfamily\u201d now, but I knew better.</p><p>\u201cPut Marie on the f**king phone,\u201d Horse said again, and the tone of his voice was not amused one little bit.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dancer again,\u201d said his sister, grabbing the phone from Cookie and taking it off speaker. \u201cYou might as well give up, Horse. We\u2019re going to take her, she needs a break and you\u2019re a dick if you won\u2019t let her have one. I heard what you did last night. Poor girl probably needs therapy after that. I promise I\u2019ll take good care of her and drive sober. Find something to do that doesn\u2019t involve shooting anyone, okay?\u201d</p><p>Then she hung up the phone.</p><p>I stared at her, stunned.</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang up on Horse.\u201d</p><p>Dancer burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll be pissed. He and Bam\u2019ll probably bitch to each other all night. But we\u2019re just going out for a little fun and he\u2019ll look like a pu**y-whipped baby if he makes too big a deal out of it. And our boys may be pu**y-whipped, but they sure as f**k don\u2019t want to look like they are. It\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t too sure about that.</p><p>\u201cTime for shots,\u201d said Cookie, hopping off the couch and walking toward the kitchen. The others pulled me to my feet and dragged me down the hallway, my phone left behind. Then the music started and things got a little crazy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you would not believe how big it is,\u201d I slurred, leaning forward and holding out my hands for scale.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s disgusting,\u201d yelled Dancer, slapping at me, and I burst into giggles, almost falling out of my chair. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother you\u2019re talking about. Stop it before I puke!\u201d</p><p>I held my hands farther apart, opening my mouth wide and flicking my tongue at her like a snake. We all exploded into fresh gales and I nearly peed my pants. Potty break time.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna pee. Anyone?\u201d</p><p>Em stood up and we stumbled toward the bathroom together. Seriously, I loved each and every one of those girls. I couldn\u2019t imagine why I\u2019d been worried about Horse. Horse kicked ass. In fact, when I saw Horse tonight I was going to rip off all his clothes and give him the best blowjob he\u2019d ever had in his life. And Jeff was going to be fine too, because despite what everyone thought, he really wasn\u2019t totally stupid. I knew that for a fact, just like I knew that I really, really needed just one more shot to make the evening perfect.</p><p>Old ladies kicked ass.</p><p>A couple of guys met us on the way to the bathroom, one of them holding out a hand to steady me as I lurched into him.</p><p>\u201cCan we buy you girls a drink?\u201d he asked, smiling at me. I smiled back. He was kind of cute in a college-freshman way. Horse would eat him for breakfast, I mused.</p> <p>\u201cNot gonna happen,\u201d came a low voice behind us. I turned to see Painter, one of the Reapers\u2019 prospects, standing behind us looking mean. With his honed muscles, sneer and white-blond hair all spiked up, he was pretty hot. Yum. Oops, too much booze... I couldn\u2019t check out Painter, that was just weird. \u201cYou need to step the f**k away from them right now.\u201d</p><p>Painter might not have had his top rocker but he was still a scary biker guy. He\u2019d showed up at Horse\u2019s house about twenty minutes after Dancer hung up on Horse and had been following us around ever since. The guys backed away instantly, mumbling apologies. Em turned and smacked Painter\u2019s chest. He grunted and narrowed his eyes at her, but he didn\u2019t say anything. I watched the exchange with wide eyes. Em grabbed my arm and pulled me away toward the bathroom. She slammed the door open, banging it against the wall as she dragged me in.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe him,\u201d she muttered, walking over to the stall, which was just an open toilet separated from the rest of the room with a wooden partition. \u201cHow am I supposed to meet anyone like this? I am never going to find a real boyfriend. Never.\u201d</p><p>I swayed, trying to follow her words.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine being the oldest daughter of the president of the Reapers MC,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many guys do you think asked me out in high school? I had to go to my prom with a prospect. A prospect who wasn\u2019t allowed to dance with me.\u201d</p> <p>Oh. Now I got it.</p><p>\u201cThat sucks,\u201d I said, feeling very sage. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably better than having some guy take advantage of you.\u201d</p><p>My own prom was an excellent example\u2014Gary had been like an octopus on Viagra and I\u2019d been stupid enough to find it flattering.</p><p>\u201cI want a guy to take advantage of me!\u201d Em snapped, pulling up her jeans. \u201cYou have no idea how many guys\u2019ve ditched me once they learned about my dad. I tried to get away. I even went to college in Seattle. Picnic had his friends over there checking on me. For about three months it was great, and then the rumors started that they\u2019d kill anyone who touched me. You\u2019d think I have two heads or something. I\u2019m a virgin, despite my very best efforts to give it away, and at this rate I\u2019ll be dead before I find a penis to put in my vagina.\u201d</p><p>I took her place, pulling down my own jeans and peeing. She made a good point. I decided to tell her that.</p><p>\u201cYou make a good point,\u201d I said, standing back up. I swayed again, and she laughed, catching me.</p><p>\u201cWow, I think you ate too much jello.\u201d</p><p>She helped me over to the sink. I washed my hands and we both took a few minutes to check out our hair and makeup. I thought we looked pretty good\u2014no wonder those guys wanted to buy us drinks. I\u2019d buy us drinks if I was a guy.</p> <p>\u201cSo who would your dad let you date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone is good enough. He\u2019d like me to be with someone in the club though. That way I\u2019ll never move away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, that\u2019s kind of sweet,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, at least your dad cares about you. I hardly even remember mine.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t trade him. Mom was pretty great too. I miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d I asked, and then bit my lip. The booze had apparently dissolved the filter between my brain and my mouth.</p><p>\u201cBreast cancer,\u201d she said, clearly not wanting to talk about it. \u201cLong time ago. Let\u2019s get shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I replied, following her out the door. Painter stood outside, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed, looking bored. I grabbed Em\u2019s arm and pulled her into me.</p><p>\u201cWhy does he have to be here?\u201d I stage-whispered. \u201cAre they afraid I\u2019ll run away or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s not personal. They send someone with us every time we go out,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cUsually a prospect, but every once in a while Ruger tags along. He\u2019s fun. They don\u2019t want anyone bothering us. That way we can party and they know we\u2019re safe. It\u2019s no big deal, at least not for you because you already have a man. For me, it sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all old ladies get watched all the time?\u201d I asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that creepy?\u201d</p><p>She laughed and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMostly just when we go out at night,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a security thing. There are a lot of clubs and not all of them are friends to the Reapers. This is their way of making sure nobody hassles us. Knowing we have a sober ride home. It\u2019s great, unless you\u2019re looking to lose your virginity.\u201d</p><p>I giggled and she glared at me, which made me giggle more as we headed back out onto the main floor. Then I stopped, because a tall man wearing Reaper leathers suddenly blocked my path. I looked up, trying to focus. Max.</p><p>\u201cHey, Max,\u201d said Em. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust felt like getting a drink,\u201d he said, looking us over with a gleam of approval in his expression. We looked good and Max noticed. Nice. \u201cTalked to Painter, heard you ladies were here. Thought I\u2019d offer to buy a round. You look great tonight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re too sweet,\u201d she replied, smiling up at him flirtatiously. He smiled back, and I wondered if there might be a little more going on with Max and Em than I realized. Painter came up next to us, standing tall as he and Max shared a look. Then Painter shook his head and stepped back, and he didn\u2019t look happy about it.</p><p>That was interesting.</p><p>Max followed us back to the table, where Maggs put him in his place, telling him to buy us drinks and stay out of our way, \u201cbecause it\u2019s laaadddieess niiighhttt!\u201d Everyone howled with approval as he grinned and took orders, bringing back a round of shots. Despite my earlier conviction that I needed more booze, looking at the little cup of vodka made me feel sick so I pulled out my phone to see what time it was. Almost two. Horse had texted about four hours ago.</p><p>Going to the Line with the guys. Don\u2019t wait up.</p> <p>The Line. Why did that sound familiar? My brain was all fogged up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Line?\u201d I asked Cookie, who sat next to me. She\u2019d put on a leather vest before coming into the bar, and her patches said \u201cProperty of Bagger, Reapers MC\u201d. The whole property thing still made me uncomfortable but she seemed happy enough wearing it. And Cookie wasn\u2019t exactly oppressed. I\u2019d figured that out by chatting between the jello shots she poured down my throat. She was way too busy running her coffee shop and taking care of her and Bagger\u2019s three-year-old daughter to be oppressed.</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s the club\u2019s titty bar,\u201d she said. \u201cMakes a fortune, although those strippers can be such sluts. But some of them are okay. I always tell Bagger I\u2019m gonna start working there while he\u2019s deployed and it pisses him off. I love doing that,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d yelled Darcy from across the table.</p><p>\u201cThe Line!\u201d Cookie yelled back. Darcy got a huge grin on her face.</p> <p>\u201cWe should go there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, startled. Cookie clapped her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s a great idea!\u201d she said. \u201cWe can play on one of the poles. I need pictures for Bagger!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? Why would we go there?\u201d I demanded, mystified.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, if the guys are at the Line, it\u2019s fun to show up without warning,\u201d said Darcy, winking at me. \u201cScare \u2019em straight, you know? Plus it\u2019s kind of interesting to watch the dancers. Some of them are really good, I\u2019ve learned some excellent tricks from them. Boonie can testify to that.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and gave Maggs a high five for emphasis.</p> <p>\u201cNot to mention that if your man is gonna spend the night around naked bitches that aren\u2019t you, it\u2019s not a bad thing to make sure he brings his hard-on back home, you know?\u201d added Maggs. That was a good point. I didn\u2019t like the idea of Horse with another woman, I didn\u2019t like it at all. I scowled down at the phone and the offending text.</p><p>\u201cAnd the shop has support merchandise,\u201d she added. \u201cI need to pick up a new tank top. Gonna go see Bolt this week, want to give him something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I hate that place,\u201d whined Em. \u201cAnd if Dad\u2019s there I\u2019ll have to watch some stripper rub all over him and it\u2019s gross. No girl should have to watch her dad screw so many different women, especially when he won\u2019t let me date anyone at all! I\u2019d rather go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave Painter give you a ride,\u201d said Max, coming up behind me and leaning against the back of my chair. He was kind of in my space, but nobody else seemed to notice so I just scooted forward, frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s almost last call anyway. I\u2019ll take everyone else to the Line, give him a break.\u201d</p><p>Dancer smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sweet, Max,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later I was crammed in the back of her car with the others, Max following us on his bike. I expected Em to complain about catching a ride home with Painter, but she seemed happy enough with the situation. That surprised me because I thought I\u2019d caught a hint of something between her and Max earlier. Apparently I\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>It was almost two-thirty in the morning when we pulled up to the strip club. We stumbled and giggled our way across the parking lot, which was mostly empty. Then the sign flickered and turned off.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s closed,\u201d I said, stopping in my tracks. \u201cWe can\u2019t go in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh that\u2019s the best part,\u201d Darcy said, grinning at me. \u201cIt\u2019s closed to the public, but we aren\u2019t the public, babe. We can party as long as we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the dancers?\u201d I asked dumbly. Max laughed behind me, putting a hand on the small of my back and pushing me forward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not old ladies. They won\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time we were here, Dancer got up on stage and showed us her moves,\u201d said Cookie, giggling. \u201cIt kicked ass. Well, it kicked ass for everyone but Horse. He looked kinda sick to his stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sober this time,\u201d Dancer replied. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I think I will,\u201d said Cookie with a grin. \u201cI could do a little show in one of the private rooms. You film it for me and I\u2019ll send it to Bagger on the computer. He\u2019s always asking me to send him pictures. This\u2019ll blow his mind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll definitely blow something,\u201d Maggs replied, cackling.</p><p>A big black guy stood guard by the bar\u2019s main entrance. He let us in without a word. I\u2019d been inside with Horse the day before, but things were different tonight. For one, the lights were dim, which gave the whole place a completely different feel. Sort of murky and dirty. There were a few waitresses bussing tables and two bartenders restocking and cleaning up. A man wearing a Reapers\u2019 cut sat in a booth counting money. Music still played and the center stage held one dancer working the pole. Below her sat several of the guys nursing beers, including Picnic, Ruger, Bam Bam, Boonie and a couple of others. I didn\u2019t see Horse.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby,\u201d yelled Darcy, sauntering down toward them. Just like the night before, Boonie\u2019s face lit up when he saw her and he stood, turning his back on the naked chick slithering around the pole. He wrapped his arms around Darcy and they fell into another of those all-consuming kisses, oblivious to the world. Dancer and Bam Bam were a little more subdued with their greeting, but they disappeared off into a darkened booth without a backward glance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck, I miss that,\u201d muttered Cookie, and I glanced over to see tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBuck up, bitch,\u201d said Maggs, giving her a little punch on the shoulder. \u201cYou wanna make a p**n o for your boy, you can\u2019t be crying in it. That\u2019s not his kink\u2014unless you\u2019ve been holding out on us?\u201d</p><p>Cookie laughed, shaking off her melancholy with a visible force of will. These were strong women, I decided. Really strong women. I could learn from them.</p><p>\u201cYou know I draw the line at soft-core, no fetish stuff,\u201d Cookie replied, waggling her eyebrows suggestively. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get drinks. Maggs, show the newbie where the VIP rooms are, will ya? And make sure it\u2019s wiped down before I strut my stuff. My man likes his girls clean and tight, no sloppy seconds!\u201d</p> <p>She gave a little shimmy and we whooped, clapping. Maggs pointed me across the floor to a long, dark hallway.</p><p>\u201cRooms are over there, sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cI left my phone in the car, and I\u2019m definitely gonna need my own personal copy of this for blackmail purposes. See you in a few.\u201d</p><p>She pushed me toward the rooms. I crossed the floor to the hallway, feeling awkward as all get out. Dark doors lined the both sides of the hall, all of them closed. I had no idea what I\u2019d find inside and exploring on my own felt weird. I decided to wait for Maggs. Then Max strolled up, offering me that same friendly smile he\u2019d worn at the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou lost?\u201d he asked. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cNot so much lost as a little out of my depth,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI guess Cookie\u2019s gonna have us film her dancing for Bagger. She said to find a room, but I\u2019m afraid to just start opening doors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo prob,\u201d he said, shrugging casually, although his eyes held a pleased gleam. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Something felt off. My instincts said I shouldn\u2019t follow him, but I couldn\u2019t think of a reason not to and I was still pretty drunk. My drunken instincts weren\u2019t so hot\u2014Gary\u2019d asked me to marry him after I\u2019d just killed a six-pack.</p><p>When Max pointed me toward the last door on the right side of the hall, which had a little green light glowing above it, I hesitantly walked over and pushed it open. It took a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness and soft red light. Then I saw Horse sitting on a black leather couch against the wall, arms stretched out along the back. His shirt was off and an almost-naked, bleached-blonde woman straddled him. Her hips writhed against his and when she turned to look at us, I saw she had giant, obviously fake boobs. She wore a blue, sparkly G-string and nothing else.</p><p>Horse met my wide, frozen eyes and glared.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k are you doing here? Thought this was ladies\u2019 night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I whispered, stepping back and very carefully shutting the door. I felt brittle, fragile, like I was going to break apart into a thousand pieces. I don\u2019t know why. It wasn\u2019t like we had a real relationship. I didn\u2019t own him. But seeing him with another woman\u2014that hurt me deep down inside. I bumped into Max, who caught my arms and steadied me. I looked up at him, devastated, and he wore an expression I couldn\u2019t begin to describe.</p> <p>\u201cDid you know he was in there?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Max replied. His easy response, completely unapologetic, threw me.</p><p>\u201cYou set me up?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re living in a f**king dream world and the girls were filling your head with shit. I can be a dick, but not as big a dick as he\u2019s being. Thought you had a right to know.\u201d</p><p>I tried to think. Unfortunately, everything was spinning around me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it to hurt you, Marie,\u201d Max said, pulling me in for a rough hug. I stiffened, then relaxed into him, needing the comfort. He rubbed my hair, combing it with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a sweet kid and you\u2019re in a really f**ked-up situation,\u201d he said, not unkindly. \u201cYou need to keep your head straight. Horse is not your old man, you\u2019re not going to live happily ever after with him and your brother isn\u2019t going to come through for you. The faster you figure that out, the better your life is going to be. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>I pulled away from Max and glanced back at the door, willing Horse to open it, to come out and explain that this was all just some sort of mistake. He didn\u2019t. The green light taunted me.</p> <p>\u201cYou want a ride home?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He took my arm and went to the fire door, quickly punching a code into a keypad on the side. A tiny red light blinked green and he pushed through the door. I followed him across the parking lot to his bike. My phone started vibrating and I looked down to see Horse\u2019s name on the screen.</p><p>I turned it off.</p><p>The ride seemed to last forever, and I was pretty much sober by the time we reached the house. Ariel ran out to greet us, smiling his big puppy grin, but I didn\u2019t pet him so he whined and crawled under the porch. Max surprised me when he left his bike and followed me into the house. I guess I expected him to just drop me off or something. It felt strange and awkward with him there, and I wished I could be alone.</p><p>\u201cYou want a drink?\u201d I asked, hoping he\u2019d say no.</p><p>\u201cYeah, grab me a beer,\u201d he replied, pulling out his phone. I left him fiddling with it while I found a beer for him and a glass of water for myself. As I came back down the hall he met me halfway, taking the drinks and walking into the dining room. He set them on the pool table and cocked his head to the side, studying me again.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to decide what the f**k Horse is thinking,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be with him, Marie. This is f**ked up. You should let me help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me how?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he leaned down and threw me over his shoulder. I shrieked, hitting him on the back and kicking. Max ignored my struggles, carrying me back into the living room and throwing me down on to the couch. I hit hard and lost my breath. Before I could recover he was on me, thrusting a knee between my legs, covering my mouth with his. I struggled against him, but I shouldn\u2019t have bothered. Way too strong for me. His legs pinned me, pelvis grinding into mine as his arms wrestled my own into the couch. His kiss wasn\u2019t sensual, just a brutal attack. No tongue, no seduction. Just a crushing of his lips against my mouth. I seriously couldn\u2019t breathe and my vision started going dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh no f**king way. You\u2019re a dead man.\u201d</p><p>I heard Horse\u2019s angry voice and felt a surge of hope. Then Max flew off me so hard I almost rolled off the couch. Horse threw him across the room into the wall, missing the TV by about six inches. I screamed as Horse leapt after him, hammering him with his fists. Max writhed under the onslaught, but he started laughing, the sound horrible and dark and oddly punctuated by the blows slamming his body. A loud, clicking noise cut through his laughter and I looked up to find Picnic aiming a gun at the two men.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t pause.</p><p>\u201cHorse!\u201d Picnic said. \u201cDrop him or I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p> <p>Horse gave Max one last, vicious punch to the gut before he stepped back, chest heaving. Max rose to his feet unsteadily, grinning at Horse in a way that was truly unbalanced. Now I got the whole \u201cMad Max\u201d thing...</p><p>\u201cYou got a problem, brother?\u201d Max asked as he wiped the blood streaming from his nose with the back of his hand. \u201cYour bitch didn\u2019t seem to think so. Practically jumped into my arms at the Line. I\u2019ll admit she\u2019s a sweet cunt, but is she really worth fighting over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth,\u201d Picnic said, stepping forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk to a brother that way. And you don\u2019t f**k around with a fellow Reaper\u2019s woman. We\u2019ll deal with this at the armory tomorrow. You got that?\u201d</p><p>Max laughed again. Then he turned to me and stuck two of his fingers in a \u201cv\u201d in front of his mouth, flicking his tongue between them at me.</p><p>\u201cYou ass**le!\u201d I yelled, filled with sudden rage. \u201cYou f**king ass**le, you get out of here! Get the f**k out of here and don\u2019t f**king come back or I\u2019ll f**king shoot you myself!\u201d</p> <p>All three guys froze, looking at me in surprise.</p><p>I sneered back at them, disgusted.</p><p>\u201cWhat, surprised that the bone you\u2019re fighting over can talk? Well f**k all of you!\u201d</p><p>With that I turned and stomped up the stairs to my room, slamming the door behind me. Moments later bikes roared to life outside. I paced my room for a minute, furious and full of energy, then threw my door open and headed back downstairs.</p><p>I had a few more things I wanted to get off my chest.</p><p>I found Horse standing in the center of the living room, running a hand through his hair, scowling at the splatters of blood staining his floor. He turned toward me, and we glared at each other across the room, neither of us giving an inch. I was still a little drunk, but I\u2019d had it. Time to lay things out with Horse. I opened my mouth to let him have it, but he started in first.</p> <p>\u201cWho the f**k you do think you are, showing up at the Line like that?\u201d he demanded. \u201cAnd why did Max have his tongue down your throat?\u201d</p><p>Oh, that really pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to talk about tongues down throats, ass**le,\u201d I hissed. \u201cAnd for your information, I was at the Line because your sister took me there. I guess it didn\u2019t occur to her that you\u2019d be screwing some slut in the back room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t screwing anyone. It was a lap dance. No big deal,\u201d he said, eyes narrowing on me.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry I interrupted you before you got to the happy ending!\u201d I yelled. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever been this angry before in my life. The edges of my vision actually turned red. I felt like throwing things at him, and I glanced around, trying to find something with a good heft. Horse stalked over, looming over me as he yelled in my face, backing me toward the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhy the f**k shouldn\u2019t I have a happy ending? It\u2019s not like I have an old lady to worry about! No, not me!\u201d he declared, throwing his arms wide, speaking to the room at large. \u201cI don\u2019t have an old lady, now do I? Nope, because you\u2019re too f**king good to wear my patch, now aren\u2019t you? What haven\u2019t I done for you, Marie? I kept your brother alive. Didn\u2019t come cheap, babe, you got no clue how pricey your ass is. And tonight? It\u2019s not like you were around to take care of me, was it? We had plans and you blew me off. You can\u2019t have it both ways, Marie. Either we\u2019re together or we\u2019re not, but if we\u2019re not don\u2019t expect me to sit around with my thumb up my ass while you\u2019re out partying. And this bullshit with Max? In my own home? I should throw your ass out and call the hit on your brother myself. You can go f**k yourself, Marie. Seriously. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>I snarled at him. How dare he play victim?</p><p>\u201cMax was trying to rape me,\u201d I said, the words cold and hard. \u201cAnd the only reason I caught a ride home with him was because you were too busy letting some whore grind her skanky crotch against you to notice. I go out one night without you and you can\u2019t keep it in your pants?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d he demanded. He shifted his weight forward as he caught my hands, twisting them behind my back and forcing me against him. A sexual thrill ran through me, all mixed up with my anger and the crazy rush of adrenaline making my heart race. I felt his cock, hard and ready, and smelled the mixture of sweat and motor oil that always seemed to follow him. My pu**y was a swollen, hot well of need and my panties were sopping. I wanted to bite him and lick him and kick him in the nuts all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cCookie hasn\u2019t seen her man in months, but when she goes out, she wears his patch,\u201d Horse snarled. \u201cShe\u2019s proud to be his old lady. You want me to keep it in my pants, you wear my patch.\u201d</p><p>Horse thrust his hips against me for emphasis and I laughed at him. Then I lunged forward and caught his lip in my teeth, biting, and not a little love nip. He dropped me with a shout and I took off up the stairs. He tore after me, catching the back of my shirt as I reached the top, pulling me down three steps and trapping me under his body on my stomach. One hand tangled in my hair, holding my head tight as the other ripped open my fly and jerked my jeans down around my knees, pinning them together. I moaned as he fumbled to free his cock, pushing my ass back at him, feeling my juices run down my leg because I wanted him inside me so badly.</p><p>Horse\u2019s dick ripped through me and I screamed.</p><p>What happened next was not gentle and nice and sweet and romantic. Horse tore into me, f**king me so hard I\u2019m surprised nobody got hurt. His hand in my hair hurt, but his c**k filled me exactly how I needed it. I don\u2019t know how long it lasted. I\u2019m not even sure how many times I came. I just know that every orgasm I took felt like a victory over him, and when he finally blew into me\u2014hot seed shooting deep into my womb\u2014he shouted and pulled my hair and that turned me on like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced before in my life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit...</p><p>I collapsed down on the stairs, cradling my face in my arms as Horse\u2019s c**k slowly softened inside me. His harsh, panting breaths echoed in my ears. Then he pulled out, turning and sitting down on the steps below me. I rolled over and looked up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is really f**ked up,\u201d he said, sounded stunned. I knew the feeling. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I replied, running a hand through my hair. I needed to pull up my pants, but it took everything I had not to melt into an exhausted puddle. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I know this is sick, but that was incredible. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We sat there for I don\u2019t know how long. My heart rate slowed and I started to notice things, like the rough texture of the carpet under my ass and the risers cutting into my back. And how wet I was. Ewww...</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m dripping on the rug,\u201d I murmured. Horse gave a short bark of laughter. I looked at him and the complete and utter absurdity of our situation hit me. I couldn\u2019t help myself, a little hysterical giggle started deep down in my chest. I twisted my mouth, trying to keep it in, but it broke free. I laughed harder and harder, my body shaking as Horse watched me like I\u2019d lost my mind. Maybe I had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, tears building up in my eyes. \u201cBut this is beyond crazy. What\u2019s wrong with us? Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>Horse shook his head, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cFuck if I know,\u201d he admitted, and for once he didn\u2019t bother putting on a front. \u201cThis is a whole new level of dysfunction for me, and that\u2019s saying something. I don\u2019t want to figure this out tonight. I just want to go to bed and I want you with me. Is that okay? Just for tonight? Can I hold you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s finish fighting tomorrow. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>We stumbled up the stairs and he took my hand, pulling me into his room for the first time. I was too tired to look around. I just pulled off my clothes and fell into the bed. Horse stripped down and climbed in next to me, tucking me into his side. Like always, it made me feel safe.</p><p>How f**ked up is that?</p><p>I woke up to find Horse lying next to me, watching as he traced his fingers across my face. He looked thoughtful and tired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure ladies\u2019 night was such a hot idea,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dick,\u201d he replied, closing his eyes, face pained. \u201cI\u2019m an ass**le and a dick and I shouldn\u2019t have been in that room at the Line. I did it because I was pissed you went out and I wanted to get back at you, which was bullshit. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, trying not to think of him half naked with that girl, big boobs rubbing all over him. I hated the idea of them together but I also had to be honest with myself. I\u2019d refused an exclusive relationship with him when he offered, and then I insulted him on top of it. Sure, he\u2019d kidnapped me in return...and then offered to pay for my college.</p><p>Did that make us even or just exceptionally f**ked up?</p><p>I really shouldn\u2019t have skipped biker babe orientation, I mused. Next time I\u2019d definitely attend. A little laugh sneaked out and Horse flopped back, groaning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m f**ked,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk this through,\u201d I said, rolling over. Now it was my turn to lean up and look down at him. \u201cWe\u2019re not in an exclusive relationship, or at least not one we agreed to together. I\u2019m not even sure we\u2019re in a relationship at all. I don\u2019t know if I have the right to be so pissed at you, but I hated seeing you with that bitch. You have no idea how much I hated it. I didn\u2019t expect that. And I am definitely pissed off about it. And I\u2019m pissed off about Max too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want the right to be pissed at me, seeing as you\u2019re so good at it?\u201d he asked, mouth quirking. The humor didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. He took a deep breath, as if bracing himself. \u201cWhat if we started over? Do you think you could give me another chance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you actually think we could?\u201d I replied. There were so many things between us, so many complicated feelings that I didn\u2019t know how to even begin dealing with them. \u201cOr is it too late? There\u2019s a lot of baggage here. I mean, even if we let all the things between us go, there\u2019s still Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your enemy,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI want to be your man. You make me feel crazy things, Marie, and I don\u2019t want to lose you. I don\u2019t want trouble for Jeff either, but I\u2019ve done everything I can to help him. I can\u2019t do any more, it\u2019s up to him now. I hope you believe that.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand down along the length of my body, catching my leg and pulling it up and over his hip. His c**k brushed my center and I shivered, like always. His gaze caught mine, full of intensity. \u201cI want you to be my old lady, babe. That\u2019s all I have to offer. I\u2019m a Reaper, and this is my world. You wear my patch, you be my woman and I\u2019ll be your man. We take the good times together and fight through the bad times. No games. That\u2019s everything I\u2019ve got and it\u2019s all yours if you\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, trying to think. I wanted it\u2014I wanted him. I still didn\u2019t like the whole property thing. But I\u2019d seen Darcy and Dancer and Cookie in action\u2014they weren\u2019t helpless victims and what they had with their men might be different, but it was good. Much better than I\u2019d had with Gary\u2014and that was another whole load of baggage. Horse would be taking on a woman who was still married to another man, a woman with no assets and no skills.</p><p>I guess it just came down to a leap of faith.</p><p>\u201cI want to try,\u201d I said slowly, holding his gaze. \u201cIf we do it, I think we need to give each other a fresh start. Only look forward, leave all the past behind us. Let go of the anger. Otherwise we could spend the next year fighting over things we can\u2019t change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works for me,\u201d he replied, face still grave. \u201cBut I need to know\u2014are you ready to wear my patch? That\u2019s how it works in the club, babe, and there\u2019s no leaving the club. If you can\u2019t live with that, I\u2019ll find another place for you to stay until this shit with your brother resolves. It\u2019ll kill me, but I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m ready to let you go if that\u2019s what you need. No strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you,\u201d I said, reaching down to run my fingers along the length of his rapidly hardening cock. I moved my mouth toward his, letting my lips hover over his. \u201cI\u2019ll be your old lady and I\u2019ll wear your patch. But if you ever let some bitch shove her tits in your face again, I\u2019ll shoot you myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that, I wrapped my fingers around his dick and squeezed a little too tight for comfort.</p><p>\u201cNoted,\u201d Horse said, smiling against my mouth. \u201cYou got a gun?\u201d</p><p>I laughed, shaking my head, brushing my lips against his.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take care of that today,\u201d he said, nuzzling my mouth. \u201cGonna f**k you first though. Honest to God, you wouldn\u2019t believe the checklist I\u2019ve got in my head for us to work through.\u201d</p> <p>Horse wasn\u2019t kidding about the checklist. We got a good start on it, but after a couple hours I needed a break for food. We ate breakfast together and cleaned up, basking in each other\u2019s presence.</p><p>Then he took me out to the barn and I learned Horse wasn\u2019t kidding about the gun either.</p><p>\u201cOkay, hold it straight like I showed you. Left hand down low to brace your right. Keep your finger off the trigger until you line up the sights. Good. Now put your finger on the trigger and pull back until it just stops. Double-check your aim and fire.\u201d</p><p>I shot the little semi-automatic .22 pistol at the target pinned against a hay bale three times, then pulled my finger off the trigger like he\u2019d taught me and pointed the gun at the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou like it?\u201d Horse asked, looking pleased with himself. He\u2019d presented me with the pistol like it was a diamond ring or something. Probably best not to think about that too much.</p> <p>\u201cIt kicks ass,\u201d I said, because it did. Firing it made me feel sort of powerful and tough. \u201cBut are you sure it\u2019s big enough? Those are really tiny little bullets, Horse. If I\u2019m gonna be a badass biker chick, shouldn\u2019t I have a bigger gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA .22 was big enough to kill Bobby Kennedy,\u201d he replied, and I stopped smiling and raised my brows.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. Honestly, it\u2019s about accuracy, not size, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I seriously just hear you, Marcus \u201cHorse\u201d McDonnell, tell me it\u2019s not about size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, ignoring my little jab. \u201cIt\u2019s true it doesn\u2019t have the stopping power that a bigger gun does, but I\u2019d be more afraid of a woman with a .22 who really knows how to shoot than a man with a .45 he bought because his dick\u2019s too small. It\u2019s not like the movies, Marie. A handgun isn\u2019t gonna stop someone in his tracks unless you hit something important, not even a big handgun. You need a shotgun for that. It\u2019s just physics.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo even this little thing could kill someone,\u201d I asked, looking at the pistol with new respect. I handed it to him very carefully. \u201cIt just looks like a TV prop or something, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d he replied. \u201cI want you to practice with it, really get used to it. We\u2019ll do it every day. Just remember, you ever point this at a person, you shoot it right at his heart and you shoot to kill. Never point a gun unless you\u2019re ready to end a life. And don\u2019t fool yourself that you can shoot them in the foot or some such shit. If it\u2019s bad enough to shoot, it\u2019s bad enough to kill. And nobody\u2019s that good a shot anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that night at the party?\u201d I asked, my voice soft.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d he asked, grabbing another, larger pistol out of his bag and sliding in the magazine with a click.</p><p>\u201cYou pointed a gun at that man. You didn\u2019t kill him, you shot next to him. But you could have killed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I could\u2019ve,\u201d he said. \u201cI got real lucky that night because when he shot near you, he didn\u2019t hit you. Then he got lucky, because I put him in the same situation and he didn\u2019t get hit either. The difference is, he chose to pull his gun on a bunch of innocent women at a party. Then he chose to pull the trigger three times. No excuse for that. He deserved more than he got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scary sometimes, you understand that, right?\u201d</p><p>Horse grinned at me, leaning over to kiss my nose.</p> <p>\u201cTry the .38, little Miss I-don\u2019t-know-if-my-gun-is-big-enough. It\u2019s what I like to carry, big enough to do some damage but small enough to be discreet.\u201d</p><p>I picked it up. This one was heavier and my hand shook just a little as I aimed it. I lined up the sights, braced my body with one foot back and pulled the trigger. The pistol bucked and while I didn\u2019t lose control, I didn\u2019t like how it felt either. The gun seemed kind of wild to me, and I decided an even larger one would probably knock me on my ass.</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean,\u201d I said. \u201cThat one\u2019s harder to hold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have more kick as you go up. I\u2019d rather see you with a gun that feels comfortable. Otherwise you might hesitate to use it when you need it. It\u2019s your choice and if I don\u2019t have what you want, we\u2019ll go find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to try the .38 one more time,\u201d I said. He nodded, and I took my stance. This time when I shot, the shell casing flew back and hit my face, bouncing down my neck and into my cle**age.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d I yelled, dropping the gun and jumping round, trying to shake the hot metal out of my clothing. It slid around, burning me until I managed to pull my bra away from my body and the shell casing fell to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Marie!\u201d Horse said, picking up the gun. \u201cYou drop a gun like that it might go off. You could\u2019ve killed yourself!\u201d</p><p>I stood and looked at him, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cThe casing burned me,\u201d I said, my voice faint.</p><p>\u201cHoney, that sucks, but it\u2019ll hurt a lot more if you shoot yourself. Or me. If you\u2019re gonna shoot me, I want to do something to earn it first. Seems only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stick with the .22,\u201d I said, biting my lip. He set down the gun and then shook his head, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not boring, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like that about me, right?\u201d I asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I like it,\u201d he replied, leaning down to kiss me. \u201cNow practice loading your gun so you can shoot it some more. If you ever need it, I want it to be more than a paperweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think I\u2019ll need a gun? Is life as an old lady really that rough?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he replied. \u201cNo more than life is rough for any woman, depending on her circumstances. It\u2019s an ugly world. But if you know how to use one, and you take it seriously, it\u2019s not going to hurt you. You don\u2019t and you need it? I couldn\u2019t live with that, Marie. Shit, you needed it last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That sobered me.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Max?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat happens with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s club business,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou don\u2019t ask\u2014you trust me to take care of it.

This gun is part of you now. You got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh baby, you have no idea,\u201d he replied ruefully, brushing back my hair and tucking it behind my ear. \u201cNo idea at all. Now let me watch you shoot. Chicks with guns are hot.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>December 10\u2014Three months later</p><p>I\u2019d love to say that things got easy after that. That every day was a new, perfect adventure and life with Horse was like living in a Disney movie with motorcycles instead of carriages.</p><p>That would be a big fat lie.</p><p>Horse had been by himself for a long time and he was in need of the occasional attitude adjustment. I\u2019d already lived with one ass**le and I wasn\u2019t in the market for another one. He claimed I could be a raging bitch myself. I can\u2019t say he was wrong about that.</p><p>But it was never boring.</p><p>For every bad time we had there were ten good ones, and they were very, very good. Horse and I had been working through his list of fantasies and I could attest to the fact that using the pink vibrator with him was a lot more fun than using it on my own. Gary had been a slam-bam-thank-you-ma\u2019am kind of guy. Horse was creative and the only thing he liked more than f**king me was making me come.</p><p>This worked for me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t learn what happened to Max. I knew he wasn\u2019t around for all of October and most of November, although he reappeared at the Thanksgiving party, slinking around the armory like a half-drowned cat, all grumpy and defensive. The rest of the club seemed to ignore it, so I did too. It was okay. Not quite as good as castrating him with a dull spoon would have been, but life is all about compromises, right?</p><p>Especially life in the Reapers MC.</p><p>That was another thing I had to get used to. I hadn\u2019t just moved in with Horse at his house. I\u2019d moved into the club, which was as much a family as he\u2019d said, albeit a really weird family. The heart of the club was the armory, a place I kept hearing about but couldn\u2019t quite wrap my head around until I saw it the first time. Maggs called one morning to let me know we were having an impromptu barbeque. I was supposed to make a \u201cshitload of that f**kin\u2019 great potato salad\u201d (a direct quote from Picnic) and be ready at four when she\u2019d come and get me.</p><p>The armory, as I discovered when we arrived, was an actual National Guard armory that had been purchased by the Reapers fifteen years earlier. It was just outside of town, three stories high and built like a fortress for obvious reasons. It had a large, walled courtyard in the back and by large, I mean big enough to park lots of cars and trucks and bikes. There were several sheds and outbuildings too. Most of it was paved, but it also had a grassy area with picnic tables, a giant fire pit and a swing set complete with children running around screaming and laughing.</p><p>Not exactly what I expected. Neither was the party that followed. It was wild and crazy, but not nasty like the one I\u2019d gone to with the Silver Bastards. This was a family gathering, and I saw for the first time just how tight everyone was. We laughed and danced and took stupid pictures and ate way too much food. That night Horse brought me up onto the roof, laid out a blanket and taught me just how much nicer drunken Reaper sex could be when it didn\u2019t end with a shooting. The kids were long gone by then and I could hear other couples in the darkness. It should have felt uncomfortable but it actually kicked ass. Go figure.</p><p>Now it was three months later and things were really good between me and Horse. I\u2019d be starting school in January. My divorce was still working its way through the system, but Gary\u2014as predicted\u2014wasn\u2019t causing any trouble. I\u2019d been to see my mom a few times and she seemed happy enough for me, although she wanted to come and check out Horse and the club for herself when she got out.</p><p>The only thing missing in my life was Jeff. Apparently he was in touch with the Reapers sporadically and had even paid them some of the money he owed. Not much though. I still hadn\u2019t talked to him, but I\u2019d gotten a couple of emails from an anonymous address. They said to lay low and hold on, that he\u2019d take care of things soon. I broke down and replied, telling him I was fine and to worry about himself, not me. I also set up a new, anonymous secret webmail account and gave him the address. I trusted Horse, but my brother\u2019s life was on the line and to say my man had a conflict of interest was an understatement from hell. I needed to be able to communicate with Jeff privately. He sent me a couple of notes after that, but they didn\u2019t really say much.</p><p>On the bright side, Horse and I were getting ready for our first Christmas together, which was pretty exciting. I\u2019d decided to go shopping with the girls at the Spokane Valley Mall that day. Cookie and Maggs were the leaders of our little group, probably because they needed the support of their sisters even more than the rest of us. The Reapers looked out for them, of course, but being away from your husband long-term had to suck, especially for Cookie. Her little girl, Silvie, cried for Bagger almost every night.</p> <p>That would be ending soon. We\u2019d just gotten word that Bagger would be home right after New Year\u2019s. He\u2019d been out of touch a lot lately, and Cookie was pretty close to the end of her rope when we got the news. That\u2019s why we\u2019d hit the mall\u2014to find the perfect welcome-home ensemble at Victoria\u2019s Secret.</p><p>\u201cI want to look hot, but not slutty,\u201d Cookie said, digging through the nighties. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Maggs laughed.</p><p>\u201cBabe, he\u2019s not gonna care what you wear. Remember what he said after you sent that video?\u201d</p><p>Cookie blushed and I burst out laughing. Bagger had liked the striptease quite a bit...after he knew for sure none of the other guys had seen it. I\u2019d \u201cmet\u201d him on Skype a couple of times now, and it was clear the man worshiped Cookie and his daughter, and he didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing her at all.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I let you talk me into that,\u201d Cookie said finally, wiping away tears of laughter. \u201cI can just see it now. Silvie will be fifteen years old and she\u2019ll find it on my computer. How am I going to convince her to wait for sex when she sees me doing something like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSilvie and Em, perpetual virgins!\u201d I said, shaking my head. \u201cAh, the horror of life as a Reaper\u2019s daughter. The poor darlings are screwed, no question. No pun intended, of course.\u201d</p><p>That set us off laughing again.</p><p>\u201cScrewed is what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d said Cookie, sighing. \u201cScrewed, f**ked, pleasured and reamed, you name it. I\u2019ve worn out three vibrators on this deployment, I swear. I cannot wait to see my man again.\u201d</p><p>After an hour we finally found the perfect welcome-home outfit. Several of them, actually. Maggs grabbed a few things too, but I didn\u2019t like spending Horse\u2019s money. He kept saying not to worry about it, but I felt weird buying things for myself. We still argued about me getting a job sometimes, but to be honest I was keeping myself pretty busy. I helped Cookie at her shop, which led to me watching Silvie three days a week. Cookie told me she could teach anyone to make coffee, but finding a sitter she could trust was a lot harder. This was perfect, because I was helping out and also earning a few extra bucks each week. I\u2019d have done it for free, but she insisted. I also ran errands for the guys and started cleaning the pawn shop when their cleaning lady flaked. The Reapers really did have a lot of stuff going on, and Horse had come to appreciate my willingness to kick in whenever help was needed. The other guys noticed too, and they seemed to enjoy having me around.</p> <p>My phone dinged. I pulled it out to find a text from Horse.</p><p>Come by the armory? Need to talk to you.</p><p>That sounded ominous.</p><p>Everything okay?</p><p>Complicated. I\u2019ll explain when you get here. No detours, okay?</p> <p>Maggs and Cookie wanted to keep shopping, so I said goodbye and left. Fortunately I had my own car with me so I drove straight to the armory. I pulled up and parked in the front lot. Painter met me outside, taking my arm and guiding me through the gate and the courtyard to the back entrance, which seemed weird. He said Horse would be out in a minute so Painter and I stood and waited.</p><p>This sucked, because Coeur d\u2019Alene might only be two hundred miles from my hometown, but it was way, way colder here in the winter. I shivered and rubbed my arms, noticing there were a lot more bikes than usual in the courtyard, along with some big trucks and SUVs I didn\u2019t recognize. Then Horse pushed through the back door, holding it for Painter, who ducked back inside. Just seeing Horse warmed me a little. He wore a black jacket over his cut and a dark, knitted cap on his head. He\u2019d let his beard fill in a little with the cold weather and I had to say, it looked hot. The look on his face wasn\u2019t hot though. It was so cold I wondered if I\u2019d forgotten something really important.</p><p>\u201cWe got a problem, babe,\u201d he said without greeting me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s made a deal with another club. Somehow he\u2019s getting information about our business and he\u2019s feeding it to them. In return, they\u2019re supposed to snatch you and hand you over to him. These are bad guys and this is going to blow up in his face, which sucks for him, but I\u2019m not letting it spill over on you. We\u2019re locking you down, only way to keep you safe until it\u2019s worked out.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, gaping.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to save you,\u201d Horse said, shaking his head. \u201cI swear, he\u2019s either the stupidest f**k who ever lived or has the worst luck of any human being I\u2019ve ever met. He reached out to the Devil\u2019s Jacks, who in addition to being our enemies are quite possibly the least trustworthy group of bastards ever born. They\u2019ve been looking for a way to f**k us up for a long time and now they have it. Could be a war, we don\u2019t get this under control. The first step is to lock your shit up tight until we find Jeff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat could he possibly be giving them? How did he go from laying low to plotting a war to get me back? You said he was against the wall\u2014where is he getting this leverage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo f**king idea where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d Horse said, his face grim. \u201cI swear, if he\u2019d put half this much effort into doing his job in the first place we\u2019d all be f**kin\u2019 millionaires. Instead he\u2019s playing us like his personal chess game, which would be pretty impressive if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that all the chess pieces have guns. The guys are all worked up, pissed as hell, and it\u2019s a damn good thing everyone likes you because this is not a good scene. You\u2019re gonna be moving into the armory for a while, into one of the apartments upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I asked, feeling a little panicky. Horse shrugged.</p><p>\u201cLong as it takes, babe. The Jacks manage to take you, the club goes to war,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cJeff\u2019s set them on you, and for now he\u2019s got enough info to make the effort worth their while. You stay inside and lay low. Tonight you don\u2019t even leave the apartment. We\u2019ve got guys from other charters coming in, a lot of them already here, could get a little wild. You stay in your room, you keep your mouth shut and you do not do or say anything to draw attention to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, feeling a little sick. \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short, abrupt laugh that had nothing to do with humor.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, rubbing his chin. \u201cAnother change of plans. It\u2019s time for you to try to get hold of your brother. Email him, call him, call anyone who knows him. We need him to end this, for your safety and for the club. Then he needs to disappear. Permanently. He can make that happen or we will. I\u2019m telling you this because I love you, babe. You want your brother to live, you get him to cooperate with us. That\u2019s his only shot.\u201d</p> <p>I grew very still.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to kill him for this? That\u2019s two strikes now,\u201d I said, feeling lightheaded. \u201cYou already threatened to kill him over the money. Now he does this. I won\u2019t lure him in for you to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna lie, babe,\u201d Horse said, looking me right in the eye. \u201cHe has one shot here. He starts a war, he ain\u2019t gonna make it. He\u2019s hired our enemies to take one of our women. This shit will not stand. He has to make things right without sucking you in. You got me?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling like I might throw up. Why did Jeff keep doing this crazy stuff? I shouldn\u2019t have listened to Horse, I should have called Jeff a long time ago and worked with him to figure something out\u2014or at least stayed in close enough touch for him to really believe I wasn\u2019t in danger. I\u2019d followed Horse\u2019s directions because I thought it was safest for Jeff. At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019d used as the excuse to ignore my brother while I built a new life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Had I been lying to myself?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to the apartment now,\u201d Horse said. \u201cRemember, lay low. You need something, call my cell. Don\u2019t come looking for me or anyone else. I already talked to Em, she\u2019s packing up some clothes and shit for you.\u201d</p><p>He took my arm, opening the back door and leading through the hallways to the stairs. I saw a few new faces, male and female, and the palpable air of tension everywhere sickened me. Nobody said hi or even looked me in the eye. We climbed the stairs to the third floor, where they had remodeled the original offices to make studio apartments. I got the smallest, all the way at the end. There were bars on the windows and Horse told me to keep the shades drawn.</p><p>I sat down on the queen-sized bed, alone.</p> <p>I pulled out my phone and sent an urgent email to Jeff\u2019s anonymous account. Then I started making phone calls to as many of his friends as I could find numbers for. I had to reach him, although I wasn\u2019t sure what I would tell him. Could I really trust the Reapers if he came in?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t so sure about that.</p><p>Horse</p><p>Church was standing room only. Picnic presided, the visiting presidents from Portland and LeGrande flanking him. Horse leaned against the wall, eyeing Max across the room. He hadn\u2019t forgotten what he\u2019d done, but he\u2019d paid his price and was back in the fold. He might not like the guy but he was still a brother\u2014and if war came, they needed every man.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lost three shipments so far,\u201d said Deke, the Portland president. Horse had spent a lot of time visiting that charter, and he knew Deke didn\u2019t f**k around when it came to security. If someone was hijacking their product, things had gotten bad. \u201cCouldn\u2019t figure out how they were getting their information. Devil\u2019s Jacks aren\u2019t exactly the brightest ass**les in the bunch, but it\u2019s like they\u2019re reading our minds or something. This last time we caught one. He didn\u2019t talk much, but we searched his cell and found some contacts. That\u2019s how we learned about your boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do with the guy you caught?\u201d Picnic.</p><p>\u201cGot him at a safe house,\u201d Deke replied, giving a feral smile. \u201cHolding on to him for now. Figured it might be useful to have him, goddamn bastards are loyal, if nothing else. That\u2019s more than I can say for this Jensen guy. Business is out of hand, Pic. Why didn\u2019t you take him out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my fault,\u201d Horse said. \u201cHis sister\u2019s my old lady. The man\u2019s got incredible skills, really thought we\u2019d be able to turn the situation around and keep using him. Obviously I made a serious error in judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhole club made that decision,\u201d Duck said. \u201cMistake? Maybe. But you go around putting talented people down all the time, eventually you run out of talent. In this case we f**ked up. Could\u2019ve gone the other way just as easy. And we all know the Jacks have been looking for a way to move in on us for years. We\u2019d be facing this sooner or later no matter what.\u201d</p><p>There were grunts of agreement all around the table.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s he getting his information?\u201d asked Deke. \u201cThat\u2019s the real question here. You know him. What are we missing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Horse said, shaking his head. \u201cHacking? Only explanation I can think of, although it\u2019s a long shot. We aren\u2019t stupid, not like this shit is on a spreadsheet or something. The other explanation is a rat.\u201d</p><p>The room grew quiet. Then Deke spoke.</p><p>\u201cWe do business online all the time, banking, transfers, you name it. Money\u2019s gotta move somehow, can\u2019t do it all in cash. That\u2019s the reality. Someone could be giving out clues without even realizing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe texts or personal emails?\u201d Ruger piped up. \u201cWe all got burners for business, but we\u2019ve got personal phones too. Email. All that shit. Can\u2019t get by without it and I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 someone\u2019s gotten sloppy. Could even be a kid or a woman, no idea what they\u2019re doing. We need to lock information down, take it from there and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie\u2019s upstairs trying to get in touch with him,\u201d Horse said. \u201cI gave it to her straight. She knows this is serious. If she finds him, she\u2019ll let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we trust her?\u201d asked Picnic, scratching his chin. He looked tired. \u201cYou know I like her, but shit like this would f**k with anyone and she\u2019s new to the club. She might tip him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she tips him off, that\u2019s better than letting things stand,\u201d said Max, surprising Horse. \u201cShe tells him he\u2019s putting her in danger, he might back down. He\u2019s doing this because he\u2019s scared and he\u2019s trying to help her. Must not\u2019ve been able to pull the money together so he\u2019s playing a new game. I\u2019ll bet he has no idea the shit storm he\u2019s creating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping her here until this is handled,\u201d Horse said. \u201cShe\u2019s up in the back apartment. Anyone have a problem with that?\u201d</p> <p>Picnic rolled his eyes, and Ruger shook his head. Deke laughed and pulled out a knife, picking at his fingernail with it.</p><p>\u201cGot no problem with that, brother,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s club property. We don\u2019t share with anyone, don\u2019t care how or why they want her. It\u2019s about all of us now.\u201d</p><p>Horse felt the tension in his chest loosen. He knew Jeff wouldn\u2019t harm her, but the Jacks? He\u2019d seen what they could do to a woman.</p><p>\u201cWe still owe those cocksuckers for Gracie,\u201d Deke added, his face grim. \u201cI know we took action, but I still say it wasn\u2019t enough. We need to show them who owns this land, throw their asses so far out of our territory that the fall back to earth kills \u2019em. We stop Jensen, great. But I think we should consider taking the fight to them, finish what we started ten years ago. I don\u2019t give a shit about this guy, I want to take them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah,\u201d muttered one of the Portland guys. Horse nodded, understanding. The Oregon charters had suffered over the years and a threat to one of the club\u2019s women would hit them harder than most. He didn\u2019t want war, but if it came he wouldn\u2019t be holding back. They owed the Jacks for a lot of things.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s how I\u2019m seeing it,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cWe reach out to all the charters, in person. Tell them to get ready. Make sure their information is locked up tight. New phones, new codes. Women and children taking safety precautions. Marie may be the one with the bounty on her head, but they\u2019re all vulnerable. Might wanna consider bringing them in for the duration, especially you guys down south. You think Marie can make contact with him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cShe\u2019s got an email. He\u2019s a smart little f**k, he\u2019ll be waiting for her to reach out. Might be able to use him to feed the Jacks information, offer him a way out. We have a shipment we can afford to give up for an ambush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got something coming through in a couple of weeks,\u201d said Grenade, the LeGrande charter\u2019s VP. \u201cYou leak it, we can set things up. Might not be bad to hit them back at the same time. Send some boys down to Cali, raid \u2019em while we ambush up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a bad idea,\u201d Picnic mused. \u201cGuys from Roseburg could do it. Thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the idea of turning him,\u201d Deke replied. \u201cTake it from there. I don\u2019t want to send men down unless we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll catch the Jacks off guard. Could be a bloodbath otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat settles it then,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cWe need a vote? Any opposed?\u201d</p><p>Nobody spoke.</p><p>\u201cAll in favor.\u201d</p><p>Assorted \u201cayes\u201d echoed around the room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s settled then,\u201d said Picnic. \u201cYou guys staying tonight? Got the girls pulling together food and shit already.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d Deke said, grinning. \u201cEat and drink while you can, boys. Got work to do tomorrow. Fuck with us and we will f**k you back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>Church was over. Time to party.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t plan on getting drunk, but it felt good to kick back with his brothers. Em\u2019d brought shit for Marie, which he took upstairs after church. He\u2019d grabbed her some pizza and a couple of beers too, and spent half an hour sitting with her. But she didn\u2019t look at him, didn\u2019t kiss him back when he\u2019d tried to get close, so he figured she needed some space. Hell of a lot to process, he got that.</p><p>Downstairs things were getting crazy\u2014always the case when charters got together, particularly when blood was in the air. Didn\u2019t get much bloodier than the Devil\u2019s Jacks. Tonight wasn\u2019t a family party either, something Picnic made clear when he sent Em packing after she dropped off Marie\u2019s things. Horse grinned, thinking of her. Poor kid, at this rate she\u2019d be fifty before she found a man.</p><p>As he sauntered into the main lounge, a girl wearing a miniskirt and thigh-high fishnets, along with a bikini top so small it defied physics, brought him a beer, reaching around his waist and rubbing her boobs against his arm. Some chick from the Line, he couldn\u2019t remember her name. He gave her a pat on the ass, then shrugged her off. Sweet butts and strippers, place was crawling with them, hospitality for the visiting brothers. Horse chugged the beer and handed the cup to another girl as she walked by. He wanted a word with Ruger before things got too crazy.</p> <p>The man wasn\u2019t in the main lounge or the meeting room, so Horse headed back toward the office. They kept their records there, at least the official ones, and Horse stored the legitimate business accounts there too. It was convenient and would make things efficient if they ever got served with a warrant. Just for fun, he\u2019d filled a couple lockboxes with shady-looking paperwork and decoy overseas account numbers\u2014he liked the idea of some cop blowing his wad if he found them, then spending months trying to put it all together. Horse opened the door to find Picnic pounding into a woman face down on the desk, his pants around his ankles, her hair pulled back like reins.</p><p>\u201cGetting an early start?\u201d Horse asked, smirking. \u201cNo wonder you wanted Em the hell out of here. You\u2019re a perv, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the f**k out unless someone\u2019s shooting at us,\u201d Picnic grumbled and Horse laughed, closing the door and heading back toward the shop. Ruger was a hell of a gunsmith and he did his most sensitive work back there, away from any curious eyes at the gun shop. If the visiting boys needed hardware, that\u2019s where they\u2019d find it. Horse threw open the door and saw Ruger at his bench, holding up a fully automated assault rifle, one of his specialties. Several of the brothers stood around, talking shit, while one of the Portland men reached for the gun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a thing of beauty, but not exactly practical,\u201d he said, laughing as he hefted it. \u201cCan\u2019t see this in my saddlebags. Like something out of Thunderdome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cBut these dumb-fuck militia dicks can\u2019t get enough of \u2019em. Think they\u2019re all Rambo or something. \u2018Master race\u2019, my ass, I make a fortune off those idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuger, got a minute?\u201d Horse asked. Ruger ambled on over.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie\u2019s upstairs, and I\u2019m thinking about security for the next few days,\u201d Horse said. \u201cYou got any thoughts on that? I know manpower\u2019s limited, and I\u2019m wondering if we wanted to rig up any extra precautions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlready ahead of you,\u201d Ruger said, flashing a smile. He flicked his lip ring with his tongue as he grabbed a laptop from the bench, popping it open. The guy looked scary as hell with his tats, mohawk, chains and piercings, but around technology he was more like a little kid at Christmas. Ruger popped open the security control panel for the clubhouse on the laptop, and he clicked on a multicolored layout of the armory and surrounding property. \u201cSee here? We\u2019ve got the cams and basic motion sensors, of course, but I\u2019m planning on putting in some new stuff around the perimeter, right here. We need detection, but I\u2019m also worried about manpower. I want to rig some traps that we can trigger by computer or phone if we need to. I know we can\u2019t count on the electronics a hundred percent, but we can only spread ourselves so thin. This gives us more options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we put something outside her room?\u201d Horse. \u201cI know it\u2019s not a top priority, but I\u2019d like to keep an eye on her. Just in case they buy off one of the girls or something. This probably won\u2019t come down to a frontal assault.\u201d</p><p>Ruger scratched his head, considering.</p><p>\u201cI can rig something up for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWon\u2019t be until tomorrow. After I fix the guys up back here I\u2019m ready for some pu**y. Speaking of, you sure about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sayin\u2019 I have a pu**y?\u201d Horse asked, crossing his arms and cocking an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass**le, you know I meant your girl upstairs. I get that you\u2019re into her. But she knows his life is at stake and we might be the ones to kill him. You might want to consider the possibility that she\u2019s working with Jensen on this. She\u2019s only human, Horse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Horse shook his head.</p><p>\u201cMarie can\u2019t lie for shit,\u201d he replied, pinching the bridge of his nose, feeling tired. \u201cAnd even if she was, she doesn\u2019t know a damn thing. Couldn\u2019t be his source of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re talking, she wouldn\u2019t have to be his only source,\u201d Ruger replied, his tone reasonable. \u201cHe might be using her. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s screwing you on purpose\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s definitely screwing me on purpose,\u201d Horse replied, deadpan.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Ruger replied, grinning. \u201cYou know what I mean. She\u2019s the victim in this situation and she believes in her brother. She tells him about your day-to-day life, he puts that together with a couple other sources, could add up. You don\u2019t tell her about club business, but she sure as shit knows when we\u2019re on a long run. All the women do. Fuck, for all we know he\u2019s on Facebook with them or something, pretending to be some chick they know. You get enough old ladies talking about their men being gone, it adds up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d muttered Horse, shaking his head. \u201cNever thought of that. This is a pain in the ass, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d Ruger asked, rubbing a hand across his tattooed scalp and the short buzz of his mohawk. \u201cSo you want cameras on her. Sure you don\u2019t want something inside the room too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, don\u2019t want your sick ass watching us f**k,\u201d Horse replied. \u201cBut I do want to check on her, make sure nobody\u2019s lingering, trying to get to her. You know what I mean? Oh, and a GPS on her car. Want to be able to find her. Make sure she doesn\u2019t see you, want to keep her safe, not freak her out more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow. Right now I need someone sucking my dick, and unless you\u2019re planning to share your old lady, I got higher priorities than this conversation.\u201d</p><p>Ruger grinned and Horse laughed, putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it hard enough to leave marks.</p><p>\u201cTouch Marie and I\u2019ll cut off your balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Ruger replied. \u201cSo much for taking care of your brothers, you cock-blocking bastard. Talk to me tomorrow and I\u2019ll set it up to feed to your phone, along with the computers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, man,\u201d Horse said.</p><p>The party was raging back in the main lounge. Two girls were bumping and grinding each other up on one end of the bar, and a third served up body shots in the middle. Duck, the filthy old pervert, sat back on a couch with a barely legal redhead eating out his mouth with her hand thrust down between them, working furiously. Picnic caught Horse\u2019s eye across the room, apparently finished with his important business in the office. The man gave a chin jerk, inviting Horse to join the Portland and LeGrande officers at his table.</p><p>\u201cInteresting times,\u201d Picnic said as Horse grabbed a seat. \u201cDeke tells me the Portland boys are itching for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad for the excuse,\u201d Deke said. \u201cJacks\u2019ve always been trouble, we all know that, but they\u2019ve been working up on us for a while. Nothing too overt, always just this side of what\u2019s acceptable behavior. Wearing their cuts on our territory, dicking with support clubs, that kind of thing. There\u2019s a group of them that\u2019s set up near Brooklyn Park. They\u2019re just camping in some shitty rental and doing their thing like they think they\u2019re citizens or something. I know two of them are going to school at PSU, if you can believe it, and they aren\u2019t doing anything for us to call them on, besides existing and being general ass**les. No respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re up to something,\u201d Horse replied as yet another half-naked girl set a beer down in front of him. \u201cThey always are. Shit, if it was us, we\u2019d be up to something.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed, knowing he was right.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d Deke replied. \u201cAnd since we\u2019re the ones losing shipments, I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a good chance the leak is close to home. But no matter how much we check on the local guys, we haven\u2019t caught them doing shit. I wanted to ask you about this Jensen guy. How good with computers is he? Do you really think he could hack in, pull stuff from our home computers, that kind of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s good,\u201d Horse said. \u201cGuys like him are why I do the books on a laptop without a wireless card. Lock it in a safe, back it up once a week and keep that backup in a different safe. That\u2019s the only kind of computer security we can really trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Deke replied. He tugged on his short, black goatee, shaking his head. The Portland president was a big guy with long, black hair he kept in a ponytail. His arms were covered in full-sleeve tattoos, and the rumor was he operated as national\u2019s unofficial hit man. Horse didn\u2019t doubt it for a minute. \u201cWe find him, we have to get rid of him unless he hands us the Jacks. Even then, might have to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>Horse nodded, knowing the truth of it. Fuck, this was gonna kill Marie.</p><p>\u201cIf it comes down to that, can you make it an accident? Maybe in a couple of months?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can,\u201d Deke replied, glancing over at Picnic, who shrugged. \u201cGotta tell you, I\u2019m a little concerned about your commitment on this one, Horse. You seem more worried about your girl\u2019s feelings than someone f**king with the club. We got a problem?\u201d</p><p>Horse shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis is my life, I know that and she knows it too. Just hoping to walk out alive and still keep my old lady. We all make sacrifices. Hoping mine isn\u2019t bigger than it needs to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear,\u201d Deke said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Make our lives easier if the Jacks killed him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cBut don\u2019t count on it\u2014they\u2019ve never done anything to help us before, doubt they\u2019ll start now. Wish we had better control over the timing, but it\u2019ll be good to take them down, especially given your situation, Deke. But that\u2019s enough business. I know you boys had a long ride today. Time for some hospitality.\u201d</p><p>Picnic glanced around, spotting a couple of girls standing not too far away. He whistled, calling them over.</p><p>\u201cTake care of Deke and Grenade for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>They smiled and obediently moved toward the visiting charter officers. Picnic looked at Horse and cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou planning to partake tonight?\u201d</p><p>Horse shook his head.</p><p>\u201cGot something better waiting for me upstairs,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving her some time to settle in, get used to what\u2019s happening. That\u2019s all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome men say a brother who\u2019s afraid to enjoy pu**y at a party is a pu**y himself,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cWho\u2019s in charge, you or the old lady?\u201d</p><p>Horse laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen your old lady was alive, you were a monk. I saw how it was.\u201d</p><p>Picnic looked thoughtful and took a long pull of his beer. Then he looked up and held Horse\u2019s gaze.</p> <p>\u201cCaught a lot of shit for that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m telling you, I\u2019d give every piece of ass I\u2019ve had in my life for another day with that woman. This,\u201d he continued, gesturing toward the party. \u201cThis is good fun. But it\u2019s not the real thing. We\u2019ll do our best to protect your girl. And if we take out Jensen, we\u2019ll do it quiet. Want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Horse said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d Picnic replied. He smiled. \u201cWhat I said aside, my old lady may not be here, but remembering her makes me horny as f**k. Girl in the office only took the edge off. Think I\u2019ll do something about that.\u201d</p><p>Picnic got up, moving toward another group of giggling women. Hands came around Horse\u2019s head from behind, covering his eyes as a warm body pressed into his back.</p><p>\u201cHey sexy,\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice. He recognized it instantly and smiled broadly. Serena. He pulled her hands off and stood to hug her.</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while,\u201d he said, stepping back to take her in. \u201cFantastic like always. Haven\u2019t been around at all lately, what\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>She offered a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a new man, I think. Guy from California, comes up here on his private jet, that kind of thing. Been seeing him for a while, but his divorce is final now, so he\u2019s got a little more freedom. We\u2019ve been hanging out. I\u2019m thinking about heading south with him, unless there\u2019s a better reason for me to stay around here...\u201d</p><p>Horse caught the unasked question and shook his head ruefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taken, babe.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking a little wistful but not unhappy or surprised. That was Serena\u2014always a realist, and a good friend too. He\u2019d been hooking up with her on and off since high school, and she was one of the few women he\u2019d slept with that he actually liked and trusted.</p> <p>\u201cI heard rumors,\u201d she replied. \u201cKind of scary rumors, to be honest. Answer me one question and I\u2019ll leave you alone. She a prisoner?\u201d</p><p>Horse shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI told her she can leave, but her brother\u2019s under a sentence. It\u2019s way beyond her now, he\u2019s on his own at this point.\u201d</p><p>Serena studied his face, then shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tricky,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou \u2018told\u2019 her she can leave? Does she know you lied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not having this conversation,\u201d Horse said, his voice firm. Serena laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, big boy. Just asking. I always thought the two of us might make something of it, that kind of thing. But I\u2019m happy for you, Horse, I really am. You\u2019re one of the good ones. Buy a lady a drink, for old times\u2019 sake?\u201d</p><p>He offered her his arm as they headed toward the bar. Just one girl danced on top now, and she\u2019d lost her clothes. The other was down on a couch, one of the brothers from LeGrande eating her out while she gave a blowjob to another. It didn\u2019t interest him much, which made Horse feel sort of old and jaded. He might be taken, but a man could still look. But honestly, it just seemed so boring.</p> <p>He snagged a couple of beers for them from the bar and looked around for a spot quiet enough to talk, but it wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs to the game room.\u201d</p><p>Nearly half of the armory\u2019s the second floor was a large, open room where they\u2019d set up pool tables, an air hockey table and a bunch of old couches. There was a big-screen TV up against one wall hooked to the satellite and about six different kinds of video consoles. Later on people might bed down in here, but for now it was quiet. Down the hallway was a series of rooms they used for all kinds of things, from storing extra inventory for the businesses to privacy for a quickie. He escorted Serena to the couch in front of the TV. She looked around, eyes lingering on the hallway.</p><p>\u201cThe room in use tonight?\u201d</p><p>Horse grimaced and shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWho knows,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody makes \u2019em do it. You starting to judge?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and laughed, leaning toward him to brush her hand along his cut.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019ve spent a night or two in there myself,\u201d she replied, winking. \u201cI think you were off with the Marines or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you were with someone else while I was gone?\u201d he asked, clutching a hand to his heart, pretending to be offended. She burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou know me. I\u2019ll stand by my man so long as he\u2019s in the room and has a pile of cash.\u201d</p><p>Horse laughed with her, loving her honesty. Being with Serena was comfortable, no question. A part of him wished he could care about her the way he did about Marie. They would\u2019ve been a good pair, and she sure as shit knew her way around the club. Intimately. Yeah, that wouldn\u2019t work, he decided. Someone took her as property the other old ladies would probably kill her.</p><p>Or she\u2019d kill them, he decided, eyeing the long, red talons she called fingernails.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the look for?\u201d she asked, arching a brow.</p><p>\u201cJust wondering who\u2019d win if you got into it with the old ladies,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing so hard that she snorted beer out her nose, which made her laugh more. That\u2019s what he loved about Serena\u2014whatever she did, she did it openly and without any pretense. He took the glass from her, looking around to find something to help her clean up. There was an old sweatshirt tucked into the end of the couch, so he snagged it and leaned toward her, helping to wipe off her chest and lap. Serena didn\u2019t help, giggling and slapping at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to cop a feel, you dirty bastard!\u201d she exclaimed. He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know me. Always looking for my next lay.\u201d</p><p>Then a voice cut through his laughter and it was his turn to choke.</p><p>\u201cI can see why you t-t-t-told me to wait upst-t-t-t-tairs.\u201d</p><p>Horse turned his head to see Marie standing behind the couch, wrapped in a blanket, face pale and teeth chattering.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d he muttered. Serena looked between them, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is the old lady?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Marie</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t get the window closed.</p><p>It was stupid to open it but I\u2019ve got a bit of a claustrophobia thing. To be fair, I was stuck in a room alone all by myself, and it wasn\u2019t a particularly big room. I heard the noise of the party below and I knew that Horse would be up eventually. But the bars on the window and the fact that I couldn\u2019t make contact with Jeff and I couldn\u2019t leave made me feel a little panicky.</p><p>So I decided to open the window for some fresh air.</p><p>Of course it was stuck, so I worked at it, rocking the old wooden sash back and forth until I got my fingers underneath. Then I braced against the floor and pushed up with all I had. Because I have shitty luck, it held for a second then burst free, sliding all the way up and getting stuck again, this time open. It took about ten minutes before I realized this might be a serious problem. The place was heated with one of those big old freestanding radiators that didn\u2019t have separate controls for individual rooms, so I couldn\u2019t turn it up. It hadn\u2019t been too warm in here to begin with. Outside the night was cold and clear and perfect, the evergreens on the hillsides surrounding us dusted with a hint of frost like something out of a Christmas card.</p><p>Now it was becoming cold and clear but not-so-perfect in the room.</p> <p>I tried to get it closed of course. And I put on my coat, but it was just my leather jacket and not particularly warm. I\u2019d been looking for a winter coat but they all cost so much and I didn\u2019t like spending money, so I\u2019d been hunting in consignment shops for just the right thing. I started pacing, trying to decide what to do next. I dug in my purse, pushing aside my gun to find my phone. Not that I carried the gun all the time, but Horse wanted it with me until they dealt with the Jacks.</p><p>No voicemails or texts, but I decided I might as well check my email. There was a new message from Jeff on the webmail account. I start reading, a sinking sensation filling my stomach.</p><p>Sis, I\u2019m glad they haven\u2019t hurt you. You need to play along and do what they ask, don\u2019t give them any reason not to treat you well. I\u2019m sending a decoy message to your main account too, telling you that I\u2019m thinking about getting in touch with them. But you need to know the Reapers are bad guys and they won\u2019t hesitate to kill you. Neither will the Devil\u2019s Jacks, but I\u2019ve got things worked out with them so that you and I should be okay.</p><p>Couple of things you need to know. You say it\u2019s good between you and Horse, and that scares me. He\u2019s stringing you along, you can\u2019t trust this guy at all. I\u2019ve learned a lot about him. Did you know he was special forces in Afghanistan? His specialty was recon, which means they\u2019d send him out ahead to get information and do their dirty work. He killed a lot of people and he got investigated for murdering civilians. Women and children, sis. They were going to court martial him, but then the witnesses either wouldn\u2019t talk or disappeared. It was a cover-up, that\u2019s the only explanation. They couldn\u2019t even give him a dishonorable discharge, that\u2019s how sneaky he was. Here are some links to articles about the massacre. I found other records too, but I can\u2019t send them to you, it\u2019s too dangerous.</p><p>Your boyfriend is a killer and if he finds out you know the truth, he\u2019ll probably kill you too. Do what he says and play the good girl. Write to me on the other email account and I\u2019ll pretend to cooperate. Play dumb and be ready. I\u2019ll contact you again later this week when I have things set up. Remember, it\u2019s not enough for you to just hop in your car and drive away. They may look like a club, but they\u2019re like the mafia. We need an escape plan for all of us, you, me and Mom, and I\u2019m working on it. Just hold on a little longer.</p><p>I love you and I\u2019m sorry I got you into this. You\u2019ll never know how sorry I am.</p> <p>Jeff</p><p>I followed the link to a news story from eight years ago. A bunch of Afghani families were murdered in their houses, located in a region under the control of US allies, but heavily infiltrated by Taliban forces as well. A Marine recon team was under investigation for war crimes. Included was a picture of a much younger Horse, in one of those standard military mug shots you see all the time.</p><p>I barely made it to the bathroom before I threw up.</p><p>Afterward I lay down on the bed, wrapping the covers around me and listening to the noise of the party below. An hour passed before I realized that no matter how depressed I felt, I couldn\u2019t just stay in the bed. The room was bitter cold now, and the blankets nowhere near thick enough to protect me. I tried texting Picnic with numb fingers. No response. I thought about calling one of the girls, but with the party going on below I knew that was a bad idea. Jeff said to keep the Reapers happy. I ran a hundred different ideas through my head and then texted Horse. Nothing. Then I called him. No answer.</p><p>That\u2019s when I ventured out of my room into the hallway. I knew there were other rooms up here, it\u2019s where they put up guests or members when they needed a place to land. I could go to one of those and warm up while I waited. The doors were all locked, though. Now my teeth were chattering and I fumbled to hold the blanket around me. No getting around it\u2014I needed to go downstairs and find Horse.</p><p>The third floor of the building was only about half as wide as the first two, just one long hallway running the length of the building with a single row of rooms on either side. There were stairwells on each end. The main stairs, which I\u2019d come up with Horse, intersected the game room and the main lounge. But the back stairwell bypassed the game room entirely and let out down by the offices. I figured I\u2019d attract less attention there, so that\u2019s where I went. Unfortunately, the door was locked on the main level, which left me to go back up or out into the cold of the courtyard. Easy call. I climbed back up to the second floor, pushing through the door from the stairwell as quietly as possible. I heard voices and grunting and shouts coming from an open door on my left. I walked toward it slowly, hoping I\u2019d find Horse in there.</p><p>What I saw shocked me.</p><p>There were five men standing around the room, none of them guys I recognized but all wearing Reapers\u2019 cuts. They stood around a bed with one woman on it, and she was getting f**ked\u2014seriously f**ked\u2014by a man standing at the edge of the bed, pants just pushed down, hands holding her tight around the hips.</p> <p>\u201cHarder, baby!\u201d she yelled, giving a little howl and arching her back.</p><p>\u201cJesus, can\u2019t believe this bitch,\u201d muttered one of the guys, and I recognized his voice. Max. I saw him now. He\u2019d been turned away from me before. I couldn\u2019t move. I just stood watching as the man at the foot of the bed finished with a grunt, then pulled out and stepped aside. Max stepped forward to take his place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh my god, she was doing all of them. I studied her face, wondering why she wasn\u2019t screaming for them to get off her, but if anything she looked satisfied. Not so much sexually satisfied but triumphant. I shook my head, backing away and shuffling down the hallway, feeling disgusted and sick. Horse might not have been in there, but this was his clubhouse and his club. Did he know about stuff like this? Did it happen often? I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it, didn\u2019t want to wrap my head around it. I just wanted to run down to my car and get in and drive as far and as fast as I could.</p><p>But I remembered Jeff\u2019s email. I couldn\u2019t do that. They might find me, or they might find him. They could even go after Mom. She was stuck in jail, and God only knew what kind of connections guys like this had in jail. I\u2019d watched Oz on Netflix last winter, I\u2019d seen how prisons worked. Were jails the same way? I didn\u2019t think so, but could I bet Mama\u2019s life on that? You can do this, I chanted under my breath. You can do this, you\u2019re strong and smart and you\u2019re going to figure everything out. Just put on your big-girl panties and get on with it.</p><p>I continued down the hall, taking deep breaths and forcing myself to stay calm. It was a lot warmer on the second floor, which felt incredible. I was still freezing and shivering in my jacket and blanket, but I\u2019d survive. I\u2019d already survived losing my dad, not to mention Gary. I walked into the game room to see a couple sitting on the couch, very close to each other. Their posture was intimate, like people who\u2019d known each other for years and were comfortable together. The woman was laughing.</p><p>It was Horse and some girl I didn\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>\u201cJust wondering who\u2019d win if you got into it with the old ladies,\u201d Horse was saying to her. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing even harder, snorting and spilling her beer. Horse chuckled, grabbing the beer and fumbling around on the couch. I saw him lean into her, rubbing her chest, his hands disappearing lower. The woman giggled and slapped at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to cop a feel, you dirty bastard!\u201d she exclaimed. He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you know me. Always looking for my next lay.\u201d</p><p>Wow. The cold in my body was nothing compared to the ice filling my heart. Jeff was right. I didn\u2019t know this man and I certainly couldn\u2019t trust him. He\u2019d promised. I\u2019d been an idiot and now I had to stay with him and do what he said and pretend not to know he might have murdered women and children in some remote village in Afghanistan. I felt myself starting to panic, so I clamped down on my emotions, withdrawing deep inside where I\u2019d be safe. I couldn\u2019t even run away and hide\u2014I had nowhere to go. Then I spoke.</p> <p>\u201cI can see why you t-t-t-told me to wait upst-t-t-t-tairs,\u201d I said, startled by how much my teeth chattered when I spoke. Horse turned and looked at me, his face hardening, eyes full of guilt. I wondered why he bothered.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit,\u201d he muttered. The woman next to him looked rapidly between us, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is the old lady?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d said Horse, pushing up from the couch so hard it slid back a foot across the old wooden floor, stalking toward me. I thought maybe I should run but I couldn\u2019t seem to move. He grabbed my shoulders and shook them, punctuating his words. \u201cI told you to stay in your room. What are you doing down here? You realize what could happen to you at a party like this? Jesus!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply, just let him shake me and mused at how truly insane my life had become.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he said finally, anger disappearing as he reached out and felt my face. \u201cShit, you\u2019re freezing! What the f**k? Talk to me, Marie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cM-m-my wind-d-dow is st-tuck,\u201d I managed to say. \u201cI t-tried to c-c-call you.\u201d</p><p>He dug into his pocket, pulling out his phone, punching it on and finding the notifications. He winced.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he said, pulling me into his arms, rubbing my back hard. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hear it. I\u2019m so sorry, I can\u2019t believe how cold you are. You need to get warmed up. Serena, run to the office and grab the apartment keys. Meet me upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He swung me up into his arms and carried me back to the third floor. Thankfully we didn\u2019t go back down the long hallway, past the crazy woman and the group of men taking turns screwing her. I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve handled that. The woman\u2014Serena\u2014was fast, because she came rushing up with the keys right behind us. Horse stopped by a room on the other end of the hallway from my original one, waiting impatiently as she fumbled the door open. He set me down on the bed and stripped me methodically, ignoring my protests. Then I was totally naked and under the covers.</p><p>\u201cGo down to the room on the far end and get her stuff,\u201d he said to Serena. \u201cAll of it, bring it down here and then lock up. We\u2019ll deal with the window situation tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Serena disappeared and I wanted to protest. I didn\u2019t want Horse\u2019s whore touching my things. I bit my lip, remembering Jeff\u2019s email. Horse killed people. Maybe women like me. Children. I thought about his guns, how easily he handled them, how he\u2019d made me practice for hours with my little .22. I remembered our first night together, when we\u2019d watched the Johnny Depp flick and he\u2019d talked about how the hand-to-hand combat was all wrong.</p><p>I guess he\u2019d know.</p><p>Horse crawled into bed beside me, buck-naked, spooning me and wrapping around my body like a big, warm blanket. My body craved his heat, soaking it up even as my mind stayed cool and detached. The more I warmed up the harder I shivered until my jaw hurt from clenching my teeth and I ached. Serena bustled in with my things at some point, then closed the door and disappeared. The entire time Horse made soothing noises and rubbed me softly, and for once he didn\u2019t try to touch my br**sts or reach between my legs. Finally I stopped shivering and I drowsed.</p> <p>\u201cBabe,\u201d he whispered, kissing the top of my head softly. \u201cBabe,\u201d he said again, shaking me gently. I stirred against him, and he rolled me over and onto my back, rising over me on his elbows. \u201cWhy was the window open? What happened?\u201d</p><p>He sounded so worried, so loving. Would a murderer be able to fake that kind of emotion? But how many times had I looked at Horse and thought he was more like two different men\u2014good and bad\u2014stuck in one body? I couldn\u2019t explore that right now, I couldn\u2019t let him know what I\u2019d found out.</p><p>\u201cI just needed some fresh air,\u201d I said, deliberately keeping my voice soft and weak. It wasn\u2019t much of a stretch. \u201cIt got stuck and I couldn\u2019t get it closed again. The room got colder and colder and I waited too long before I left to get help. It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m fine, Horse. Honestly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you always saying that to me?\u201d he asked, although it seemed like he was talking to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re so strong, always strong. You shouldn\u2019t have to be that way. I should\u2019ve been there for you. I\u2019m so sorry, babe.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, closing my eyes and turning away from him. His body felt good on mine, strong and safe like always. I felt his penis harden and his hips flexed, almost involuntarily. The achingly familiar chemistry between us came to life and my ni**les tightened as my legs shifted restlessly. He started kissing me near my ear, sucking and licking his way down my neck toward my breast, sending tendrils of sensation racing through me. When he sucked my nipple into his mouth I cried out, then reached down and grabbed his hair, pulling him away.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this right now,\u201d I whispered. He sighed and rolled over next to me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he said, his voice firm. I looked over at him, panicked. In addition to everything else, could he read my mind or something? How did he know what I\u2019d found out? Was he monitoring my phone?</p> <p>\u201cSerena is an old friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve known her for years. We\u2019ve slept together, I won\u2019t lie to you about that, but nothing was happening between us tonight. We were just joking around.\u201d</p><p>My eyes opened wider as I processed what he\u2019d said. Serena. The woman on the couch. I felt hysterical laughter bubbling up in my throat and I swallowed it down painfully. This was a good thing, I realized. I could use this as an excuse to be angry with him. He expected it, he deserved it, and he wouldn\u2019t have to know that my mind was way too full of visions of him killing Afghani children to give a flying f**k about him and Serena.</p><p>\u201cYou promised,\u201d I said, letting the tears I\u2019d been holding back well up in my eyes. Might as well let them out while I had an excuse. They started falling and I gulped. \u201cYou promised that you wouldn\u2019t be with those other women, the night we decided to give this a shot. You lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been with any other women,\u201d Horse said, his voice a mixture of frustration and something else I couldn\u2019t identify. \u201cI was talking to an old friend. She\u2019s got someone else in her life and I\u2019ve got you. I was just killing time, waiting until it got late enough for me to leave and come back up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about this right now?\u201d I asked, trying to roll away from him. He held me, taking my chin and making me look at him.</p> <p>\u201cFight with me all you want, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t turn away from me. Let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk,\u201d I whispered, feeling panic rise again. He searched my face, mouth hardening.</p><p>\u201cIs there something else?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you heard from your brother? Tell me. I\u2019m here for you, Marie.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cLet me check my email,\u201d I said quickly. I pulled away from him and started to get up, but he stopped me, getting up and digging my phone out of my jeans pocket himself.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing it to me. I turned it on and clicked on the email app\u2014the one linked to my main account. There it was, the fake message Jeff had promised.</p> <p>\u201cHe wrote,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cRead it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says, \u2018So sorry about all this, sis. I got your message about coming in and talking to the Reapers. I\u2019m not sure I can do that. No offense, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re planning to kill me. Talk to them, find out if they\u2019re willing to make a deal and get back to me. I love you. Jeff\u2019 That\u2019s all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what I expected,\u201d Horse said slowly, climbing back into bed. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised he doesn\u2019t trust us. He\u2019s scared and he should be. Odds are good he\u2019s not gonna survive this. But there\u2019s a huge difference between staying in bed with the Jacks or trying to make peace with us. He needs to wrap his head around that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d I asked, afraid to hear the answer.</p><p>Horse rolled onto his side and propped his head up on one elbow looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d Horse said, reaching over and tracing the curve of my cheek. \u201cThe Jacks will. No question of it. He should know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they were trying to take me back to him,\u201d I said softly. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jacks will get you if they can, but their record with women isn\u2019t too good. Three years ago Deke had a niece, Gracie, get in trouble with them. His old lady\u2019s sister\u2019s kid. No connection to the club, other than that. She decided to go to school down in California and turns out she wasn\u2019t far from a Jacks charter. Started dating a guy who seemed nice enough, but he was one of their hangarounds. Apparently she mentioned her uncle was in the Reapers at some point. She went to a party with him and they raped her. All of them. One big f**king train, nearly killed her. They finished her off by carving \u2018DJ\u2019 on her forehead. Dumped her by the side of the road. Sent Deke a picture afterward taken with her own phone.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, feeling sick. Then I thought about the woman on the second floor, and wondered if she\u2019d finished with those men yet. What if she wanted to stop halfway through? Would they let her?</p><p>\u201cWhat about downstairs?\u201d I asked, mouth getting away from my brain. \u201cWhat makes that any different?\u201d</p><p>Horse cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a woman downstairs, I saw her in a room with a bunch of guys on the second floor. They were taking turns...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d Horse muttered, dropping onto his back and running his hands through his hair. \u201cWhat else is gonna fall to shit tonight? I\u2019m sorry you saw that, babe. I didn\u2019t think about that at all. Shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Are they going to hurt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said, sitting up and looking down at me. \u201cShit, no, I can\u2019t believe you have to ask that. We\u2019re not a bunch of ra**sts, Marie. Shit. If she\u2019s in there, she chose to be there. Fuck if I know why, but women do it all the time. It\u2019s a thing with some of the sweet butts, like counting coup or something. I can\u2019t exactly defend it as upstanding behavior, but that\u2019s nothing like what they did to Gracie. They tore her up so bad, I can\u2019t even explain it. She\u2019ll never have kids. She tried to kill herself twice before they got her into some kind of psychiatric facility. Damn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked so genuinely upset that I believed him.</p><p>\u201cHow often does it happen?\u201d I asked softly. \u201cWhat else goes on at your parties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll kinds of shit happens at parties,\u201d Horse said, sighing heavily. \u201cBut that\u2019s really none of your business. It\u2019s wilder tonight because there\u2019s blood in the air, that\u2019s all. Nobody\u2019s getting hurt and nobody\u2019s here against their will. That\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you done it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, although whether he was denying it or just making it clear I couldn\u2019t expect an answer, I couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>\u201cAre we really gonna do this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig up everything either of us has ever done? I thought we were over that. I\u2019m not a saint, babe, and I\u2019ve never pretended to be. But I promised you that I wouldn\u2019t cheat on you and I haven\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I trust that you won\u2019t either. Isn\u2019t that good enough?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wondering if killing children fell under the category of \u201cnot being a saint\u201d.</p><p>\u201cYou need to write back to Jeff,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cThe faster we work through this the better.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and grabbed my phone. It took about three minutes to type out the message, which he read over before hitting send. It was simple enough\u2014I asked Jeff to call me and told him I was safe with the Reapers but that the Jacks were dangerous. I was afraid of them.</p><p>I set the phone down on the little bedside table. Horse reached over, pulling me to him, kissing me as his fingers reached between my legs. I resisted at first, turning my head away, tensing. He just rubbed up and down, slowly and steadily, as he leaned over and started on my br**sts. He licked at them, sucking my ni**les in and then flicking his tongue until I twisted against him, wanting more even though I despised myself for it.</p><p>Jeff claimed the man was a murderer. Yet when Horse hooked two of his fingers deep inside me I crumbled, spreading my legs and mewling for more, pumping my hips against his fingers. He slid farther down the bed, taking my knees and pushing them up and over his shoulders as his mouth covered my clit. Horse had the tongue of a devil, sliding around my little nub, alternating between teasing it and fluttering, then moving to suck just strong enough to almost hurt me but not quite. The entire time he worked me over inside until I twisted and moaned against him, hovering on the edge of climax.</p><p>That\u2019s when he stuck his finger in my ass.</p><p>He\u2019d been doing this more and more and while I found it startling, I also enjoyed it. In fact, he\u2019d been sticking in two and even three fingers, stretching me and shaping me, usually while he played my clit. Other times he\u2019d put me on my hands and knees, thrusting into me from behind with his c**k in my pu**y and his fingers in my ass. I knew he wanted anal sex. Sometimes he rubbed the head of his c**k against my opening, pressing lightly. He\u2019d always been incredibly careful, but I hadn\u2019t let him stick it in me. To be honest, our sex life was so great I didn\u2019t think it needed much in the way of improvement, and his size scared me a little.</p><p>But there was something different that night. Looking back, I wonder if he sensed just how wrong things were, despite my attempts to reassure him. He worked me over hard with his tongue, making me come three times, leaving me limp and quivering, every muscle in my body loose and pliant. I wasn\u2019t thinking about Jeff or the party or anything other than the sense of completion and sensual satisfaction he gave me. That\u2019s when Horse rolled me onto my stomach, then lifted my hips and pushed a pillow under them. I stayed limp as his hands spread my cheeks, and he pressed lightly against my opening with his finger. It slipped in easily.</p><p>\u201cI want this,\u201d he said softly, leaning over and kissing me between the shoulder blades. \u201cI need to own you. All of you. Make you scream and realize that you belong to me and I belong to you and nothing else matters. I can\u2019t let you slip away from me, babe.\u201d</p><p>A second finger joined the first and I wiggled my hips a little, feeling the stretch and the pressure. He guided his penis into my vagina, sliding in and out, the position perfect for reaching the spongy spot on my inner front wall. His fingers mirrored his penis, rubbing me and stretching me from behind. Then he pulled his fingers out and something cool and wet dripped into my opening. His fingers rubbed the lube in deep, warming it, and then he pulled his c**k free from my body. He fumbled for a minute and I heard the tear of a condom wrapper.</p><p>I stiffened as he placed the head against my rear. I was afraid it would hurt, but he shushed me softly and rubbed the small of my back until I relaxed again. Then he started pushing in very, very slowly. It stretched and pinched, but not nearly as much as I\u2019d imagined it would. It was more pressure than anything else, a strange kind of fullness I\u2019d caught hints of from his fingers. Every few seconds he\u2019d stop, giving me time to grow used to the feeling of him deep inside me. Then he\u2019d push a little more.</p><p>He had to be about halfway in when his hand reached down under the pillow to find my clit. After all he\u2019d done to me, I was incredibly sensitive and he seemed to know that, because he used a light touch to rub it in circles, pushing deeper into my ass until I felt the muscles of his stomach against my bottom. I flexed, trying to accustom myself to this new intruder, and he groaned sharply. I felt him jerk inside me, and I squeezed again.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Horse muttered, starting to rub my clit more quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna kill me, babe.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and then moaned as he started pulling out, which caused a whole new flood of feeling. That started the slow glide of his c**k in and out of my ass. It hurt at first, but it didn\u2019t hurt badly and that little bit of pain was all mixed up with the incredible sensations building in my lower body. He was rock-hard inside me and every time I squeezed him he took his revenge by dragging his rough finger across the swollen tip of my clit.</p><p>The torture was mutual.</p> <p>After an eternity of easing the way, he started moving more quickly in me. Not fast, mind you. He still took care, but this was definitely pumping action, not a slow glide. I found myself twisting under him, seeking my own relief as his fingers played me expertly. My need wound tighter and tighter and I thrust my butt back at him, ready and waiting to go over the edge a final time. Sensing this, he pressed my clit down hard as he seated himself deep within. That tipped me over the edge and shivers swept through me, along with sweet, shuddering relief. He groaned hard and leaned down, biting my shoulder as his c**k surged deep inside, held captive by my clenching ass. That\u2019s when he blew, gasping and panting against my back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He lay on top of me for several minutes, c**k slowly shrinking down, which was a very strange feeling. Then he pulled out and went into the bathroom. I heard the sink running and the toilet flush before he came out and climbed back into the bed. He pulled me into his arms and I lay against him like a limp doll, spent and sore and completely satisfied.</p><p>\u201cThat was incredible, Marie,\u201d he whispered, kissing me deeply. I hardly had the energy to kiss him back and he pulled away, chuckling softly. \u201cSleep, babe.\u201d</p><p>I tucked into him, body exhausted, thought processes long shut down. Sleep was instant and dreamless.</p><p>A phone rang in the early morning darkness. I grunted, pushing at Horse. It kept ringing and finally he moved, reaching over and grabbing it. I whimpered because he\u2019d pulled the covers off me, letting in tendrils of hateful cold.</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d he answered, voice rough and gravelly. He listened for a moment, and then I felt the air in the room change.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he asked, alert now, his voice utterly devoid of emotion. \u201cNo, I hear you. Is someone with Cookie?\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good. It really didn\u2019t sound good. I sat up in bed, pulling the covers across my br**sts. Horse ignored me, utterly focused on the phone call. I felt a twinge in my ass but I ignored it. Last night felt like some surreal dream\u2014a dream I wasn\u2019t ready to remember just yet.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Horse said finally. He dropped the phone down, then rolled away from me and stood up, reaching for his pants. Tension roiled off him, along with waves of anger so powerful it scared me.</p><p>Last night\u2019s lover had left the building.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked, keeping my voice low and calm. He didn\u2019t look at me as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cBagger\u2019s dead,\u201d he said, reaching down for his long-sleeved thermal shirt. Then he grabbed his cut. \u201cDied two days ago, took them awhile to locate his body for confirmation. Cookie\u2019s at the hospital, she collapsed when they told her last night. I\u2019ve got to go. You can call the other girls but don\u2019t leave the armory. We\u2019re still on watch against the Jacks. You got it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, waiting for me to acknowledge his orders. I nodded and he left without another word.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so helpless in my life.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even know Bagger, aside from saying hi to him on Skype a couple of times. I didn\u2019t have a right to mourn him, not like everyone else. But I mourned for Cookie and Silvie, his little girl who cried for her daddy at night and begged to perform for him in front of their webcam with her little stuffed dog. I wanted to do something to help, even if it was something stupid like cleaning her house or cooking. Instead I sat alone in my room and watched a stunning sunrise while everyone I\u2019d come to know and love in Coeur d\u2019Alene suffered.</p> <p>Around nine Horse called me and told me I should go downstairs, find some food. He warned me that the place was a mess and told me that if any of the women gave me shit I could to throw their asses out. Um, right. I needed to stay in the building, other than that I\u2019d be okay. I walked down the stairs cautiously, expecting to see wreckage and evidence of some kind of giant orgy. Instead I found subdued men drinking coffee and a bunch of tired, hungover-looking women. A few of them huddled in a corner, crying. One of them was Serena, the woman I\u2019d seen last night sitting next to Horse. She approached me cautiously, like she expected me to go crazy on her. I didn\u2019t have the energy and it just didn\u2019t seem very important anymore.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d she asked, taking my shoulders and looking at me, clearly checking me over for I don\u2019t know what...injury from Horse\u2019s giant penis? She would know, I thought, feeling morose.</p><p>\u201cNot really, but I should probably eat,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. C\u2019mon, we got donuts over here.\u201d She led me over to a table on the far side of the room, littered with donuts and a couple boxes of coffee to-go from Starbucks.</p><p>\u201cStarbucks? Seriously?\u201d I asked. She shook her head and grimaced.</p><p>\u201cI knew the boys would need something,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cIt\u2019s what was easy. Eat something, hon. It\u2019s gonna be a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Cookie?\u201d I asked. I\u2019d tried to call Em a while ago, but she hadn\u2019t answered and I didn\u2019t want to bother anyone. The last thing they needed was to be worrying about me. But I really wanted to know how she was holding up. I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what she was going through. Serena shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, although not well,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not really the girl they parade in public, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d I asked. Then I bit my tongue, realizing how insensitive that was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have asked that. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she replied, giving me a small, weak smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be one of their old ladies, and despite what you might think, I\u2019ve had more than one opportunity. I like my freedom. I\u2019ve got my place and it\u2019s worked for me. I\u2019m moving on to something new now anyway. But this... This throws me. They always seem so strong, you don\u2019t think of anything being able to kill them, you know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, knowing exactly what she meant. When I\u2019d first met him, I\u2019d half wondered if Horse was a Terminator.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Bagger?\u201d I asked. She nodded, pouring herself a cup of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said without elaborating. \u201cHe was crazy about Cookie, you know. He didn\u2019t cheat on her. Horse isn\u2019t a cheater either. Last night, that wasn\u2019t anything, what you saw with us. We were just talking. I hope you believe that.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, not sure what to believe. Cookie\u2019s life was in ruins and I supposed that at some point I should check my email to see what fresh games Jeff was playing. Things kept hitting so hard and fast I couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she said, shaking my shoulder a little. \u201cWake up, look at me. This is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, trying to make myself focus.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you,\u201d she said, holding my gaze with hers. \u201cI know all about what happened, everyone does. They spread it around, wanted to be sure people know they didn\u2019t give your brother a pass. You\u2019re collateral for him, and all that shit. But the reason you\u2019re really here is that Horse loves you. Do you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what to think about any of this,\u201d I replied. \u201cAll I know is that Cookie is in hell and I can\u2019t do anything for her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can help me get this shithole whipped into shape,\u201d Serena replied sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a funeral, and they\u2019ll have tons of people coming in from out of town. Three states worth of bikers will be here to show their respects. We have to get ready. It\u2019s something you can do for Cookie, she knows Bagger would want a hell of a wake. This is where it\u2019ll happen. We have to get it cleaned up and ready, you up for that?\u201d</p><p>I looked around. She was right. The place needed cleaning in a big way. And we\u2019d need food too. Lots of it. I knew there was a kitchen somewhere on the ground floor, but I wasn\u2019t sure how good it was. Could it handle that many people?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she said, smiling at me. \u201cNice to have you join us this morning. I knew there was a reason Horse shelled out so much for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d I asked, caught off guard.</p> <p>She tilted her head at me, eyes speculative.</p><p>\u201cHorse paid a shitload of money for you, girl,\u201d she said softly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that? Maybe not, that\u2019s not part of the public story...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d I said, eyeing her suspiciously. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle another shock, I really wasn\u2019t. But I needed to know what she meant by that comment.</p><p>\u201cHorse paid the club $50,000 out of his own pocket to give your brother another chance,\u201d she said bluntly. \u201cThey were going to kill him outright, but Horse wanted you for his old lady and he knew how much your brother means to you. He paid the club to give your brother another chance. How do you not know this?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, feeling dizzy.</p> <p>Horse paid the club to save my brother. Horse was a murderer who killed women and children. Horse offered to send me to college, knew how to fight hand to hand and taught me to shoot. Multiple personalities? Two certainly weren\u2019t enough... But I\u2019m a practical girl. I\u2019d spent a good chunk of the past day feeling dazed and confused, but now I had a job.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, pushing all that away. I\u2019d think about it later, like so many other things piling up. \u201cSo how do we want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the girls together in the game room,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out who\u2019s just party leftovers and who\u2019s willing to pitch in and help.\u201d</p><p>Eventually we rounded up about twenty women in various states of undress, a few of the guys watching in interest without interfering. Serena stood up and introduced me as Horse\u2019s old lady, which made all of them sit up a little straighter. Then she looked over toward me, obviously waiting for me to speak. That was a surprise, I thought she\u2019d take the lead but apparently not. Clearly, as the only old lady in the room, I was supposed to be in charge.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it sounds like most of you heard the news,\u201d I said. \u201cBagger is dead, he died in Afghanistan. I didn\u2019t know Bagger, but I know his wife and daughter. Obviously this is a big deal, and if you want to do something to help, I need to get the clubhouse clean and ready for company. I don\u2019t know how much time you have or how much work you can do, but anything is a help. Who can stay and clean?\u201d</p><p>A few raised their hands, but most of them looked away, unwilling to meet my eyes. One, definitely not a girl but a woman, walked over to me.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in charge of getting the guest rooms and studios ready,\u201d she said. She was a tall brunette who looked to be in her early thirties, with tight jeans and a lot of swagger. Unlike the others, she looked sexy but not slutty, which was impressive considering how many were sporting giant raccoon hangover eyes. \u201cA lot of them are full right now, but we\u2019ll need to find room for more people to camp out. Some\u2019ll get hotel rooms, but a lot will stay here. What\u2019s your name? Aside from Horse\u2019s old lady?\u201d</p><p>She offered me a genuine, if sad, smile, and I decided I liked her. This sweet butt situation was more complicated than I\u2019d realized, because obviously they weren\u2019t all brainless sluts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Marie. What\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Claire,\u201d she replied, holding out her hand for me to shake. Her grip was firm and reassuring. \u201cI\u2019ve been a friend of the club since high school but I\u2019m not with any of the guys. Just came by last night to see some friends from out of town, you know how that is.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, not quite sure what she meant and not too worried about it. Her obvious respect surprised me, although I was starting to realize it shouldn\u2019t have. There seemed to be a hierarchy of Reaper women, with old ladies at the top, but right now I didn\u2019t care what their status was if they\u2019d help me get the armory ready for Bagger\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to meet you,\u201d she said, genuine kindness in her eyes, tempered with a fatigue that had nothing to do with being hung over. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this done, don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t take shit from anyone, okay? You\u2019re an old lady, and not one of these girls has a right to tell you a damn thing. Not even me,\u201d she added ruefully. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t mind, I think some asses could use a little kicking and that\u2019s one of my favorite things to do. You mind?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Serena.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d she said. \u201cShe takes the upstairs, I\u2019ll take the main floor and you can coordinate food. Sound like a plan?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d I said, feeling grateful.</p><p>Claire turned the group and clapped her hands for attention.</p><p>\u201cYou heard Marie,\u201d she said loudly. \u201cShe\u2019s nice and polite, but I\u2019m not. Get off your asses and get working, or get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>Nobody moved for a minute, and she put her hands on her hips and glared around the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, bitches!\u201d she yelled, and I believed her. \u201cIf you\u2019re a friend of the club, now\u2019s the time to show it. Otherwise get the f**k out and don\u2019t come back. You won\u2019t be welcome. Got me?\u201d</p><p>About four girls got up and left quickly, but the rest seemed to break out of their stupor, sorting themselves out quickly enough and breaking into teams. Within minutes half had followed Claire upstairs and most of the others followed Serena downstairs. I found myself alone with a woman I recognized with horror\u2014she\u2019d been the one on the second floor, screwing an entire room full of men.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Candace,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m a caterer. Can I help you get the food situation figured out? I know my way around the kitchen and have a pretty good idea what to expect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled at me like a perfectly normal person, rather than a woman who\u2019d had sex with five men in a row the night before. How could she even walk? I shook my head, and she gave me a quizzical look. Of course, she didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d seen her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that sounds good,\u201d I said, and we started downstairs. She led me through the lounge to the far end of the building, where double doors opened to reveal a dining room with a serving bar separating it from a kitchen. Not a full-on, modern industrial one, more like the kind you\u2019d find in a church. Several big fridges, big dishwasher, that kind of thing. Empty platters and bags of chips littered the counters, debris from the night before, I assumed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of parties for them,\u201d she said, flipping on lights and going to the fridges, opening them and checking out the contents. \u201cI give them a deal, they take good care of me. A few years ago my ex decided to use me as a punching bag. I knew one of the girls who likes to party here and she passed the word along to Ruger. He and a couple others offered to take care of the problem for me in exchange for some help in the armory kitchen and things grew from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse beat up my ex,\u201d I said, feeling a sudden sense of sisterhood with her.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a relief when it stops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she replied, with a sad little smile. She started grabbing food wrappers and tossing them in a big plastic garbage can. \u201cHe\u2019s a real good guy. You\u2019re lucky to have him.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not sure I wanted to go there. Everyone seemed to think he was so great\u2014did they know the real man? Did I? I felt my phone vibrate and I pulled it out to find a text from Em. Cookie is home again. They gave her some drugs to help her sleep. Maggs asked if you can stay on top of things at the armory, some of us will be over in a couple hours to help. ((Hugs))</p><p>Already on it, I sent back, relieved I could tell her something positive, no matter how small. Candace and I finished cleaning up and sat down to plan food for the day. Then I sent her to the grocery store with my debit card, which still had about five hundred dollars on it and another hundred in cash. I was torn about that\u2014if I had to get away, I\u2019d need the money. But I wanted to help, and the realization that Horse had already spent fifty grand on me still floated around in the back of my head, waiting to be processed.</p><p>It seemed like the least I could do.</p><p>By the time Horse took my hand and pulled me upstairs to bed that night I was exhausted. The day had been endless, a blur of people crying, yelling and worst of all, just sitting in silence and staring into nothing.</p> <p>Candace had been amazing. She\u2019d gone from gangbang hoochie to kitchen goddess apparently without need for transition. Around noon she came back with a ton of food, so much I couldn\u2019t imagine we\u2019d go through it all yet it disappeared almost entirely by the end of the day. The party girls worked hard to clean the armory before melting away when the old ladies started showing up\u2014a club dynamic I still couldn\u2019t wrap my head around. Surprisingly, Serena and Candace stayed. They kept to themselves back in the kitchen, but every time I turned around they were quietly serving people, bringing them drinks or food, helping the few remaining guests find a place to sleep.</p><p>Most of the visiting charter members left, although I got the impression they\u2019d be returning for the funeral. At one point Horse cornered me and told me that the situation with the Jacks was under control, but that I\u2019d still need to stay in the armory.</p><p>We waited for news on Bagger\u2019s body.</p><p>Cookie stayed at her house, but Maggs brought Silvie over after her nap. I took her up to the game room and we played for a couple of hours and ate dinner together. I gave her a bath in our room and dressed her in jammies before Maggs took her back home. The poor girl didn\u2019t have a clue what was really going on but she obviously felt the tension in the air.</p><p>Now Horse and I were finally alone in our room and I wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Some of the guys had been visibly broken up, while others were stoic. Horse was just blank. Nothing. No concern, no sorrow, nada. He\u2019d found me a few times during the day, asking if I\u2019d heard from Jeff. I hadn\u2019t, from either email account, which made things easier. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could pull off a lie tonight. I watched as he stripped down to his boxers mechanically, then sat down on the side of the bed. He leaned forward, elbows on knees, just looking toward the window. I went to use the bathroom and get ready for bed. When I got back he hadn\u2019t moved. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad over there,\u201d he said softly. I went and stood in front of him, reaching down to run my fingers through his soft, silky hair. I didn\u2019t know where this was going, but I wanted to be close to him, absorb some of his pain. \u201cYou have no idea, nobody does. They\u2019re crazy, they kill little kids and women and entire families. Every day, Marie. At one point my team set up shop in some town and there were these two boys who liked to come and play with us. Probably about ten years old. They were cute and we liked them, would kick a soccer ball around with them, give them candy, that kind of shit. It was my buddy\u2019s ball, but we let the kids take it home, figured they\u2019d enjoy it more than us. Just a ball. One day only one of them came back, threw the ball at us and he took off running. We found out later his friend and his mom were shot in the street for being friends with the Americans. It was just a ball, babe, and he died for it and because we gave him candy. That\u2019s so f**ked up. And shit like that happened all the time. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many civilians are dying over there.\u201d</p> <p>I massaged his scalp, feeling the tension tying him in knots with every touch. I wanted to ask him about the article but I couldn\u2019t do it. Words seemed so incredibly trite compared to the pain that radiated off him.</p><p>\u201cAnother time we found an entire village massacred,\u201d he said, voice rough. \u201cWhole damn place shot to hell. Kids. Women. Men. Fucking donkeys. Goats. All of them dead, houses burning, you name it. You know what\u2019s totally f**ked up? We go in there and find this, call it in, but the next day we\u2019re the bastards under investigation. Apparently there\u2019s all kinds of people saying we did it. You know how f**ked that is? You go to a country, you try to help the people there and they spend all their time and energy either trying to kill you or set you up.\u201d</p><p>I stilled, wondering if I could believe him. Horse had no reason to tell me about this. Not unless he\u2019d found my email account. But I\u2019d been careful, really careful, clearing out my phone\u2019s cache and cookies and browsing history. I\u2019d never put the address into my email app, I only checked it on the website. Could he trace that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you know how insane this is? Bagger just died for this country in a war that\u2019s gone on for ten f**king years, and people around here think they\u2019re suffering if they can\u2019t afford a new iPhone,\u201d he said, looking up at me for the first time. The stark grief written all over his face tore through me and that\u2019s when I knew. It wasn\u2019t fake. Not this. Jeff was wrong about him. Horse might be many things, but he didn\u2019t kill those people. The article said Marines were under investigation, but it didn\u2019t say how the investigation ended. Even Jeff acknowledged Horse had an honorable discharge.</p><p>Horse didn\u2019t kill those people. I knew it in my bones.</p><p>I felt such incredible relief that I trembled with it, but I didn\u2019t say anything. Whatever else happened, I would protect Jeff. But that didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d give up on what I had with Horse. There had to be a way to walk the line between the two men I loved. I just had to find it. Horse leaned forward, pressing his head into my stomach, shuddering. His arms wrapped around my hips and he pulled me forward between his legs. I have no idea how long we sat there but it seemed like forever. He didn\u2019t talk, just held me, shaking, as his grief poured out.</p><p>Finally the shudders eased and he pulled back. I looked down at him, running my fingers across the lines of his face, feeling the softness of his lips with my thumb. He reached up and caught my hand, tugging it to his mouth, kissing my palm. Heat flared in his eyes and he fell back on the bed, drawing me down to him.</p> <p>We\u2019d made love so many different ways in our time together. Urgent, slow, angry and laughing\u2014but never like this. He held me like his life depended on it, hands digging into my hips and spreading my legs across his body as his hips ground up into mine urgently. I took his head between my hands and kissed him, long and deep, full of pain for his suffering and relief so intense I thought my heart might explode. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d doubted him. I knew he was a violent man living a violent life. But what he\u2019d told me, the way he suffered\u2014that wasn\u2019t a lie.</p><p>His c**k pressed into me, long and hard as I rubbed myself across it. I wore a tee and panties and all he had on were boxers, but that was way too much. I wanted to be naked so I could take him deep into my body, give him my love until the sadness in his eyes changed to something else. Instead we ground against each other, too desperate for sensation to stop long enough to pull off our clothes. I let his lips go, put my hands on either side of his head and arched my head back, maximizing the pressure between us.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d he gasped, hands digging into my ass so hard it hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it. I\u2019ll take whatever you have. I never want it to stop.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him, focusing now on the pressure and need growing between my legs. Everything in my body wound tight and I realized I might come dry humping him like a teenager in the back of a car\u2014that\u2019s how much his body called to mine. I ground harder, feeling it just beyond me, and then it burst and I moaned, shuddering over him.</p><p>I rolled off, reaching down to slide off my panties. Horse shoved down his boxers just enough to free his cock, which sprang up long and hard between us. He reached toward me, obviously planning to pull me on top of him, but I stopped him. Instead I leaned over his lower body, wrapping my lips around his erection and sucking him in deep.</p> <p>He shuddered, wrapping the fingers of one hand in my hair as I swirled my tongue around his head and started stroking him with my hand down below. I couldn\u2019t fix anything for him. I couldn\u2019t bring back Bagger or change what had gone down overseas. But I could make him forget for a little while and I didn\u2019t plan to do it halfway.</p><p>I sucked him and licked him, pulling away every once in a while to attack his balls with my mouth, drawing them in and rolling them around my tongue. Then I got creative, sliding one of my fingers up into his ass as I suctioned hard, squeezing and stroking him with my fingers until he groaned and twisted underneath me, captured and desperate for release. He tugged at my hair, trying to pull me away, but I wouldn\u2019t let him. Instead I held him captive with my fingers and mouth, swallowing triumphantly when he exploded into me, hips jerking and trembling.</p><p>When he finished I pulled away and sat up, wiping my mouth off with the back of my hand. He smiled up at me, and while he still looked sad, his terrible tension had eased.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said softly, reaching up and tracing the line of my lips.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m going to brush my teeth. No offense, okay?\u201d</p><p>He gave a low chuckle and nodded. When I came back to bed I found him naked. He pulled me close into the crook of his arm, bringing my leg up and over his. I felt peace. Nothing could undo what had happened, either to him or Bagger, but for tonight he could sleep.</p> <p>I felt like a very, very good old lady.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The morning of the funeral was cold. I wondered how much of it was the temperature and how much was the cloud of wrongness and grief hanging over all of us. Bagger hadn\u2019t been a religious man but Cookie had asked a biker chaplain from Spokane to come over and do a graveside service. It would start with a viewing at the funeral home, followed by a procession to the cemetery for the interment.</p><p>Maggs and Darcy took charge of making arrangements because Cookie couldn\u2019t handle the details. Her in-laws, who didn\u2019t live locally, were elderly and utterly devastated. They were pathetically grateful for the support, unable to think of anything but their lost son. That\u2019s why the night before the service, the women of the club held a strategy session at the armory. Apparently Cookie was particularly worried about Silvie coming to the cemetery. It would be cold and she\u2019d started acting out, probably from all the tension and grief in the air. She still didn\u2019t understand what had happened to her daddy, and would carry the laptop to any adult she could find so she could talk to him online.</p><p>Cookie asked me\u2014as Silvie\u2019s favorite babysitter\u2014if I\u2019d help watch her at the service. If Silvie couldn\u2019t handle things, she wanted me to take her back to the armory rather than subject her daughter to something she couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend. Of course I said yes, so the morning of the funeral Maggs parked my car around the back side of the cemetery. That way if Silvie needed me, I could take her and leave quickly and unobtrusively. Horse didn\u2019t like the idea but even he had to admit that the Devil\u2019s Jacks wouldn\u2019t dare disrupt the funeral. Not with a hundred Reapers watching, not to mention half the veterans in north Idaho. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hadn\u2019t left the clubhouse all week but Em had been my lifeline. She even bought me a black dress to wear, and that morning I rode to the funeral home with her. The men followed us on their bikes, which had to be incredibly uncomfortable in the bitter cold. Nobody complained.</p><p>Driving motorcycles in a winter funeral procession didn\u2019t seem that sensible to me, but apparently that\u2019s the way things were done at a biker\u2019s funeral. Maggs had warned me, but I was still stunned to see hundreds of motorcycles parked outside the funeral home. Not only Reapers, but the Silver Bastards and a bunch of other clubs I\u2019d never heard of. There were men who weren\u2019t part of any club too, and vets flying MIA/POW flags off the backs of their Harleys. Even more of the riders had American flags. There was no way this many people could fit inside the funeral home for the viewing but nobody seemed to mind. Maggs took me inside and I watched as more people arrived, waiting patiently in the cold, talking to each other quietly in small clumps. Some of them stuck what looked like bumper stickers on the casket, which freaked me out at first. Then I realized they were Reapers support badges and nobody seemed to have a problem with it. I saw Cookie and managed to go up to her to offer my respects. She smiled at me but I don\u2019t think she even recognized me. Silvie did, though, and I picked her up and carried her around. She loved it and I lavished attention on her.</p><p>Then it was time to pile into the cars for the procession. I walked Silvie over to Cookie, who seemed completely disconnected from reality. Couldn\u2019t blame her for that. When her mother-in-law tried to take her granddaughter from me, the little girl started crying and clung to me, kicking.</p><p>\u201cCome with us,\u201d Cookie said suddenly, as if she\u2019d been startled awake. \u201cWhatever makes her happy. Please take care of her for me, I need your help.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s how I wound up riding in the limo with the family, right behind the hearse. It felt so wrong, so presumptuous, but it made Silvie happy and Cookie certainly wasn\u2019t up to handling her. We drove slowly through town and I was astounded at the show of support and respect. I guess I\u2019d been cut off from events out at the armory, but I honestly hadn\u2019t realized just how big Bagger\u2019s funeral procession would be. This wasn\u2019t just the club, or even a group of clubs. The whole town was stepping up to honor Bagger for his sacrifice.</p><p>It started with six police cars, driving two abreast with their lights flashing. The Reapers weren\u2019t big cop fans, but Bagger\u2019s dad had wanted to accept their offer of an escort so no one complained. Then came the hearse and the family in three limos, followed by the indescribable roar of hundreds of bikes. We drove right down Sherman Avenue and instead of having us avoid the main roads like a typical funeral procession, they closed off the streets in his honor. People lined the curbs to pay their respects, standing at attention as we drove by. Many held American flags and handmade signs saying things like \u201cThank You\u201d and \u201cWe Will Not Forget\u201d.</p><p>Cookie watched them with dead eyes while Silvie pressed her little face to the glass, fascinated. When we finally arrived at the cemetery, the limo stopped and we got out. The Reapers came behind us, more of them than I\u2019d ever seen. It seemed like hundreds, although I learned later there were about a hundred and twenty-five. Behind them rode other clubs and veterans\u2019 groups, followed by an endless line of cars. There were also active-duty servicemen in dress uniforms and even the local high school marching band, wearing poorly fitted black suits instead of their usual flamboyant regalia. It took nearly an hour before everyone could park, so we made Cookie get back into the car to wait. I climbed into another limo with Silvie and let her play on my phone.</p><p>Finally everyone had arrived and we congregated around the gravesite. Once again, I felt like I was far too close to the front for a woman who\u2019d never met Bagger. So many people had known and loved him. But Silvie wanted me so I stood to one side of Cookie\u2019s chair, bouncing her in my arms. The service was a strange mix of military formality and biker tradition. Instead of the Marine honor guard serving as pallbearers, Cookie had requested Horse, Ruger, Picnic, Duck and Bam Bam. They carefully carried the flag-draped coffin from the hearse to the grave. There were three on one side and only two on the other, something I\u2019d never seen at a funeral before.</p><p>\u201cCookie wanted them to leave a spot open for Bolt,\u201d Maggs whispered next to me, choking up a little. I felt my own eyes tear up, amazed that even in the depths of her grief, Bagger\u2019s wife would remember Bolt and honor his friendship with her husband. Once the coffin was settled, the preacher spoke and so did some of the guys from the club. The band played the Star Spangled Banner.</p> <p>Then the military honors began.</p><p>A group of ten young Marines in full dress uniform had been standing patiently off to the side during the service. Their commander called them to attention and gave out a series of orders. Then seven of them raised rifles and shot three perfectly timed volleys in unison. The sound split the air like thunder, so loud it rattled off the hills. Cookie shuddered at every shot like they were firing right through her. Silvie squealed as I covered her little ears.</p><p>One of the remaining Marines raised a bugle to his lips and played Taps, the haunting song echoing through the eerie silence of the cemetery. Silvie squirmed in my arms and started to fuss. The commander and remaining man walked carefully over to the coffin and lifted the flag, stepping to the side and away from the casket, folding it carefully into a star-spangled, blue triangle.</p><p>Finally, when it was perfect, the commander walked forward to Cookie and leaned forward to present her with the flag, voice carrying in the cold, still air.</p><p>\u201cOn behalf of the president of the United States, the commandant of the Marine Corps and a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one\u2019s service to country and corps.\u201d</p><p>Cookie took the flag and cradled it against her chest, utterly silent, as Bagger\u2019s mother sobbed loudly. Silvie crumpled up her face and started crying too, and I decided she\u2019d had enough. I made my way to the back of the crowd and walked across the frosted grass quickly, which seemed to distract the little girl. I put her in the car seat now permanently installed in my vehicle and sat down to turn on the engine and get the heater going. A knock on the window startled me and I gave a little scream, which made Silvie burst into tears again.</p> <p>Max stood outside.</p><p>I wanted to hit the gas and run him over. Instead I lowered the window a crack and glared at him.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to get Silvie out of here,\u201d I said, filling my tone with ice.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I\u2019m really sorry about what happened. What I did to you was out of line, so out of line, and there\u2019s nothing I can do or say to make up for that. But I\u2019m worried about you leaving by yourself. I just got a text from a friend who says he saw four of the Devil\u2019s Jacks eating at Zip\u2019s. There\u2019s only one reason they\u2019re in town and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be safe if you leave by yourself. Let me make sure you and Silvie get back to the armory okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the last person I\u2019d trust,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied, face full of remorse that seemed real, but who could tell? \u201cI deserve that. But Horse shouldn\u2019t have to leave right now. If he had any idea the Jacks are already in town he\u2019d be with you right now. But think about this\u2014with the way everyone\u2019s on edge, things could get pretty ugly if there\u2019s a confrontation. Horse isn\u2019t in a good place.\u201d</p> <p>He made a good point.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want Horse to wind up in jail. I didn\u2019t want any of them in jail and I definitely didn\u2019t want Bagger\u2019s funeral to turn into a debacle.</p><p>\u201cLet me drive home with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my hands to myself and my mouth shut. Email Horse right now, so if I pull something he\u2019ll know we\u2019re together. Then text him as soon as we get there, once the service is over. That should make you feel safer. Please, if you won\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for Silvie. If they spot you, they\u2019ll move in and they\u2019ll take her too. I can\u2019t let that happen to Bagger\u2019s kid. It\u2019s one last thing I can do for him.\u201d</p><p>That convinced me. Max was right\u2014whatever was between us, Silvie needed to be safe and I really didn\u2019t want to pull Horse away from the funeral. I might loathe Max, but he was loyal to the club. Horse hated him too, but he\u2019d told me time and again that he\u2019d trust any of the Reapers with his life. Max was still one of his brothers, and the only thing that scared me more than the thought of the Jacks catching me was the thought of them hurting Silvie. Even Max at his worst would be better than that.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car,\u201d I said, sighing. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me or touch me.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and walked around to the passenger\u2019s side, sliding in as I sent Horse a quick email. The fact that he didn\u2019t reach for the car keys impressed me\u2014Horse never let me drive, and based on what the other girls said it was a common bone of contention. Reapers liked to be in control. I turned on the radio and drove straight to the armory. Max kept his word. No talking, no touching, nothing until I turned the car off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you in and make sure the prospects are on top of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I\u2019m going back to talk with Picnic and the guys, give them a heads-up. Nobody will want to leave the reception or party but we need to be aware. Don\u2019t go outside, okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, still feeling nervous when he looked at me. I\u2019d never feel safe around that man. We walked inside to find Painter and a couple other prospects from different charters hanging around. Painter didn\u2019t look too thrilled when he glanced from me to Max, but I caught his eye and flashed him a quick thumbs-up. Then I took Silvie into the kitchen for a sandwich. While she tucked in her food, I texted Horse and let him know where I was and that Max had escorted me without incident. He didn\u2019t respond, which wasn\u2019t a surprise. I took Silvie up to my room and laid her down for a nap, thankful that I\u2019d been able to help and bemused that Max had proven capable of decency.</p><p>Dancer came and took Silvie to a family friend\u2019s house around seven that evening. People had been pouring into the armory for hours by then. Cookie pulled herself together enough to eat dinner with her daughter and read her stories before Silvie left. I went to find Horse and see how he was holding up.</p><p>I found him outside around yet another bonfire, with a mixed group of Reapers, Silver Bastards and family members. Like most wakes, it started off somber enough but was growing louder as people shared beer and stories. I came up behind him and wrapped my arms around his stomach, resting my face against his back. After a while he pulled me around to his front, draping his arms over my shoulder and leaning down to whisper in my ear.</p><p>\u201cThanks for everything today, babe,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to ride with Max. You made the right call though. We\u2019ve spotted the Jacks a couple of times, they\u2019re definitely planning something. It\u2019ll be good to finish this out.\u201d</p> <p>I leaned back against him, drinking in his warmth and thinking about going back home together. I was tired of the armory. I just hoped they managed to get rid of the Jacks without hurting Jeff...</p><p>\u201cWill it be dangerous?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot if we do it right,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not stupid and this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had to protect what\u2019s ours. Don\u2019t worry about it, babe. Tonight\u2019s about Bagger.\u201d</p><p>After a while I got cold, so I went inside to find Maggs and a bunch of women I didn\u2019t know standing around the kitchen\u2019s center island, passing a bottle of Jack Daniels. I didn\u2019t feel much like drinking, but I joined the circle when Maggs waved me over. I was learning that the sisterhood of biker babes was bigger than I\u2019d grasped. I saw respect and welcome in their eyes when she introduced me as Horse\u2019s property, and for the first time the word didn\u2019t bother me. It just meant something different to us than it did in the civilian world.</p><p>Us.</p><p>I was part of \u201cus\u201d now, I realized. These were my sisters, Horse was my man, and I could trust all the guys to keep an eye out for me, even Max. I still loathed him and he made my skin crawl, but he\u2019d been watching out for me and Silvie in his own weird way today. It\u2019d always been me and Mama and Jeff against the world\u2014it felt good to have more.</p><p>An air horn sounded at nine, calling everyone outside to the bonfire. I followed the girls and found Horse again, tucking myself into his arms to keep warm as Picnic stepped out in front of everyone, solemn. Cookie stood not far away, flanked by Maggs and Dancer. She looked unsteady but determined. She still wore her black dress, but she\u2019d put her \u201cproperty\u201d vest on over it, trading her heels for black leather boots.</p><p>\u201cTonight we say goodbye to a brother and a friend,\u201d Picnic said, his voice hoarse. \u201cHe truly understood that brotherhood is forever and that no matter what happens in this life, a real man never walks away before the fight is finished. No matter what, we stand together. He gave his life standing with his brothers in Afghanistan and we\u2019ll respect him for the rest of our lives.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBagger wore the Reapers\u2019 patch for ten years and always brought it honor. When he left for his last deployment, he gave his colors to me to keep safe. He\u2019s Freebird chapter now and he doesn\u2019t need his patches anymore. It\u2019s time to send them back to him. We won\u2019t forget. Reapers forever, forever Reapers.\u201d</p><p>A lot of the guys, including Horse, echoed his words like a mantra. Then everyone grew silent and the opening strains of Lynyrd Skynyrd\u2019s Free Bird started playing. Picnic stepped forward, holding up Bagger\u2019s cut for all of us to see. He\u2019d almost reached the fire when Cookie cried out.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d she said, pulling away from Maggs. \u201cWait for me. Mine\u2019s going with his. They belong together.\u201d</p><p>I watched as she shrugged out of her \u201cProperty of Bagger, Reapers MC\u201d vest and draped it over Bagger\u2019s cut.</p> <p>\u201cThey go together,\u201d she said again, voice breaking. Picnic shook his head and Maggs came up to her, taking her arm.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou aren\u2019t thinking straight tonight. Bagger would want you to keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt belongs with his,\u201d Cookie replied, her voice fierce. She and Picnic stared each other down for a minute as the song played, then he jerked his head once in acquiescence. Cookie sighed in relief and let Maggs pull her away, unsteady on her feet again, as if she\u2019d used up all her energy on this final chore. The song soared around us as Picnic threw the two sets of patched leathers into the fire. All around me I heard women sniffling. Men blinked quickly, their eyes suspiciously moist. All too soon the song ended and the leather cuts were lost in the flame.</p><p>It was official. Bagger had left the Reapers behind.</p><p>I stood in the bathroom off the game room an hour later, fiddling with my hair and wishing I could leave. Horse needed space and wanted to be with his brothers. The women were friendly but I didn\u2019t know most of them and I didn\u2019t want to intrude on their grief. The toilet flushed behind me and Cookie stepped out of the stall.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, not sure what to say. I didn\u2019t want to ask her how she felt or offer some empty platitude.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, washing her hands. She looked in the mirror and then glanced at the door. She took a deep breath and touched my arm.</p><p>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d she said, her voice matter-of-fact. \u201cCan you take me home? Everyone\u2019s drunk and I can\u2019t find anyone to drive me. Are you sober? You look sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, startled. \u201cYou really want to leave? Everyone\u2019s here for you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to go right now,\u201d she said, shaking her head with unnatural composure. \u201cI\u2019m holding on by a thread and if I have to listen to his name or any more stories I\u2019m going to fall apart and I don\u2019t want an audience. Not only that, they all say I shouldn\u2019t be alone tonight and probably won\u2019t let me leave. That\u2019s not working for me. I\u2019m not going to do anything stupid, but I can\u2019t handle listening to a party when all I can think about is my husband lying cold and dead in the ground a mile from my house. Will you take me home?\u201d</p><p>There was only one answer to a statement like that.</p> <p>\u201cLet me get my purse. I\u2019ll meet you out front.\u201d</p><p>I ran upstairs and grabbed my things, trying to decide whether I should tell Horse. The Jacks were out, I knew that. But Horse needed his mourning time and I didn\u2019t want to take it away from him. Maybe I could find a prospect to go with us. Painter stood outside with a few other guys, but when I went up and asked him to drive home with me and Cookie, he said he needed to check with Picnic. Cookie paced nervously by my car and I could see her starting to visibly fall apart. What if Picnic didn\u2019t want her to leave? Then Max walked around the corner and I made a snap decision.</p><p>\u201cAre you sober?\u201d I asked him. He stopped, obviously startled.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah, I am,\u201d he replied. \u201cWanted to be alert if the Jacks showed up. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCookie needs to go home and I\u2019m taking her,\u201d I said, putting my cards on the table. \u201cI asked Painter to ride with us but he said he had to check with Picnic first, and Picnic might not let her leave. We have to get out of here now. Will you come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, and we all got into the car, Cookie taking the backseat. During the drive my phone started ringing, Horse and Picnic both, so I let it go to voicemail. I\u2019d deal with the fallout after I got Cookie home. None of us spoke on the way to her house and when we pulled up, she paused only long enough to thank us before heading inside.</p><p>\u201cYou think she\u2019ll be safe?\u201d I asked Max. \u201cI mean, from the Jacks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t bother her,\u201d he replied. \u201cNot a war widow, not with this many guys in town. They go after her, even their own support clubs could turn on them. She\u2019s untouchable. You aren\u2019t though. We should get back.\u201d</p> <p>My phone rang and I grabbed it, wanting to reassure Horse.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie, it\u2019s Jeff.\u201d</p><p>I stilled, eyes darting toward Max.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d I replied, keeping my tone friendly and casual. \u201cJust a sec.\u201d</p><p>I stepped out of the car and closed the door, strolling a few feet down the street in front so Max could see me without hearing me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing calling me?\u201d I demanded. \u201cYou were supposed to email. What if someone else had answered? It\u2019s after midnight, what if I\u2019d been in bed with Horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Jeff replied. \u201cI know there\u2019s a wake at the armory. Are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I had to give someone a ride home,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cHow did you find out about the wake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know everything they do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got things all set up now, it\u2019s time for us to go. I want you to meet me out at Horse\u2019s place. I\u2019m in the barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cYou need to get your ass out here so we can go. We\u2019ll talk while we drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone. Max is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLose him,\u201d Jeff snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d I replied. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about the Jacks. He isn\u2019t going to just hop out of the car. Jeff, you need to know I\u2019m not going with you. I\u2019m with Horse and I\u2019m going to stay with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re brainwashed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I told you, Horse isn\u2019t who you think he is. I have proof, I\u2019ll show you. Everyone\u2019s busy, they won\u2019t have a clue until it\u2019s too late. At least come and see what I\u2019ve found. If you still want to stay after that I\u2019ll call off the Jacks and leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring him,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cTell him you need something in the house, ask him to come with you. I\u2019ve got a gun. We can tie him up while we talk, lock him in the tack room. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>I felt my stomach sink.</p><p>\u201cThis is a really bad idea, Jeff,\u201d I said softly. \u201cThink it through. What if it doesn\u2019t work? He could kill you. You need to stop doing crazy things and deal with this situation in a way that doesn\u2019t make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so damned naive,\u201d he muttered, frustration clear in his voice. \u201cMax is a violent criminal, all the Reapers are. You need to stop protecting them and think about your family. Now get your ass out here.\u201d</p><p>He hung up on me. I turned back to the car, pasting a fake smile on my face for Max\u2019s benefit. No way I would be bringing him out to Horse\u2019s place. Jeff had lost his mind. But I still wanted to talk to him and see if we could figure something less crazy out together. I also wanted to look at this proof he kept talking about. There had to be an explanation.</p><p>\u201cThat was Maggs,\u201d I said, climbing back into the car. \u201cShe wants us to stop by the grocery store and pick up some garbage bags. I guess they\u2019ve run out and things are getting ugly. Let\u2019s swing into Safeway, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said and I kept my eyes forward, counting every breath as I drove to the store. As we pulled into the parking lot I chose my spot carefully, then stopped the car. Max got out and as soon as he shut the door I clicked the locks and hit the gas.</p><p>My phone rang at least fifteen times during my drive to the farm. I had no doubt that Max had called Horse within seconds of my little stunt, and Horse was mighty pissed.</p><p>I\u2019d deal with that later.</p><p>Still, I didn\u2019t want him to worry about me more than he needed to, so after I pulled up I sent him a quick text saying that things were all right but that my brother had called and I needed some privacy to call him back. Then I silenced the phone, planning to ignore his response.</p><p>The fallout from this was gonna suck, no question.</p><p>I grabbed my purse and walked toward the barn. No sign of Jeff. No sign of Ariel either, which made me really nervous. I pushed through the open door, noting the broken lock. Horse wasn\u2019t going to like that either, I thought, biting back a hysterical giggle. Poor man would have a heart attack before the night was over at this rate. Jeff grabbed me as soon as I walked into the barn, pulling me to the side of the door with one hand and waving a gun around in the other. All of Horse\u2019s training must have sunk in, because I hit the ground automatically as the barrel swung toward me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t point that at me!\u201d I hissed, and Jeff glanced down at the gun, startled.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you come by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, standing up and dusting off my knees. \u201cBut they were lighting up my phone on the drive out here. We don\u2019t have a lot of time. What\u2019s the proof you were talking about?\u201d</p><p>Jeff walked over to a work bench and pulled out a folder. I flipped it open and saw several articles about the massacre from different news outlets. None of them had any information I hadn\u2019t seen already.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking,\u201d Jeff said. I flipped further, finding a copy of Horse\u2019s discharge papers. Honorable. I found a memo stating that his unit was being cleared of charges based on a lack of evidence. Another newspaper article followed, this one stating that the killers had never been found and now several key witnesses had disappeared. That was it.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d Jeff asked. \u201cIt\u2019s right there. Now do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t say he did anything,\u201d I replied softly. \u201cIt just says they never figured out who did it. Sometimes that happens during war, Jeff, especially in areas with competing guerrilla groups. This doesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, clearly frustrated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a conspiracy, you have to read between the lines,\u201d he said. \u201cThe witnesses disappeared. Why do you think that happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because they were afraid they\u2019d get murdered if they collaborated,\u201d I replied, shaking my head. \u201cJeff, forget about this. You need call off the Jacks and stop working with them. Then you need to disappear. Otherwise I\u2019m afraid the Reapers will kill you. I love you so much\u2014I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>Jeff\u2019s face softened, and I saw a trace of the laid-back, loving brother he\u2019d been most of my life. He pulled me into his arms but he didn\u2019t feel right to me. His heart raced, he\u2019d gotten far too thin and I felt and smelled clammy sweat coming off him. I pulled back and looked into his face, feeling indescribably sad.</p><p>\u201cJeff, what are you doing to yourself?\u201d I asked. His features hardened and he jerked away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to take care of my family,\u201d he snapped. Outside I heard the roar of bikes and I froze.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, they\u2019re gonna kill you,\u201d I said, panicking. I started looking around, trying to find somewhere to hide him, which was ludicrous. The barn door flew open and banged against the wall. It was Horse and Max, holding guns. They froze as Jeff grabbed me and held his own weapon to my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, sis,\u201d he whispered in my ear. \u201cI would never hurt you. I just need to get out of this so we can start over somewhere else. It\u2019s going to be great, you won\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201d</p><p>Oh f**k.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Horse</p><p>Horse saw red when he saw the gun at Marie\u2019s head. Jensen stood next to her, trembling so hard he thought it might be enough to pull the trigger. The man was obviously tweaking hard on something, probably meth. Very bad news. Might even be hallucinating. It took everything he had not to charge Jensen and kill him with his bare hands, but he had to be smart.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Max said, sounding a little too casual. Horse glanced over at him and caught his play. \u201cWe\u2019re just here to make sure Marie\u2019s all right. We were afraid the Jacks got her. We know you love her and would never hurt her so let\u2019s talk this through. Win/win, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeff laughed, the tone high-pitched and more than a little crazed.</p><p>\u201cI showed her the evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows all about what you did in Afghanistan to those kids. And now you\u2019re going to die for what you did to her.\u201d</p><p>Horse ignored his words, focusing on reading his tone and body language. No clear shot, obviously. How could he get to her? He\u2019d been in tighter situations but never with so much at stake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put down my gun,\u201d he said, setting the gun very slowly and carefully on the floor. Then he held his hands up, showing Jeff they were empty. \u201cMax will do the same. Then you can take the gun away from her head. I don\u2019t want any accidents. We\u2019ll let you get in her car and go, sound good?\u201d</p> <p>Jensen laughed again, something new and ugly on his face...honest glee, with a hint of gloating.</p><p>\u201cI want you out in the center of the floor,\u201d he said. \u201cNo tricks.\u201d</p><p>Horse stepped forward, hands up. The gun trembled in Jensen\u2019s hand as he pulled Marie backward, deeper into the barn\u2019s open central floor. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cYour turn,\u201d he added, looking at Max now. Horse heard Max shuffle behind him and then Marie\u2019s eyes went wide. She opened her mouth and screamed at him as a bullet tore through his back, pain exploding as his vision started going dark.</p><p>He hit the floor, seeing his blood flowing out onto the ground next to him. He couldn\u2019t move but he could feel, the pain beyond anything he could have imagined. This is how Bagger went, he realized. Alone in a pool of blood, knowing that he failed his woman. Then he stopped thinking and everything stopped.</p> <p>Marie</p><p>Horse hit the floor and my world ended. I think some part of me had doubted whether our love was real. Not anymore. I hardly noticed as Jeff let me go, I just ran over to Horse and felt his neck for a pulse. It was there, and while the blood was pooling beneath him it wasn\u2019t spurting out.</p><p>I still had a chance.</p><p>I stood to see Max and Jeff greeting each other, guns lowered. Holy shit.</p><p>\u201cThis was a setup,\u201d I said. Jeff glanced over at me.</p><p>\u201cMax is my inside source. He knew I\u2019d be here tonight and planned to deliver you, but it made things a lot easier when you gave Cookie a ride home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo much talk,\u201d Max said, narrowing his eyes at Jeff. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>Jeff nodded, looking sad.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cMarie, I know this is hard for you but you\u2019ll get through it. You\u2019ve only known him a few months and it was all fake anyway. You\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything ready?\u201d Max asked. Jeff nodded.</p><p>\u201cAll set up,\u201d he said. \u201cHaven\u2019t pulled the money from the accounts yet, didn\u2019t want to do that and tip them off until we got her out. Marie, grab your purse, we gotta go.\u201d</p><p>He picked it up and tossed it toward me, then pulled Max away, talking with him quietly. Both men seemed extremely excited and agitated as they pored through papers on one of the work benches. I didn\u2019t care about that\u2014I needed to find something to stop the bleeding. I saw a pile of rags that looked pretty dirty, but figured we\u2019d worry about infection if he managed to survive. It wouldn\u2019t matter if I kept the wound clean if he bled out.</p><p>Once I had the rags on him and started applying pressure, I tried to think of the next step. I definitely wasn\u2019t going anywhere with Max and Jeff. I\u2019d finally grasped the reality\u2014I\u2019d already lost Jeff. There was something really, really wrong with him and I\u2019d never be able to fix it. Even if I did, I didn\u2019t want him in my life anymore. Not after he killed Horse. Tried to kill Horse.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dead yet. Gotta keep the thoughts positive.</p> <p>Max and Jeff were engrossed in whatever they were studying\u2014apparently I wasn\u2019t a threat to them. I could use that. I glanced down at my purse and realized I had two very powerful tools in there. My phone and my gun. I couldn\u2019t call and say anything though, because they\u2019d hear me. I guess I could\u2019ve called 9-1-1 in the hope they\u2019d find me, but considering it was a cell phone that wouldn\u2019t happen very fast.</p><p>I\u2019d call Picnic and hope to hell he answered. Maybe he\u2019d hear something useful.</p><p>I scooted around Horse\u2019s body, turning my back to them. That felt wrong, but I needed some cover to dig through my purse. I also needed to keep up the pressure on his wound, so I leaned down and across him, holding down the rags with the weight of my body as I searched quickly through the bag. I found the phone first, turning down the sound and hitting Picnic\u2019s number. It rang forever. Nothing. Shit. I heard their conversation shift and realized I was running out of time. I hit Maggs\u2019 number and set the phone on the floor behind Horse\u2019s arm, hoping she\u2019d answer and hear something. I couldn\u2019t do more than that, not right now.</p><p>Now for the gun.</p><p>Horse had given me a really cute leather purse that had a little compartment in it designed especially for a handgun\u2014crazy, right? I was damned thankful for it at the moment though, because my .22 slipped right out when I pressed the latch. Now all I had to do was c**k it. I got ready and then coughed loudly as I chambered a round, sliding it under his arm.</p><p>\u201cYou should leave him,\u201d Jeff said behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die, no way you can change that. Grab your shit and let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chest and pressed against Horse again with both hands. Then I scooted around to find Jeff standing over me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going with you,\u201d I said, meeting his eyes. \u201cYou guys should get out while you can. Leave us. I won\u2019t even tell them who did it, I just want you gone.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed and came up behind Jeff, holding up a paper. He smiled and shook his head, studying whatever it said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s this simple,\u201d Max said, shaking his head. Jeff turned back to grin at him, the maniacal gleam coming back into his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius. We\u2019ll be set, even after we pay off the cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only simple because I spent so much time setting it up,\u201d Jeff said, looking pleased, although I noticed his hand had started twitching again. Of course, he kept his finger on the trigger. Just what I needed.</p><p>\u201cYou did a hell of a job,\u201d Max said, shaking his head ruefully. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing of beauty, man.\u201d</p><p>Jeff grinned at the compliment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad they didn\u2019t listen to me back in September,\u201d Max continued. He looked at me and smiled almost fondly. \u201cGotta thank your old man for that, Marie. I wanted to kill you months ago, Jeff. Figured you might expose me on the skim. Never figured on a payoff like this. Damn. I\u2019m actually sorry I have to do this. It\u2019s not personal, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jeff looked at Max, puzzled. He never saw the biker\u2019s hand lift and for the second time in ten minutes I found myself screaming a warning too late for someone I loved. Jeff\u2019s head exploded. Literally exploded, chunks flying off. One of them hit me in the face, which I didn\u2019t notice at the time because in the instant Max shot him, Jeff\u2019s hand spasmed and pulled the trigger on his own gun. A second shot rang out almost instantly and I felt a line of fire across my arm. I ignored it because my brother was dead, my lover was almost dead and I had a really, really bad feeling that I\u2019d be dead, soon too.</p><p>Max looked down at me, tapping his gun against the side of his leg. He wore the same puzzled look he\u2019d had the night he\u2019d attacked me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to die,\u201d Max said, looking down at Horse thoughtfully. \u201cYour brother was right about that. You might as well let him go, because his blood is getting all over your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I whispered. \u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cMoney, what else? Get out of the way unless you want me to shoot you too. I want to f**k you first. Your call.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as he raised his gun and pointed it right at Horse\u2019s head. This was it. Horse was out of time. I needed a distraction, just for a second.</p><p>\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m covered in blood!\u201d I squealed suddenly, pulling my hands away from Horse to tear off my shirt and bra. Max\u2019s eyes went straight to my tits right as my hand grabbed my gun. A thousand memories flashed through my mind in an instant, but the one that stayed with me was the sound of Horse\u2019s voice, that first day he taught me to shoot.</p><p>Just remember, you ever point this at a person, you shoot it right at his heart and you shoot to kill. Never point a gun unless you\u2019re ready to end a life.</p> <p>I lifted my gun and pointed it straight at Max\u2019s heart like I\u2019d practiced hundreds of time. I didn\u2019t even think as I pulled the trigger over and over and over until I ran out of bullets. Like Jeff, Max\u2019d pulled his trigger as he died but his arm had dropped just enough to miss us. I crawled over to his body and grabbed his gun, taking it back with me as I climbed onto Horse, sitting on the rags as I grabbed my phone.</p><p>\u201cMaggs, are you there?\u201d I asked, my voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she demanded, her voice steady and calm. Apparently Maggs took gunfire in stride. \u201cThe guys are on their way, they\u2019ll be there in two minutes, tops. They had GPS on your car. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorse needs an ambulance,\u201d I said, my voice shaky. \u201cI think he\u2019s still alive. Max and Jeff are dead. Please save us, Maggs. I\u2019m really, really scared.\u201d</p><p>The barn door burst open in front of me and I dropped the phone, bringing Max\u2019s gun up and pointing it at Picnic, Bam Bam, Duck, Ruger and a couple other guys I\u2019d seen at the armory, guys from another charter.</p><p>\u201cI want cops and an ambulance,\u201d I said, and my voice might have been weak but my hands were steady.</p> <p>Picnic surveyed the scene, his face calmer than seemed reasonable.</p><p>\u201cMax tried to kill Horse,\u201d I told him. \u201cHe killed Jeff. I don\u2019t trust any of you. I want an ambulance for Horse and I want you out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, I have no idea what went down here,\u201d Picnic said slowly. \u201cBut you have to let us help Horse. Put down the gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo f**king way,\u201d I replied. \u201cMax shot him in the back. I\u2019ll shoot any one of you f**king Reapers who try to touch him. Ambulance. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one on the way,\u201d Picnic said. \u201cBam\u2019s called it in. But if you\u2019re sitting there holding a gun on us when the cops get here, that\u2019s going to make it a lot harder for them to take care of Horse. He\u2019s our brother, we aren\u2019t going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax was his brother too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bad thing happened here,\u201d Duck said, stepping forward. Something about his voice mesmerized me, and his eyes looked soft and sad. I watched as he crossed the floor and sat in front of me, about three feet from the gun. \u201cDon\u2019t make it worse. We can still control the situation, but not if you get in a shootout with the cops.\u201d</p><p>That startled me.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to shoot the cops, I just want to protect Horse,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow are they going to know that?\u201d he asked reasonably. I heard sirens in the distance. \u201cYou\u2019re running out of time, let us help you through this, okay?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to agree and had opened my mouth to tell him when something tackled me from behind. Duck\u2019s hand darted forward at the same instant, wrenching the gun out of my grasp as Ruger rolled me away from Horse\u2019s body. He held me down, hand over my mouth, and leaned his face in close to mine. His expression was intense, almost feral. In the corners of my eyes I saw the guys spring into action, throwing things into a bag, which Bam Bam grabbed before he took off running out the back door of the barn.</p><p>\u201cAll hell\u2019s gonna break loose when they come in here,\u201d Ruger told me, his tone urgent. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to arrest you, maybe all of us. Keep your mouth shut. I don\u2019t care what happened here and I don\u2019t care who did the shooting. You keep your mouth shut and the only time you open it is to ask for a lawyer. Keep asking for a lawyer \u2019til you get one, we\u2019ll send him to you. Do not talk, you got me?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand away from my mouth and I nodded, eyes wide. A single cop came flying through the door and stopped abruptly, obviously shocked at the scene.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d he yelled, reaching up to grab his radio. \u201cWe need backup now. Everyone, hands up where I can see them. Get off that girl, let her go.\u201d</p><p>Ruger rolled off me and stood, backing away with his hands raised high. The others followed suit and then I joined them. The lone cop watched us anxiously as EMTs rushed over to Horse, bundling him onto a stretcher and hauling him out the door. More cops arrived, which was the start of a very, very long night.</p><p>I asked for a lawyer and eventually I got one, but he couldn\u2019t answer the one question I cared about.</p><p>Was Horse still alive?</p><p>Horse</p><p>He felt detached from his body, almost floating. Pain roared through him. Voices echoed in the background, along with sirens. Then the world went black again.</p><p>More voices. Pain, but muted. Horse opened his eyes slowly, taking in a blurry room and a bright white light. A woman stood over him, asking him questions. He tried to answer, telling her his name, but he was so damned tired. He needed to sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWake up, ass**le. You\u2019re late for church. No excuses.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Had he slept in?</p><p>Horse opened his eyes, blinking rapidly, trying to focus. Not his room...hospital. Had to be a hospital. It came back to him in a rush\u2014he\u2019d been with Marie and then somebody shot him.</p><p>\u201cDid they get Marie?\u201d he demanded, but it came out in a whisper. Fucking pu**y, he couldn\u2019t even talk. He hated feeling weak.</p> <p>\u201cMarie is safe,\u201d Picnic said, stepping into Horse\u2019s line of sight. Horse studied his face to make sure the man wasn\u2019t lying to him. \u201cShe\u2019s in jail right now. Our guy\u2019s arranging bail. He says that if the ballistics match her story, they probably won\u2019t charge her with anything. She\u2019d be out already but they\u2019re pissed that she\u2019s stonewalling about why her brother and Max were fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJail?\u201d he asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cMarie shot Max,\u201d Picnic said, his face grim. Horse wrinkled his forehead. \u201cRuger\u2019s in there too. Hands covered in blood so they arrested him. He had to tackle your girl to get the gun away from her. She\u2019d gone all Pulp Fiction on us, ready to defend you by killing all of us if she had to. Crouched over your body like Wonder Woman. Gives me a boner just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the ass**le. Why would she shoot Max?\u201d Horse asked, every word grating against his sore throat. Had the bullet hit his mouth, for f**k\u2019s sake? Why couldn\u2019t he talk right?</p><p>\u201cMax shot you in the back,\u201d Picnic said shortly. \u201cAnd then he shot Jensen. Marie was probably next\u2014she told our guy that Max was getting ready to finish you off when she took him out. Kid is like a f**king commando, never saw that coming. Shot him seven times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Horse muttered, feeling himself smile. \u201cDamn, that\u2019s amazing. My girl\u2019s a one-woman army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Picnic said, shaking his head. \u201cTook care of business, no question about that. Hey, gotta ask you something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Picnic leaned over and spoke softly.</p><p>\u201cCops found all kinds of papers,\u201d he said. \u201cNo idea what was in them, but Marie told the lawyer they were talking about money transfers. Jensen said it was all set up. Could we be in trouble?\u201d</p><p>Horse wrinkled his forehead, trying to think.</p> <p>\u201cI changed everything after we found out about Jensen,\u201d he said. \u201cNew accounts, the whole thing, a lot more than just passwords and shit like that. Shouldn\u2019t have been traceable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder what he was talking about?\u201d</p><p>Horse searched his memory, which was way too hard. Must be on drugs, he realized. Something hovered just out of reach, something he knew was important. Then it came to him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax was in the office the last time I printed out a list of the overseas account numbers and contact information,\u201d he said. \u201cTold him I was making dupes for the lockbox. Probably left to take a piss or something and he copied them. Bet he thought he\u2019d hit the jackpot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me that isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds, bro.\u201d</p><p>Horse tried to shake his head, but it didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>\u201cThey were dummies,\u201d he replied, savoring the moment. \u201cYou know I like to f**k with the cops. Couple times a year I update my fake accounts and ledgers, make \u2019em realistic enough that if we ever get raided they\u2019ll be chasing their tails for months. I never told Jensen, and Max sure as f**k wouldn\u2019t know. Max gave him accounts with about five grand in them. Just enough to trick someone trying to do a test transfer, you know? Little game I like to play, extra insurance...guess it worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ... Thank f**k for that,\u201d Picnic said.</p><p>\u201cNope, not Jesus, just a man,\u201d Horse whispered. \u201cAlthough when women see my dick for the first time, they\u2019ve been known to fall down on their knees and worship me.\u201d</p><p>Picnic laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna live,\u201d he said. \u201cEgo\u2019s too big to die. Cops\u2019ll want to talk to you at some point. Tell \u2019em you can\u2019t remember anything beyond being at the party, lawyer says a traumatic head injury can make you forget the hours right before it happened. Yours hit the ground when he shot you. That\u2019ll get you off the hook and drive \u2019em crazy at the same time. I\u2019m gonna call the nurse now, let them know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Horse said. \u201cTell me about the Jacks. I miss anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet,\u201d Picnic replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an eye on them, this is just getting started. War\u2019s coming. Doubt your girl\u2019ll be their target though. Not worth their time to range this far out of their territory if they aren\u2019t getting paid.\u201d</p><p>Horse heard the room door open, and the sounds of a busy hallway behind it.</p><p>\u201cHey, Picnic, I just went down to grab a drink,\u201d Dancer said as she walked in. Horse managed to open his eyes again and look at her. She froze, eyes wide, then her face exploded in a huge smile as she rushed over to him. She leaned over to give him a hug, pulling back at the last minute with a grimace. Thank god for that, a hug right now and he\u2019d probably need another gallon of whatever painkiller they\u2019d given him. \u201cHorse! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here when you woke up. How do you feel? Can he talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look like shit,\u201d Horse said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother got shot, you douche,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you were going to die. Marie saved your life, did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Horse said, closing his eyes again. Damn he was tired.</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 pansy,\u201d Picnic said, and Horse heard him laugh, as if from a distance. \u201cDamn woman had to protect him, lazy ass**le wouldn\u2019t even get up off the ground. Dripping blood, making a mess...\u201d</p><p>Horse opened his mouth to tell him to f**k off, but before the words came he was out again.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Yakima Valley, eastern Washington</p><p>Five months later</p><p>Marie</p><p>I drove past our old elementary school on the way to the church. Jeff and I loved that playground\u2014in the summer Mom would drop us off there before heading in to work a block away. We\u2019d check in with her every couple of hours, feeling very mature. The familiar ache of sorrow and loss hit me, a stealth attack.</p><p>I missed him.</p><p>Jeff\u2019d been messed up, way more messed up than I\u2019d realized, but that didn\u2019t change that he was my brother or that I\u2019d watched him die right in front of my eyes. At least the nightmares were getting better. For the first few weeks I\u2019d been terrified to sleep because he\u2019d visit me at night, accusing me of killing him while his brains dribbled out his mouth. Thankfully, I hadn\u2019t had one of those nightmares for two months now and most days I didn\u2019t even think of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today wasn\u2019t like other days though.</p><p>I pulled into the parking lot and grabbed my dress bag. Mom was going to be pissed\u2014I was supposed to be there almost forty-five minutes ago but I\u2019d been delayed. The church coordinator glared at me as I walked in, grabbing my arm and rushing me downstairs to the bathroom. There I found my mother looking like a dream in an elegant, Grecian-style, peach-colored wedding dress.</p><p>\u201cOh Mama,\u201d I said, feeling tears spring to my eyes. \u201cYou look so beautiful. John\u2019s gonna die when he sees you.\u201d</p><p>Her face crumpled at the word \u201cdie\u201d and I swore under my breath. Mom was fragile these days and I still wasn\u2019t sure how to deal with that. I was used to her being the strong one, because she\u2019d suffered so much and always survived. Now I\u2019d become the strong survivor.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to get dressed,\u201d she said, forcing herself to smile again. Joanie, her longtime beautician, clucked at Mom to sit down so she could finish up her makeup. Her hair was already done, swept up in keeping with the Grecian style, little ribbons woven through it along with fresh flowers.</p><p>An hour later we waited in the back of the church. The last of the guests were inside and then John came out to stand at the altar. The music started and I reached over to take Mama\u2019s hand, squeezing it. John\u2019s daughter Carla walked ahead of us carrying white lilies. She was hard to read and I still wasn\u2019t quite sure how she felt about our families being joined. I guess it didn\u2019t matter, because she wanted her dad to be happy and that was enough to make her overlook our oddities. The wedding march started and I took Mama\u2019s hand to give her away.</p><p>It should have been Jeff\u2019s job.</p><p>I wondered if he could see us from wherever people go after they die. I hoped he knew Mama was finally happy. Then I stopped thinking about Jeff because the stunned, almost worshipful look on John\u2019s face as we came down the aisle filled my heart. I put their hands together, popping up on my toes to kiss first his cheek and then hers. I liked him. I liked him a lot, actually. He adored my mother and the feeling was mutual.</p><p>I stepped back and took my spot next to her as maid of honor. The minister started talking and that\u2019s when I let myself look over at Horse for the first time. He stood strong and tall next to John\u2019s grown son, Paulson. They wore matching tuxes, which I\u2019d never imagined Horse would be willing to tolerate. He\u2019d done it with grace though, telling me I\u2019d find a way to pay him back.</p> <p>I blushed, because that\u2019s why I\u2019d been late. He\u2019d already started collecting.</p><p>They held the reception in the old Eagles lodge, where John was a lifelong member. Their first dance together was beautiful, and somehow Mama resisted the urge to smash cake on John\u2019s face. She hadn\u2019t been married to my father, so this was her first wedding. That seemed to please John in some weird way. I guess he liked the idea of being her only husband. Horse held my hand all through dinner, stealing little glances at me when he thought I wasn\u2019t paying attention. It made me a little nervous\u2014I knew him well enough to realize he was up to something. That could be very good. Once when he\u2019d gotten that look, he\u2019d taken me up to Canada for a surprise weekend at a gorgeous bed-and-breakfast.</p><p>Of course, last week I\u2019d seen that look on his face the instant before Maggs dumped a bucket of water on me from the second floor of the armory.</p><p>I stood talking to Denise next to the dance floor when he struck, throwing me over his shoulder and carrying me out of the room to cheers and whistles. My mom\u2019s voice was the loudest, something we\u2019d be having words about later. I squawked as he hauled me up the stairs and out onto the roof. Then he set me down and I saw a blanket covered with red rose petals.</p><p>My eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI get that this is probably some romantic gesture, but what have you done with my old man?\u201d I demanded, looking at him with narrowed eyes. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your style, babe.\u201d</p> <p>Horse grinned, looking almost sheepish. Wow. Didn\u2019t know Reapers could do sheepish.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s idea,\u201d he said. \u201cShe said I couldn\u2019t be trusted not to f**k things up. This is the price I paid to keep her from following us up here. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and led me over to the blanket, standing in front of me and kissing my lips very softly. Then to my utter shock he lowered himself to one knee and took my hand.</p><p>\u201cI feel like an ass**le because this is so corny,\u201d he said, shaking his head. He started to get back up and I grabbed his shoulders, pushing them down hard.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d he said, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d I burst out, glaring back at him. \u201cDon\u2019t make me get my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, am I ever going to live that down?\u201d he asked, shaking his head. \u201cYou know they\u2019re calling me your bitch at the armory now, does that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware. Not my fault I had to save your big, bad, biker ass. You know what they say with guys who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut the f**k up, Marie,\u201d Horse said, rolling his eyes. \u201cYou gonna let me do this or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I replied, feeling a little giddy. Sure it was corny, but it also kicked ass.</p><p>\u201cMarie Caroline Jensen, will you do me the honor of being my permanent bitch?\u201d</p><p>I smacked him on the side of his head as he burst out laughing, then aimed my foot for his nuts. He grabbed me, shoving me down onto the blanket and covering me with his body, still shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin my dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess your mom was right\u2014I am f**king this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it right or I\u2019ll say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie Caroline Jensen, will you marry me?\u201d he asked suddenly, looking right into my eyes. I bit my lip, trying to decide how long to drag it out. Maybe a little longer...he\u2019d used the \u201cb\u201d word, I should probably make him suffer. I looked away, refusing to meet his eyes as he stopped laughing and grew still.</p><p>\u201cMarie?\u201d he asked, his voice suddenly strained. \u201cOh f**k, don\u2019t do this to me, please. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, catching his eye and smirking. \u201cI\u2019ll marry your big, dumb ass but only because you said the magic word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck? You\u2019re right, that is a magic word. Let\u2019s test it out.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing, which only lasted for a few seconds before his mouth took mine, kissing me deeply. I felt the length of his erection between my legs and realized that whatever damage he\u2019d already done to my outfit was probably just the beginning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stopped kissing me long enough to lift himself and pull up my dress. That\u2019s when he discovered I\u2019d left my panties off. He growled in approval as I giggled, covering his face with kisses while he fumbled with his fly. Then his c**k was out and pressing into me, sliding into my wet depths with a singular focus that drove me crazy.</p><p>Horse thrust into me over and over, touching me deeper than I\u2019d imagined possible before him. I wrapped my legs up and around his waist, holding him to me and tilting my pelvis just the right way to make the most of his hard length.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t believe you\u2019re stupid enough to marry me,\u201d Horse muttered, sitting up and lifting my hips, one of my favorite positions because now every stroke drew the round lip of his c**k head across my G-spot with a force that drove me insane. He knew it too, and he grinned at me as I flew over the edge, moaning and arching my back. Two more strokes and he followed, spurting deep inside.</p><p>We came down together, panting under the stars, the faint sound of Mom\u2019s reception floating up from the open windows below. After what seemed like forever, Horse sat up and I joined him, pulling down my dress as demurely as possible considering I\u2019d just been f**ked senseless on a roof. I brought my knees to my chest and wrapped my arms around them, looking out over the lights of the valley.</p> <p>\u201cNo second thoughts, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo second thoughts,\u201d I said, feeling warm and happy all over. Then I held up my left hand. \u201cDid you forget something?\u201d</p><p>Horse smiled at me, looking very pleased with himself again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I brought it for you.\u201d He stood up and walked over to one of the rooftop air conditioning units. He grabbed a small, black bag and brought it back to me, dropping down onto the blanket. Then he reached in and pulled out a box.</p><p>A too-big box.</p> <p>I narrowed my eyes and took it from him to discover that\u2014in addition to being too big for a ring\u2014it was way too heavy. I opened it and found a large, semi-automatic black pistol.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a .38,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cI know you\u2019re a .22 girl, but it\u2019s time for us to take the next step in our relationship. I think if you start practicing you\u2019ll get used to the feel of it. This is a great piece because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear if you say one more word I\u2019m shooting you,\u201d I growled, thoroughly disgusted. Of course he\u2019d buy me an engagement gun.</p><p>Stupid biker.</p><p>\u201cAt least take it out of the box and see how it feels in your hand.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and picked it up, wondering how many anniversaries we\u2019d have before I needed my own private bunker to store my weapons. But as I pulled it out, a beautiful, sparkling silver engagement ring came with it, tied to the trigger with a short thread. It was gorgeous, not so big that it was tasteless but still absolutely stunning. It held a large blue sapphire with small diamonds on either side. I loved it instantly. Horse pulled it loose and I held out my hand for him to put it on. Then he took my chin and looked right in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cLove you, babe. Are you still planning to shoot me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too,\u201d I replied, grinning at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet about shooting you though. I\u2019ll get back to you on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want to stay up here a little longer, just the two of us? Or do you want to go downstairs and show your mom your new bling?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at him, leaning against his side as he wrapped an arm around me.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make me a horrible, shallow person that I want to go flash this thing around to everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with that,\u201d he replied, kissing the top of my head. \u201cThen you need to call Maggs and Em\u2014it took everything I had to keep them from crashing the reception. They\u2019re having a party for us when we get back to Coeur d\u2019Alene. Picnic wants you to make potato salad. I told him no f**king way you\u2019re cooking for your own engagement party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNaw, I told him I\u2019d do whatever it took. Love that shit. It\u2019s the bacon that really sets it apart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaby!\u201d my mom squealed, rushing out onto the roof. John followed her, along with Denise. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I couldn\u2019t wait. Tell me all about it! Did he screw it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on, go to your mom,\u201d Horse said, rolling his eyes. He stood and took my hand, lifting me to my feet. Then he smacked my ass, pushing me toward my mom and her new husband. \u201cBut when she\u2019s done with you I\u2019m taking you home to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>I lifted to my toes to kiss him and then ran over to show Mama my new ring. I decided to leave the gun with Horse.</p><p>At least for now.</p>  </body></html>"]
