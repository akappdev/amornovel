The two things that everyone in Holland Springs could always count on at Jack\u2019s Fine Italian were great service and food.</p><p>Elise Dumas raised her glass, studying him over the rim. Her green eyes sparkled, and her red hair glowed under the lights. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d Standard southern answer to a question. But he wasn\u2019t fine, and he hated lying about it. \u201cJust a little tired.\u201d At least that much was true. He was exhausted, having spent most the night before working on repairing a software glitch for the Special Victims Unit in Wilmington.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more than a little tired,\u201d she said gently, and he had to look away before she could glimpse the truth. The longer he and Elise dated, the more this off feeling had grown, until it felt as though his entire body was suffused with it.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t understand it, really. He\u2019d been the one to ask her out, he\u2019d been the one to pursue her, enjoy the flirting and stolen kisses...the daily texts to make plans for lunch or have coffee, just because. Not just that, Gabriel wanted to settle down. He wanted a wife, a dog, and, eventually, children\u2014God willing.</p><p>But he did not want those things with Elise Dumas.</p><p>Gabriel blinked, the errant thought completely taking him by surprise, because there was absolutely nothing wrong with Elise. She didn\u2019t deserve this sudden internal waffling. She deserved all of his attention, and not the sporadic amounts he\u2019d given her lately.</p> <p>Turning to her, he placed his hand on hers. It was warm and small beneath his palm. His heart raced a little. A slow smile flickered on her face, and she licked her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that tired,\u201d he said softly. \u201cHow about drinks...at my place?\u201d</p><p>That smile of hers curved up even more. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Usually, he wouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t exactly broadcast it to the world, but he had planned on waiting for his wedding night to have sex for the first time. Perhaps this off feeling was a result of that, of old-fashioned thinking. Growing up as the adopted son of a preacher had made him tentative in his relationships. Or maybe it was because he was still a virgin by choice.</p><p>With a wink, he said, \u201cI think a gentleman shouldn\u2019t keep a lady waiting for so long.\u201d Then he motioned for the server to bring him the check.</p><p>Elise\u2019s brows rose, but she said nothing until after the bill had been paid and Gabriel was lacing his fingers in hers. \u201cThree months isn\u2019t that long, Gabe.\u201d</p> <p>Try twenty-nine years, honey. He opened the door and inclined his head, letting go of her hand so she could go through first. She walked ahead of him, and he stood back to admire the sway of her hips, the way her slim skirt fit her curvy frame, and how her hair bounced on her shoulders with the movement.</p><p>A quick glance over her shoulder made him blush. He really shouldn\u2019t be ogling Elise in the parking lot. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said. Exhaling, he strode after her.</p><p>Stopping by the passenger side of his truck, Elise stood, hands clasped in front of her as she waited for him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to apologize.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head to one side and opened the door, helping her inside. \u201cPretty sure I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I liked it.\u201d She leaned into him, placing her hands on either shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to feel wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than nice.\u201d Her lashes fluttered, and he knew in that moment she would kiss him. He\u2019d welcome that kiss, that reminder of all the reasons why he found her attractive.</p><p>But just as his own eyes grew heavy-lidded, a flash of blond hair framing a familiar face caught his attention. He jerked back. Elise almost tumbled out of the truck.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she gasped</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw...\u201d He swallowed, unable to lie to her, yet unable to voice what his mind had registered. She couldn\u2019t be back in town. Not now. Not when I\u2019m so close to being over you. \u201cSomething... and it startled me.\u201d There. At least that was the truth.</p><p>\u201cIf PDA makes you uncomfortable, Gabe, I won\u2019t try to kiss you again,\u201d she said. There wasn\u2019t a trace of bitterness or sarcasm in her tone, but instead of making him feel better, he felt like a freak.</p><p>Scared to kiss her, angel? Or are you thinking of another? A voice whispered in his head, soft, seductive, and completely deadly to his determination to scrub her from his thoughts.</p><p>The scent of sea breezes and cut grass washed over him, reminding him of Summer. He inwardly grimaced. Not Summer, but summer\u2014the season.</p><p>I\u2019m over you. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me uncomfortable,\u201d he said, cupping the side of Elise\u2019s face. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her, long and hard, until she melted into him. He kissed her while thinking of all the things he liked about her, of all the things he knew about her, and of all the things that made her special to him.</p><p>But who had to think this much during a kiss? Shouldn\u2019t a kiss be so overwhelming and consuming that the only thought you can hold onto is how to breathe?</p><p>Reluctantly, he pulled away.</p><p>Elise\u2019s cheeks were rosy. \u201cWow,\u201d she breathed. The measure of satisfaction he should feel never came. What was wrong with him?</p><p>With a heavy heart, he backed up. \u201cDrinks are waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf drinks at your place are anything like this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to finish in one sitting.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel had to smile over that. Her compliment flattered his ego, and then some. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>After climbing in his truck, he cranked up the engine and pulled out of the parking lot, heading north on Broad Street. Elise tuned the radio to a country station that had them both humming along. She grabbed his hand, and he felt better. In fact, that off feeling was completely gone.</p><p>\u201cHere comes trouble,\u201d he sang, but then that familiar face caught his eye and his stomach contracted, like he\u2019d been suckered punched.</p><p>Summer Holland, the woman who\u2019d sworn never to come back to Holland Springs ever again, was walking down Broad Street. She looked the same to him\u2014beautiful, strong, and unattainable. Though that wasn\u2019t always true. Once she\u2019d been vulnerable and always willing to throw herself into his arms.</p><p>But then he\u2019d let her down. All over a lie, that turned into a rumor, which spread like wildfire... and he\u2019d done nothing to stomp it out, until it was too late, because the smallest part of him had believed it could be true. That, in truth, the apple didn\u2019t fall far from the tree.</p><p>He\u2019d been the worst sort of snob, the worst sort of hypocrite, to believe some guy\u2019s lie. It didn\u2019t matter that he had apologized. Summer had never forgiven him, and would always make him pay. Until he thought they\u2019d finally broken through all that. Until he thought they\u2019d finally be together. He had wanted to be the father of the child that wasn\u2019t his. He had wanted to be Summer\u2019s husband, her lover, and best friend. He thought she had wanted the same.</p><p>Then she\u2019d shoved him away again. For no reason at all.</p><p>He almost slammed on the brakes, but somehow, he kept going, staring at her retreating form in the rearview mirror.</p><p>It was a damn good thing traffic was light.</p><p>Her hips swayed in barely there cutoffs, tan legs as long as anything. The blood is his veins thrummed. Involuntarily, his grip on Elise\u2019s hand tightened.</p><p>Elise. Elise. The woman who sat so innocently beside him, singing and enjoying his company, while he salivated over another woman\u2019s legs and hips. She deserved better than this, better than him, with his messed-up, tightly twisted history of dropping everything to help the girl who used to own his heart.</p><p>Now he knew what was wrong with him\u2014Summer Holland.</p><p>And knowing was power. He would use that knowledge and get over her by taking this final step with Elise. Never mind that he was ditching his own long-held beliefs to prove a point. Never mind that he wouldn\u2019t be thinking of Elise at all when he kissed her again.</p><p>He wanted to bang his head against the steering wheel to clear it, but instead he drove on, silently urging the already light traffic to become nonexistent. After another ten minutes of driving, he pulled into her driveway instead of his.</p><p>\u201cChange of plans?\u201d she asked, slipping her hand from his as he parked the truck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s very beautiful, just like everyone says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he managed to ask, turning to Elise.</p><p>\u201cSummer Holland.\u201d</p><p>He searched Elise\u2019s face. There was no judgment in her expression, just a sort of gentle understanding, which only served to make him feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not why I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she is a part of it.\u201d</p><p>Running his hand through his hair, he groaned. \u201cYes, no... Honestly, she\u2019s all in my head right now, because the only time she comes around is when she needs something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you always rescue her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ve been warned about that, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a warning, more like a be prepared type of thing.\u201d Elise gave him a small smile. \u201cZoe Romanov told me that if I wanted to be with you, then I needed to accept your need to help others, especially one person in particular.\u201d</p><p>Shame and guilt washed over him. She\u2019d known, the entire time he tried to spare her feelings by kissing her. God only knew what she thought about him making the first move.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did Zoe tell you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen things started getting serious, or at least, I assumed we were serious.\u201d A large frown invaded her small smile and won. \u201cI assumed too much apparently.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to groan again. Their date had gone from good to bad to really ugly in a matter in minutes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t assume anything. We\u2019re a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will you think of me when Summer needs your help, or when she asks you to drop everything for her?\u201d</p><p>Technically, Summer never had to ask him. He simply gave and she always took, but splitting hairs didn\u2019t seem to be the best course to take. \u201cI give you my word that you will always come first, and if you ever don\u2019t, then call me out on it and give me the opportunity to rectify it.\u201d</p><p>He meant it, every single word. Elise was good for him. She\u2019d be good for any man, with her intelligence, looks, and disposition. Who wouldn\u2019t want her in their life?</p><p>The leather seat creaked a little as she moved closer to him. \u201cYou get one chance, Gabriel. That might sound a little harsh, but from what I know and what I\u2019ve been told\u2014one is probably too many.\u201d With that, she kissed him on the cheek, got out of the truck, and went inside her house.</p><p>Summer Holland had sworn she\u2019d never step foot in Holland Springs again, but here she was, standing in the front yard of the house she\u2019d grown up in. A house that not even three years ago, she\u2019d burned to the ground, in the hopes of saving her sister.</p><p>Strawberry Grove looked mostly the same, only the rebuilt mansion no longer sagged in the front, shutters were firmly nailed beside windows, and the paint wasn\u2019t peeling. The aura of decay was completely gone. It looked bright, cheery, and...homey.</p><p>Most likely, this was how Strawberry Grove had looked when it was first built, before the Civil War, by her great-great-great-great grandmother\u2019s lover. Or if the family lore were to be believed, by a man who had actually convinced Poppy Holland to marry him while abandoning his own last name.</p><p>Actually, that would be two men in the history of all the notorious Holland women. Well, three if she counted her sister\u2019s husband\u2014the same man Summer\u2019s daughter called Daddy.</p><p>The sound of tires crunching over gravel made her turn around just in time to see a hot-pink truck come to a stop. A tall blonde with a winning smile got out, waving at Summer like she was happy to see her.</p><p>It struck Summer as odd, painful, and sweet all at once. Growing up, no one outside of her family in Holland Springs had ever been happy to see her.</p><p>Except for one, a voice in her head reminded her.</p><p>\u201cHey you! It\u2019s me, Jemma Leigh. Rose said you\u2019d be by today,\u201d Jemma Leigh called out as she teetered on high heels. She carefully made her way to Summer, with a stack of papers clutched tight in one hand. \u201cI have a key for you, though Rose said you wouldn\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>Rose was correct. A locked door had never kept Summer out of any building. \u201cHow thoughtful.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh stopped short, searching Summer\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Summer lied, tossing her hair over one shoulder. Jemma Leigh had always been kind to her, even in school. Once Jemma Leigh had given Summer her own lunch when Summer had forgotten hers, and had no money to purchase one. Another time, she\u2019d complimented Summer on a dress she\u2019d worn to school, for the first day of ninth grade. It had been one of her mother\u2019s and ill fitting.</p><p>But that\u2019s not why Summer lied. She lied because she couldn\u2019t afford to make friends. Friends turned on you when you needed them the most. Only Summer didn\u2019t remember Jemma Leigh turning on her. Then again, Summer had never given her the chance.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Jemma Leigh\u2019s face fell. \u201cWell, I remember you, Summer Holland. We went to school together. You always drew the best pictures in art class, and I was green with envy.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what Jemma Leigh remembered? Not the rumors, or the whispers, or the name-calling, but how well she\u2019d drawn? Color her confused. \u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jemma Leigh shifted her weight from side to side, and then handed over the stack of papers. \u201cI took the opportunity to get the mail this evening, since you wouldn\u2019t know to get it. But since you\u2019re staying, you can get it from now on. While you\u2019re here, you\u2019ll have to have coffee with me so we can catch up. There\u2019s a new caf\u00e9 in town with muffins that will widen your hips just from looking at them. Not as good as Daisy\u2019s place, but she\u2019s off with her earl, living it up in England or China... Some place like that. Anyway, you just have to go with me.\u201d</p><p>Summer stared at her blankly, taking the mail.</p><p>\u201cYou are staying, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jemma Leigh\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cI could have sworn Rose said you were.\u201d</p> <p>Summer crossed her arms, not the easiest of feats considering her hands were full. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about staying.\u201d There was no need for the entire town to know she was here, until she was good and ready. She turned and walked to the house, leaving Jemma Leigh standing in the middle of the front yard.</p><p>\u201cNice chatting with you, Summer. I\u2019ll see you around,\u201d Jemma Leigh called out, but Summer barely paid her any attention. All her focus was on the house, and what she\u2019d find behind the door.</p><p>The old-fashioned key seemed to weigh about a thousand pounds in her hand. Her palms became sweaty and her knees wobbly, but she put the key in the lock and turned it. The door swung open.</p><p>A cat rushed out, winding around her legs. She bent down, dumping the mail on the porch to scoop him up. \u201cBlackbeard,\u201d she whispered again his soft, black fur. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard purred in response.</p> <p>She looked into his blue eyes and made a face. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been that long.\u201d</p><p>The cat kept staring, and his tail twitched.</p><p>\u201cAll right, it has been a long time, but I plan on staying a long time.\u201d She stroked his back. \u201cDoes my time frame meet with your approval?\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard wriggled out of her arms, and she let him go. Rising to her feet, she left the porch and the mail behind her as she entered the house.</p><p>A white envelope propped up on a table in the foyer caught her eye. Her name was boldly written on it. Blackbeard jumped on the table, rubbing against the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so vain now. Is Rose\u2019s husband the reason for it?\u201d she asked the cat. Picking up the note, she examined it and then let out a puff of air when she couldn\u2019t discern what was inside without opening it.</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered, lifting the back flap and pulling out the letter.</p><p>Dear Summer,</p><p>Sasha, Ivy, and I are traveling in Zimbabwe at the moment. We are opening a new school there, and then another one in Brazil.</p><p>\u201cA globetrotting Holland. Who would have thunk it?\u201d she said, absently petting Blackbeard.</p><p>Normally, I keep Carolina Dreams closed during our trips, but there are several couples that will need our help. I hope that you can find a way to reopen the store while I\u2019m gone. After all, you and Skye helped start it. Please pay yourself whatever you think is fair. Harrison can help you, if you have any questions.</p><p>\u201cFat chance of Harrison helping me,\u201d Summer muttered.</p><p>Please make yourself at home. You\u2019ll find your old bedroom ready for you. I\u2019m sure Blackbeard can show you the way, if you\u2019ve forgotten.</p><p>All My Love,</p> <p>Rose</p><p>P.S. Tell Blackbeard to stay out of my closet. He has a nasty habit of drooling on my cashmere sweaters.</p><p>P.P.S. That was Sasha, not me. Blackbeard has a crush on him.</p><p>P.P.P.S. Why wouldn\u2019t he? I\u2019m very pleasing to the eye, as are you.</p><p>P.P.P.P.S. Beauty fades, but I\u2019ll keep you anyway.</p><p>Summer swallowed a giggle, and then crumpled up the letter. Her sister was truly in love, and the man she married was truly in love with her. The thought of it warmed the coldness that lived inside of her, but only a little. A little was all she would allow.</p><p>She looked in the mirror, not at herself, but at the room behind her. Everything inside the house had changed. It was elegant and touchable. The large chairs flanking either side of the fireplace practically begged to be sat in, but she wouldn\u2019t succumb.</p><p>Instead, she scooped up Blackbeard and dropped the letter on the table. She wandered around for what seemed like hours, taking in the newness as memories washed over her.</p><p>Running through the house with her sisters, laughing as Blackbeard chased after them. Their mother teaching her how to illustrate botanical recipes long after everyone had gone to bed, not even Rose suspected Summer had been the one to do that.</p><p>Trying the new recipes Rose invented. Putting up with all the friends Skye would make and try to bring home with her. Meeting Gabriel for the first time, in the backyard, when he\u2019d gotten lost in the woods.</p><p>But along with the good, came the bad.</p><p>Growing up to look exactly like Azalea. Dealing with the rumors while, struggling not to become what she was accused of being. Azalea kicking her out. Living with Patrick\u2014</p><p>Summer paused in the middle of the upstairs hallway and closed her eyes.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t think of him, of what he demanded after letting her stay the night when she had nowhere else to go. Summer had thought Patrick was her friend, because he was Gabriel\u2019s friend. And Gabriel would have never been friends with\u2014</p><p>Her eyes popped open, and she marched to her old room.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what Gabriel used to be, was right now, or would be in the future. Coming home to Holland Springs had nothing to do with him.</p><p>She threw open the door and stepped inside. The room was tastefully done in soft greens and rich creams, two of her favorite colors. Little splashes of pink and yellow made the room extra homey.</p><p>But the picture of her holding a newborn Ivy seemed to mock her from the mantle over the fireplace. Her lips twisted, and her jaw clenched.</p><p>It\u2019s the right thing, Summer.</p><p>But it hurts.</p><p>I know it does, but I\u2019ll help you, every step of the way, if you want.</p><p>Gabriel. It was his fault she\u2019d given up Ivy like she had. It was his fault that she allowed him to see her in a weak moment. Otherwise, she would have never let Rose adopt Ivy. She would have found a way to make herself a better mother... to make herself love a child who no longer knew her. A child who looked so much like the man who\u2019d helped her, who\u2019d found her in a diner while she counted tips and how many days were left before she had to pay rent again.</p><p>Darius.</p><p>Though she hadn\u2019t loved him, she had liked him and the way he treated her, like she mattered and deserved respect. She\u2019d admired him and the sacrifices he\u2019d made while in the ARMY. When he\u2019d died in a roadside bomb, a piece of her died along with him.</p><p>The image of mother and child blurred. Summer blinked, and tears ran down her cheeks.</p><p>No matter what, she\u2019d never let herself be that weak again.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The next day, at precisely nine AM, Summer reopened Carolina Dreams. She\u2019d been up since dawn, reacquainting herself with the apothecary shop. Everything was as it should be, neatly labeled, and stored in the back and across the street, according to the second letter Rose had left for her.</p><p>Summer glanced around the office, taking in the new desk, new desk chair, new computer, and plethora of family pictures. She ran a finger along the edge of a frame. Ivy, Rose, and Sasha posed in the pictured. Ivy wore a tutu, a bow in her hair, and a sweet smile.</p><p>Summer flipped the picture over.</p><p>The bells on the door rang, and she walked to the front, standing behind the massive counter made of wood and glass. This would be her battle station, the place where she could draw power and throw containers of shampoo at customers if she had to.</p><p>God, she hoped she didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>Butterflies fluttered in her stomach as the first, second, third, and fourth customer walked inside, made their purchase, and left. All with a wave and a smile.</p><p>All said things like:</p><p>It\u2019s nice to meet you.</p><p>I love your store.</p><p>This is exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for.</p><p>Say hello to Rose.</p><p>Tell her we miss her.</p><p>For the next three days, the pattern repeated with even more customers, until it felt as though the bells over the door played Carol of the Bells due to all the activity.</p><p>By the time three o\u2019clock rolled around on Wednesday, Summer was mentally exhausted, but she couldn\u2019t close until the tall redhead finished shopping. The woman kept giving Summer looks, but for the most part, Summer thought it was merely curiosity and not hostility.</p><p>\u201cCould you help me, please?\u201d the woman called out.</p><p>Summer moved to the corner of the store, to where the scented lotions and body washes were displayed. \u201cIs there a certain scent that speaks to you?\u201d</p><p>The redhead gave her an odd look, her green eyes a touch frosty. \u201cSpeaks to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you smelled any of them, and have a particular favorite or two?\u201d Summer asked, trying again. Unlike Rose, she didn\u2019t immediately grab the scent she knew would complement the customer, because she preferred the customer to come to their own conclusions\u2014with a little guidance, of course.</p><p>\u201cThey all smell nice, but I want to find one that will drive my boyfriend wild.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that was the hesitation. Summer smiled. This was something she loved, though, no one would have believed her. \u201cFirst things, first. Tell me about him\u2014his favorite dessert, the color of his eyes and hair...his favorite time of day to... kiss you.\u201d All romantic things to know about a lover in Summer\u2019s opinion. At that moment, Gabriel came to mind. Effortlessly, she answered every one of those questions about him.</p><p>Favorite dessert, lemon pound cake. The color of his eyes, darkest blue with a ring of black at the center. Hair just as dark, and silky to touch. As for kissing her, he had always said he loved kissing her during the summer sunset, because it was as close as he could get to kissing her at nighttime, without breaking curfew.</p><p>\u201cHis favorite dessert is lemon pound cake. Dark blue eyes, black hair, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s hand froze, hovering over a blue bottle. Please don\u2019t let her say at sunset. Please, please, please.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a favorite time of day, not that I\u2019ve ever heard. He just kisses me whenever.\u201d</p><p>Summer exhaled, and then glanced at her customer. It wasn\u2019t Gabriel. She was silly to think it was, or even to think of him at all.</p><p>The redhead blushed and tipped up her chin. Summer felt a bit sorry for her, because she got the impression the woman hated that her boyfriend didn\u2019t have a favorite time of day to kiss her.</p><p>Despite what people thought about her, including her sisters, she couldn\u2019t stand to see innocent people in pain or feeling bad about themselves. She knew what it was like.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s perfect, really,\u201d Summer said, trying to put her at ease. \u201cHis favorite time of day is all day. You\u2019re so lucky to have a man like that...Um, I didn\u2019t catch your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Elise Dumas, the not-so-new head librarian.\u201d Elise stuck out her hand, and Summer shook it, and then let go.</p><p>\u201cSummer Holland, by the way. I\u2019ve just moved back to Holland Springs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are, and I want you to stay away from Gabriel,\u201d Elise said firmly.</p><p>This time, Summer\u2019s entire body froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d she managed to croak. Maybe there was another Gabriel in Holland Springs, and Elise didn\u2019t mean the Gabriel Summer knew at all.</p><p>\u201cGabriel Edwards and I are dating. Seriously dating. I would appreciate it if you would stay away from him. Or if you do need his help, go ahead and get it, then leave.\u201d</p><p>Red-hot fury boiled inside of Summer, melting all the frozen parts of her. She stepped away from the display and toward the woman beside her. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for his help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you come here for him?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cNo.\u201d Never, she swore to herself, ignoring the woman inside of her who missed the man who always put her first. Summer barely held on to her temper, although she wasn\u2019t mad at Elise. She was mad at herself, for having such conflicting thoughts over him. Just like always.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not the first woman he ever loved, but I want to be the last one, so I\u2019m begging you, please stay away.\u201d Elise let out a shaky breath. \u201cHe\u2019d choose you over me, I know this. So, I\u2019m asking you, woman to woman, to respect our relationship, and stay the hell away.\u201d</p><p>Before Summer could say another word, Elise fled the store, leaving Summer standing there. So that was why Gabriel hadn\u2019t been by. He was in love with someone else.</p><p>Claws of jealousy ripped at her heart.</p><p>Trudging to the front of the store, she let the pain overtake her. How could he do this to her? How could he have let her found out like this? Usually, Gabriel would have been here on the first day she made an appearance, but after three days and counting, she had come to the conclusion he wasn\u2019t coming.</p><p>Now she knew he wasn\u2019t coming\u2014not that it mattered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t matter, she reminded herself. She ignored the pain in her heart. The only thing that mattered was family, and he wasn\u2019t family. He would never be her family.</p><p>But Gabriel used to be your family, a little voice in her head reminded her. She told that voice to shut the hell up.</p><p>After flipping the \u2018open\u2019 sign to \u2018closed\u2019 in the window, she moved to the door and slumped against it, rubbing her temples. She needed to take the rest of the week off, and think long and hard about what had prompted her to come back to Holland Springs in the first place.</p><p>A knock almost made her jump out of her skin. \u201cI\u2019m closed.\u201d</p><p>The knock came more vigorously this time, and Summer\u2019s lip curled. She managed to unlock and yank open the door at the same time, ready to curse the person behind it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the he\u2014?\u201d The curse died on her lips.</p><p>Jemma Leigh stood there, smile on her face. \u201cReady for that muffin?\u201d</p><p>Dumbstruck, Summer stared.</p> <p>\u201cYou thought I forgot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Jemma Leigh asked, but she wasn\u2019t looking for an answer. \u201cI have been looking forward to this all week. Janie Leigh is at Momma\u2019s and Jeremy\u2019s on the boat, so I don\u2019t have to be in a hurry. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>Summer had two choices.</p><p>One, she could slam the door in Jemma Leigh\u2019s face and ruin any chance of a potential friendship, a friendship that Jemma Leigh seemed determined to start. Or two, she could go eat a muffin and catch up on all the town\u2019s gossip, especially on one resident of Holland Springs in particular.</p><p>Though it wasn\u2019t the best reason to befriend Jemma Leigh, it was an honest one\u2014for Summer at least.</p><p>\u201cLet me get my purse,\u201d Summer heard herself say.</p> <p>Jemma Leigh did a little jumpy clap and wrapped her arms around Summer\u2019s neck.</p><p>Summer grunted, her hands fluttering in the air, uncertain where to land. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time someone had hugged her.</p><p>Letting go, Jemma Leigh stepped back. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be such great friends, Summer Holland. I know it. The Hollands aren\u2019t the only ones with the sight.\u201d She winked at her, looking pleased as anything with herself.</p><p>And just like that, Summer would never let Jemma Leigh know the only reason she agreed to have coffee was so that she could pump the town\u2019s sweetest gossip for information.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to sit in full public view of everyone in town, but Jemma Leigh had insisted on being seated outside. A large, yellow umbrella kept them nicely shaded, and the poppy seed muffin Summer ordered was delicious.</p><p>\u201cMy momma always said, A moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips,\u201d Jemma Leigh sighed, and then ate another bite. \u201cBut she\u2019s not here, and I don\u2019t even care.\u201d</p> <p>Summer glanced at her. \u201cWhy should you? You look great.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh blinked, and Summer wanted to snatch the words back. She never willingly complimented anyone. If she wasn\u2019t a hardass, then who would she be\u2014sweet, kind, and loving? Ha. Fat chance of that ever happening again.</p><p>\u201cI do work out every day,\u201d Jemma Leigh said. \u201cAnd Jeremy is very happy with how I look, too.\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded and kept her mouth fully occupied with eating instead of being complimentary.</p><p>\u201cSo much has changed since you\u2019ve been gone. Daisy Barnes landed herself an honest-to-goodness earl. She\u2019s a countess now\u2014have you ever?\u201d</p><p>No, Summer hadn\u2019t ever, but she could bet Rose had seen that one coming a mile away.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s moved to England, and then Zoe Ambrose is expecting. Those Romanovs are something else, but I think our local boys are good enough for us, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Summer thought she should nod, so she did, and that encouraged Jemma Leigh to keep talking. She talked about everything and anything. About her daughter, her dog who wouldn\u2019t listen, and how the real estate market had picked up a titch\u2014what kind of measurement a titch was, Summer had no idea, but up was good. The only person Jemma Leigh didn\u2019t talk about was Gabriel, but that spoke volumes in Summer\u2019s opinion.</p> <p>\u201cI met Elise Dumas,\u201d Summer finally blurted, unable to take it any longer.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jemma Leigh glanced away, taking a deep sip of coffee. \u201cShe\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>Nice wouldn\u2019t be how Summer would describe her. \u201cShe\u2019s dating Gabriel. Seriously dating him, and warned me to stay away.\u201d For the second time in a matter of minutes, Summer wished she could snatch her words back. Why was she telling this to Jemma Leigh of all people?</p><p>Because you once actually liked the thought of friends.</p><p>When she\u2019d been with Darius, the other soldiers\u2019 wives had been friendly to her, none of them thought the worst about her, or if they had, they\u2019d never said it. So, it wasn\u2019t as though Summer didn\u2019t know how to make friends. She was just really rusty at it. And wary.</p><p>Completely, absolutely wary, because in this town, everyone knew her by reputation only, and the women here let her know it by shunning her and her family.</p><p>A frown marred Jemma Leigh\u2019s forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty direct, and a little presumptuous, but she\u2019s a Yankee, so she\u2019s a little different, and we have to take that into account. Bless her heart. And far as I know, none of you Holland girls, with the exception of your momma, have ever been involved with men who were married or otherwise engaged.\u201d Her brow smoothed. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to have a talk with Elise and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, but no.\u201d Tears pricked at Summer\u2019s eyes, and she couldn\u2019t claim not to know why. Jemma Leigh wanted to defend her. Her throat grew thick. She needed to leave before she did something dumb, like promise to have coffee again or trade phone numbers.</p><p>\u201cI have to go let Blackbeard out,\u201d Summer said, jumping to her feet. She grabbed her purse and sunglasses, shielding her eyes with the latter.</p><p>Jemma Leigh tipped back her head. \u201cIt was really nice having coffee with you. Most people think I\u2019m nothing but boobs and blond hair\u2014which I am, but you listened to me. Well, Jeremy does too, but he also likes boobs and blond hair so he might be a little biased.\u201d</p><p>Could this day get any worse?</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t want to be thanked. She\u2019d been purposefully quiet to keep their one-sided conversation going. She\u2019d been a user, like Gabriel had always accused her of being, when they\u2019d get into a particularly nasty fight. So she did what any Holland woman would have done in the same situation.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have coffee again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh smile was brighter than the sun when she accepted.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Gabriel scrubbed his hand across his face, stood up, walked to the door of his office, and then made himself go sit down behind his desk.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t go down there. No way, no how. There was no way he\u2019d walk the two blocks to Carolina Dreams and confront Summer, mostly because he wanted to confront her.</p><p>It was best he didn\u2019t concern himself with her at all. He\u2019d made a promise to Elise, and he was determined to keep it. He owed it to her.</p><p>\u201cYeah, because only doing something because you think you owe them has always worked out so well for you, Edwards,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Noah Sawyer walked in Gabriel\u2019s office, sitting in the nearest chair. \u201cYou look amazingly happy right now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rolled his eyes. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to go out with Carlos and me tonight? Sort of a pre-bachelor party before the bachelor party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t wait two more days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight make hump day better.\u201d Noah rubbed his chin. \u201cThis morning, Stacey decided to break things off to go find herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the pool guy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel sucked in air through his teeth. \u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to find out now, then years down the road, I guess,\u201d Noah said. \u201cRose Holland warned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone warned you,\u201d Gabriel pointed out. Noah\u2019s ex had never wanted an exclusive relationship, but she\u2019d tried. And failed, apparently. \u201cWho did Rose recommend?\u201d</p><p>Noah grunted. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need Rose\u2019s advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who used to date her sister and then tried to date Rose herself,\u201d Noah reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI never dated Rose. I just didn\u2019t like Romanov sniffing around her,\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>Noah held up his hands, palms facing out. \u201cSorry for bringing up a sore point. But yeah, I get you on the Romanovs. First your ex, and then your other ex\u2019s sister. Don\u2019t suppose you ever dated Daisy Barnes?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laughed. He couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cNo. Even if I had wanted to, I think Bella would have kicked my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of little sisters, would you be upset if I asked her out?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leveled Noah with a look. He\u2019d known his buddy since freshman year of college, and Noah had moved to Holland Springs from Charlotte to help start up their software company. Originally, Noah had been the money behind their company, Gabriel the people person, and Carlos the main brain.</p><p>\u201cIf your intentions are good, then no, I wouldn\u2019t mind. But if you\u2019re looking for a rebound, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d stay away and find someone whose fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t run off to marry another woman the day before he and Bella were supposed to secretly elope.\u201d There were very few times Gabriel had been driven to the brink of violence since he\u2019d been adopted by the Edwards\u2019 family. Peter leaving Gabriel\u2019s sister to marry his own father\u2019s widow was one of them.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThanks for the warning. I\u2019ll think of a different way to get over Stacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServing others always makes me forget about my problems,\u201d Gabriel said.</p><p>Noah grinned, green eyes gleaming with humor. \u201cI have something really dirty to say to that, but since it would be wasted on you, I\u2019ll keep it to myself.\u201d</p><p>Wait, he couldn\u2019t take a racy joke now? \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve known you. Dude, you\u2019re slightly uptight.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel made a face. \u201cAnd you\u2019re slightly too old to call anyone dude.\u201d</p><p>That only made Noah laugh. \u201cDamn, I\u2019d hoped Elise would loosen you up, but I guess my fantasy of uptight librarian/wildcat in the bedroom is just that\u2014a fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been fantasizing about Elise?\u201d The thought made him a little jealous.</p><p>\u201cNah, not your librarian. More of a general librarian fantasy,\u201d Noah clarified. He ran a hand through his short, dark hair. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to knock off early. Did I tell you I\u2019m building my first house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly three times yesterday, twice this morning, and now, but I\u2019m not keeping count.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabbed a piece of paper from Gabriel\u2019s desk, balled it up, and threw it at him. With a laugh, Gabriel ducked and caught it, tossing it back at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019m done.\u201d Noah stood, made to leave, and then paused. \u201cLook, I know Summer\u2019s back in town, and if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle Summer.\u201d Famous last words. Gabriel grimaced.</p><p>Noah eyed him for a moment, before saying, \u201cAre you sure, because if she needs anything, I can take care of it, in a totally responsible, non-creepy manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find me, if you change your mind.\u201d Noah finally walked away.</p><p>Gabriel stayed seated at his desk, staring at nothing outside the window, until she appeared. A lone butterfly seemed to follow her as she walked. He strode to the window, opening the blinds a little wider.</p><p>Summer wore a simple dress with short sleeves. Her pale hair was caught up in a long ponytail, and she looked to be deep in thought.</p><p>Probably wondering how to best use him.</p><p>He banished the dark thought. It wasn\u2019t her fault that she came to him for things. It was a pattern they\u2019d repeated for so long that it had become second nature.</p><p>Pushing her sunglasses up to the top of her head, she lifted her face to the sky and smiled. He sucked in a breath at her beauty, at the vulnerability he knew still existed inside, but that she refused to let anyone see.</p><p>Out of nowhere, dozens of butterflies enveloped Summer, their delicate wings transporting him back to the day he\u2019d fallen in love with her. Real love, not the crush he\u2019d been harboring since he was ten.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they beautiful, Gabriel?\u201d she whispered, her eyes dark and rich. Sweet, just like her. \u201cHave you ever seen anything so pretty in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered and wrapped his arms around her body. Her dark gaze grew shy even as he grew bold. She was only thirteen to his fifteen. He had to remember that.</p><p>She licked her lips. It was all the encouragement he needed.</p><p>He kissed her and kissed her again, until his heart felt like it would fly away with the butterflies.</p><p>Summer\u2019s gaze caught his. She smiled. No, she smirked at him, and then blew a kiss his way, like she knew exactly what he\u2019d been reliving.</p><p>His jaw clenched.</p><p>Not again. This time he wouldn\u2019t be weak. He would remain strong.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The humid morning had turned into perfect North Carolina summer weather with blue skies, fluffy clouds, and the occasional gentle breeze. Couples strolled along Broad Street, while downtown employees exited the local eateries with take-out bags. American Flags waved, in honor of the soldiers still serving in a war on a foreign land.</p><p>Ladybugs flittered by, almost too quick to catch. Her hand shot out, closing around one. A mother pushing a double stroller gave her a strange look as she passed by. Slowly opening her hand, she found the red and black insect on the corner of her palm. The perfect companion for killing time while waiting for Harrison Collins to get back from lunch.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t easy walking along the streets of a town that hated the very thought of her, but it was her own fault. Perpetuating the every-Holland-woman-was-after-your-man legend seemed to have that effect on people.</p><p>Not to mention the times she\u2019d padded her pockets in the General Store with cans of fruit, toothbrushes and toothpaste, or slipped a pair of shoes for Skye in her purse, without paying. But her sisters had been hungry, she had been in charge, and none of them had money.</p><p>There had been a big part of her that demanded she take from the people of Holland Springs. People so high and mighty that they couldn\u2019t help three little girls who went to bed hungry every time their mother didn\u2019t bother to come home from her \u2018dates\u2019, but let them have a relationship problem? They practically beat down the front door of Strawberry Grove. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sighed.</p><p>Three little girls left to defend for themselves. Three little girls who wore clothes decades out of date. Clothes stored in steamer trunks that smelled of dried flowers.</p><p>Tiny feet tickled her skin as the bug crawled. A small smile pushed up the corners of her mouth. She held up her hand, puckered her lips, and blew gently until the ladybug flew away.</p> <p>Her sister, Rose, hadn\u2019t minded, mostly because Azalea would give them some story about each item belonging to a particular Poppy Holland. Summer hadn\u2019t believed her for one minute.</p><p>Okay, so she had believed her mother, maybe even smiled and giggled as Azalea sighed dreamily about the former lovers of their great-something or another grandmother.</p><p>When Azalea was home, the entire house came alive. They\u2019d spend hours giggling, making love potions, and chasing Blackbeard. Hours and hours playing in an old house full of ghosts, make-believe, and laughter.</p><p>All that changed when Azalea had finally agreed to quit homeschooling them\u2014not that anyone could call learning math, science, and reading from the family\u2019s potions book a state-approved curriculum. The baby had wanted to go, and no one said no to Skye, so off they went.</p><p>The window of a children\u2019s dress shop caught her eye. She stopped and turned. Child-sized mannequins, all sweetly dressed in ruffles and bows, with matching shoes, were on display.</p> <p>Summer held her hands out at her sides, the reflection of her fingers touching the smaller, plastic ones. She and her sisters had walked, hand in hand, to the end of their road to wait for the bus. Just the three of them, with dust on their scuffed-up shoes and anticipation making their little hearts beat fast.</p><p>Anticipation had quickly turned to dread when they couldn\u2019t find a seat and kids began to whisper, until, that is, a familiar face with a friendly smile had flashed from the back of the bus.</p><p>Gabriel Edwards\u2014their guardian angel. He\u2019d waved them over, giving up his seat to sit across the aisle.</p><p>My angel.</p><p>Bittersweet emotions gathered in her chest. In the darkest and happiest hours of her life, Gabriel had been there for her. Except once. But it had been enough to sever the ties that had bound them together.</p><p>A sharp whistle pierced her memories.</p> <p>Not this. Couldn\u2019t she walk down the street without someone harassing her? With a frown, she glanced over her shoulder, but only found the town\u2019s trash collectors pointing at their next stop.</p><p>She tucked her hair behind her ear, and then resumed her walk.</p><p>The Bradford Pear trees lining each side of the street had gone from showy white blossoms to full-on lime green leaves. Shop doors were propped open with daily sale signs, or large pots of in-season flowers.</p><p>Her thoughts turned back to Gabriel (as if he\u2019d ever left them). She had to see him today. That glimpse of him, standing in the window of his office, had taken her breath away. She wanted her breath back, and the only way to do it was in person.</p><p>Candles set out on a half-off sale table sparked to life as she passed by them.</p><p>Mr. Crane, a middle-aged man wearing a paisley shirt and striped shorts, looked from the lighter in his hand, then back at the table. He scratched his head. \u201cLisa sent me trick candles. No wonder they didn\u2019t sell,\u201d he muttered, heading back inside his shop.</p><p>Summer bit back a smile, running a finger along one candle, making the flame dance and her skin grow hot. Water dripped on her cheeks from the green and gold striped awning. She turned and walked away, swiping at the moisture.</p><p>\u201cStop right there, missy.\u201d</p> <p>Missy? Summer pivoted on her heel, arching a brow at Mr. Crane. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can help me by putting back the candle you just stole from me.\u201d Mr. Crane\u2019s eyes narrowed as he crossed his arms. The supersized black magic marker stuck out on one side. If she pulled it, would he go flying in the air like a balloon shooting out helium?</p><p>The marker flew out of his hand, hitting the store\u2019s brick fa\u00e7ade.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take your candle.\u201d She yanked open her purse. Humiliation coursed through her veins, heating her skin as she waited for him to search it. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d A part of her wanted to tell Mr. Crane where he could stick his candle. And maybe if she wasn\u2019t so tired of playing the immature shrew, she would have.</p><p>Mr. Crane poked a finger in, moving around her wallet, brush, lip gloss, and roll of lifesavers. He glanced back at her. \u201cPockets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She gestured at her shorts, the pockets ripped and showing through the bottom, as they lay perfectly flat against her body. Stepping to one side, she squatted on the ground and looked under his table. \u201cI see a candle by the left side, in the back.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Crane\u2019s skinny face flushed. \u201cThere\u2019s still the matter of the three stained glass suncatchers\u2014each one had a different symbol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d But she did. Three small squares. One with flowers, the second with a sun setting, and the third with angel wings. All gifts for the people she\u2019d loved. A twinge of guilt, like a wasp\u2019s sting, pricked at her.</p><p>\u201cFourteen years and counting, Miss Holland.\u201d Mr. Crane tapped his head. \u201cLike a steel trap.\u201d</p><p>Of that, she had no doubt. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have me arrested?\" Way to go, Summer. The urge to slap herself rode her hard. But could she really change years of habit, years of being on the defensive, every time she stepped foot in this town in only a matter of days?</p><p>Mr. Crane\u2019s face softened. \u201cLittle girls trying to think of others don\u2019t rank high on my list of reasons for calling the sheriff, even if they go about it the wrong way.\u201d He retrieved the candle out from under the table, and then glanced at her. \u201cBut you\u2019re not a little girl anymore, Summer.\u201d</p><p>Unsure what to make of his conflicting statements, she searched through her purse, pulled out two twenties from her wallet, and smacked the bills on the table. A hard look into his sympathetic eyes almost made her apologize.</p><p>\u201cI was never a little girl,\u201d she said. Not like he meant it. Little girls worried about being invited to their friends\u2019 birthday parties, not if they had enough food in the pantry. She sure as hell never worried about being invited to any parties\u2014mostly because she\u2019d never been invited by other girls her age.</p><p>Dark clouds swept in. The wind picked up, swirling the loose pieces of hair around her face. Maybe she was crazy for coming here, for wanting to be a part of a family again, but she longed to be a part of Ivy\u2019s life.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t quite sure what her role would be. The loving aunt who just happened to be the biological mother? The loving aunt whose butt would be hauled off to jail if anyone ever pressed charges against her?</p><p>Awesome role model for Ivy.</p><p>In the park across the street, she saw Jemma Leigh, Janie Leigh, and Jeremy playing on the swings. They all sat in one, pumping their legs and laughing. The little girl smiled and then jumped, falling to her knees. Both of her parents rushed to her, and Summer\u2019s heart caught in her throat.</p><p>Little chubby arms reached for them. Gentle words and comforting kisses chased away the tears, but not the storm rolling in. The three of them gathered their things and headed to the parking lot nearby.</p><p>The wind blew harder. Leaves shook on trees.</p><p>Now Summer knew exactly why she\u2019d come back to Holland Springs. She knew exactly what she had to do. All she needed was some guidance on how to go about it.</p><p>A quick stop by Pellum &amp; Foster confirmed what she knew, or an appointment wouldn\u2019t have been available otherwise. It was a sign that she was on the right track, and no matter what, she would stay on it.</p><p>Exiting the building, dandelion puffs floated in front of her, carrying with them the scent of freshly cut grass. Of sunshine. And...strawberries. Her lover smelled of all these things.</p><p>Gabriel.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t her lover, had never been her lover\u2014not in the way a man and woman came together. In the past, she thought he hadn\u2019t wanted to be her lover, and would never be her lover with the way fate interfered in their lives.</p><p>Breathing deeply to clear her head, she opened the glass doors to the bank and went inside, blowing past all the customers, the tellers, and even the bank president\u2019s secretary.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just go in there without an appointment,\u201d his secretary all but screeched at her.</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d Summer twisted the doorknob and let herself inside.</p><p>Harrison Collins, the bank\u2019s president, sat at a desk large enough to command Wall Street. He didn\u2019t look surprised to see her as he removed his glasses and rubbed them against a cloth to clean them.</p><p>\u201cI need to get money from the bank,\u201d she said.</p><p>Replacing his glasses, he said, \u201cThis is a first\u2014a criminal informing the victim of her intent before it happens.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t this just her day to be reminded of her past deeds? She crossed the room to his desk, plunking her bright green purse down on the mahogany surface. \u201cStick to your day job, Harrison.\u201d She sat down in one of the high-backed chairs in his office. \u201cRose said you would be able to help me. I\u2019m running Carolina Dreams while she\u2019s gone, and I\u2019d like to be able to shop.\u201d And eat. Basic things she would never admit to him.</p><p>\u201cRose asked me to set up a separate account for you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach plummeted to her feet. Rose didn\u2019t trust her.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted you to have something of your own.\u201d He slid a small card her way. \u201cThis is the account information for the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat password would you like for the log-in portion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that supposed to be private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t arson supposed to be illegal?\u201d</p><p>Regret poked at her, but only for the hurt she caused Rose. Burning down Strawberry Grove had made Summer\u2019s heart dance and sing. Setting fire to a legacy that had done nothing more than confine the women in her family to a role the newest generation of Hollands no longer wanted to play had given her pure joy.</p><p>As she watched the flames grow, the pain that had been living inside of her seemed to extinguish, but only for a short time though. She had been shortsighted, unable to touch an enormous sum of money that would\u2019ve made it possible for her to never come back to Holland Springs, possible for her to take care of her daughter, without worrying about food, shelter, and clothing.</p><p>Eventually, she\u2019d given it all to charity. Specifically she had anonymously donated every penny to the organization Gabriel had started with his church. It served at-risk kids in the surrounding counties.</p><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d she managed to say without blushing, even as Harrison cast her a sharp look. Of course, she\u2019d pick the nickname of the man who\u2019d wanted to save her. Gabriel was always on her mind.</p><p>Glancing around the room to avoid his knowing eyes, her own widened. There were pictures everywhere... of her. Of Rose. Of Skye. And not creepy pictures either. School pictures of the three of them, graduation pictures (though not of Rose), baby pictures\u2014</p><p>She swallowed, her fingers digging into the arms of the chair. Pain radiated from the tips. He had pictures of Ivy. A knot grew in her throat, breathing a soon to be impossibility.</p><p>\u201cMy granddaughter\u2019s pretty, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he asked, handing over another card and a piece of paper to sign. \u201cLast week I showed off the picture she drew for me to all the bank board members. Said I had a Georgia O\u2019Keefe in the making.\u201d</p><p>How grandfatherly he relayed this information. How totally hypocritical. \u201cLorelei loosen your leash?\u201d She flung the card into her purse, uncaring where it landed.</p><p>\u201cMy wife has accepted my choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy\u2019s not yours, not by blood,\u201d she pointed out, wanting to wipe that proud look off his face.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d He took off his glasses, polishing the lenses with a soft cloth. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a better man.\u201d</p><p>Summer made a noise of disbelief. The world was short of good men, much less better ones.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been treated right, and neither has Rose...and in some instances Skye, but things are different. The old guard is passing and with the influx of new people, things are changing. For the better.\u201d Harrison had always had a way with words. He could also read people, like Rose. Maybe she\u2019d inherited that from him, and not some supposedly witchy ancestress.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I plan on staying here for a very long time, whether the old guard likes it or not.\u201d She stood. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have another appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really none of your business.\u201d Besides, if he knew, then he\u2019d find a way to tell Rose, then she would come back, and Summer would lose her nerve.</p><p>Her sisters\u2019 happiness had always been her biggest weakness.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Summer stood at the edge of the party, near the white tent in the middle of the expansive gardens at The Chesson House Bed and Breakfast. Out of habit, she tipped up her chin, and fisted her hands on her hips, daring anyone to take a jab at her, but no one did.</p><p>She shivered in the shade of a great oak tree.</p><p>No one noticed her at all, just like Jemma Leigh said when Summer had shown her the invitation Rose had received to the Montoya-Wilson rehearsal party.</p><p>Except one man.</p><p>He stood apart. Tall and broad shouldered, with hair black as a midnight sky. Despite being too far away to actually see the color of his eyes, she knew they were deepest blue and framed with heavy, long lashes.</p><p>Gabriel Edwards had a beautiful face to match those eyes, but unlike some men, he didn\u2019t use it against women. No, he saw through a woman, made her feel guilty about her past deeds (true or fabricated)\u2014and crimes she hadn\u2019t yet committed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Elise moved closer to him, her brows so tight Summer was sure she was furious. Yet he kept staring, lips full and lush enough to tempt a saint. A wave of heat passed through her, and she couldn\u2019t stop the shiver following in its wake.</p><p>Elise whispered in his ear, making him smile, but then his attention turned back to Summer and a frown appeared. Of course he wouldn\u2019t smile at her. Why would he ever smile at her?</p> <p>Why did she still want him to smile at her?</p><p>She gritted her teeth to keep the scream from breaking free.</p><p>He started in her direction, and try as she might, Summer couldn\u2019t stop her heart from racing.</p><p>Finally, he was coming to her. Though she had to acknowledge that she came to him, first, by showing up to a party that Rose had been invited to because she\u2019d been the one to introduce the couple to one another.</p><p>His gaze flickered over her. She shivered again. \u201cDid you bring a sweater?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo much skin for you, angel?\u201d she cooed, fully aware her dress showed nothing at all. It barely dipped in the front.</p><p>His lips thinned, but his voice and demeanor remained the same. Calm, helpful, and exasperating. \u201cYou looked cold, standing in the shade, and with that dress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoticed it, did you?\u201d She smoothed her hand down the front. \u201cLustful thoughts are a big sin, angel, even for someone as pure as you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t we ever have a normal conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to leave. Crashing a rehearsal dinner is a little much, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Heat flooded her cheeks. \u201cI think I have an invitation, and your name wasn\u2019t on the RSVP.\u201d</p><p>He gently grabbed her arm, and a thrill of awareness passed through her. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Summer. Carlos and Shelia are nice people. They don\u2019t deserve whatever you have planned tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no lap dances for the groom-to-be. Got it,\u201d she said with a smile. Inside though, everything hurt. Everything was wrong.</p><p>\u201cSummer Jean Holland,\u201d he growled. \u201cStop it, right now.\u201d</p><p>She managed to blink up at him. \u201cDid you want one instead?\u201d Tilting her head to one side, she peered at him through her lashes. \u201cI suppose I could work you in.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed, briefly. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have a choice,\u201d she muttered as he practically dragged her by the arm across the yard.</p><p>He led her to the other side of the tent, where the sound of voices and music were drowned out by distance and generators.</p> <p>\u201cSo how did you meet Mary Sue Perfect?\u201d she asked, and then cursed herself for sounding like a jealous witch. Forget sounding like one\u2014she was one.</p><p>\u201cElise and I met at The Sweet Spot, before Daisy closed shop and moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that special?\u201d she sneered.</p><p>His gaze sliced across the way. \u201cAt the time, I thought it was very special.\u201d</p><p>She followed his gaze and frowned. The bridal party sat at their tables, laughing, eating, and toasting. He probably wished he were with them, with people who knew what fork to use, exactly what to wear for every occasion, and how to make small talk.</p><p>She fixed her attention back to Gabriel. \u201cDon\u2019t let me keep you from the future Mrs. Edwards. I\u2019m sure you two will have plenty to keep you busy on your honeymoon. Lots of Bible reading and speaking in tongues. Although, the laying on of hands is probably a no-no. I\u2019m sure Elise can find tons for you to read on making love, though application is necessary\u2014not just single-handed experimentation.\u201d</p><p>His head whipped around so fast she was sure if it hadn\u2019t been attached, it would have frisbeed across the garden. He blinked at her, and then a smile covered his face, victorious.</p><p>Running away would be really good right about now, but her feet wouldn\u2019t move. Heat crept up her chest, then neck and cheeks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>An annoyingly adorable dimple appeared in his left cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re jealous,\u201d he said with an incredulous laugh. \u201cSummer Holland is actually jealous over me.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She\u2019d gone too far. \u201cI am not,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, you are. It\u2019s eating you alive to know that I\u2019m with Elise, that I haven\u2019t been by Carolina Dreams to see you, and that you were the one to come to me, and not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t deny the truth, but she also didn\u2019t have to acknowledge it. Instead, she crossed her arms over her chest and glared at him.</p><p>Gabriel watched as the roses that had bloomed on her cheeks withered away, leaving nothing but too-pale skin. Maybe he should give her a break, but it had been a slight balm to his damaged ego to know she was jealous. Okay, so, it had been more than a slight balm. It had been a heady rush all the way to his toes and back.</p><p>Summer was jealous. Of him.</p><p>But hearing her deny it in a voice he hadn\u2019t heard in years...well, it had skewered him straight through the heart. She\u2019d looked...heartbroken. The sun had chosen to hide behind the clouds at that very moment, shadows washing over her beautiful face and lending credence to his theory.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t he a big man for getting one last dig in at her?</p><p>Summer glared at him, arms crossing. This woman he recognized. The familiar Summer had returned. Nose tilting, face defiant, and attitude at the ready to make everyone uncomfortable. A thousand ugly memories invaded his mind. Daring him, it seemed, to prove her right. That he was the hypocritical, holier than thou, son of a preacher she regularly accused him of being.</p><p>Not that she was far off.</p><p>Despite apologizing to her, despite helping her whenever she needed it, she hadn\u2019t let up on him. \u201cI wish you and Elise nothing but the best.\u201d Her voice was sharp, breaking into his memories.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d</p><p>Silence reigned as her pretty brown eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy was Elise holding the bouquet when I showed up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe stood in for the bride and groom, during the rehearsal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She scrunched her nose. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad luck, remember?\u201d he added. This wasn\u2019t so bad. Maybe they could have a civil conversation.</p><p>She fisted a hand on her hip and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a sin to believe in luck?\u201d</p><p>Not this again. It always came back to this. Her perception of him, his life, his work, and his family. He couldn\u2019t please Summer, not when he\u2019d fallen short of being there for her when it had counted the most. Since then, he tried his damndest to catch her whenever she fell. But as soon as she felt his arms around her, she shoved him away. Or took his money and his truck.</p><p>But could he really accuse her of taking something he freely gave?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter, not this time. This time he would remember. This time he wouldn\u2019t let his need to be her knight in shining armor get in the way of his happiness. He could be happy with Elise. She was... He mentally floundered as his brain searched for adjectives to describe a woman like Elise, but all he could come up with was the opposite of Summer.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked. \u201cMoney or a place to stay?\u201d Better to get this out of the way, so he could help her and then she could do what she needed to, and leave. Just like always.</p><p>Panic flared in her eyes, and then... hurt? She blinked, and it was gone. \u201cWhy does it matter, unless you want me in your bed? I think I could lower my fee for you, for old time\u2019s sake and all.\u201d</p><p>And so it began. The verbal sparring that did nothing for him or for her. It only served to widen the gap between them, and no matter what he said, the more time they spent together, the worse it became.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d he asked, gentling his tone.</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual\u2014seduce every available man in Holland Springs.\u201d That cute nose of hers, one that he used to kiss at every opportunity, tilted up in the air. A big clue she was full of it, or embarrassed. Possibly, she was both.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to have an adult conversation, I\u2019m here, but until then, be nice to Elise and everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elise already warned me away from you,\u201d she said with a roll of her eyes. \u201cLike I could convince you to take a walk on the dark side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean she warned you?\u201d Elise hadn\u2019t said anything about meeting Summer.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing, really.\u201d Summer shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t remember most of the conversation, just the gist of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet here you are,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI plan to stay here for a really long time. You can\u2019t make me leave this time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never wanted her to leave, not matter what she thought, but if he denied it, then they would start yelling at each other, and this night wasn\u2019t about them. It was about Carlos and Shelia, two great friends who deserved a night without drama.</p><p>\u201cHave fun tonight.\u201d He turned to walk away, but she stopped him with the lightest of pressure on his arm.</p><p>\u201cWant your truck back?\u201d Keys jingled near his ear. \u201cThe shocks are shot to hell from all the off-road riding I\u2019ve been doing. But you can fix that. You were always good with your hands, angel.\u201d</p><p>Pinching the bridge of his nose with his thumb and pointer finger, he closed his eyes and counted to fifty. It didn\u2019t help. He opened his eyes, then looked down at the hand on his elbow, at the simple silver ring on her pointer finger, and fought to stay calm.</p><p>Finally, he managed to say, \u201cKeep it.\u201d Then he gently pulled away, careful not to embarrass her, and walked away.</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to him until he\u2019d sat down beside Elise, that it was the second time in his entire life he\u2019d had the strength to walk away from Summer.</p><p>And it cut as deeply as the first.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Gabriel stared at the silver truck sitting in the parking lot. It sat off to the side, under the yard light.</p><p>Over the years, he had missed driving it. It had been the first brand new vehicle he\u2019d ever owned, but it wasn\u2019t the vehicle he\u2019d picked Carlos up in. No, his used red truck was parked beside Elise\u2019s sedan. Despite the flashy color, it had nothing on the silver truck. No bells or whistles. Only four-wheel drive, a radio, and working a/c.</p><p>He moved closer to the truck, inspecting the body and finding it in nearly perfect condition. Opening the driver\u2019s side, he leaned in to find the interior as pristine as the body and the key stuck halfway in the ignition. Jerking them out, he dropped them in his front pocket and locked the door.</p><p>Where was Summer? Concern welled up in his chest, making his collar tight. He loosened his tie and unbuttoned the top two buttons of his shirt. He had watched her as she disappeared inside the old house, but had lost track of her after that.</p><p>Bits of oyster shells crunched under his dress shoes as he walked out to the road.</p><p>Looking right, and then left, he found the road empty. Maybe he should take a quick ride down the road, toward Strawberry Grove, to make sure Summer was okay. Sunset was the worst time for someone walking down the side of the road. Visibility for drivers was horrible.</p><p>Then again, would she welcome his concern? And why did he keep thinking Summer was his concern?</p><p>He jammed a hand in his pocket and pulled out his keys, grimacing. As if he really needed to ask himself that question.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel turned and found Carlos, grinning at him. \u201cDinner\u2019s over. Bachelor party begins.\u201d</p><p>At Gabriel\u2019s silence, his buddy\u2019s grin fell. \u201cOh come on, man. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d The truck keys burned in the palm of his hand. Gabriel knew exactly what his friend didn\u2019t want him to do.</p><p>\u201cGo chasing after Summer.\u201d Carlos nodded at Gabriel\u2019s truck. \u201cYou got your truck back. Be done with her.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem\u2014he and Summer were never done. They had too many unanswered questions, too many what ifs. There was no water under the bridge for them. Their bridge was six feet under, and the river was still swelling.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to walk home by herself. It\u2019s almost dark.\u201d He reached in his other pocket, drew out the second set of keys, and tossed them to Carlos.</p><p>\u201cNot every woman wants to be rescued, Gabe,\u201d Carlos said as he caught the keys. \u201cSometimes a good buddy needs rescuing from himself. Let\u2019s round up the guys and go.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred, Gabriel shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. I can\u2019t leave her out there.\u201d</p><p>Carlos frowned, running a hand through his hair. \u201cHow about this\u2014we stick to the plan and check on Summer as we drive to Wilmington. If she\u2019s okay, we keep driving. If she\u2019s not, we call the cops and still keep driving. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a warrant for her arrest for something.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel knew Carlos was trying to be a good friend by offering to save him from a woman he thought was bad news. He\u2019d known Summer as long as Gabriel had, longer really, since Gabriel hadn\u2019t moved to Holland Springs until he was nine. But it still pissed him off. \u201cDon\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being a realist.\u201d Carlos held up his hands in surrender. \u201cBut hey, if you want to ruin what you have with Elise, who am I to stop you?\u201d</p><p>Crap. He\u2019d forgotten about her. Yet another reason Carlos\u2019s warning made sense. However, when it came to Summer, right was wrong, down was up, and left was right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m checking on the woman, not marrying her,\u201d Gabriel snapped.</p><p>His buddy rolled his eyes and dropped his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted.\u201d Gabriel smiled, already at the truck and opening the driver\u2019s side door. He jammed the key in the ignition, but hesitated at turning it. The last time he\u2019d found her walking down the side of the road, he\u2019d picked her up and had driven to The Pointe. From there, things had gotten really hot, steaming up the windows hot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d been all of seventeen and Summer fifteen. They\u2019d spent the entire months of July and August making out in his old, beat-up truck. But he wasn\u2019t seventeen anymore. He was a grown man with goals and accomplishments that had nothing to do with Summer.</p><p>Keep telling yourself that.</p><p>Gabriel wiped sweaty palms on his khakis, started up the truck, put it in gear, and made a left onto Highway 13. As he drove, fireflies dotted the fields and ditches along the road, blinking in and out of sight. The closer he got to Strawberry Grove, the more fireflies appeared.</p> <p>The sun slipped under the horizon, making his running lights visible along the blacktop. Great. Just great. How was he supposed to find her?</p><p>Light glowed from the forest of pine trees by the old Holland place. He slowly braked, put the truck in park, and rolled down the passenger side window, watching as the bugs blinked on and off.</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, he\u2019d unbuckled his seatbelt, opened the door, and strode into the forest. He crept through the woods, quiet as a predator hunting his prey, and then came to a sight that stole his breath away.</p><p>Summer, all alone in a meadow of spring flowers. Well, if you didn\u2019t count the hundreds of fireflies dancing around her.</p><p>Laughing with pure joy, she waved a hand in the air. The fireflies followed her movements, reminding him of kids playing with sparklers on the Fourth of July.</p> <p>His gut clenched.</p><p>The fireflies continued their dance, moths joining in. Something swept passed him. He followed the blur and realized it was a bat, mostly likely trying to eat the conveniently provided snack.</p><p>Summer laughed again, drawing his attention back to her. She threw out her arms and spun around. He felt himself drift closer, like he was one of those moths... and she the flame.</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d Her name a prayer on his lips. A plea in his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Summer snapped. \u201cI gave you back your truck.\u201d</p><p>He paused at the vehemence in her tone. \u201cThank you, but I wanted to check on you and make sure you got home okay.\u201d</p> <p>He fully expected her to ask who would be checking on him, because he lived by himself. Instead, she tilted her head, giving him a small smile. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I walk you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left it on the road.\u201d He nodded his head to the right.</p><p>The moon came out from behind the clouds, illuminating the field to near daylight.</p><p>She scrunched her nose. \u201cSomeone could steal it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they need it more than me,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cGood Samaritans have nothing on you.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cWhen people are desperate, they do desperate things. Those of us who can help, should.\u201d</p><p>Wrong thing to say. \u201cYou Jesus freaks amaze me.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cBut you do give good lip service.\u201d</p><p>Irritation rose, making his jaw clench before he answered. \u201cWas it lip service to let you drive off with my truck all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me?\u201d She shook her head and smiled. \u201cAngel, you had no idea what I was going to do that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He crossed his arms and stared down at the lovely face highlighted by the moonlight. \u201cLet\u2019s think about this\u2014the gas pump only takes pre-pays. I chose to go inside to buy a bottle of Cheerwine.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faltered and a pink tongue licked at her lips. \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019d give anyone in need the clothes off my back.\u201d He uncrossed his arms. \u201cIncluding you.\u201d Especially her. Always her. No matter how much it hurt when she threw it back in his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your pity or your charity. I don\u2019t need anything from anyone, especially you.\u201d</p><p>White-hot fury rose, but he remained calm. He had to, or he\u2019d lose control of the situation. \u201cI just need to know why you\u2019re here. I know what you said, but honey, you\u2019ve never stayed longer than a year at a time, since you turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>If he had a time limit, he could stay away from her. Keep his personal life going\u2014one that didn\u2019t involve the woman standing in front of him. The woman with pretty, dark eyes and pale, blond hair. The woman who\u2019d clawed his heart out at every turn, yet he kept offering it up on a platter.</p><p>A frown pulled down the corners of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d She leaned forward, placing a hand on his cheek. \u201cAfraid I\u2019ll steal you away from Elise?\u201d</p><p>Yes. Only it wouldn\u2019t be stealing. More than likely, he\u2019d go with her, willingly. Some things never changed, but he could. \u201cYou know what\u2014I don\u2019t care. Stay as long as you like. Do whatever you like. You don\u2019t need my permission, and you\u2019re not that damn irresistible.\u201d Turning, he marched away from her.</p><p>Summer\u2019s eyes grew wide. Oh God, no. His disapproval she could handle. His infuriatingly calm manner she could handle. But an indifferent Gabriel? The one who\u2019d been ignoring her all week... \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>Still, he strode away.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, please.\u201d</p><p>That made him stop.</p><p>She ran to him, and then around to face him.</p><p>A cool night breeze whispered through the pine trees. The sound of crickets chirping and the steady rattling of locust blended to create a symphony so soothing that Summer almost forgot where she was. Almost.</p><p>In a loose tie, button-down shirt, and khaki pants, Gabriel was her fantasy come to life. Not that she\u2019d ever let him in on it. No, she preferred to let him think that her type rode into town on a Harley and out of it, with her on the back.</p><p>He gazed at her, expectation on his face. But what could she say\u2014don\u2019t leave me? Please keep caring about me, because you\u2019re the only one in the entire world who does?</p><p>Maybe she needed to be truthful for once. Maybe she needed to quit saying the most outrageous and hurtful things to him.</p><p>Taking a leap of faith, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard what I said.\u201d No way would she repeat herself. It was bad enough she\u2019d apologized in the first place. It was bad enough that she was lowering her defenses.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you.\u201d Simple, but powerful words.</p><p>\u201cThe reason why I\u2019m here is because I miss my family. I\u2019d like to be a part of one again.\u201d Growing up with a mother like Azalea, a woman who came and went as frequently as the tides, Summer had always dreamed of a home. Of family meals at a table set for four. A husband that would come in the door with a kiss for her, while he tried to navigate the room with two rugrats stuck to his legs.</p><p>After dinner, this fictional man would ask about her day while they did the dishes. Then they\u2019d make love... in a bed with a mattress made of down feathers.</p><p>Yeah, she was all kinds of screwed up for her deepest, most guarded, secrets to be so traditionally boring.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with that at all. I\u2019m happy you want to reconnect with Rose and Ivy.\u201d Taking her hand, he said, \u201cLet me drive you the rest of the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But she pulled her hand away.</p><p>His dark brows drew together, but he didn\u2019t say anything, merely started walking to the edge of the woods. She followed him.</p><p>The moon might be as bright as day in the field, but the forest was another matter altogether, so she stayed close. Close enough to touch him. Tempting her to slide her arm through that triangular gap between his elbow and lean body.</p><p>If she was really honest, she was even more tempted to slide her hands all over him, to learn the hard planes and new muscles that hadn\u2019t been there when they were teenagers, or even four years ago, when he would have held her hand while they walked. Back when he looked at her like she\u2019d hung the Corn Planting Moon in the sky.</p><p>Now Elise would be the one who hung the moon for Gabriel.</p><p>Stopping at the edge of the highway, she glanced at him. Gabriel stood, phone in his hand and his thumbs moving. \u201cCarlos is on his way.\u201d</p><p>There was a tiny prick at her heart, but she breathed through the pain. Besides, it was ridiculous to think he would want spend more time with her. She never made it easy for anyone to be around her, not even her sisters. Turning away, she eyed the silver truck idling in the middle of the road.</p><p>\u201cTaking your truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>Beams of light made her eyes squint. She put up a hand to shade them.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, let\u2019s go! We don\u2019t have all night,\u201d a man called out.</p><p>\u201cYeah, can\u2019t have Carlos out too late, or Shelia won\u2019t be able to display his nuts in her trophy case tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Noah. There\u2019s a lady present,\u201d Gabriel laughed, and then looked at her. \u201cSorry about the language.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the thought of him classifying her as a lady gave her pleasure, maybe even a little pride. \u201cI\u2019ve heard worse.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer to her, brushing the strand of hair that kept falling in her face. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. You deserve to be treated with respect.\u201d</p><p>A thrill ran through her body. Hugging him seemed exactly the right thing to do, but she gave him her brightest smile instead. \u201cHave fun, angel. Don\u2019t forget to tip your stripper in singles.\u201d Then she turned, but a warm hand on her arm guided her in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cTruck\u2019s this way, sweetheart. I told you I\u2019d drive you home, but Carlos showed up before I could. \u201d Another thrill at his touch, at his endearment. She was losing her ever-loving mind. This was Gabriel: he was like this to everyone.</p><p>Opening the door, he waited for her to climb inside. She stared at him, then the truck, and then back at him. Her brows were practically a part of her hairline. \u201cBut\u2014but I thought y\u2019all were taking your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d He grinned and pointed to the red truck a few feet in front of them. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019ve been driving all this time?\u201d</p><p>Speechless, she climbed in the cab and let him shut the door behind her. As the interior lights dimmed, she mouthed a \u2018thank you\u2019 to him. His grin widened before he jogged to his waiting friends. She could hear them laughing and calling each other names as he jumped inside.</p><p>The red truck took off, leaving her behind. She gripped the steering wheel, staring after the tail lights until she couldn\u2019t see them anymore.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019ll pay you back, angel,\u201d she said softly, with absolutely no malice in her words or meaning. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll see me and only smile, then go on with your life.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Pellum &amp; Foster was the newest and smallest law office in Holland Springs, but had an extremely large and powerful branch down in Wilmington, which was exactly why Summer had chosen to make an appointment with them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve reviewed the adoption paperwork, and frankly, Ms. Holland, you don\u2019t have a case,\u201d Ms. Foster began. \u201cThe minor child\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIvy,\u201d Summer corrected.</p><p>Ms. Foster smiled. \u201cIvy has been visited by DSS over the years, and they\u2019ve found no evidence of neglect or abuse. In fact, the\u2014Ivy is very-well taken care of, but I suppose this isn\u2019t news to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d Summer shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have asked Rose for help if I\u2019d thought otherwise. But I was desperate and most likely suffering from post-partum depression.\u201d At least, that was what Gabriel had told her. He had also given her the name of a therapist, but she\u2019d torn that card into pieces. Why should she go talk to someone when she was perfectly able to solve her own problem?</p><p>\u201cBe that as it may, you have limited resources, no place to stay, and you\u2019re unmarried. Three very big strikes against you.\u201d Ms. Foster wasn\u2019t unkind as she said this. She was to the point, which was exactly what Summer had wanted. \u201cYou also swore you weren\u2019t under duress when you signed away your parental rights to Ivy.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lied. Oh God, she had lied. She had been under so much duress that she was about to crack, but at the time, it was the right thing to do for Ivy and for herself.</p><p>\u201cI realize that, but you can see for yourself that I\u2019ve never been fired from a job, and I only quit when I had to move.\u201d Summer brushed a piece of hair out of her eyes. \u201cMy references are all there, and they\u2019re really good. Finding a permanent place to stay shouldn\u2019t be a problem, and it\u2019s not like I want to take my daughter away from here. I plan to live in Holland Springs, but as Ivy\u2019s mother, not her aunt.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Foster said nothing.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just give me the best case scenario of getting Ivy back. What would I have to do on my end?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a permanent residence, one that you don\u2019t mind being inspected by DSS, the Fire Chief, and a whole host of people who will work in the best interest of Ivy. You already have a job, but do you think Mrs. Holland will allow you to keep working there once she finds out what you\u2019re planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose made me co-owner.\u201d Ms. Foster blinked, and Summer had the grace to blush. \u201cI helped start the company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d the woman said, and then continued. \u201cEven with all of those taken care of, there is still the matter of your relationship status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSingle women raise children all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe court isn\u2019t concerned with other single women. They will be concerned with you. Short of finding a man who walks on water to be your husband, I\u2019m afraid your odds of getting custody of Ivy are slim to none. Honestly, your odds are practically non-existent, no matter what you do.\u201d</p><p>A man who walked on water? Summer smiled. There was only one man who fit the bill\u2014Gabriel Edwards. And she didn\u2019t care about practically non-existent odds, because practically mean there was still a chance she could prevail. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t be difficult at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without missing a beat, Ms. Foster said, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>Summer shook the woman\u2019s hand and headed outside, her mind full of plots to get Gabriel to help her.</p><p>She could trick him into marrying her. No, that was too 1800s.</p> <p>She could pay him to marry her. With what money? Besides, he wouldn\u2019t take it anyway.</p><p>So deep in thought, that she almost walked past the man she was plotting against.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d he said, in that deep voice of his that sounded like a caress.</p><p>Unfortunately, he\u2019d caught her off-guard, and she had no time to put on her mental armor. \u201cGabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin me for lunch?\u201d He gestured to the empty spot on the park bench. \u201cI packed extra.\u201d</p> <p>Wary, she sat down, but as far away from him as possible. \u201cI am hungry. My meeting took longer than expected.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow rose. \u201cMeeting?\u201d</p><p>Crap, she should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut. \u201cYeah, my monthly home-wreckers not so anonymous meeting. Though can one call it a meeting when I\u2019m the only member?\u201d</p><p>He scowled at her. \u201cStop putting yourself down like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying what everyone else does.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel handed her half of his sandwich. \u201cHoney, you haven\u2019t lived her in almost three years. So, how do you know what anyone around here is saying?\u201d</p> <p>He had a point, and Harrison had said the same thing. \u201cDo you remember when we used to meet under the second set of entwined dogwoods, and eat lunch during the summer?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, a far-off look appearing in his beautiful eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d always bring me lemon pound cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d bring me Pringles\u2014the cheese flavored ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAzalea wouldn\u2019t allow processed foods in the house,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI remember your fingers and mouth would be yellow-orange by the time you were finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you tasted like lemons,\u201d she giggled, and then smashed her lips together. Why did she have to bring that up?</p><p>\u201cCheese and lemons, who would have thought it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, that was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with reminiscing. We were childhood sweethearts, Summer, no matter how much you wish it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d She\u2019d never wished that either.</p><p>He smiled sadly at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Summer fell silent, and Gabriel did the same. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, and that bothered her all the more. It was easy and sweet and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI need your help,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>His blue eyes turned hard. \u201cI\u2019m listening, but I\u2019m not promising anything. Elise needs my full attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to help me get Ivy back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Was Summer out of her mind? Of course she was. How else could they have had a civil conversation for longer than a minute, besides insanity or divine intervention?</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to do anything beyond marrying me, and then we can get a divorce or an annulment after whatever requirements the state has is met,\u201d she said in all seriousness.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known one another for eighteen years, and in all that time, have I ever said I\u2019d get married just so I can get a divorce? And a planned one at that,\u201d he growled. He threw his lunch in the nearby trashcan. It was a good thing he\u2019d shared it with Summer, because his appetite was completely gone.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me,\u201d she said, her voice just as hard as his.</p><p>\u201cOwe you?\u201d His jaw clenched. \u201cI have done nothing but bend over backwards for you. I\u2019ve lost perfectly good relationships because of you. I put people who matter last because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople who matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, people who matter.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI have gone against advice from my friends, my parents, my ex-girlfriend, and even your sister to help you. It\u2019s cost me everything at times to help you, but do you appreciate that? Hell no.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes grew wide, but her mouth turned stubborn. \u201cI didn\u2019t make you choose to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do\u2014let you starve, freeze, and go homeless?\u201d</p><p>Birds in a nearby tree flew away, wings beating loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to believe me, yet you didn\u2019t. You believed what everyone else said about me, and not until you found out it wasn\u2019t true, did you apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat still bothers you?\u201d He threw his hands in the air. \u201cThe act of a dumb, insecure teenager not taking your word for something still bothers you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than something.\u201d She fisted her hands in her lap. \u201cI was called a whore and a slut. I was accused of sleeping with the entire football team, with teachers if I made a good grade, and if a couple broke up, it was because I screwed their boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, I wasn\u2019t there, then. I was in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where you were, but you could have stopped it when the rumors first started,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out what Patrick Johnson did to you, I made him pay...I broke his arm and knocked out three of his teeth.\u201d He jumped to his feet. \u201cDoes that make you happy? I beat the living hell out of another human being for hurting the girl I loved.\u201d</p><p>Shock registered on her face. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cDoes that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014yes.\u201d She beat a fist against her thigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it makes you happy. Say that knowing what I did makes up for it,\u201d he demanded. \u201cThat it makes up for everything.\u201d</p><p>Tears made her eyes glisten, and her lips trembled. \u201cYou promised to be there for Ivy and me. You promised,\u201d she shouted. \u201cBut you left, because\u2014because...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but you left me there, in the hospital with that woman. Azalea said you couldn\u2019t handle the pressure.\u201d</p><p>His anger ebbed away. Summer truly believed he\u2019d left her? Then again, why wouldn\u2019t she believe the woman who had raised her? \u201cI didn\u2019t leave you,\u201d he swallowed. \u201cAzalea told me I was no longer needed. She had an orderly escort me out, and when I went to see you after you were discharged, she said you moved away.\u201d</p><p>Summer stood, eyes glistening. \u201cI swear to you, I did not want you to leave me.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel scrubbed a hand across his face. \u201cI want to believe you, I really do, but it\u2019s hard. Thing is, even if I do believe, even if you believe I owe you, I have to put Elise first. I have to concentrate on her. She has to come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep repeating that, but I have to wonder if you\u2019re doing that for my benefit or yours,\u201d Summer said softly. \u201cAnd if you two are so serious, then why are both of you so concerned with what I will or won\u2019t do to your relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fair, Summer.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never had to compete with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Summer stared at Gabriel. The hell she hadn\u2019t. However, none of that mattered. She would convince him to marry her, so she could get Ivy back. What he did afterwards, was no concern of hers.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it easy on you. If you don\u2019t help me, then I\u2019ll make Azalea look like a saint compared to how many marriages I\u2019ll break up around here.\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. \u201cWhat about Elise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she loves you so much, then she can wait for the divorce. Hell, have an affair with her until then, if you want, but I get dibs on the honeymoon.\u201d Summer lifted her chin, daring him to call her bluff.</p><p>For the love of God, call it.</p><p>Yes, she wanted his help, but she had only ever slept with exactly two men in her entire life. The second one had been Darius, and it had taken months for her to learn to trust him enough to even get that far.</p><p>Gabriel remained silent, so she fell back on what she knew made him uncomfortable.</p><p>She walked up to him, placing her hand on his chest and breathing him in. \u201cI\u2019d be very gentle, angel. Or rough. However, you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist, but she noticed he didn\u2019t try to push her hand away. \u201cSummer.\u201d</p><p>She fluttered her lashes at him. \u201cYes, angel?\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cSex doesn\u2019t scare me. I\u2019m perfectly comfortable with the act.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open a little. \u201cBut I thought you were waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how would you...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, but I\u2019ll be damned if I let you threaten me into anything.\u201d He pulled her closer, until nothing separated them\u2014not even daylight.</p><p>They still fit perfectly together. Her head right under his chin, her chest to his chest... His grip tightened. She wanted to kiss him, and she wanted him to kiss her back.</p><p>\u201cWill you think about it?\u201d she asked, breathless. Her heart beat loudly in her ears, and her blood sang in her veins. Gabriel was touching her, willingly touching her, and holding her close.</p><p>His perfect mouth thinned. Suddenly, his eyes widened a little and he made a little noise, something between a grunt and a growl.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cElise saw us.\u201d Gabriel let go of her, like she was a hot poker.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d It was all her fault. She never should have touched him.</p><p>\u201cI still need to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ll help me?\u201d she tentatively asked.</p><p>He shot her a dark look. \u201cIt means we\u2019ll talk later. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d Then he stalked away, calling Elise\u2019s name.</p><p>Summer watched him go. She wished she could say that she wasn\u2019t happy, but she was. Though she really hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt Elise, she had to get her daughter back. No matter the cost.</p><p>Someday, after the divorce, Gabriel and Elise could be together again, and Summer would never bother him again, even if it would permanently break her heart in two.</p><p>It was funny, if she thought about, because her heart had stopped working a long time ago.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Gabriel jogged after Elise, calling her name again and again.</p><p>Finally, she turned around, her green eyes blazing. \u201cIf I had wanted to talk to you, then I would have stopped, before everyone in the entire county heard you shouting my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me explain,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise\u2019s lips smashed together, and then she took a breath. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing happened, Gabe. You\u2019re not that kind of guy.\u201d Elise made a little face. \u201cYou\u2019re kind, honest, and love saving damsels in distress.\u201d</p><p>Affronted, he stepped back. \u201cI enjoy helping people, Elise. It gives me joy to do for others what was done for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to save everyone,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Carlos said those very words to him? \u201cI know it\u2019s not, but all we were doing was talking, honey. Nothing more. I made no promises to help her.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sadly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. The look on your face said it all for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m hearing this.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing, but repeat to Summer that you come first, that you are what I have to focus on, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave to focus on?\u201d She tilted her head to one side. \u201cYou make it sound like a chore you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to win this argument, am I?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to convince you that no matter what, I\u2019ll keep my promise, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabriel. The only woman you\u2019ve ever kept your promise to is standing right where you left her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never broken my promise to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019ve never made one before.\u201d She glanced away. \u201cI talked to your ex-fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did Zoe have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re everything I know you to be, everything that any woman could want, but only one woman truly holds your heart.\u201d</p><p>Zoe had said that to her? Zoe had known that about him, yet continued to be his friend and take him back, over and over again, until she finally met the man that made her happy? Some kind of friend he\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like for me to do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best if we break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She laid a hand on his arm. \u201cThe minute I felt a need to go into Carolina Dreams and warn Summer Holland to stay the hell away from my man was the moment I knew I needed to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d Gabriel stood there, stunned. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you don\u2019t have to. Seriously, Gabe, it\u2019s for the best.\u201d Elise leaned in, brushing a light kiss on his cheek. \u201cI wish you happiness.\u201d It began to rain, and she made a little sound, letting go of him and grabbing her umbrella. \u201cGood-bye, Gabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Elise.\u201d With the rain beating down on him, he watched her walk away, wondering what it said about him that he only felt the smallest bit of regret.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted the answer to that question.</p><p>Whirling around, he searched for Summer, but the park was empty. He thought for sure she would have stuck around to gloat. It was for the best anyway. He really needed time to think.</p><p>Helping Summer was possible now, but to what end? He had meant what he said to her about marriage and divorce.</p><p>He walked along the wet, tree-lined path and shoved his hands in his pockets. As a child, he never minded the rain, because it meant that he could get a little cleaner, that he and his mother could have a little water to drink. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed.</p><p>Maybe Summer was as desperate as the woman who\u2019d raised him on the streets of Bogot\u00e1, Columbia. From what he knew, or at least what he thought he knew, of Summer, she and his mother had a lot in common when it came to men.</p><p>They didn\u2019t trust them. They used them and were used and abused in turn.</p> <p>It was a nasty, vicious cycle that he would never know if his mother ever broke, but maybe this was his chance to help Summer break free of her past for good.</p><p>It\u2019s not your job to save everyone.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t, but all he\u2019d been doing for Summer was throwing her life jackets over the years. It was time to pull her out of the ocean\u2014permanently.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t quite sure how to implement that. There was someone he needed to talk to, someone whose judgment he trusted implicitly, even when he hadn\u2019t bothered to listen.</p><p>Sunday dinners were anything but quiet at the Edwards\u2019 house, especially with six brothers and sisters. Gabriel\u2019s family hadn\u2019t always been this large. Until the age of eight, there had only been his biological mother and himself living in a house comprised of wood, metal, and pieces of cardboard. It was a period of his life he didn\u2019t care to dwell on, much less looked upon with fond memories.</p> <p>His adopted father, John, sat at the head of the table, with his wife and Gabriel\u2019s adopted mother, Gloria, on his right. Occasionally, Gabriel would catch the two of them staring at him, and then exchanging knowing glances. It wasn\u2019t a big stretch of the imagination to figure out what they were thinking.</p><p>Elise\u2019s mother and Gloria had become the best of friends, since Elise\u2019s parents had moved down here. Both mothers had made it perfectly clear they loved the idea of Gabriel and Elise seriously dating. He wouldn\u2019t put it past either mother to have engaged in a little wedding planning either.</p><p>A spoonful of peas sailed through the air, hitting Isabella, the next to the oldest of all the siblings, in the neck. She narrowed her eyes at Hope and Faith. \u201cStop playing with your food,\u201d she said while signing the words with her hands.</p><p>The twins looked at each other and silently giggled, fingers furiously signing their next plan of assault on their big sister to each other.</p><p>Gabriel caught their attention and nodded at Paul, who was busy circling his dinner plate with miniature trains. Identical smiles grew to Cheshire proportions.</p><p>\u201cI heard Summer Holland was back in town,\u201d Isabella said as she stabbed a piece of roast beef with her fork.</p> <p>Heard his tail. Maybe he should throw his peas at his sister, along with his roll and what was left of his portion of the roast beef.</p><p>\u201cIs this true, Gabe?\u201d Gloria asked, her brown eyes missing nothing. She shook her head at the twins, and then instructed Michael to eat the rest of his mashed potatoes.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Even if he didn\u2019t suspect his mother already knew, he wouldn\u2019t have lied to her. Not that he shared his private life with anyone. It stayed private\u2014at least, when he could help it.</p><p>Gloria glanced at her husband, and then back at Gabriel. \u201cWhy is Summer back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to return the truck she borrowed from me.\u201d Not the whole truth, but it was all he felt comfortable giving at the moment.</p><p>\u201cIs she leaving soon?\u201d John asked as he fed Anna, another one of Gabriel\u2019s sisters. She\u2019d been six months old when they\u2019d adopted her from China, and had been born without her hands. Now she was three and insisted on feeding herself most of the time.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s planning on staying for good this time. She wants to reconnect with her family.\u201d For a while, Gabriel had blamed himself for Summer\u2019s extended absence. After all, he\u2019d been the one to convince her to let Rose adopt Ivy. If anyone deserved Summer\u2019s anger, it was him. But he\u2019d seen the pain in her eyes, the uncertainty of her situation, and for a moment, she reminded him of the woman who\u2019d given him up.</p><p>Given. More like sold to John and Gloria Edwards. Or had tried to sell him. Then again, his mother had been eleven or twelve when she\u2019d given birth to him in a slum. A malnourished boy couldn\u2019t have been anything but a drain to her. Maybe selling him to the two American missionaries had been her gift to him. He\u2019d only wished she\u2019d done it sooner.</p> <p>He set his glass down beside his plate, tracing the condensation along the rim. For eight years, he\u2019d endured poverty, hunger, and hopelessness. Things he had in common with his adopted brothers and sisters. Only Isabella, his parents\u2019 one biological child, was perfect.</p><p>\u201cI saw the two of you eating lunch together in the park,\u201d Isabella said, eyes all wide and innocent. Yeah, his sister was perfectly annoying. But he loved her anyway.</p><p>\u201cOh no, not lunch. That means we\u2019re exactly nothing, Bella,\u201d Gabriel pointed out.</p><p>Judah, the newest member of their family, sat in his mother\u2019s lap, looking a little scared and a whole lot overwhelmed. His baby brother had arrived only two months ago from Romania, his little legs bent at odd angles and his fingers permanently curved.</p><p>His mother frowned, but kept her comments to herself.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Ms. Kelly and Ms. Nancy?\u201d he asked, referring to in-home nurses who helped take care of all the special needs children his parents had adopted or fostered.</p><p>\u201cThey deserved a day off,\u201d his dad said as he balled up his napkin. He stood and began clearing off the table. \u201cLike your mother does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Gabriel grabbed his glass and plate.</p><p>Paul, the third oldest of the kids, copied him, and they both followed their dad into the kitchen.</p><p>John was at the sink, rinsing off his plate. Paul opened the dishwasher and unloaded the dishes. The twins ran in and out of the kitchen, bringing dirty plates and empty bowls with them. Gabriel could hear Isabella trying to coax Judah into sitting with her as Anna started demanding lap time with Gloria.</p><p>The three men worked in silence, Paul stopping every so often to rearrange the silverware drawer to his liking. Once the last dish was placed inside the dishwasher and all the clean plates were put away, they headed out to the front porch.</p><p>Gabriel and Paul sat in the porch swing, while their dad took his usual place in the rocking chair. It was still sunny outside, but pink and orange streaked the evening sky. The swing creaked as Paul moved his legs back and forth.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019m happy about this turn of events,\u201d John finally said. The urge to defend Summer was strong, but he remained silent as his dad continued, \u201cBut I trust you to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel laid an arm along the back of the swing. \u201cAs in help her out, but nothing more.\u201d</p><p>John nodded. \u201cYour mother\u2019s not happy with you right now.\u201d</p><p>His parents knew of their past, so he couldn\u2019t exactly blame them. \u201cSo this little man time out here is to voice her concerns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to voice our concerns. Neither of us are telling you to stay away from Summer. You\u2019re a grown man\u2014one who usually makes good decisions. But there\u2019s only so much you can offer a woman like her, and your judgment seems to be skewed when it comes to Summer.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel clenched his jaw. The place between his shoulder blades pinched together. \u201cA woman like her?\u201d Wasn\u2019t his dad the man who preached unconditional love and to help out your neighbor? To not judge a person, because you don\u2019t know what they had endured or were still enduring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take a phrase out of context, son,\u201d John warned. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about her reputation; I\u2019m talking about her actions. Actions that have hurt my son.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel exhaled, letting the tightness in his shoulders ease up. This he could understand. He didn\u2019t like it, but he could understand his parents\u2019 need to protect him. \u201cI appreciate your concern,\u201d There was that word again, \u201cbut things are different. Summer\u2019s different this time.\u201d</p><p>The conviction in his voice surprised him. Maybe his heart knew something his brain didn\u2019t. Usually his brain was telling him to stay the hell away from her, to not get involved beyond what she needed.</p><p>The last time Gabriel tried to get involved, Summer had burned him so badly that he still had scars. He looked down at his arm, at the scar in the shape of a thumbprint. It looked as though he had been branded. There were two more on his left bicep that resembled fingerprints.</p><p>If he had been a man who believed in the supernatural, he would have said that those were Summer\u2019s marks on him. Marks she\u2019d given to him while she was in labor with Ivy, as she clenched his hand and gripped his arm when another contraction had made her cry out.</p><p>Those marks, those little reminders of when he tried to be more than just a friend to her, were nothing like the one on his heart. In reality, they were nothing more than burns from welding a motorcycle frame together the morning Summer\u2019s daughter had been born.</p><p>Funny how he hadn\u2019t noticed, until that evening. Until he was home\u2014alone and worried out of his mind for her. But it had been made very clear he hadn\u2019t been needed.</p><p>\u201cYou said that before,\u201d his dad pointed out.</p><p>Paul stopped swinging and shuffled back inside.</p><p>He glanced up at his dad and said, \u201cThis time I\u2019m different, and I\u2019m doing things differently, too.\u201d This time, he would make a difference in Summer\u2019s life.</p><p>John smiled and nodded. \u201cDifferent is good.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Summer hadn\u2019t expected Gabriel to take so long to tell her no.</p><p>But here he was, two weeks later, walking into Carolina Dreams with a determined look on his face. Jemma Leigh had said that she\u2019d heard Elise had broken up with him, but Summer seriously doubted that.</p><p>The bells on the door rang, and then went silent.</p><p>She backed up, against the counter, desperately wishing she had something in her hands other than Blackbeard, the fickle cat. He meowed at Gabriel before jumping out of her arms and heading to the back.</p><p>\u201cTraitor,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s scent washed over her before he reached her, but this time it didn\u2019t give her comfort. She knew she\u2019d pushed him too far. She also knew she had no chance at getting Ivy back, that her hopes and dreams for a real family were about to be dashed to pieces.</p><p>\u201cAre you really determined to go through with it?\u201d Gabriel asked, stopping just shy of touching her. Today, he wore another button-down shirt and khaki pants. His dark hair was thick and slightly wavy... slightly tempting her to touch him.</p><p>She fisted her hands by her side. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw and her body nearly dropped to the floor in shock. Then she remembered her threat. \u201cSo nice of you to be concerned about all those couples\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve known you for too long not to know when you\u2019re bluffing. And that, sweetheart, was one of your biggest bluffs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...uh...well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve agreed to marry me. Hopefully, Elise won\u2019t be too broken up about it.\u201d She wanted to bang her head against the counter after she said that. Way to rub a little salt into the wound.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cElise won\u2019t be broken up about it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d she whispered, growing more uneasy by the minute.</p><p>\u201cBut I have some conditions of my own, since I\u2019m being so agreeable and giving up Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re darn right it does.\u201d</p><p>Summer waited. This time, her fingers uncurled and fisted the material of her dress instead. Gabriel\u2019s gaze dropped, and she could have sworn his expression softened.</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a marriage in name only, and there won\u2019t be a divorce. It\u2019s either all or nothing.\u201d He started ticking off a list, marking each item with a finger. \u201cI want to date you, then get engaged, then having a wedding, a honeymoon\u2014you did call dibs on that, after all\u2014and then we\u2019ll come right back to Holland Springs. You\u2019ll move in with me, work here, or wherever else you\u2019d like, or stay at home. Doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I can provide for you either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a \u2018but\u2019. You have to want...something else from me,\u201d she said, her heart sinking and her legs shaking.</p><p>\u201cOh I do, but that has to be given\u2014willingly.\u201d He gently grabbed her arm, pulling her toward him. Cupping the side of her face with his free hand, he dipped his head. \u201cI plan to be the man you\u2019ve always wanted, your every fantasy, and every desire. I plan on meeting every need a wild child like you could have. And by God, I hope it\u2019s a lot, because I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life for you.\u201d</p><p>Before Summer could melt into a puddle on the floor, his mouth came over hers. Hard. Demanding. She kissed him back just as hard, just as demanding. Years of pent-up need, and want, and desire for him twined, growing stronger with each passing second.</p><p>Her butt hit the counter, and his hard chest bumped into hers. She gasped, and his tongue plunged inside her mouth.</p><p>Good God, he could kiss, was her last thought, and then all she could do was feel, and touch, and taste. Take and give. Whimper, and moan, and dig her nails into his skin.</p><p>All too soon, he pulled away, his breath coming in pants.</p><p>\u201cDo you plan on kissing me like that very often?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He grinned, slow, cocky, and just this side of wicked. Her eyes couldn\u2019t help but widen. Her pulse couldn\u2019t help mimic the speed of hummingbird wings. Her angel had never looked at her like that. Ever.</p><p>\u201cI plan on kissing you like that, every day, for the rest of my life,\u201d he said.</p><p>Normally, this would be the time she\u2019d say something sarcastic, but normally, he didn\u2019t kiss her. Normally, she didn\u2019t feel so alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all she could manage. Her voice was breathless. When had she ever been breathless around a man? Oh yeah, not even two minutes ago when he was kissing the daylights out of her. She placed her hand on his chest to steady herself, but all it did was throw her off balance once more.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d Gabriel murmured, and she had to look up at him. \u201cI\u2019d like to take you out tonight.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel had heard the line about drowning in someone\u2019s eyes before. He had even thought it was pure junk science, but as Summer gazed up at him, all wide-eyed with desire and confusion, he could picture himself falling into those chocolate depths.</p> <p>Under his hand, her fingers curled. \u201cWhat time should I be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about six?\u201d How did his voice remain so calm when, inside he was utterly devastated by her\u2014in a completely excellent way. He had kissed her and she\u2019d kissed him back. She hadn\u2019t pushed him away or critiqued his technique. In fact, she looked as turned on as he felt. His entire body vibrated, pulled tight, and ready for release. For relief.</p><p>Breathe in, breathe out.</p><p>He could stay strong. He could also rethink the timeframe he\u2019d given himself to date Summer before \u201cofficially\u201d asking her to marry him. Honestly, he didn\u2019t know if he could wait a day, much less a month.</p><p>But what was thirty days compared to twenty-nine years?</p> <p>She nodded, licking her bottom lip. She was the difference. Summer\u2019s lips, her hand on his chest...her body against his...that\u2019s what made thirty more days seem like thirty million years.</p><p>\u201cPick me up here.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather pick her up at her place, but he\u2019d go along with her wishes. \u201cWe\u2019ll grab a bite to eat, and then catch a movie, or go to Poor Boy\u2019s so you can dance.\u201d</p><p>Desire faded from her eyes. \u201cSure you want to take me there?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten about the last time they been in Poor Boy\u2019s. She\u2019d flirted, he\u2019d snapped, and neither had spoken to the other for two months. Not until he\u2019d driven past her on Highway 13.</p><p>\u201cNeed a ride?\u201d he asked, his truck keeping pace with her strides.</p> <p>She tilted her nose in the air, hiked up her purse on her shoulder, and walked faster. \u201cDoes it look like it?\u201d Then she stopped suddenly, bent over, and retched.</p><p>He put the truck in park, hopped out, and was by her side in an instant. Gathering her hair back, he held it while she finished. \u201cI have some water in the truck\u2014haven\u2019t even twisted the cap off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that convenient?\u201d She grimaced, and then breathed through her mouth. \u201cAlways showing up at just the right time, like my own true knight in shining armor.\u201d Once again, she was pushing him away.</p><p>He let her hair fall, looking around at the fields that had been turned over for an early spring planting. \u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s knight,\u201d he said and moved back to his truck. He reached inside the open window, grabbing the bottle of water and a couple of loose napkins. \u201cI\u2019m giving you a ride into town as an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her spine straightened as if steel had been poured, and then cooled inside of it. \u201cI need to go see Dr. Reed.\u201d</p><p>He placed his palm over her forehead, a gesture his mother made whenever he or his brother and sisters were sick. Her skin was clammy, not feverish. A fine sheen of sweat glistened along her cheeks. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Summer?\u201d</p><p>There was the barest hint of tears surrounded by anguish before she blinked, clearing everything away. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The bottle of water fell to the asphalt, but it was his body that felt the impact.</p> <p>Gabriel gave himself a mental shake, and then smiled at Summer. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the past, and I\u2019m ready for the future.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cA date,\u201d Summer said to her reflection.</p><p>\u201cYes, a date,\u201d Jemma Leigh said, walking up behind her and placing her hands on Summer\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAll you need is some lipstick, and you\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Summer smiled faintly, accepting the tube from the woman who seemed to be bound and determined to be her friend, whether she liked it or not.</p><p>\u201cGabriel\u2019s gonna die when he sees you.\u201d</p><p>Summer made a little noise. \u201cGabriel will probably order me to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by change, you mean put on some sexy lingerie, then I have some you can borrow, too,\u201d Jemma Leigh said with a conspiratorial smile. \u201cThat man won\u2019t know what hit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Gabriel Edwards as good as I do, and we both know that will never happen.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh pursed her lips. \u201cYou have to stop thinking that way about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Easy enough for someone like Jemma Leigh to say. \u201cI\u2019m stating the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you bother inviting me over?\u201d</p><p>Summer leveled her with a look. \u201cThe devil made me do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been called that before,\u201d Jemma Leigh said wryly.</p><p>Earlier in the afternoon, Jemma Leigh had caught Summer in another weak moment, and invited her to coffee again. Over caramel lattes, Summer had blurted the news. Okay, so if she was honest, she hadn\u2019t blurted it. She had wanted Jemma Leigh to know, and not just because she would spread the news around town, but because Summer was nervous. With a capital OH DEAR GOD, WHAT HAD SHE AGREED TO?</p><p>And that\u2019s how she ended up with Jemma Leigh helping her get ready at Carolina Dreams. Rose\u2019s office had served as a dressing room, while Jemma Leigh had served as makeup artist and stylist by rushing home and back again with clothes, makeup, and anything else she could find. The room looked like a department store had exploded inside of it.</p><p>Summer plucked at a bead on her shirt. It was hot pink (naturally), with tiny, silver-colored beads along the sides. The sleeves were short and capped, and the white miniskirt with more pink and silver beads made her feel like she was bedazzled to the max. Matching silver and pink earrings dangled from her ears.</p><p>Overall, she looked nothing like herself and everything like the woman standing behind her, but Summer didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her so. Mostly because she didn\u2019t have a heart in the first place.</p><p>However, the makeup Jemma Leigh had applied was another story. Summer had never been able to pull off really dark or bright colors, at least not in her opinion, so she felt like a clown, even if she didn\u2019t remotely resemble one.</p><p>\u201cCould we tone down the eye shadow a bit? The hot pink at the top seems a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou hate it, don\u2019t you? I bet you hate the entire outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Summer all but screamed, and Jemma Leigh\u2019s smile returned in full force. \u201cI don\u2019t have the bones for this, not like you do...so I think we need to go a little neutral on the eye makeup.\u201d</p><p>Striking a pose, as her new friend had been doing in front of the mirror she\u2019d brought over all afternoon, Jemma Leigh tapped her chin. \u201cYou might be right. I thought with your attitude that you could carry it off, but the more I think about it....the more I see what\u2019s underneath.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s eyes widened, and she turned around to face Jemma Leigh. \u201cUnderneath what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderneath all that attitude. You can\u2019t fool me, Summer Holland, but I won\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d Jemma Leigh winked at her. \u201cNow, go wash that pretty face and we\u2019ll take it from the top.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel took one look at the woman walking toward him and forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Summer wore a pale blue sundress, a string of dark blue beads, and silver sandals. Her pale hair flowed down her back in big, bouncy curls. Brown eyes with the longest, blackest lashes he\u2019d ever seen gazed at him, without malice, anger, or even scorn.</p><p>In fact, Summer looked nervous.</p><p>But how could she? It wasn\u2019t her palms sweating. It wasn\u2019t her heart pounding against her chest. It wasn\u2019t her knees that were weak. It wasn\u2019t her brain reminding her of the last kissed they shared, of how she felt in his arms and pressed against him. Oh no. That was all him, with all his body parts and brain conspiring against him.</p><p>\u201cLet me take a picture,\u201d Jemma Leigh said. She rushed around the counter, phone in her hand, and waited for Summer to join him.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d he asked as she moved to stand beside him.</p><p>She shook her head in answer, sending the scent of flowers washing over him. It wasn\u2019t her usual scent, but he liked it. Hell, he loved it.</p><p>Wrapping an arm around her, he whispered, \u201cYou look beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him, giving an up-close and personal view of her flawless skin. There was a tiny mole, right by her left eye. The beauty mark hadn\u2019t been there when they were younger, and every other time they\u2019d been this close, it was to push the other away.</p><p>Well, with the exception of today, but he could give himself a pass for not noticing when he\u2019d been consumed with kissing her. He hadn\u2019t had a thought in his head about anything else but the way she tasted, which was how it should be.</p><p>\u201cOne more, you two. These are so good!\u201d Jemma Leigh squealed.</p><p>Except now, when he wasn\u2019t kissing her, and he was posing for a picture, all he could think about was kissing her again.</p><p>\u201cThank you. You look handsome.\u201d Then she looked at the camera again. Her hair fell forward, obscuring her face, so he couldn\u2019t see if she was smiling as Jemma Leigh took just one more picture.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Answering in monosyllables had never been Summer\u2019s style. Usually, she had an accompanying skewering remark. Usually, they wouldn\u2019t be going out on a date.</p><p>\u201cI made reservations at Bluebelle. Hope you still like seafood.\u201d He\u2019d decided against taking her to Poor Boy\u2019s tonight, for an after-dinner activity. Besides, he was getting a little old for that honky-tonk bar, and the crowd was getting younger every year.</p><p>Jemma Leigh beamed. \u201cTaking my bestie to Palm Island. I approve.\u201d</p><p>Summer and Jemma Leigh were best friends? That was...unexpected.</p><p>Placing a hand over her heart, Jemma Leigh sighed. \u201cBluebelle is so romantic. Lots of surprise engagements are on the menu there, or so I heard.\u201d</p><p>Summer stiffened beside him. He wasn\u2019t sure why. It had been her idea to get married in the first place. Did she think no one would notice when they got married, or when she sued for custody of Ivy?</p><p>Whatever she thought, he\u2019d be there for her, in whatever way he could. In the meantime, he would unequivocally convince her that in order to have a family, she didn\u2019t have to destroy the one she helped create. That she was worthy of love, of a family, and of everything she thought she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>He pressed his hand against the small of her back and blinked, slightly startled by how warm and delicate she felt under his palm.</p><p>\u201cHave her back at a decent hour, Mr. Edwards,\u201d Jemma Leigh admonished. \u201cA lady is never kept out later than midnight.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not a lady, so Gabriel can keep me out until the cock crows, but I\u2019m pretty sure the preacher\u2019s son isn\u2019t allowed to be out past the sinning hour.\u201d Summer stepped away from him, and headed to the front door. The bells rang as she went outside.</p><p>\u201cTonight should be fun,\u201d he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t mean it, you know,\u201d Jemma Leigh said, staring out the window. \u201cIt\u2019s just battle armor.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew it. He\u2019d always known it, but it was hard for him to keep his temper and be patient with her. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s time for her to be at peace?\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh shrugged. \u201cSometimes, when you\u2019ve been battling for so long, it\u2019s hard to know when to lay your weapons down and surrender to love.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Summer rode in silence as Gabriel drove them over the bridge to Palm Island.</p><p>The bridge only had one lane, and constantly had traffic backed up, as cars filled with vacationers lined up on opposite sides, waiting for their turn to go. Luck had been with them, and just as they approached, the light turned green.</p><p>Summer glanced at Gabriel, then back at the scenery. Possibly, it had been divine intervention.</p><p>Palms trees and small sand dunes, with vibrant orange wildflowers growing on them, flanked the road, while houses built on stilts rose above it all. Every now and then, she got a glimpse of the ocean or the Pamlico Sound.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been here before?\u201d Gabriel asked. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>This was his second attempt to try to get her to engage in conversation. The first time had been on the outskirts of Holland Springs. He\u2019d pointed out new shops and subdivisions that hadn\u2019t been there three years ago, but after she\u2019d only crossed her arms in response, he\u2019d shot her an amused look and turned up the volume on the radio.</p><p>For a minute, she considered remaining on the defensive with him, but why should she? He\u2019d agreed to help her, even if it meant a marriage not in name only. Even if it meant that he\u2019d promised to meet and fulfill every want, need, fantasy, and desire a wild child like her could have. Too bad she\u2019d never let him know that just by kissing her, like he had in Carolina Dreams, that he\u2019d already met more than half of them.</p><p>Yeah, too bad, but for whom... him, or was it her?</p><p>\u201cOnce or twice when I was younger. Azalea needed something from one of her friends.\u201d By friends, Summer meant lovers. Her mother had been having an affair with a married man from two towns over, and since Skye had been sick at the time, all of them had been forced to come along. Forced to watch as their mother flirted and preened in front of a man twice her age, while she ignored the three girls that had nothing to do, but wait and stay glued to one another. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he hadn\u2019t ignored them.</p><p>That man had watched them, with a hunger in his eyes that had made Summer\u2019s skin crawl. Thankfully, Azalea had noticed as well, and after hurrying them out of the beach house, with the real excuse of Skye being sick and possibly contagious, she had promised never to take them around him again.</p><p>It was the first and only promise she had ever kept.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d he said, and the thought of him knowing all of her secrets\u2014true or not, scared her so badly that she automatically looked for an exit. \u201cWe have a lot of misconceptions about each other, and I\u2019d like to finally clear them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr everything about me is entirely true, and there\u2019s nothing to clear up, because what you see is exactly what you get.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pulled the truck into the blacktop parking lot, next to a one-story house that had the look of a seaside cottage. After finding a spot, he put the truck in park and cut the engine. At first, she thought he would ignore her again, but he did the unexpected.</p><p>He reached across her, unbuckling the seat belt, and then took those big hands of his and pulled her toward him. Right before his head dipped, she managed to ask, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d His voice had slowed to that drawl she loved to hear. \u201cSummer Jean Holland, I plan on kissing you each and every time you utter such nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d His head dipped, but she leaned back, unsure if she should be aggravated with him over his gall. \u201cWhat if I started uttering things that make...sense?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m still going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Then his head dipped once more, and she met him halfway. Unlike the kiss in her store, this time when their lips met, it was slow and easy. Sweet and gentle, while knocking down some of the many barriers she\u2019d erected against him and everyone else who dared to see the real her.</p><p>Of their own accord, her fingers sank into his hair. The strands were thick and heated at the scalp, cool and silky at the tips. He moaned a little when she nipped at his full bottom lip, so she did it again, smiling when it elicited another sound of pleasure.</p><p>Until, that is, he took control, nudging her mouth open and plunging his tongue inside. Her angel kissed like the devil. He made her insides twist up in tight pleasure, made heat and desire pool between her thighs. He made her nipples tighten, and her wish that there was nothing between them, not even the cotton fabric of her borrowed dress.</p><p>His hands moved down her shoulders, cupping her elbows and sliding lower still, until he touched her wrists and laced his fingers through hers. Then he put their joined hands in her lap and simply kissed her.</p> <p>He kissed her and held her hands like they had all the time in the world, and weren\u2019t sitting in his truck, in public, while customers walked in and out of the quaint-looking restaurant.</p><p>Finally, finally, he pulled away, but kept their hands entwined. He lowered his forehead to hers. \u201cSay something completely ridiculous so I can kiss you again,\u201d he teased.</p><p>The words shimmered in her mind, but she refused to look at them again. She refused to acknowledge that an emotion like that could still exist between them, after all this time.</p><p>After all this time, could be it true that she wasn\u2019t over him? She gave herself a mental shake. Of course she was over him, because she\u2019d never been under him.</p><p>Besides, she had a plan, and she was sticking to it. Whatever it took to get her family back, she would do it, even if she had to walk backwards through the burning fires of hell while wearing gasoline panties. Which Holland Springs might end up becoming, once her sister found out her plans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she said, carefully sitting back and watching his reaction.</p><p>His vibrant blue eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cWell, I did say I\u2019d make sure your every desire was met.\u201d Letting go of her hands, he sat back, and then grabbed his keys.</p><p>Flipping down the visor, she pretended to check her makeup in the mirror, but she kept stealing glances at Gabriel while he got out of his truck and walked around it to her side.</p> <p>\u201cStop staring before he catches you,\u201d she scolded herself, before quickly reapply her lipstick. \u201cNothing wrong with small talk. Nothing wrong with enjoying yourself and having a nice time with the man you plan on marrying, and then divorcing for his own good.\u201d She got a queasy feeling in her stomach, but she flipped her hair over her shoulder and put on a bright smile as her door opened.</p><p>He held out his hand to help her down. She took it, snagging her purse on the way. \u201cYour eyes are pretty. The blue dress really makes them stand out.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t vain, nor had she ever lacked in compliments from the opposite sex, but his simple statement about her eyes made her want to preen in front of a mirror to see if what he said was true.</p><p>To her horror, she felt her cheeks heat. \u201cThank you. Blue is my favorite color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and not just any blue but dark blue. Indigo. \u201d</p><p>The color of your eyes, angel. \u201cGreen is yours,\u201d she said, not to be outdone.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that time we tried to build a teepee, after I learned about the Bear River Indians during the Boy Scouts\u2019 Jamboree?\u201d he asked. \u201cDarn near burned down the woods with our campfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWe must have worked on perfecting that teepee for a month, but rain would still manage to sneak inside.\u201d</p><p>Once again, he placed his palm on the small of her back, making her feel safe and secure as they walked up the front porch steps and inside the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cOne of us, and I\u2019m not naming names, got a little too happy with making a really big fire,\u201d he said with a wink, and then checked in with the hostess.</p><p>\u201cHow else would we roast hotdogs and eat marshmallows, or stay warm, when winter came?\u201d she pointed out, the memory of them as children making her smile. \u201cWe were going to live there, on the shores of the Pamlico, like the Bear River People. I\u2019d wear flowers in my hair and fish for us, while you did the dangerous hunting and watched the kids.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of children, her smile fell. For a little while, the memories of their childhood had been a nice way to pass the time while they waited, but the present would always find a way to intrude.</p><p>\u201cYou always looked pretty with flowers in your hair.\u201d Gabriel gently tugged on a curl resting on her bare shoulder.</p><p>Goose bumps appeared, and she didn\u2019t dare look at her date. She couldn\u2019t bear what might be in his gaze. Mercifully, the hostess appeared and led them into the main dining room.</p><p>They were seated at a table for two by the window. Lazy ceiling fans spun in slow circles, while servers in crisp white shirts, long, white aprons, and black pants wove in and out of the room, balancing trays on their fingertips.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Summer said as the hostess handed each of them a menu. She opened one, scanned the first few items, and almost set it facedown on the table.</p><p>Had he taken her here to impress her and flaunt his money, because he thought that was something she desired? Or had he taken her here because it was romantic, like Jemma Leigh had said?</p><p>Knowing what she did about Gabriel and Jemma Leigh, it had to be because it was considered romantic. If Gabriel wanted to show off how much money he had, he would be driving a Corvette or some other kind of flashy car most people would be horrified to learn she didn\u2019t like.</p><p>Give her a truck any day of the week. Or one of those VW Bugs. She did like those, especially the convertible ones, in bright green.</p><p>\u201cThe salads look good,\u201d she said, trying to keep the conversation pleasant, yet neutral.</p><p>\u201cSteak and lobster look better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her gaze travelled to the other side of the menu. \u201cToo many to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of Bluebelle?\u201d he asked, setting his menu to the side.</p><p>\u201cLooking for some utter nonsense for me spout?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but say, and then quickly turned her attention back to the menu. It wouldn\u2019t do for her to flirt with him. Kissing was one thing, but flirting was extremely bad for both of them.</p><p>Oh, who was she kidding? It was all bad, because it all felt so very good to do with Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Too bad I can\u2019t read your mind,\u201d he said, raising his brows.</p><p>She looked at him over her menu, thinking it was a lucky thing he couldn\u2019t read her wayward thoughts, but she still couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>Another one of those wicked grins covered his face, stealing her breath and making her pulse race. \u201cBecause I\u2019m ninety-nine percent sure your lips would look all bee-stung when I was done with you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, her breasts rising to the neckline of her dress, and Gabriel noticed. His gaze actually dropped there, for only a couple of seconds, before his blue eyes found hers. \u201cSaw something you liked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>The server chose that moment to take their order. Summer had no idea what she told the man, only that Gabriel\u2019s heavy-lidded gaze never left her face. His knee brushed hers as she handed the menu to the server, and she gasped.</p><p>Emotionally off-balance, she slid her chair back.</p><p>Gabriel frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She swallowed that lie, and then spouted off another one. \u201cJust thought you needed more leg room, is all.\u201d What was wrong with her? This wasn\u2019t how she handled Gabriel. This wasn\u2019t how she kept him at a distance. She should be the one touching his knee. The one running her foot up his leg.</p><p>He made a noise, his frown deepening, before he excused himself from the table. She watched him go, watched him cross the room, and head to the front of the restaurant where the restrooms were located.</p><p>After a couple of minutes of people watching, she stared at the ocean, at the waves as they rolled onto the shore, wishing she could be a part of it. Wishing she could dive in and float away. She could practically feel the cool water lap at her body, the weightlessness... the blessed quiet. Would anyone notice if she drifted away? Would anyone care if she had never come back to Holland Springs?</p><p>Rose hadn\u2019t known the exact day Summer would appear at Strawberry Grove. Jemma Leigh confessed she\u2019d made the whole thing up, but that whenever Rose and her husband would go out of town, the letter and key were placed in Jemma Leigh\u2019s hands just in case.</p><p>Certainly if her sister had known, then Rose would have also known what Summer\u2019s plans were all along, and wouldn\u2019t have been so welcoming or forgiving. Summer wouldn\u2019t have been, not one bit.</p><p>Or would she? Would either of them? Maybe the bonds of sisterhood were stronger than their past, than the reasons why Summer did what she did, and her sisters would accept her for it. Though, Skye still hadn\u2019t returned from Colorado and no one knew when or if she ever would.</p><p>Maybe Skye had been the smartest of them all by moving away to pursue her dreams, while Summer and Rose couldn\u2019t help but come back to Holland Springs, no matter what lay before them.</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>The flame of the candle danced and she held her hand over it, palm facing down. Burn my past away. Burn all that used to be me. Burn it all away. The candle seemed to grow hotter and brighter as she chanted the words in her head.</p><p>Burn the old me to the ground.</p><p>Gabriel returned to the table just in time to save Summer\u2019s hand from catching on fire. Leaning over the table, he grabbed her wrist and moved her hand away.</p><p>She jumped, her brown eyes going wide at the sight of him. \u201cAngel,\u201d she breathed, and for once, the word sounded like an endearment.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Turning her palm over, he tenderly brushed his thumb over the red spot in the middle. He kneeled beside her, bringing her hand to his mouth and kissing the center. \u201cPlaying with fire will always leave a mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t playing.\u201d She removed her hand from his grip, but he didn\u2019t move from his spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking? I watched you for a full minute, before rushing over here.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes turned wary. \u201cNothing to get me kissed.\u201d</p><p>Yet another reason he\u2019d excused himself from the table. He was acting like a teenager with self-control issues. Summer deserved more than to be pawed by him at every opportunity. She deserved more than him finding any excuse to touch her hair, her shoulder, or hand. She deserved a gentleman, in every way, and it was his job to be one.</p><p>\u201cAre you having a good time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Another one-word answer. He exhaled and stood. As he sat in his chair, he asked, \u201cAfter dinner, would you like to go for a walk on the beach?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and his heart sank more.</p><p>Thankfully, the server brought the appetizers, and then the entrees as soon as they had finished the seafood bisques.</p><p>Gabriel had never had such a quiet meal with a date, and not just any date, but Summer, the woman who was his childhood sweetheart. The woman, who at one time, he\u2019d wanted to spend the rest of his life with, and the woman he\u2019d thought he\u2019d never see again, after he\u2019d helped her through the heart-breaking decision of giving up Ivy.</p><p>He paid the bill, and began to say something to Summer, but she wasn\u2019t looking at him. Her complete attention was on the ocean, as the sky faded from pale blue to gold and orange, then violet and indigo. She\u2019d always been a lover of nature.</p><p>He simply gazed at her, at the rapturous, yet vulnerable look on her face. This was the girl he remembered. This was the girl who held him spellbound, not the woman who\u2019d become hard and cynical, without joy.</p><p>A pale curl shifted, drawing his attention to her neck. It was slender and strong, like her. Everything about her looks had that duality about it. Slender yet strong, soft yet unyielding... sex kitten yet girl-next-door with her big, brown eyes and pouty lips...his best friend yet his worst enemy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now...now she would become his wife.</p><p>His wife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to walk on the beach and talk about our favorite positions, and what turns us on,\u201d she said, her smile so sweet it gave him a toothache.</p> <p>He blinked. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to tell me your favorite. I already know it\u2014missionary style,\u201d she said with a firm nod. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one allowed, right? Guess I\u2019ll have to get used to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to be baited by you, not anymore. Need a verbal punching bag\u2014then here I am,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cBut not in public. I\u2019m taking you home, where you can make whatever kind of remark you want. However, this changes nothing. We\u2019re going on another date tomorrow, and the next day, until we can have an entire conversation without resorting to our old ways of handling each other.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had to include himself in that last part, because he wasn\u2019t perfect and even if she thought that about him, he knew it wasn\u2019t true, and knew what he was capable of doing. It was only fair to have the same expectations placed upon him as well.</p><p>Was that a glimmer of relief in her eyes? Had he calculated correctly for once?</p> <p>He stood, and held out his hand. For a second, he half-expected her to bite him, but she took his hand, lacing her fingers with his, and allowed him to lead her outside to his truck. Once they were back at Carolina Dreams, he opened the door on her side, and walked her around back to where the truck he\u2019d let her borrow was parked.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me goodnight, angel?\u201d she cooed. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I said something ridiculous before we left.\u201d</p><p>It hit him then, like a punch to the head. She wasn\u2019t only trying to keep him at arm\u2019s length. \u201cWere you trying to get me to kiss you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I have to resort to tricks for that to happen,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>She flipped her hair over one shoulder. \u201cYes, I did, but you didn\u2019t bother to read between the lines.\u201d</p> <p>He rocked back on his heels, actually enjoying this bit of sparring. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you help me out? Sometimes men need a little direction.\u201d</p><p>She snorted, actually snorted, and he wanted to kiss her for that, because it made her seem so real and touchable. And his. \u201cI swear, Gabriel, it\u2019s like you\u2019re begging me to say something so you\u2019ll have an excuse to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say? I love kissing you.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her final blow, for her to make a reference to all the men she\u2019d enjoyed kissing, but her gaze skittered away.</p><p>\u201cI love kissing you, too,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He kissed her cheek softly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her satiny skin, right along her jawline. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pressed her lips together, and then dug her keys out of her purse. \u201cI need to go home. Blackbeard needs his beauty sleep.\u201d As if on cue, Blackbeard appeared out of nowhere, rubbing against Gabriel\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll visit us, once you move in with me?\u201d he asked, and panic flared in her eyes.</p><p>She shrugged, glancing away from him. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him. He does what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to follow you home, to make sure you make it all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me wait for you to start up the truck and be on your way,\u201d he said. He lived in the opposite direction of Summer, and since he wasn\u2019t a stalker, he needed to make sure she was safe in town.</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Pulling out the keys, she unlocked the door and climbed inside. Blackbeard jumped in behind her, and she shut the door.</p><p>He waited until she buckled on her seatbelt, locked the door, and adjusted her mirror. Then he waited even longer while she started up the truck\u2019s engine and fiddled with the radio.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s making me wait on purpose,\u201d he said with a shake of his head, but he didn\u2019t get angry. Instead, he patiently waited with a small smile on his face while she came to the conclusion that he really wasn\u2019t going anywhere until after she did, and finally drove away.</p><p>\u201cYou might think you\u2019re the winner, Summer Jean,\u201d he said to himself as he walked to his truck, \u201cbut in the end, we\u2019ll both be happy with the outcome.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Over the next couple of weeks, much to Summer\u2019s dismay and secret joy, Gabriel kept his promise to take her out every night, until they had a meal without them falling back on old habits.</p><p>Only, new habits emerged.</p><p>For one, she teased him and he teased her back. If she were honest, she would call it flirting, but she couldn\u2019t be honest with herself right now, because honesty would lead to examining her heart.</p><p>There was no telling what she would find there.</p><p>Not that she had time to examine anything, because Gabriel had taken over her schedule of nothing but work by actually dating her.</p><p>They tasted prize-winning jams and jellies at local fairs named after fruits and small woodland creatures, went tubing at a river festival, and held hands during an outdoor play.</p><p>They\u2019d eaten hummus and pita points while listening to a jazz band perform at a park in Wilmington, and had spent one afternoon riding the Swan Quarter ferry to Ocracoke Island.</p><p>He\u2019d also started coming to Carolina Dreams right before closing time, to ask about her day and plan their next great adventure.</p><p>It was as though he was trying to fit years of dating, years of what they should have had together, into a matter of days.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to touch my trophy?\u201d she asked, waving a stuffed fox at him she\u2019d won for having the loudest whistle at the Red Fox Festival.</p><p>\u201cThe fox says put him out of his misery.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been properly stuffed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what it is, that fox used to be alive. Don\u2019t touch me with it.\u201d He stepped away from her, and she laughed so hard that her stomach began to ache. \u201cI could be allergic for all you know.\u201d</p><p>She pretended to consider his words, and then lunged for him. He moved out of her reach at the last minute. \u201cTake it home with you and put in on your mantle like a real man,\u201d she giggled, chasing him around Carolina Dreams. \u201cHe\u2019ll watch over you while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather have you glowering at me in my sleep,\u201d he said, laughter rumbling from his chest. The sound made her so happy. He made her happy.</p><p>\u201cSo the rumor is true.\u201d</p><p>Summer and Gabriel simultaneously stopped and turned at the same time.</p><p>Elise stood just inside the door, red hair swept up, displaying a dainty earring on each lobe, while wearing a pencil skirt with a form-fitting white blouse that highlighted her curvaceous figure to perfection.</p><p>\u201cHi, Elise,\u201d Gabriel said, taking the stuffed fox from Summer and setting it on a nearby counter. The bridge of his nose flushed. Was he embarrassed at being caught with her? He glanced at Summer with a pleading look in his eyes, before turning his attention back to Elise.</p><p>Summer felt herself melt a little. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed. He was worried about Elise\u2019s feelings and her feelings, even though she\u2019d been the one to instigate everything.</p><p>\u201cI...We...\u201d he began but Summer wasn\u2019t about to let him apologize for something he hadn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to hurt you,\u201d Summer said, taking a step toward Elise. \u201cSometimes things just happen, and Gabriel and I have a long history.</p><p>\u201cHow sweet of you to think of me like that.\u201d Elise marched up to Summer. \u201cDo you believe in physical violence?\u201d</p><p>Confused, Summer answered honestly, \u201cAs a rule, no, but there are times when a situation calls for it.\u201d Like after Patrick Johnson tied her to the bed and took what was owed to him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Elise slapped Summer so hard that her head whipped to one side.</p><p>Pain flared out, to her ear and eye socket. Tears welled up in her eyes, and she whimpered, cupping her cheek.</p><p>Gabriel was at her side in an instant, gently turning her face and sucking in air through his teeth. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>All she could do was look at him through a sheen of tears.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, seriously dumb question.\u201d He kissed her forehead, and she thought she heard Elise hiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he said, then his eyes got all hard. Summer wanted to flinch again, but he fixed his furious gaze on the redhead still standing there. \u201cYou broke up with me, not the other way around, and she\u2019s not responsible for our decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Summer whispered miserably. \u201cYou saw us in the park, and that\u2019s why you broke up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elise said, shocking her. \u201cI broke up with him, because it\u2019s one thing to be second to a memory. It\u2019s quite another to have to be second to the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t make you second,\u201d Gabriel insisted.</p><p>Summer backed away, going to the cabinet in the corner to find a purple jar with some ointment to ease the swelling and redness on her cheek. It had to be red and swollen, because it stung like hell.</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t about to give you a chance, but seeing the two of you... It just pisses me off that I wasted so much time on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never looked at it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never had to, women flock to you, you idiot.\u201d Elise huffed. \u201cMen, it\u2019s so easy for you. Get older and you look better. We get older and have to compete with younger women who y\u2019all think look better than us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel\u2019s not like that,\u201d Summer said, rubbing in the lotion. Immediately, the stinging lessened.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all like that.\u201d Elise gave Summer a hard look. \u201cI wish I could say sorry and mean it, but I can\u2019t. It felt good, and you deserved it anyway, for all the other relationships you helped destroy.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel heard Summer\u2019s sharp intake of breath and almost cursed.</p><p>He knew what she was thinking, what Elise had planted in Summer\u2019s brain. Soon, it would take root, and all the weeks of trying to build something new would wither away and die.</p><p>\u201cThen you might want to hit the other one then, for my future misdeeds,\u201d Summer snapped, marching from the back of the store to where Elise stood. She tipped up her chin and turned her head to one side. \u201cSo very many men and so very little time.\u201d</p><p>Forget soon; it was instantaneous. He briefly closed his eyes. \u201cI suggest you leave, Elise, before I call Sheriff Barnes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have me arrested?\u201d Elise looked genuinely horrified.</p><p>\u201cIf Summer wants to press charges, then yes. You assaulted her, without provocation.\u201d He should know. So many of the teens he worked with had that very wording on their rap sheet. He had it on his.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t press charges,\u201d Summer said, much to Gabriel\u2019s surprise.</p><p>Elise\u2019s mouth flattened as she made a little noise of satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll be going.\u201d</p><p>Neither he nor Summer bothered to say anything more as Elise marched out of Carolina Dreams. Summer merely waited until his ex has left and then moved to lock the door.</p><p>When she turned to face him again, he winced at the bright red handprint. \u201cDo you want some ice for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She pushed back her shoulders, tipping her nose in the air. \u201cI want a timeframe from you, so I can know when to expect a ring and plan a wedding with a honeymoon. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve,\u201d her lips trembled, \u201chad a m-man?\u201d</p><p>So they were back to this, once again. Damn Elise for this, and damn him for letting things escalate. \u201cIt\u2019s best if you had dinner with my parents, first, so they can get to know you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already know me by reputation, angel. Everyone does, no matter what you or Jemma Leigh say.\u201d She gave him a brittle smile. \u201cYou two want me to think like y\u2019all, like everything is rose-colored glasses and Fourth of July parades, but I\u2019m not buying it. The mark on my face proves nothing has changed in this town.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>That evening, Gabriel walked the mostly deserted streets of Holland Springs. It was almost ten, and the only shops still open were the local drugstore and movie theater.</p><p>Normally he\u2019d be home now, but one of his client\u2019s parents called him, worrying because their son hadn\u2019t come home from school. It had taken him a good two hours, coordinating with local law enforcement officials, to track the teen down, but an anonymous tip had helped, and the fifteen year old was back where he belonged.</p><p>Gabriel ran a hand through his hair. Small town or big city made no difference to a teenager looking for trouble. Though Holland Springs was not a big city by any stretch of the imagination, the town had grown over the past few years.</p><p>New subdivisions and strip malls had been built, but the downtown, with good planning and financial backing from influential citizens, had remained vibrant, even when the local Wal-Mart had turned into a superstore. Many had proclaimed that expansion as a death knell for local businesses, but as with most things, the rush to judgment and end-of-the-world wailing were all for nothing.</p><p>New businesses had cropped up, offering services and items that the Wal-Mart didn\u2019t carry. Honestly, he thought it was pretty hypocritical for people to not want something that the majority, no matter their income, could afford. Where else were they supposed to shop for groceries and clothes?</p><p>Yeah, if there was one thing he hated in this world, it was hypocrites. Which is probably why he was so determined to prove to Summer that he wasn\u2019t one\u2014at least, not anymore. He wanted to prove to her that, for the most part, people could be counted on to be kind and caring when push came to shove... not everyone, but most. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dear God, he prayed he was right.</p><p>He exhaled and took a right onto Ivy Lane.</p><p>A light shone in the second-story windows, and he frowned. It was doubtful that Summer had left the light on. She was too conscientious of stuff like that, and she had the uncanny ability to see in the dark like a cat.</p> <p>Just then, a black cat jumped up on the window, rubbing its body back and forth on the glass. What in the world was Blackbeard doing there?</p><p>Maybe Summer had some inventory to do. Maybe he could check on her, offer his help, or at least his company.</p><p>Dashing around the back, he checked for her truck and found it, gleaming under a street lamp. With a smile, he strode to the back door, intent on knocking, when Blackbeard came running out, leaving the door ajar.</p><p>The cat was used to roaming where he wanted, and most of the townspeople knew who he was and gave him little treats, so Gabriel didn\u2019t bother to try to catch him. Instead, he slipped through the door, and made his way upstairs, calling Summer\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cGabriel?\u201d She appeared at the top of the stairs, eating a bowl of something while only wearing a t-shirt.</p> <p>He almost tripped up the stairs at the sight of her shapely legs. The t-shirt barely covered her, so it left little to the imagination. Immediately, he stopped his ogling and froze on the stairs, staring the wooden steps. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t know you were, uh... What are you doing here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating a bowl of cereal while Blackbeard goes catting around.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the wood grain. \u201cDo you do this every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Relief flowed through him. Although, he still couldn\u2019t figure out why she was dressed the way she was. It wasn\u2019t his business, not completely, but it was strange.</p><p>\u201cUsually I\u2019m entertaining gentleman callers while he roams the streets,\u201d she said in that voice he\u2019d grown to dread. The one that meant he needed to turn around and go back the way he came, if he knew what was good for him.</p> <p>Only he knew what was good for him\u2014she was. She didn\u2019t believe it, was all.</p><p>\u201cSounds fun. Care to entertain this gentleman?\u201d he asked, silently praying he was going about this the right way.</p><p>The clink of the spoon dropping into the bowl made him grin. He risked taking another look at her. Summer\u2019s mouth had dropped open, and then she caught him looking and put on a haughty face.</p><p>\u201cDoubtful,\u201d she said, turning away and disappearing from the top.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a no. He jogged the rest of the way up the stairs, catching her at the sink of the studio apartment. She rinsed out the bowl and set it down, then headed to the bathroom.</p><p>Guess he\u2019d have to entertain both of them.</p><p>He glanced around the room. A lot had changed since he\u2019d last seen it, but to be fair, he\u2019d only been up here once and that was to help Rose unload some heavy boxes.</p><p>The open floor plan had remained the same, but the d\u00e9cor had changed. Gone was all the mismatched furniture. In its place were comfortable-looking seating areas, a table for two, and freshly painted cabinets, and granite countertops in the kitchen, as well an antique dresser with a flat-screen television on top. Off to the side was a small room with a very large bed.</p> <p>Now, that was definitely new.</p><p>\u201cWhere does Rose keep all the extra inventory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander bought the building across the street, the one he\u2019d originally had up for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess when you\u2019re that loaded, buying a building from yourself makes sense,\u201d he said to himself, moving to the long couch by the front windows. \u201cI thought you were staying at Strawberry Grove.\u201d He sat down, and waited for her to join him.</p><p>She emerged from the bathroom a minute later, still wearing the same t-shirt but she had put on a pair of loose boxer shorts. \u201cIt\u2019s better if I live here, until\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou move in with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her eyes widened, just a little. She didn\u2019t move from her spot by the television. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I thought I\u2019d come up here and see if you wanted any help or maybe just some company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I have lots of company\u2014except tonight,\u201d she said, her gaze skittering away. She crossed her arms and took a deep breath.</p><p>He took the opportunity to continue, and ignore her little jab. \u201cBut on second thought, I think you were right. We do need a timeframe. In fact, I was thinking of speeding things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she asked, still not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He patted the seat beside him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come sit over here? I\u2019d rather not yell our plans.\u201d</p><p>Stiffly, Summer marched to him, and he hid a smile. She sat on the opposite side of the sofa, so far away that she might as well be in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHow much longer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He scooted closer to her. \u201cMaybe next week or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait another week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou at least need to meet my family first. Can you wait until after this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She shoved a pillow between them.</p><p>Undeterred, he scooted even closer, tossing the pillow on the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get dirty,\u201d she cried, starting for it, but he stopped her with a hand on her arm.</p><p>\u201cThe pillow is fine, and knowing you the way I do, we could eat off the floor and not get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess clean freak and town whore doesn\u2019t mash very well, does it?\u201d Summer said, but there was less of a bite to her words. She settled against the couch again, and he unhanded her.</p><p>\u201cFor a town whore, you do a really crappy job at entertaining men.\u201d</p><p>Summer finally turned to look at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019ve been gone more than you\u2019ve actually lived here, and if you\u2019d really been servicing all the men that you have been accused of sleeping with, or bragged about being with you, for that matter, then you\u2019d still be on your back. It\u2019s not mathematically possible.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, she gaped at him, and he knew in his heart she wanted to laugh, or punch him in the throat. Maybe at the same time. He\u2019d welcome either if it meant she would smile, if it meant she could erase today.</p><p>She did neither. \u201cYou were always good at math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was outstanding at math,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cChemistry, too,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you\u2019ve always made me feel like I could spontaneously combust, even if it\u2019s not possible without an accelerant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m the accelerant.\u201d Her lashes lowered, and then she peered up at him, giving him a look so hot that he did indeed believe she was the accelerant. She lifted her chin, leaning into him. Their breath mingled. He felt her hand touch the outer edge of his, then one of her fingers caressed his, and he almost moaned.</p><p>\u201cSummer,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She brought his hand up to her mouth, kissing the center, and then nibbling her way across his knuckles. \u201cIn biology, I learned that a man has more nerve endings in his hand than a woman.\u201d She sucked a finger into her mouth and nipped at the tip.</p><p>Sensation flooded his body, straight from the tip of his finger to his dick. His cock swelled. He couldn\u2019t help it, nor did he try to hide it.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked around that very lucky digit.</p><p>\u201cFeels like it.\u201d He fought for control when she took another finger into her mouth, sucking it down to where it joined to the last knuckle. He could only imagine what that would feel like in other places. Another rush of lust jolted him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you begging me to show you what I do with all those gentleman callers?\u201d she asked, and he was too turned on to take exception.</p><p>But a flash of clarity assured him that no matter how he answered it would be wrong, so he pulled her to him, straight into his lap, and lifted her chin. Then he kissed the daylights out of her.</p><p>But was either of them content with that? Not in the least.</p><p>Summer straddled his lap, putting his hands on her butt. He cupped her there, groaning at the feel of her firm, plump flesh. Then she moved, rocked her hips in such a way that his eyes rolled to the back of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She silenced him with a kiss, still rocking her hips against the length of him, and dug her fingers into his shoulder. \u201cFeels good, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs good as it did the last time you did this,\u201d he said, somehow remembering them as teenagers, parked in his truck, with her riding his lap for all she was worth. Neither of them had taken off the last of their clothes, but they\u2019d come pretty close. They\u2019d come pretty close to giving everything to each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much better now,\u201d she said throatily. \u201cAll that practice, you know.\u201d</p><p>If she wanted to lie, then so could he. \u201cMe, too. Can\u2019t tell you how many women I\u2019ve let ride me like this. They\u2019ve always gone home happy, too,\u201d he said, helping her move now. He gripped her ass, pulling down and pushing against her. Every glide made him hotter, flamed the lust and desire that he\u2019d been holding in check for as long as he could remember.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have on a bra this time,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He nipped her lip. \u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not.\u201d She nipped his in return. \u201cYou\u2019re too much of a gentleman to look that close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up close and personal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I promise to keep moving, would you want to touch me t\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hands were up her shirt before she could finish her sentence, eyes closing in pure pleasure. She filled his hands, her nipples beading against his palms.</p><p>\u201cOh God. That\u2019s perfect. You\u2019re perfect,\u201d he whispered. She rocked harder, making his eyes open and his breath grow ragged. \u201cWe have to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you wanted to be entertained,\u201d she said, lips brushing his ear. \u201cI thought you wanted to make me as happy as all those women you let ride you like this.\u201d</p><p>Fabric slid against fabric, the thin material of her pajama bottoms and his khaki pants making it possible for him to feel everything. He flicked her nipple with the pad of his thumb in response, and she made a little noise.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again, and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>The couch began to squeak with their efforts, and her breasts started to bounce. He flicked her nipples with his thumbs, one at a time, while maintaining an iron grip on his control. No way would she make him come in his pants like some teenager... like she had when they were teenagers.</p><p>She ground down harder against him, and her head fell back. Unable to stop himself, he shoved up her shirt, licked her nipple, and then sucked it deep inside his mouth, watching her.</p><p>Summer\u2019s face flushed, her lids lowered, and her lips parted. He had never seen such a beautiful sight. Her hair spilled over her shoulders, teasing the tops of his hands. The silky strands caressed his face.</p><p>\u201cSoft, so soft,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He sucked harder, used his teeth, and then did the same to the other one, more than satisfied when she ordered him to do it again. Then he grabbed her waist and shoved up, sending his cock in direct contact with her heat. He wanted her. He wanted inside her. He wanted to take her and take her, and never let her go. He wanted to be the last man she ever kissed\u2014the last man she ever made love to.</p><p>Quite simply, he loved Summer Holland and would always love her.</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she cried, and he went over the edge with her.</p><p>Summer stopped rocking, unable to comprehend what they\u2019d just done. Unable to believe what he allowed her to do to him.</p><p>Her own orgasm had been hard and fast, twisting up her body until it had finally let her go while his...Oh, God.</p><p>Reality had returned, and she wanted to die.</p><p>Gabriel blinked up at her, his dark blue eyes still glazed over, but when they cleared, he was going to be pissed at her. He was going to say to hell with her plans, and go on about his way. She\u2019d practically had sex with him, on a couch, in front of the windows where anyone could have walked by, and they sure as heck weren\u2019t married, much less engaged.</p><p>What would people think of him, if they were caught?</p><p>Sure, it was almost eleven now, and the streets were deserted, but it would be just her luck that some busybody would see them. She could stand gossip about herself, but the man who held her\u2014never.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His gaze lowered, as did hers, right to the wet spot on his pants. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, and her gaze flicked up to his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d</p><p>She watched his cheeks grow red. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a towel,\u201d she said lamely.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower, and possibly your washer and dryer,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>For some reason, his laugh made her want to cry. Why was he making a joke? She shoved away from him, but he caught both of her wrists in his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t run off like you\u2019re ashamed of what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am ashamed.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI lost control, not you. I made the choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were waiting, and I...\u201d</p><p>He gave her a lopsided smile, the dimple in his left cheek making her heart flip. He let go of one wrist and brushed back the hair at her brow. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting. Tonight proves one thing, though.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married as soon as the ink dries on the marriage license.\u201d</p><p>Summer could only nod her agreement.</p><p>\u201cNow, about that towel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said, but she still hadn\u2019t moved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He let go of her other wrists and cupped the back of her neck, pulling her to him. \u201cKiss before you go?\u201d</p><p>She kissed him tenderly, wishing she could see herself as he did, or how he pretended to see her. She opened her eyes, staring at her reflection in the window. But she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t pretend at all.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>Saturday evening, Gabriel took Summer to his parents\u2019 house for the first time, and he was nervous, so nervous it was like he was the one meeting the parents and not her.</p><p>He wanted his parents to like her, and he wanted Summer to like them. Growing up, Summer never really got to meet his parents like this. She\u2019d always turned down his invitations to dinners, while he was never invited to Strawberry Grove.</p><p>Besides, he wasn\u2019t on the best of terms with her mother, after the hospital incident, though she\u2019d left a long time ago and had never come back.</p><p>So, it was as if they were each other\u2019s dirty little secret, without all the secrecy or the implied sex. Lately sex had been occupying his mind more and more often, not that it didn\u2019t inhabit his brain at all times, because it did. Just... his brain knew what would happen soon, so his body was getting all on board and making it hard for him to sleep at night.</p><p>He really wished that pun didn\u2019t exist. If Summer knew what he was thinking, she\u2019d either laugh in his face or\u2014he frowned\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure what else she would do. Unless she planned a repeat of Thursday night. Now that, he could go along with.</p> <p>The perfume she\u2019d worn on each of their dates stole over him as he parked his truck in the driveway. \u201cIs that a new perfume?\u201d</p><p>Big, brown eyes met his. \u201cNo. I stopped wearing perfume not long after I had Ivy. The scent of it made me... sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPost-partum depression?\u201d he ventured.</p><p>Her gaze fixed on a spot over his shoulder. \u201cDarius liked for me to wear perfume. He liked to buy the samplers from Victoria\u2019s Secret so we could pick out the ones we liked the most without spending a fortune.\u201d</p><p>He covered her small hand with his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk much about him when you were pregnant.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWhat was I supposed to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you wanted. It wouldn\u2019t have bothered me, unless he didn\u2019t treat you right.\u201d Gabriel couldn\u2019t be jealous of a dead man, of a soldier who\u2019d fought so Gabriel could sit in an American-made truck, in the middle of his parents\u2019 driveway, on a Saturday night, with the woman who made his heart pound against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe treated me right.\u201d She bent her head. \u201cHe was kind to me, and I think he loved me, unless I was imagining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not hard to imagine at all.\u201d</p><p>She made a noise of disbelief. \u201cDon\u2019t make me call you a liar, angel. I am not easy to love.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel hooked a finger under her chin and applied gentle pressure, until their gazes locked. \u201cWho said love was easy? If it were, then we wouldn\u2019t have entire passages in the Bible about it. We wouldn\u2019t be instructed to love our neighbors, or our enemies. A man is commanded to love his wife multiple times.\u201d He made himself stop talking, because he knew how she still viewed him, how she thought he was this holier-than-thou type, and he didn\u2019t want to ruin this date. He wanted them united when they went inside to meet his family.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not patient, or kind, or selfless,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThe girl I knew was, and the woman who gave up her daughter, because she knew she couldn\u2019t take care of her, is incredibly selfless,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cThe woman, who, right now, is putting up with Jemma Leigh dressing her up like some life-sized Barbie doll, because she doesn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, is very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like how Jemma Leigh\u2019s dressing me.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cI really appreciate how she\u2019s dressing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because I look decent for once?\u201d she snapped, and then winced a little. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>In answer, he kissed her. \u201cNonsense. Utter. Nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she whispered, right before she sucked his bottom lip into her mouth and bit down.</p><p>Behind his eyelids, sparks of light exploded. Desire wound through him, stoking embers of lust that grew hotter. For so long, he\u2019d been waiting for her, waiting to be able to kiss her just because, touch her because she was near and welcomed it.</p><p>A sharp rap on the window startled them both, and he turned to see his sister, Isabella, standing there. Her caramel-colored hair was pulled into a haphazard bun, and she wore a Hurricane\u2019s Jersey with a stain on the shoulder.</p><p>She looked less than put together\u2014way less, but he wasn\u2019t about to comment on that, not with the red-rimmed eyes she sported.</p><p>Hoping his sister\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 lost his millions while on an extended stay in Vegas might not be very Christ-like, but he was human and he loved his sister, which only made his point about love not being easy. That guy had hurt Isabella, therefore making him the enemy, and Gabriel did not love him for it.</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad are waiting, love birds.\u201d Wrapping her arms around her middle, she walked back to the house.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all grown up now,\u201d Summer remarked, and he gave her a look.</p><p>\u201cBella\u2019s only three years younger than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is a lifetime younger than me.\u201d</p><p>Rather than agree or argue, because his family was in fact waiting for them, he got out, and strode around the truck to open her door.</p><p>Sometimes she waited for him to do it, while other times, she rolled her eyes and opened it herself. Tonight, she waited for him. For some reason he felt like taking her in his arms, but he didn\u2019t want to wrinkle her outfit or mess up her hairdo, since she and Jemma Leigh had spent so much time on them.</p><p>She wore a pale yellow dress with small beads on the hem. Her hair was braided in a crown around her head, with a sprig of flowers nestled in the back. Jemma Leigh should have become a stylist instead of real estate agent. The woman had major talent in his opinion.</p><p>\u201cWill you keep letting Jemma Leigh dress you after we get married?\u201d he asked as they walked hand and hand to the front porch.</p><p>\u201cYou want Jemma Leigh to come on our honeymoon?\u201d she asked, and he had to fight to keep from doing a little victory dance when he heard the teasing tone of her voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking neither of us will need much clothes for that,\u201d he said, not surprised his voice got all husky. Hell, he was arousing himself with thoughts of her nude and in bed with him.</p><p>She paused on the last step and stood on her tiptoes, putting her mouth against his ear. The sensations of her breasts rubbing his arm made him hard. \u201cI always thought you\u2019d like to see me wearing nothing but a tiny pair of thongs and some silk stockings.\u201d</p><p>His hands shot out, and he dug his fingers into the posts that flanked either side of the steps. \u201cAre you trying to kill me before the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>She tugged his ear between her teeth and then said, \u201cJust giving you something to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I looked anymore forward to it, we\u2019d already be on it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss the little smile of satisfaction on her face, and he couldn\u2019t stop his mouth from kicking up at the corners in response. Breathing in and out a few time to get control of his body, he finally moved to the front door.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he glanced at Summer. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave me... my side, I mean.\u201d But he caught her slip.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never leaving you again, and you can\u2019t make me go away,\u201d he promised and then he opened the door and stepped inside.</p><p>The first thing Summer noticed about the Edwards house was the noise.</p><p>It was loud, full of laughter, of music, and conversations. Lots and lots of conversations. Overwhelmed, she shrank back a little and gripped Gabriel\u2019s hand.</p><p>The second thing she noticed was all the kids.</p><p>They were everywhere, and so were their toys as they played. As a child, Summer had never been allowed to have store-bought toys. She and her sisters had played with century-old dolls, which had been made over every few years, and smelled of dried flowers. Painted-on faces were smudged from kisses and sticky fingers. They had tea sets and old dress-up clothes. They had each other.</p><p>She smiled a little at the bittersweet memory.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know the twins would have friends over this evening,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cI would have waited until Sunday if I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I knew you had a lot of brothers and sisters, but this... wow. I don\u2019t know how your mother does it,\u201d she said, genuinely offering up a compliment.</p><p>A little girl toddled over to Summer, Isabella holding her hand the entire time. The child had light brown skin and big hazel eyes, her hair in little puffs on each side of her head. When she smiled, Summer couldn\u2019t help but think of Ivy, and her heart stuttered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Irene,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cShe\u2019s staying here for a little while, until her momma can get back on her feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Irene,\u201d Gabriel said, kneeling beside her.</p><p>Summer remained standing, unable to do more than stare at the not-so-subtle reminder of what she\u2019d given up.</p><p>\u201cRemember me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The little girl nodded, biting her lip.</p><p>\u201cRemember the pretty lady I told you about?\u201d he asked, and again Irene nodded. \u201cThis is Summer, and she wanted to come meet you and everyone else tonight.\u201d</p><p>Irene let go of Isabella long enough to wrap her little arms around Summer\u2019s waist. Summer awkwardly patted her back, tears pricking at her eyes so hard that she was sure blood would flow.</p><p>\u201cI have to... please excuse me.\u201d Blindly, she stepped out of the little girl\u2019s reach and headed in the opposite direction of Gabriel, Isabella, and Irene. Especially Irene.</p><p>The first door she came to, she barreled inside and closed behind her, bursting into tears. Eventually, those tears turned to sobs, great heaving sobs that racked her body.</p><p>A soft click made her look up, but it was too late. She had been found. Tipping up her chin, she dared the intruder to say anything to her, but all Isabella did was take her in her arms and hug her.</p><p>At first, Summer didn\u2019t know what to do, so she simply let her arm dangle limply by her sides, but then she felt Isabella\u2019s body tremble, and her arms automatically went around the younger woman.</p><p>Summer had been hugged more in the past few weeks than she had in her entire life. Pretty sad, if she thought about it. So she pushed it out of her mind. She had enough sadness for a dozen people, without adding to it.</p><p>\u201cI know I should be comforting you, but I\u2019ve been a mess lately, and seeing your reaction to Irene...it just broke my heart,\u201d Isabella said with a sniff.</p><p>Summer swallowed. \u201cSo you only hugged me to get a hug back?\u201d That made absolutely no sense to Summer. Gabriel was one of the most affectionate men she knew.</p><p>\u201cNo. I wanted to talk to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no idea you were crying, until I heard you.\u201d</p><p>Summer felt her body go rigid. Who else had heard her? And if Gabriel had heard her, then why hadn\u2019t he come to comfort her? Not that she needed his comfort.</p><p>Stop lying to yourself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one else heard. Dad came in with a couple of lizards, and all the kids rushed him, making one lizard go up his sleeve and another down his pants. It\u2019s a regular madhouse as Gabriel and Momma try to contain the excitement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere goes the other one,\u201d a child squealed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Gabe\u2019s pants now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet it out!\u201d</p><p>A giggle burst from Summer\u2019s mouth. She couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Isabella sighed.</p><p>Finally, she let go of her, and Summer stepped back. She glanced around the room, taking note of the frilly bedcovers on the twin beds, the pink walls, and multiple posters of One Direction that plastered the closet doors. \u201cWas this your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGosh, no.\u201d Isabella made a face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead with a pink room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how you really feel,\u201d Summer muttered, and Isabella laughed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was really, really obsessed with all things turquoise when I was this age.\u201d Isabella\u2019s expression turned serious. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Dread clawed at her. \u201cYes.\u201d Isabella knew. Somehow, she knew of Summer\u2019s plan to marry Gabriel, sue for custody of Ivy, and then divorce him for his own good, so he could be with a woman who deserved him.</p><p>\u201cHow hard was it to give up Ivy?\u201d</p><p>Her insides were twisted once more, harder this time. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s very nice,\u201d Summer managed to choke out.</p><p>A fresh round of tears welled in Isabella\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to be nice. I\u2019m asking you, because, in about six months, I\u2019ll be doing the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Isabella\u2019s confession was so unexpected that Summer had to sit down on one of the beds in the room.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to shock you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not shocked,\u201d Summer said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m stunned, because... because...\u201d How could she say that she thought Isabella was exactly like Gabriel and had planned to wait for marriage, without making things worse?</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m the perfect preacher\u2019s daughter who\u2019s always done everything everyone\u2019s always told her?\u201d Isabella finished for her.</p><p>Summer smiled faintly. \u201cI was going to say a really nice girl, from a really nice family, who had her future planned a little differently.\u201d</p><p>Isabella snorted. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re Summer Holland, because the one I heard about and last saw at the Collins\u2019 Halloween Party wouldn\u2019t be this nice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Well, Isabella had her there, didn\u2019t she?</p><p>Summer had made to sure to cause a scene, to imply that she\u2019d slept with some woman\u2019s husband, and threatened to do the same with anyone else who was interested as well. In a word, she cemented every ugly thought that every long-time resident of Holland Springs had ever had about her family.</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but I was going through some things at the time.\u201d That was putting it lightly. She was depressed, barely holding on to a job, and living in a women\u2019s shelter.</p> <p>Only the promise of enough money to live on for years to come had given her extra incentive to burn down Strawberry Grove and take back the baby she\u2019d left in her sister\u2019s temporary care.</p><p>In the end, she\u2019d brought Ivy back, ill-equipped to take care of herself, much less a baby who no longer knew her. Not that any of those events mattered now.</p><p>She was healthy, and soon to be engaged and married to the most perfect man on the planet.</p><p>Isabella moved to the bed and sat down beside her. \u201cWas it hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder than anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Summer answered truthfully. Including coming back to Holland Springs and once again asking Gabriel to help her. \u201cBut at the time, it wasn\u2019t about me. It was about what was best for her.\u201d Just like this time, it was about what was best for her daughter, and Ivy belonged with her mother.</p> <p>Isabella placed a hand over her abdomen. \u201cEvery day I work with women who are put between a rock and a hard place by thoughtless men, or their own thoughtless choices. Never in a million years did I think I\u2019d be one of them by... by hooking up with a guy I barely knew, after drinking too much at a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that sounds pretty tame to you,\u201d Isabella added, not unkindly though.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d Summer said. She\u2019d never had a one-night stand, drunken or sober, but besides Isabelle most likely not believing her, and most likely feeling worse about herself if she did, Summer kept that to herself. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to the father and talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s half a world away.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, sympathy flooded Summer. \u201cIvy\u2019s Dad was in Afghanistan when I found out. He\u2019d come home on mid-tour and things... broke. Not long after, I broke, too, when I found out he\u2019d been killed in a roadside bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Isabella grabbed her hand, squeezing it. \u201cThe father isn\u2019t a soldier. I doubt he\u2019d ever go to war, much less join the military, because of his political beliefs.\u201d She groaned. \u201cThe one guy I decide to be wild with turns out to be the exact opposite of me in every way it counts\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOpposites attract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in God, and I\u2019m a missionary for goodness\u2019 sake.\u201d</p><p>Summer frowned. \u201cThat is a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing we have in common is an attraction to one another, but that wouldn\u2019t last, would it?\u201d Isabella stood and began pacing the room. \u201cBeing with someone just because they make you feel good and attractive, like there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you, is incredibly stupid, don\u2019t you think? I mean, what will you have later\u2014a summertime fling?\u201d</p><p>Would that be what her marriage to Gabriel would become\u2014a summertime fling? Because they certainly had nothing in common but chemistry. Heck, there were times when she questioned God, but he usually smacked her upside the head with something that made her want to say just kidding. So she just thought it, in case He was listening.</p><p>According to Gabriel, He was always listening.</p><p>\u201cA summer fling could be the start of something permanent, if you went and talked to him,\u201d Summer said, unable to believe what was coming out of her mouth. The women in her family certainly wouldn\u2019t have suggested such a thing. \u201cDoes he want the baby?\u201d</p><p>Isabella stopped pacing long enough to flush. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, and since he\u2019s a big proponent of choice, I\u2019m making the choice not to tell him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut is that who you really are, Isabella? If you disagree with him, then talk to him. Don\u2019t hide behind your beliefs and preconceived notions.\u201d Like she had with Gabriel, and like he had with her. Oh God, talking with his sister was making everything worse. It was like holding up a mirror.</p><p>There was a knock on the door, and then it opened. Summer quickly ran her fingers under eyes and patted her hair. Isabelle did the same.</p><p>Gabriel poked his head inside the room and grinned, his smile faltering when he saw Summer\u2019s face. What looked like tracks of tears streaked her cheeks. He glared at his sister, who also had the same pattern on her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Summer?\u201d He didn\u2019t care who had started it, or if anything had been started at all, but for once, he was going to automatically assume that Summer was the innocent party.</p><p>The tremulous smile she rewarded him with let him know he had made the right decision. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. Your sister was being very kind to me. I had a little panic attack, and she helped me calm down. It\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>But that didn\u2019t stop him from worrying. It was his nature to worry and protect.</p><p>Gabriel stepped inside the room, and his sister slipped out, but not before patting him reassuringly on the back. Summer met him halfway, smoothing down her dress as she walked.</p><p>Isabella was like that, always helping others, while giving no thought to her own well-being, and that\u2019s exactly why she\u2019d been used by her ex-fianc\u00e9. Isabella was too na\u00efve for her own good, but one day he knew she\u2019d meet the right man, and be happy with her personal life again.</p><p>\u201cToo many people, huh?\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cWe can go, if you like. Mom and Dad would understand. It\u2019s a madhouse tonight. I\u2019ll order some pizza, pick up a case of your favorite beer, and we can watch a movie at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you usually have dates over to your place?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of me if I said no?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She started to reply, but his mother\u2019s voice came floating down the hall, calling his name.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, bring that pretty date of yours outside so your father and I can meet her.\u201d</p><p>Panic registered on Summer\u2019s face. \u201cThey\u2019ll love you,\u201d he said, and then bit the side of his lip, making his dimples play in his cheeks. \u201cOkay, so my mom might not love you right now, because she and Elise\u2019s mom had become best friends, and were set on us marrying. But I promise no one will be unkind to you.\u201d</p><p>Summer glanced up at the ceiling. \u201cYeah, yeah, I know,\u201d she muttered and then fixed her gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019ve faced worse than a mother who wanted her son to marry a woman worthy of him.\u201d</p><p>Worthy of him? \u201cSummer,\u201d he began, but she stopped him with a sad smile.</p><p>\u201cGabriel, it\u2019s the truth. Everyone will think it, and you\u2019re fooling yourself if you think otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He touched his forehead to hers. \u201cWhen are you going to learn that I don\u2019t care what other people think?\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him, stepping back, and shaking her head. \u201cAnd when are you going to learn that you do?\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms over her chest, she walked out of the room.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>It could be worse, Gabriel thought.</p><p>Gloria smiled at Summer as she passed her the salad greens, but it didn\u2019t quite meet his mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Summer said, before serving a portion on her plate. She passed the bowl to Isabella, adding some dressing and starting to eat.</p><p>Everyone looked at Summer, and Gabriel reached under the table and grabbed Summer\u2019s knee. Startled, she dropped the fork and looked up at him, cheeks turning red at an alarming rate as she realized everyone else was staring. \u201cIs something the matter?\u201d</p><p>Irene giggled. \u201cWe haven\u2019t said the blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo Grace. No food,\u201d Paul intoned.</p><p>\u201cAngels are weeping,\u201d one of the twins\u2019 friends said.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Isabella glared at the preteen.</p><p>Yeah, he should have waited until Sunday, but he was about to go out of his mind. However, he couldn\u2019t just get engaged and show up at his parents\u2019 house, with a woman they\u2019d known only by reputation. Most likely, their extremely short engagement would raise some eyebrows, and make more than one old biddy measure Summer\u2019s waist with her eyes for the next nine months.</p><p>Yet another obstacle they would have to overcome together.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looked as though she wanted to crawl under the table and hide.</p><p>Gabriel caught her eye, picked up a roll, and took a huge bite out of it. \u201cWhoops,\u201d he said with a wink. The grateful, yet surprised look she gave him made him want to jump up from the table and take her in his arms. He didn\u2019t doubt that very few people had ever tried to make things easier on her.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, I forget too,\u201d his dad said. \u201cThe meals Gloria prepares are that good.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s gaze flew to his dad\u2019s face, and his mother positively beamed at the compliment.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t correct our guests,\u201d his mother said to the girl beside her. \u201cApologize to Summer. We want her to feel welcome and come back again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d the preteen said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Summer said, ducking her head. \u201cI should have asked first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWe should have told you, like good hosts.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s head came up, and the color of her cheeks stopped flaming. One of the twins\u2019 friends spilled a glass of milk, and everyone, it seemed, jumped up and started talking all at once again.</p><p>Gabriel turned to his mother. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be happy with what happened with Elise, but I can\u2019t help but think that the plan I had for you wasn\u2019t the one you were meant to follow,\u201d his mother said just soft enough so her voice wouldn\u2019t carry. \u201cYou have nothing to worry about. I\u2019ll get over myself, and love that girl, just as you do. We all will.\u201d</p><p>He gave his mother a grateful look. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She patted his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s what a mother is supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>After blessing the food, everyone ate, including Summer. He watched as she and Isabella carried on a conversation at levels too low for him to hear, but he didn\u2019t care. It eased his mind to see the two of them get along.</p><p>Summer caught him staring at her, from across the table. She smiled, and he couldn\u2019t help but smile back.</p><p>Having her here, in the house he\u2019d grown up in, was like a teenage boy\u2019s dream come true. All he needed to do later was kiss her in his bedroom, and then his life would be complete. His smile grew bigger at his ridiculous thoughts.</p><p>Summer wrinkled her nose, her head tilting to one side as if to say, What are you thinking?</p><p>Later that evening, after the dishes had been done and the kids were either in bed or watching a movie, Gabriel and his dad sat on the front porch, in their usual spots. Inside, he could hear his mother and sister\u2019s laughter, with Summer\u2019s chiming in every so often.</p><p>She needed to laugh more. Laughter was good for the soul. Hearing Summer laugh was good for his soul.</p><p>\u201cI plan on asking Summer to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little unexpected,\u201d his dad said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good for a man to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on asking her next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken with her parents?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel twisted his lips a little. \u201cYou know as well as I do that Summer\u2019s mother skipped town a long time ago, and no one knows who her dad is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be someone.\u201d His dad held up his hands. \u201cI know, I sound a little old-fashioned, but Summer deserves respect. I doubt she\u2019s been afforded that for much of her life.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel considered the few people Summer spent time with\u2014Jemma Leigh, Blackbeard, her customers, and him. \u201cThe only person I can think of is Jemma Leigh. She\u2019s been looking after her, and making sure that I get her home on time after every date, because a lady\u2019s never out past midnight.\u201d</p><p>His dad chuckled. \u201cI like Jemma Leigh. She has a good heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made it her mission to be Summer\u2019s best friend, but more often than not acts like a mother hen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your answer, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves weddings, and will be happy to help Summer plan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding will happen before the end of the month.\u201d Gabriel mulled over his next words. \u201cSummer and I have talked about getting married before, and neither of us wants a long engagement.\u201d</p><p>His dad stopped rocking. \u201cGabriel.\u201d</p><p>Oh, good grief. He gave his dad a look. \u201cShe\u2019s not... I didn\u2019t put her or us in that position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what people will think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you\u2019d be surprised how much it will matter.\u201d His dad exhaled. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Gabriel, but you do value your reputation too highly.\u201d</p><p>The assertion hit a little too close to home for him. \u201cWith the exception of one time, I\u2019ve done nothing but be a good son to you, to prove that you two didn\u2019t make a bad decision when I was adopted. You\u2019re a pastor, for goodness sake. My reputation is a reflection of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your responsibility,\u201d his dad said sharply. \u201cBeing a man of God who keeps his words and promises, loves his friends as well as his enemies, as well as lays down his life for the one he marries\u2014that\u2019s your responsibility. Your mother and I loved you from the start, and for you to suggest it was based on how good you were or are...Frankly, it\u2019s an insult, and one a grown man shouldn\u2019t give to the people who raised him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Immediately chastised, Gabriel settled back in his chair, scrubbing his hand over his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2014I only meant to say that I don\u2019t care what others think of me. The only opinion that matters the most is Summer\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His dad smiled. \u201cSee that you keep thinking like that, and I\u2019ll talk to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me about what?\u201d Gloria asked as she stepped outside.</p> <p>Gabriel could let his dad smooth things over, or he could be a man and tell his mother his plans. Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if Summer would say no.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Summer to marry me and,\u201d he swallowed, \u201cif all goes well, then we would get married before the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Worry lines appeared on his mother\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cNothing elaborate. Just here, in the backyard, with family. I thought we could do something low-key.\u201d Besides, weddings took time, and since they had very little time, the smaller the better.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d his mother exclaimed. \u201cThat girl will have a dream wedding, with the entire town invited. We won\u2019t hide Summer in the backyard, like we\u2019re ashamed of her. \u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of her,\u201d Gabriel snapped, then held up his hand and winced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d She touched his face and smiled. \u201cLet us take care of everything, with her input of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe might not let you,\u201d Gabriel pointed out.</p><p>His dad chuckled. \u201cWhen has that stopped your mother?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stood. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know how it goes first, before you start planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d his mother said smoothly. \u201cThen we can get started.\u201d</p> <p>Smiling, Gabriel shook his head. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what family does,\u201d his dad said softly.</p><p>Summer kept quiet as long as she could before she finally blurted, \u201cWhat did you and Gabriel talk about at lunch today?\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh took a sip of her coffee, her eyes sparkling. \u201cA little of this and a lot of that.\u201d</p><p>Summer sat back in her chair, crossing her arms over her chest, and trying her best to pin Jemma Leigh with a dirty look, but she couldn\u2019t keep it for long.</p><p>She and Jemma Leigh had made it a habit to meet each other at Muffin Top\u2019s at least twice a week. At the rate they were eating muffins, Summer might have to buy an entirely new wardrobe in a larger size. To compensate, she took long walks, ate light lunches, and had her standard bowl of cereal for supper\u2014unless Gabriel took her out on a date.</p><p>\u201cYou can stare at me until there\u2019s a hole in my head, but I\u2019m not saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me if it was a good thing or a bad thing.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma Leigh grinned. \u201cThat all depends on you, sugar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got your sugar,\u201d Summer muttered as Jemma Leigh waved at a group of women. Every single one of them waved back. Was there anyone is this town she didn\u2019t know? Then again, Jemma Leigh\u2019s mother was the former mayor of Holland Springs, so it was probably her job to know who people were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be coming by tomorrow evening to get you ready. I\u2019m thinking pearls and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fuss over me like you do,\u201d Summer said, thinking of all the time Jemma Leigh had spent away from her family to help her. All the times she and Jemma Leigh would talk and laugh... Okay, so Jemma Leigh did most of the talking and laughing, but, for once, Summer felt like she was part of a group, even if their group was only a duo.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun, and you\u2019re such a good listener, though I wish you would talk more, but like sister like sister, I guess,\u201d Jemma Leigh sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou and Rose are really good friends?\u201d Was she a substitute for Rose? Summer didn\u2019t want to be a substitute for anyone. It was bad enough she had convinced Gabriel to marry her, when he should marry for love and to someone who deserved a man like him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t call us really good friends. The only person Rose opens up to is Alexander, but since he\u2019s her husband, I can\u2019t be put out by that. You probably won\u2019t believe me, but when I was growing up, I used to envy you Holland sisters.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s mouth dropped open, even as she kept a firm grip on her coffee cup. She absolutely couldn\u2019t believe that. \u201cEnvy us?\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh waved a hand in the air. \u201cThree sisters, always hanging out with each other, always leaning on each other... I\u2019m an only child, and I was in awe. The three of you were like your own little clique, and gorgeous to boot. I wanted to be a part of that.\u201d She gave Summer a shy smile. \u201cSorry it took me so long to try to be your friend.\u201d</p><p>Would the people of Holland Springs ever quit surprising her? Besides, Summer had grown fond of Jemma Leigh. She acted like an older sister, looking after her like she did, and always waiting with her for Gabriel to pick her up. It was like she actually cared about Summer\u2019s feelings.</p><p>Summer tentatively reach out her hand and covered Jemma Leigh\u2019s. The woman\u2019s eyes rounded a little, and Summer could have sworn that tears glistened in them. From now on, she would be a true friend to Jemma Leigh, instead of merely putting up with her, or at least telling herself that she was putting up with her.</p><p>\u201cBetter late than never, right?\u201d Summer said with a smile.</p><p>Jemma Leigh smiled right back at her. \u201cDarn right.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The next evening, Gabriel brought her to his house, like he had promised, but he didn\u2019t take her inside. Instead, he led her to the back, to where his view of the Pamlico Sound was best.</p><p>Water lapped at the edges of the small beach, fireflies danced in the yard, and the heady scent of gardenias swirled around her. Stars were starting to twinkle in the sky.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember this place?\u201d</p><p>She turned this way and that, taking in the large backyard, the massive live oaks, and the Low Country-styled house.</p><p>\u201cIt looks a little familiar, but no.\u201d She gave him an apologetic grin. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>He turned her to the right, pointing at the forest. \u201cWe built our teepee over there.\u201d</p><p>Summer gasped. \u201cYou bought the Simmons\u2019 place?\u201d She and Gabriel had spent so much time here as children, year after year, until he\u2019d given Summer her first kiss. Then, things had started to change between them.</p><p>\u201cI had to.\u201d</p><p>Summer slipped her hand in his. \u201cYou had to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered simply, and it was then she remembered.</p><p>This had been the house of her dreams. Before Gabriel had moved to Holland Springs, a family had lived in that house, a mom, dad, and three kids\u2014all boys. Curious, she would watch them, laughing at their antics and smiling wistfully at the parents who loved them.</p><p>Eventually, they moved away and the house became rundown, but she hadn\u2019t stopped coming here. At least, not until the first time she ran away from Holland Springs, with a pocket full of cash and a stolen car, payment from Patrick Johnson\u2019s father when he\u2019d caught his son with her.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t structurally sound, so I had to spend a lot of time and money having it shored up and redesigned, but it was worth it,\u201d he said, unaware of her less-than-happy thoughts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even able to move in, until a month ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill living out of boxes?\u201d she asked, trying to push them away, but not quick enough to escape Gabriel\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sad right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemories.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, and then pulled something out of his pocket. \u201cI hoped by bringing you here would make you happy, and be something we could tell our kids about in the future.\u201d He opened his hand. A ring with a single diamond lay in the center of his palm. She didn\u2019t know enough about jewelry, except to think that it was pretty and she didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cJemma Leigh gave us her blessing,\u201d he added.</p><p>Her heart stuttered. \u201cIt\u2019s just a marriage of convenience,\u201d she said without thinking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that, and you know it.\u201d He slipped the ring on her finger. \u201cMarry me, Summer Holland and make me the ha\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed him before he could say happy, because she couldn\u2019t bear to hear the word. There was no way she\u2019d ever make him happy, at least not permanently. But she could offer him moments of happiness, moments of pleasure that would make him not regret helping her.</p><p>He stood there, not kissing her back.</p><p>For a moment, she was worried that she\u2019d done the wrong things, but then his arms wrapped around her, holding her tight. His mouth fastened to hers, tongue slipping inside to touch hers.</p><p>She ran her hands down his back, slipping them under the hem of his polo shirt and gliding up the hard planes.</p><p>He groaned in pleasure. She\u2019d heard the sound often enough to recognize it. Lightly, she let her nails rake the skin, and he murmured her name. He tore his mouth away from hers, kissing up the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI want to take you inside so badly,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She let her head fall to one side to give him better access. \u201cNo one\u2019s stopping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stopping me. I can wait a few more days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow?\u201d she asked, shivering in pleasure as he bit the lobe of her ear.</p><p>\u201cToo soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of what we could be doing by tomorrow night.\u201d She grabbed his hand and placed it on her breast. \u201cWhat you could be touching again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me. Killing. Me.\u201d</p><p>Peering at him through her lashes, she unbuttoned the tiny fastenings in the middle of her dress and let it gape open. \u201cWill these bring you back to life?\u201d</p><p>With a groan, he fell to his knees, burying his face in her chest. She threaded her fingers in his hair, holding him close. \u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he murmured. His lips teased the skin on her left breast, and she almost fell to her knees. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you.\u201d The fabric of her dress pooled around her waist and he looked up at her, desire glittering in his eyes. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He stood, and she thought he would, in fact, take off his shirt, but all he did was lightly kiss her mouth while adjusting her dress. \u201cI have limits, Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think less of you, if we had sex, right now,\u201d she said. There would be no gloating on her part, no satisfaction had at making him so desperate for her that he would give up everything he believed. \u201cI want you to make love to me, Gabriel.\u201d She trailed the backs of her fingers down the center of her chest, and then cupped her breasts. His nostrils flared, and she felt a thrill of pleasure run though her at the sight of raw need. \u201cPlease don\u2019t keep me waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get married this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Somehow, Gabriel had talked the town\u2019s clerk into expediting the marriage license, which is why she stood in the middle of the guest bedroom, at Gabriel\u2019s parents\u2019 house at the beach, while she waited for Jemma Leigh to bring her a glass of water.</p><p>According to Jemma Leigh, who was serving as her maid of honor, the entire town was agog over the wedding. No one could remember the last time a Holland had actually gotten married in Holland Springs, let alone to a local boy\u2014and the preacher\u2019s son to boot.</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Yet here she was, doing exactly that. Maybe she should have done like her sister, and gotten married in a foreign country. Only then, she would be more indebted to the Jemma Leigh and Gabriel\u2019s parents.</p><p>Jemma Leigh had helped her find a dress, while his parents had insisted on taking care of the wedding and reception, and they had insisted on inviting the entire congregation of Grace Baptist Church.</p><p>The thought of all those people staring at her, judging her, as she walked down a sandy aisle to exchange vows on a perfect stretch of beach made her want to puke.</p><p>Gloria stuck her head inside the room. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Gloria walked in, carrying a length of lace. \u201cThis was my wedding veil, and I\u2019d be honored if you would wear it.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, Summer reached up to pat her hair. Jemma Leigh had gathered it at the crown, leaving most of it loose, with flowers woven in. \u201cWill it fit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around and let\u2019s see.\u201d Gloria tucked the comb in, fluffing the lace a little. Their gazes met in the full-length mirror propped against the wall. Tears were in Gloria\u2019s. \u201cQue bonita,\u201d she sighed. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s great-grandmother\u2019s veil. She brought it with her to California from Spain, as a part of her wedding trousseau. It was an arranged marriage, but since then, only love has been the reason for marriages in this family.\u201d</p><p>Nausea made Summer\u2019s stomach churn. This wasn\u2019t love. This was a marriage of necessity. \u201cI\u2019ll give it back to you, for Isabella\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s for the firstborn or his bride, and one day, you will do the same.\u201d Gloria kissed her cheek. \u201cMy newest daughter, you are a beautiful bride.\u201d</p><p>Summer wanted to sit on the floor and bawl like a baby, but not before she gave the veil back. There was no way she could go through with this, no way she could hurt his entire family like this. But just as she reached for the veil, Jemma Leigh came barreling through the door, took one look at her, and burst into tears. Again.</p><p>\u201cOh my word, Summer,\u201d Jemma Leigh exclaimed, placing a hand over her heart. Tears spilled over her lashes and onto her cheeks. \u201cThat was just the finishing touch we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my something borrowed,\u201d Summer said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gloria clucked her tongue. \u201cNo, this is your something old.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh gestured to Summer\u2019s ears. \u201cThe earrings are something borrowed and blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA penny for your shoes.\u201d Isabella\u2019s voice cheerfully rang out.</p> <p>Summer wiggled her toes. \u201cI\u2019m barefoot.\u201d</p><p>Isabella shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need it anyway. Gabriel is the nervous one.\u201d</p><p>Summer blinked. \u201cHe\u2019s nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is, he\u2019s marrying the woman he\u2019s loved since he was fifteen,\u201d Gloria said, and the world tilted on Summer. She felt dizzy. She felt like a fraud.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it\u2019s contagious,\u201d Isabella said with a little laugh, helping Summer to the bed. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to sit down, is all,\u201d Summer gasped, breathing slowly and gripping the bedpost.</p><p>Jemma Leigh and Gloria exchanged smiling looks. Summer felt even worse.</p><p>\u201cSit down and drink some water, sugar,\u201d Jemma Leigh said, helping her to a high-backed chair and handing her a glass. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your lipstick.\u201d</p><p>Summer sat there, drinking water, while she debated on whether or not she should run away. She had no idea why anyone called it having cold feet, because she felt hot all over.</p><p>Before she knew it, Gloria and Jemma Leigh were herding her out the door and into the backyard. They walked with her to the beach, where everyone was sitting in rows of chairs as they waited on her.</p><p>The sun shone bright as music played. She could hear the waves lapping on the shore. A few seagulls cried out. It was perfectly warm, perfectly breezy, and she was a perfect fraud.</p> <p>She blinked, trying to get her eyes to adjust. Gabriel came into focus, standing in front of an arch of roses and ivy. He looked so handsome standing there, dressed in a pale blue shirt and khaki pants. His dark hair gleamed in the sun, as did his tan skin. Her mouth twisted a little when she realized he was as barefoot as she was.</p><p>He smiled, his entire face lighting up with joy, and it seemed his dark blue eyes glowed.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help but go to him, then, and take his arm, listening to the words and repeating her vows. All she could see and think and feel and breathe in those moments were Gabriel.</p><p>Angel.</p><p>He kissed her, and she kissed him back, not wanting this moment to end. Not wanting reality to crash and make her want to burn this time in her life away. Not wanting anything or anyone but this man, standing in front of her and kissing her like he loved her.</p><p>Everyone clapped and cheered for them. The sound snapped her out of her thoughts.</p><p>Get a hold of yourself.</p><p>Summer stepped back, face flushing. Gabriel\u2019s face was flushed as well.</p> <p>\u201cYou make a beautiful bride, Mrs. Edwards,\u201d he said, his voice husky with desire.</p><p>Mrs. Edwards. She smiled at him, and for once in her life, she had no comeback at all.</p><p>They were married.</p><p>To each other.</p><p>Forever, according to their vows and to Gabriel himself.</p><p>Married.</p><p>Until death do us part.</p><p>MARRIED.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop thinking of that word, and all it meant to him, all it didn\u2019t mean to her, while the wedding party was hugged, kissed, and wished nothing but the best.</p><p>\u201cI like the flowers in your hair,\u201d Gabriel said as they sat at an elaborately decorated table just for the two of them. \u201cThe veil\u2019s pretty, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mother gave me the veil.\u201d</p><p>His dark brows rose. \u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to look at him, so she glanced at their feet. \u201cI can\u2019t thank your parents enough for doing this. I hadn\u2019t thought of all the things that go into weddings. They\u2019re not exactly looked upon too favorably in my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet, Rose married anyway.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, someone tapped a spoon against their glass. So, of course, she and Gabriel had to kiss.</p><p>And, of course, everyone had to cheer and say awww.</p><p>And,of course, she wanted to go throw herself into the ocean.</p><p>\u201cTonight can\u2019t come fast enough,\u201d Gabriel said, brushing his mouth over hers. She shivered in response, her skin coming alive at the feel of him.</p><p>Summer tried to smile, tried to be cheerful and happy, but all she could manage was a little, \u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they had eaten and were driving away, with shoes tied to the bumper and a Just Married sign on the back of Gabriel\u2019s truck, did she realize that she had no clue where they were going. She didn\u2019t expect a honeymoon. There wasn\u2019t enough time to plan one, and she had no passport to go anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, because she was at least curious about his plans.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Gabriel held out his arms to Summer, and she went willingly into them, her body shaking. They were in the master bedroom of his house, and she knew what would happen next. She knew what he expected and what she wanted, and she knew that they were the same.</p><p>Still...</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d he asked, his hands gliding down her back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done this before, remember?\u201d She wanted to smack herself for saying that, for reminding him of the rumors and the truths he thought he knew about her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have pretend with me, not anymore,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She made a noise in her throat. \u201cI\u2019m not pretending.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, gazing down at her. \u201cWhat you think I want isn\u2019t what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over your face.\u201d He rubbed the pad of his thumb over her cheek. \u201cI want you, Summer Jean Holland Edwards and no one else. I want to make love to you all night and tomorrow and the next day. I want to love you for so long and so good that you\u2019ll never want our honeymoon to end.\u201d</p><p>Wanting she could understand. Sexually needing her, she could handle. \u201cLofty goals for a virgin, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she said with a teasing grin.</p><p>\u201cI might still be a virgin, but I did some research so I wouldn\u2019t be totally unprepared.\u201d His gaze skittered away, and he rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cBut I completely understand if you\u2019d like to wait until later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s the nervous one now.\u201d She stepped out of his embrace.</p><p>His gaze snapped back to hers. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous. I\u2019m trying to be considerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want considerate.\u201d She tossed her hair over her shoulder. \u201cMaybe I want your hands and mouth all over me.\u201d Boldly, she reached out and cupped him between his legs, licking her lips at the thickness and length she found. He groaned, low in his throat, and her confidence grew. \u201cMaybe I want this inside of me. Right. Now.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel didn\u2019t move, and for one horrible minute, she thought he didn\u2019t want her at all. But then his arm snaked out, and he grabbed her wrist, tugging her to him. He kissed her, hotly and tenderly, all the while working at the zipper of her dress.</p><p>Finally, it gave. He pushed the straps over her shoulders and down her arms, to where it fell and pooled around her feet. His own clothes were the next to go, until he stood hard and proud for her. All hard, tight abs with muscular thighs and long legs. His shoulders were broad and his arms, good Lord, his arms were muscular but lean.</p><p>\u201cDo I meet your approval?\u201d he asked, looking at her from beneath his lashes.</p><p>She gave him a saucy smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he took her in his arms once more, sucked on her bottom lip and then glided his tongue along the seams of her mouth until she opened for him. The room seemed to move, but no, it was just him, guiding her to his big bed and laying her down.</p><p>He stretched out beside her, one hand propping up his head while the other touched her, traced the contours of her body. \u201cTake off the bra.\u201d</p><p>She unsnapped the front and threw it across the room, anxious for his touch. But to her surprise, he didn\u2019t touch her breasts at all, just made lazy, wide circles around them. Her nipples grew hard, and his dark gaze didn\u2019t miss it.</p><p>She sucked in air when his head dipped, when his tongue teased the tip of a nipple and his fingers slid inside her panties. Her thighs widened, and he wrapped his hot mouth around her nipple and began to suck.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she moaned, coming off the bed. His fingers slid through her curls, finding her as wet as she\u2019d ever been in her life.</p><p>\u201cDo you like this?\u201d he asked softly against her skin while circling her clitoris.</p><p>She whimpered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your panties.\u201d</p><p>Once the lacy material had been removed and thrown to the other side of the bed, he parted her, and she grabbed his wrist. Always, she\u2019d envisioned being the one in control, the one who pinned him to the bed and took his breath away, like the night she had on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cTrust me,\u201d he said, leaning up to kiss her on the lips. \u201cTrust me to take care of you.\u201d Finger by finger, she released her death grip on him. \u201cBreathe, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again and again, while his fingers explored... while one of those fingers slid inside of her. This time, both of them sucked in air. Her lashes fluttered, and she caught a glimpse of his face. It was drawn taut, as if it actually hurt to touch her and kiss her.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d she murmured, trying again to take control, to not let the emotions that simmered below the surface boil up and wash away her determination. \u201cLet me ease you. Let me stroke you, put you inside of me... just let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He slid another finger inside of her and she couldn\u2019t stop her hips from moving against him. Then he began to move, all that wetness making her slippery. She not only felt how aroused she was, she could hear it.</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt, she thought. For once in her life, it didn\u2019t hurt to let another take control. So, she completely surrendered to Gabriel\u2019s touch... his kisses. She surrendered to his hands and mouth and beautiful words that she wouldn\u2019t allow her mind to dwell on.</p><p>He lowered himself onto her, balancing on his elbows. His cock nudged insistently against her thigh. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d She pressed her bare chest against his, and he hissed. \u201cNot sure what you wanted to do for\u2014\u201d She glided her leg up the back of his leg and he shook. \u201cProtection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are condoms,\u201d she said, reaching between them and touching him. \u201cBut most men complain about the feel.\u201d He frowned, and then his face went deliciously tight again when she cupped his balls. \u201cOr you can go bareback and pull out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I pull out?\u201d</p><p>He was on edge, she realized, and would soon snap. Wouldn\u2019t it be a completely erotic sight to see him snap, now that she was back in control again? Always she would fight for this kind of control, even though surrendering to him had felt so blissfully good.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, because I\u2019m on the pill.\u201d She nipped at his bottom lip. \u201cSo you can go hard and deep and never, ever pull out. You can fill me up until\u2014\u201d</p><p>He shoved her hand away, gripped her thighs, and began to push inside. She made a noise of discomfort. The sheer size of him was amazingly good and bad.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d But it did hurt a little. She hadn\u2019t been with another man since Darius, before Ivy had been born. Only, she couldn\u2019t tell him any of that. It was too much exposure for her heart and soul.</p><p>Suddenly, he pulled out, and she clutched at his back. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d was all he said before he pushed down her body, and palmed her butt in his big hands, lifting her to his mouth. \u201cYou almost made me forget about what I\u2019ve been dying to do to you, with that dirty talking you were doing, sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>She squirmed, not used to being on display like this.</p><p>Once again, he\u2019d taken over and she felt helpless to stop him. His head dipped, black hair brushing against her pale thighs. The first long lick of his tongue made her curl her hands into tight fists, the second had her begging for more, and the third, well, there wasn\u2019t a third.</p><p>Instead, he settled himself between her thighs and feasted. \u201cI delight in the taste of my lover,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She caught the grin, the heated look in his eyes, right before he sucked her clit into his mouth. \u201cAngel, angel,\u201d she chanted, teetering on the edge of what she knew would be an earth-shaking orgasm.</p><p>He sucked harder, and she almost screamed his name.</p><p>\u201cLove hearing you say that,\u201d he growled, crawling up her body. \u201cSay it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d she moaned as he slid inside her. She gasped, and her eyes opened wide.</p><p>Gabriel gazed down at her, his face tight. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long I can last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d she confessed. Forget control. All she wanted was him.</p><p>His head dropped, and he began to move.</p><p>Oh God, he moved and stroked and touched her in just the right spot, gave her clitoris a little pat that made her arch off the bed and into him. He did it again and drove himself so deep that she swore she could taste him in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cLike that?\u201d he asked roughly</p><p>Burying her face into the crook of his neck was her only response. He didn\u2019t let up, didn\u2019t give her a chance to find her bearings, or even to think of what she should do next. Where she could touch him and make him\u2014</p><p>He shifted, the head of his cock hitting her in just the right spot, and she saw stars.</p><p>Widening her legs, she fisted her hands in his hair and brought his mouth to hers, kissing him. And kissing him some more, until she came, crying out his name and begging for him to never stop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop. More,\u201d she said, dragging in a breath.</p><p>\u201cI have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p> <p>He drew in a ragged breath, his chest heaving. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>She plunged her tongue inside of his mouth and wrapped her legs around his waist. He bucked against her, driving deep and hard, until finally, finally he melted into her and groaned her name... Until he returned her frantic kisses with tender ones.</p><p>He gently brushed the hair out of her face, his blue eyes soft and blazing with love. For her. A part of her wanted to deny it and chalk it up to his first time, but a larger part of her, the part of her who wanted to be loved and cherished, refused to be ignored.</p><p>\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned, all boyish and proud. \u201cSo, a repeat performance wouldn\u2019t be out of the question?\u201d</p> <p>She shifted beneath him, eyes widening when she felt how quickly he was filling her again. \u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting a long, long time,\u201d he said, then sucked on her bottom lip and let it out with a little pop. \u201cPractice makes perfect, and I want every time to be perfect with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already is,\u201d she heard herself say. He pulled away a little, tilting his head to one side. She put her fingers against his lips. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tips before nudging them out of his way. \u201cMy sweet wife, I\u2019d never use what we say here and now against you. I\u2019d never throw it in your face when you let down your walls and allow me inside.\u201d</p><p>Tears threatened her resolve.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know what an honor it is for me? Don\u2019t you know how much I cherish you and what we\u2019ve already done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGabriel,\u201d she began, but the words wouldn\u2019t come, and thankfully, neither would the tears.</p><p>He swept his lips over hers. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, sweetheart, but maybe one day you\u2019ll let down all your walls and not be so afraid to let me see the real you.\u201d</p><p>His words made her all gooey inside, yet at the same time, made her stiffen against him, but he took it as a sign to move.</p><p>And thank God he did, because when he moved, she stopped thinking and started feeling him. He surrounded her, held her, and whispered words of love that didn\u2019t require her to say anything back.</p><p>Her angel didn\u2019t require anything from her at all, but for her to be her, and that was the best and the worst thing about their situation.</p><p>\u201cThis is for you. It\u2019s a wedding present.\u201d Gabriel handed her a large, brightly wrapped box after they\u2019d eaten breakfast in bed. He\u2019d loved waking up with her this morning, kissing her and sliding inside, moving in slow glides until she\u2019d urged him faster and harder. He loved the look on her face when he made her lounge in bed while he cooked her breakfast.</p><p>Honestly, he loved everything about her. Always had and always would.</p><p>\u201cI have one for you, too,\u201d she said, setting her present down beside her before slipping from the bed and padding over to the closet. She still hadn\u2019t unpacked, but he\u2019d been keeping her occupied, so... She came back to bed, smiling shyly as she handed it to him, and crawled back in bed. \u201cI had a little help picking it out. I needed to make sure you didn\u2019t have this one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said. He watched as she carefully opened the present, not tearing into the wrapping paper or breaking the bow. \u201cWe have a ton of presents to go through, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the wedding?\u201d Her brow wrinkled as she pulled away the last of the paper. \u201cOh my... angel,\u201d she breathed, her gaze going from the art set he\u2019d bought her, to his face, and then back again. \u201cYou remembered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember the blue ribbon you won for your painting of a field of wildflowers. Town Hall had it on display for days.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cIt has everything you could need, except paint. I thought we could go to one of those hobby stores in Wilmington to pick some out, and anything else you might need.\u201d</p><p>She hugged it to her chest. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wonder what happened to your painting?\u201d</p><p>Her face fell a little. \u201cI heard they threw it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He gestured to the painting over the bed, and her eyes widened before she giggled. \u201cI found it in one of the storage rooms a few years back when they needed help searching through old documents. Jemma Leigh\u2019s mother said I could keep it, since the town didn\u2019t own it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d Her attention was fully on the swirls of green, red, yellow, blue, purple, and pink. It was actually a really good painting, almost lifelike. He\u2019d always thought she had a talent for art.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be offended if you\u2019d noticed,\u201d he teased. \u201cI\u2019ve been working very hard to dispel the myth that waiting until you get married to have sex is a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, and then leaned over to kiss him sweetly on the cheek. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>He opened his present, just as careful with the paper as she had been, to find that she\u2019d bought him a book on astronomy. It was one he\u2019d been eyeing for a while, but hadn\u2019t bought yet. \u201cNow who\u2019s the one remembering?\u201d</p><p>Biting the side of her lip, she shrugged and then said, \u201cI\u2019m happy you like it. Maybe you can show me how to use your telescope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I read an article about using feather brushes during sex,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d She held out the box. \u201cPreferably with a demonstration.\u201d</p><p>He tackled her to the bed instead, laughing and kissing her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t face Gabriel or herself the next morning when she woke up, and certainly not after showering and finding him sleeping so peacefully. Instead, she wrapped a quilt around her body and stepped outside, walking down to the end of the pier and sitting down.</p><p>The sun had barely risen in the sky, but she couldn\u2019t welcome the dawn of a new day, because today was not only the last day of their honeymoon, it was also the last day she would allow herself to feel vulnerable, to surrender completely, and believe what he insisted on telling her.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>You\u2019re mine.</p><p>We belong together.</p><p>You\u2019re perfect.</p><p>Lies. All lies. Though he didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>Gabriel actually believed those pretty lies, with his entire heart and soul. She knew this about him. She knew he didn\u2019t give his love lightly to her, and that\u2019s what made it all the worse for both of them, because she would leave him. He knew from the start what her goal was, and what would happen once she met it.</p><p>After she got Ivy back, everything would be right in the world again. She would be whole once more, the aching part of her heart that had been missing for so long finally filled. It didn\u2019t matter that the lawyer didn\u2019t think she had a chance in hell of getting her back, because Summer was confident she could make Rose see things her way.</p><p>She could make Rose acknowledge that she, Ivy\u2019s biological mother, was who was best for her. She could make Gabriel see that she wasn\u2019t who was best for him.</p><p>The art kit had been the final straw.</p><p>She could\u2014her vision blurred. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d she whispered fiercely.</p><p>Gabriel stretched and rolled over in bed, searching for his wife. \u201cWife,\u201d he said with a smile, then his smile fell when his hand encountered nothing but cold sheets. Cold sheets meant she\u2019d been up for hours, without waking him.</p><p>\u201cSummer?\u201d He rose from bed, rubbing his chest and yawning before he grabbed a pair old of pajama pants.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, so he tried again. \u201cSummer?\u201d</p><p>The cold from the sheets seemed seep inside him from across the room when silence met him, but he tried not to let that bother him. Summer had always been an early riser. Striding to the back door, he opened it and went outside. Warm relief flooded him when he spotted her at the end of the pier, wrapped in a quilt.</p><p>Warm relief turned to hot desire when she dropped the quilt. He would never get used to the sight of her, all golden skin and soft curves.</p><p>The last time she had been in Holland Springs, her body had been almost as sharp as her words. Her body had felt bony and brittle. It had worried him so much that he\u2019d made her get something to eat before taking her to Ivy, but now that she\u2019d filled out again, her skin no longer looked stretched tight over muscle and bones.</p><p>Still, she wasn\u2019t as strong as she would have him and everyone else believe. Like the graceful willow tree he had planted in his yard, if too much strain and pressure were applied, eventually she would break.</p><p>Summer turned slowly, the look on her face both heartbreaking and heart racing. He\u2019d seen it often enough to know she was determined to prove she had control. It wasn\u2019t a matter of controlling him; it was a matter of controlling her situation.</p><p>\u201cNot again,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Instead of waiting for her to come to him, he went to her first. The grass was cold and dewy under his feet, but he didn\u2019t care. All he could think and feel and see was her\u2014standing there, waiting for him. He had to save her.</p><p>She thrust out her breasts, raised her arms over her head, and stretched. \u201cMorning,\u201d she said as he stopped a couple of feet away.</p><p>\u201cMissed you this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d She took a small step toward him before running a hand up his bare chest. \u201cWant me to make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think you should do.\u201d</p><p>A flash of annoyance appeared in her eyes. Gracefully, she kneeled in front of him and pulled down his pants, freeing his erection. His vision sparked, a hot flash of white light, when she wrapped her mouth around the tip of him.</p><p>His hands went to her hair, burying his finger and wrapping the blond strands around them. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI delight in the taste of my lover,\u201d she said, and then licked the length of him.</p><p>Don\u2019t throw my words back at me, he silently begged. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he groaned, tugging on her hair. He wanted her to continue. He wanted to feel her mouth on him again, but not like this, not like she owed him.</p><p>She sucked him deep, and his eyes rolled. His hips moved, his hands pushing and pulling her head as he found a rhythm. Wet, hot pleasure washed over him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think. He could barely speak\u2014much less breathe.</p><p>The head of his cock hit the back of her throat and he went over the edge, groaning her name and hating himself as clarity returned. Shame washed over him as she stood, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand, not at what she had done, but for the reason behind it. A reason he didn\u2019t know, but he did know it couldn\u2019t be because she loved him and wanted to give him pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to perform for me,\u201d he said, adjusting his pants.</p><p>Her brown eye turned hard and cold, after days of warmth residing there, and he wanted to shout and curse at his own weak flesh. \u201cWhat do you expect?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cFor you to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least share why you decided to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive you a blow job?\u201d</p><p>His jaw turned hard. \u201cWhy do you have to do this? Why do you take something that was amazing and special and make it sordid and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sordid.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cYet another s-word I need to learn, like sinning.\u201d She cupped her breasts. \u201cWas it a sin when you sucked on these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d</p><p>Her hands left her breasts, to tiptoe down her flat stomach, and slide between her legs. \u201cWas it sinful to touch me here, to lick me, and shove your dick inside of me?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist. \u201cStop it, before you say something that you\u2019ll regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already regret what I said to you,\u201d she shouted. \u201cI regret marrying you, and the faster you regret marrying me the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Her lower lip trembled, and the hardness in her eyes glistened, like slick ice. \u201cIt just is.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to argue with her some more. He wanted to explain all the reason why it was the best decision either of them had ever made when it came to their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t regret it. No matter how hard and far you push me away, I\u2019ll keep coming back. No matter how silent you become, I\u2019ll keep talking.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve let you lead this relationship for too long, and I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes.\u201d Then he picked her up in his arms and carried her back inside, striding to the bedroom and placing her in the middle of the bed. He didn\u2019t stop touching her, didn\u2019t stop kissing her, until he was hard again, and she was begging for him to make love to her, begging him to let her come.</p><p>Finally, he thrust deep inside of her, groaning her name.</p><p>\u201cPlease, please,\u201d she cried out, writhing beneath him, but he kept the roll of his hips steady. \u201cFaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He dipped his head, licking her nipple, and then giving the other some attention until they were hard, greedy little points. \u201cSay it after me\u2014divorce isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p>She stopped moving long enough to give him an evil glare. \u201cDivorce isn\u2019t an option... it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d</p><p>Cursing under his breath, he pulled out of her and flipped her on her stomach, getting into position behind her. When she didn\u2019t line up properly for him, he improvised and shoved a pillow under her hips, before giving her enticing little bottom a smack. She squealed and tried to get up, but he held her in place with one hand and smacked her there again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her legs widened, giving him an extremely nice view of her wet folds, all pink and waiting for him to fill her up again. Grabbing his cock, he eased it inside of her, pausing to give her time to adjust. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say it.\u201d There was a little hitch in her voice.</p><p>Exhaling, he closed his eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAngel,\u201d she said tentatively.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to answer her. All he wanted was for her to agree, and for them to make love like nothing was wrong between them. But he did anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here.\u201d The snug feel of her made his eyes water. He couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cOrder me to tell you to move.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flew open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Their damnable pride. That\u2019s what had brought them to this point, and yet, here she was, asking for his help. \u201cTell me what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want...\u201d He slid the smallest of distances and she moaned. \u201cThat. I want that.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her hips, pulling out and thrusting inside of again. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>In and out, he thrust inside of her, every slide, every roll of his hips, encourage by her reverent yeses and pleas for more. His heart pounded, and their skin grew slick. Bead of sweat rolled down his back, but there was no way he\u2019d come before her.</p> <p>Slipping a hand under her body, he cupped her and made her sit back on him, sliding his fingers to where they were joined. She tightened around him, her breasts bouncing as she moved.</p><p>Her head fell back. She turned slightly to kiss him. He fastened his mouth to hers and drove deep. She cried out and he joined her, growling like some animal.</p><p>But none of that mattered, because she was weeping in his arms and he was pulling out of her, turning her to face him, and kissing her tears away.</p><p>There were no need for words, no need for questions. Only comfort, only love, and he had it all to give her, even if she still believed she didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Gabriel pulled a shirt over his head. \u201cI have to go into town tonight. There\u2019s an emergency with one of my clients.\u201d</p><p>Summer sat up in bed, arms wrapped around her legs. \u201cDoes that happen a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but this kid in particular is extremely stubborn.\u201d He sat down in a chair and began to lace up a pair of sneakers. \u201cShe keeps running away from her uncle\u2019s home, and the law keeps finding and bringing her back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t belong there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said with a grunt.</p><p>\u201cWhat if her uncle is hurting him?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel pinned her with a look. \u201cNot all men are like Patrick Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he is dead.\u201d</p><p>Summer blinked at him. \u201cHow... are you kidding? Please tell me you\u2019re not kidding.\u201d She felt light in the head. This was something that had come between them for years. His belief that she had started sleeping with Patrick to get back at him, and when he learned the truth, she\u2019d made him pay for years by allowing the men and women around here to talk about her, to spread rumors and lies. It was only fitting since Gabriel had believed them, without getting her side first.</p><p>By the time he had come to her for her side of the story, she\u2019d been so hurt and furious that she refused to have anything to do with him. She\u2019d refused his calls, his visits... everything until he had asked her to prom and she\u2019d told him to drop dead.</p><p>He\u2019d taken Zoe Ambrose instead, but Summer wasn\u2019t mad at her. She still wasn\u2019t mad at her. She wouldn\u2019t have been even if Zoe and Gabriel had gotten married and had beautiful children. It wasn\u2019t Zoe\u2019s fault, and none of the Ambroses had ever treated her or her sisters like second-class citizens.</p><p>Come to think of it, there had been many times, Leah Ambrose, the matriarch of the family, had come to Strawberry Grove with some extra food that was about to spoil, or so she claimed.</p><p>But that extra food always ended up being fresh, home-cooked meals. Azalea had taken it all, like Leah Ambrose owed her, but the baby, Skye, had always hugged the other woman in thanks. Summer and Rose would stand silently, watching from the porch and wishing a hole would swallow them up.</p><p>Funny how little memories like that sneaked up on a person when they were feeling most vulnerable. But right now, she didn\u2019t want memories of Patrick Johnson. She wanted all the gory details of his death.</p><p>Gabriel crossed the room and sat down beside her. \u201cHe was caught raping a twelve year old. Her dad blew his head off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, refusing to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say vengeance only belongs to the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have castrated him,\u201d Gabriel said softly. \u201cI blame myself for not doing it years ago.\u201d</p><p>Tears clogged her throat. \u201cBut you would have gone to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I did go to jail for assaulting Patrick.\u201d Her gaze flew to his as he continued. \u201cI stayed locked up for six weeks, and then had a years\u2019 worth of probation.\u201d He picked up one of her hands, lacing his fingers through it. His wedding ring caught her eye, a sign of his commitment to her, though he\u2019d been committed to her since they were children. \u201cWhy else do you think those kids listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew,\u201d she said. He\u2019d done all that after he\u2019d found out what Patrick had done, and hadn\u2019t bothered to tell her? \u201cIf I had, I would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone to jail for stealing his car and taking his money?\u201d Gabriel gave her a sad smile. \u201cJustice doesn\u2019t always work the way we want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal it,\u201d she gulped. \u201cHis dad gave it to me, so I\u2019d be quiet. He said if I didn\u2019t take it and be quiet, then he\u2019d...he\u2019d bring Skye to his son. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, girl,\u201d Patrick, Senior had shouted at her, shoving her from behind.</p><p>She limped to the mustang, the pain between her thighs excruciating. One eye was swollen and her lip was busted, but she was alive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d she managed to snap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell no one either. You tell, then so do I.\u201d He took her by the arm, and began dragging her to the car. \u201cAin\u2019t no one going to believe the daughter of a whore, who raised nothing but baby whores.\u201d</p><p>Now that, Summer believed. \u201cWhy are you helping me, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy couldn\u2019t help himself. You tempted him, but when he tied you up and you started screaming for help... Well, that\u2019s different. You at least get to have say.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at his logic.</p><p>He opened the car door and shoved her inside. Pain shot through her, making black dots dance in front of her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be keeping my ear out. If I hear so much as a peep, I\u2019ll get that sister of yours, the redheaded one, and let Patrick play with her.\u201d</p><p>Helpless fury rose. Summer might not be able to save any other girls from what she went through, but she could at least keep her sisters safe. \u201cYou touch her or Rose, and I\u2019ll burn your house to the ground with Patrick in it.\u201d</p><p>He paled a little, and then shut the door. \u201cJust remember what I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you remember what I promised.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and she drove away.</p><p>She didn\u2019t come back for almost a year, but she had to check on her sisters to make sure they were safe. However, when she came back, Azalea was gone and everyone looked to her to be the new town whore\u2014after all, every small town had one. Only the newest one of Holland Springs had never had consensual sex with any of the men there. She never touched a single one of them. Ever.</p><p>Gabriel wrapped his arms around her, taking her out of her head\u2014thank God. \u201cIf I could have saved you, I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not some fragile doll,\u201d she lied, leaning into him and letting his warmth fill her. \u201cI won\u2019t break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever thought you to be a doll, but you are fragile, just not in ways you think you should be.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cAnd we all have our breaking points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you promise to be honest?\u201d He gave her a come-on-this-is-me look. \u201cHow many men do you think I\u2019ve been with?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate when he answered, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I let you think I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember our conversation about mathematical impossibilities?\u201d he asked, one dark brow raised.</p><p>She blushed, actually blushed, over the memory. \u201cI seem to recall the one about chemistry and biology getting us all hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and then his expression turned serious. \u201cOne day, if you still feel the need to tell me how many or how few men you\u2019ve been with, I\u2019m all ears. But for now, I want you to keep it to yourself, because you need to know in my eyes you have always been worthy of everything good in this life.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel watched her face as his words sank in. Maybe, just maybe, she would let his words process this time.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably go,\u201d was all she said, and he tried not to let his disappointment show.</p><p>\u201cI should be home before ten, but I\u2019ll call you before I get back.\u201d He let go of her, grabbing his cell phone from the nightstand and pocketing it. \u201cI\u2019ll text you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and he felt his heart pinch a little. Time, he told himself. They couldn\u2019t erase years of history in only a month. But a selfish part of him wanted her to at least go ahead and try.</p><p>\u201cSummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Her brown-eyed, desolate stare nearly ripped him in two. \u201cI know you do, angel.\u201d</p><p>As he left the house, he prayed for guidance and strength. He prayed that Summer would see herself the way he saw her, and he prayed for her to receive the forgiveness she didn\u2019t think she deserved. They needed help in the coming days, months, and years.</p><p>This he knew, because there was no way either of them could do it on their own.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>By the end of July, Rose, Ivy, and Alexander still hadn\u2019t returned from their travels, and Summer was getting restless. Each day she was growing closer to Gabriel, to his family, and to abandoning her plan of getting custody of Ivy back from her sister.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. It was bad enough that she went to church and ate dinner at Gabriel\u2019s parents\u2019 house every Sunday. It was bad enough that she\u2019d gone on couples dates with Jemma Leigh and her husband, Jeremy. It was bad enough that the bells on Carolina Dreams\u2019 door never seemed to quit ringing, and people never stopped smiling. At her.</p><p>What was worse though, what was almost unpardonable, was the way she allowed herself to become vulnerable and surrender to Gabriel, like last night.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me and watch the sunset. It\u2019s almost as pretty as you to look at,\u201d he said when she joined him on the patio.</p><p>Next thing she knew, he had her in his arms, kissing her hard, and sliding his fingers deep inside of her. \u201cSo wet, sweetheart. So wet for me,\u201d he whispered while she\u2019d trembled in his embrace. \u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Please,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>She trusted him to keep his word, because he always did, right down to the littlest of things, like picking up toothpaste for her. Something she could have done it herself, but it was like she was testing him.</p><p>Pick me up at five, she would tell him, and he would show up at 4:59.</p><p>He brought her flowers every Tuesday. On Thursdays, he would take her to lunch and share the latest software his company had in development, which had led to her point blank asking him how much money he had, if only to make him think she was interested in that and nothing else.</p><p>\u201cNot that it\u2019s my business, or that I need it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you never ask me to contribute to paying the bills, and I\u2019m living with you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out his phone, ran his fingers over it, and then handed it to her. She almost dropped the phone. \u201cMy money is your money. No secrets. The house is paid for, so our bills are minimal.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d merely nodded and handed it back. \u201cYou want to see mine? I don\u2019t have that many numbers in front of the decimal point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you want,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you need help investing it, let me know. I have a buddy down in Charlotte that\u2019s brilliant with numbers. But pretty soon, we need to sit down and go over finances for our future plans.\u201d</p><p>The thought of the future scared Summer to death, mostly because her future had been more about them, and less about her and Ivy. He never brought up her plan to get her daughter back, and she wasn\u2019t sure if he hoped she would forget about it, or would abandon her plan.</p><p>Tonight, however, she would put him to the test, instead of making love after dinner, like they usually did. She still couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d talked her into becoming his dessert after one meal. Since then, she\u2019d made it a point to be his dessert and to make him hers. She was very inventive when she wanted to be, which was all the time with Gabriel.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t blame him though. He was making up for twenty-nine years of abstinence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last dish,\u201d Gabriel said, placing it on the drying rack. \u201cReady for dessert?\u201d He wriggled his brows suggestively.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could talk finances tonight.\u201d His face fell, and she almost said forget it, but she had to do this. She had to remind him of why they\u2019d gotten married in the first place. It was only fair. It was the right thing to do, even if it hurt like hell to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to do that right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be a good time to talk about the future.\u201d She swallowed the lump in her throat. \u201cAbout our future plans.\u201d</p><p>His face lit up and the sight of it made that lump return, bigger than before. \u201cWe can go in my office, and you can borrow my laptop.\u201d He took her by the hand. \u201cMaybe we can include that in our future purchases, if you want one\u2014but I do have a confession to make.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, heart pounding as they entered his office. She sat down at the table by the windows, and he sat across from her.</p><p>Booting up his laptop, he turned the screen to face her and said, \u201cI might have bought you another wedding present. It\u2019ll be delivered tomorrow. So don\u2019t peek at that expense.\u201d</p><p>Another present? What could be better than the art kit he\u2019d given her? She grabbed the material of her skirt and twisted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see your expenses.\u201d</p><p>His brows drew together. \u201cThen what do you want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to help me pay the legal fees for the lawyer.\u201d</p> <p>His face grew so dark that she almost ran out of the room. \u201cWe\u2019re not getting a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for that. It\u2019s for Ivy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d His knuckles turned white around the fist he made.</p><p>She named the amount left to pay her lawyer. \u201cYou can write a check out to Pellum &amp; Foster if you think that would work better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the first of next month. I\u2019ve paid through this one.\u201d</p> <p>He shut the laptop and rose to his feet, moving to his desk. He opened a drawer, and took out a checkbook, filled out a check, and then tore it off. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, placing it on the top of his desk. \u201cI was thinking about going out tonight. Noah and Carlos invited me to Poor Boy\u2019s, but I told them no, unless you think differently?\u201d</p><p>Why did he have to be like this? Any other man would have stormed out, but her husband... he wanted her to know where he was going and who he would be with, and her opinion on the entire invitation. All that served to remind her that he didn\u2019t deserve her for a wife.</p><p>\u201cYou should go,\u201d she whispered. Go, so I don\u2019t have to see the disappointment in your eyes. She could never stomach his disappointment, one of the reasons why she always left Holland Springs after staying a while. Gabriel would get to her, with only a look.</p><p>\u201cWill you be here when I get home?\u201d he asked, and she wanted to cry, because he knew her that well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until it\u2019s decided about Ivy.\u201d He sounded so defeated that her heart began to ache for him.</p><p>She nodded, biting her lower lip. There was nothing she could say, and what she wanted to say would do nothing to help.</p><p>Gabriel nursed his beer while waiting for his turn at the dartboard.</p> <p>Noah sat down beside him, after scoring three bulls-eyes in a row. \u201cIt feels like we haven\u2019t talked in forever.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gave him a side-eyed glance. \u201cWe talk every day at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but only about work stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to talk about, Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Noah grinned over the rim of his glass.</p><p>Carlos stepped up to the table and tossed the dart on it. \u201cYour turn, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel Edwards, huh?\u201d Noah made a noise. \u201cStripper or ninja name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither.\u201d Though Summer tended to call him by the nickname when he was nude, or inside her. He swallowed.</p><p>Carlos looked at Noah. Together they said, \u201cStripper name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys really need to stay off Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how else will I find out what people I haven\u2019t talked to in ten years are up to nowadays?\u201d Noah quipped.</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t talked to them in ten years, why would you start now?\u201d Gabriel asked, scooping up the darts.</p><p>\u201cBecause they accepted my friend request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSound logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the guy who posted over a hundred pictures of his wedding.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s mouth flattened. Who cares how many pictures he had posted of his and Summer\u2019s wedding? She certainly didn\u2019t. Her not-so-little reminder tonight was loud and clear. She might give him her body, might even laugh with him, and confide some of the things that had bothered her for years, but never would she be his completely.</p><p>Yet, he\u2019d given her his word, knowing exactly why she wanted his help, all the while thinking he could change her mind. God, he\u2019d been such an arrogant fool, thinking he could change her anything.</p><p>\u201cSore subject?\u201d Carlos asked.</p><p>There was no way he\u2019d talk to them about Summer\u2019s plans. Carlos was half a beer away from saying, I told you so as it was.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t have a clue about Summer at all, his view of the opposite sex was generally positive, no matter their reputation. Besides, there were only two people in his and Summer\u2019s relationship, and neither of them were Noah or Carlos.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strategizing on how best to win,\u201d Gabriel said instead, and it wasn\u2019t a lie. He really did want to kick Carlos and Noah\u2019s butts. Usually they won. He was horrible at darts in college, and he was just as horrible now, but he didn\u2019t hang out with them to improve his game\u2014obviously.</p><p>\u201cIf you strategize any longer, they\u2019ll kick us out and start cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>Noah snorted. \u201cIf the bar starts closing at nine at night, then I need to move to another town.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel looked around him, not for the first time noticing how young the bar crowd was\u2014legal yes, but at least seven years younger.</p><p>\u201cHave you guys noticed the crowd lately?\u201d Noah suddenly asked, and both he and Carlos leveled their buddy with a look. \u201cI feel old.\u201d</p><p>A waitress walked by, wearing low-slung jeans and a halter-top that left nothing to the imagination, but Gabriel pretended he hadn\u2019t seen anything.</p><p>\u201cTry thirty, and then talk to me about feeling old,\u201d Carlos said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI will in February,\u201d Noah said, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cMaybe we should find another place to hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr start playing this in my garage,\u201d Gabriel offered. \u201cBeer\u2019s better and cheaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll toast to that,\u201d Carlos said, holding up his glass. \u201cShelia would be much happier with that arrangement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has begun,\u201d Noah said in a deep, booming voice. \u201cOne wedding ring to rule us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Noah.\u201d Carlos threw a pretzel at him. \u201cShelia is very secure in our relationship, but bars like this... It seems kind of juvenile to hang out here and do the same thing we\u2019ve been doing since we were in college.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel threw his dart and hit the number three. \u201cAre we calling it a night, gentleman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith that score, you better hope we want to call it a night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just sad, Gabriel. We\u2019ve been playing for ten years, and you\u2019re still just as bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassic.\u201d Noah emptied his bottle and set it down, leaving some cash for the tip. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about we continue our game another night?\u201d Gabriel asked.</p><p>\u201cFine with me,\u201d Carlos said.</p><p>Noah shrugged. \u201cI can catch up on Honey Boo Boo re-runs \u201d</p><p>Gabriel struggled not to make a face and failed. \u201cSounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel paid for his drinks, left a tip, and headed outside. The night was humid, so much so that it felt like he was drinking air instead of breathing it in. As he drove home, he thought of Summer, and whether or not she\u2019d be there.</p><p>Despite not arguing, his heart felt heavy. He wasn\u2019t sure how to proceed once he did get home. Assuming, once again, that Summer was actually there.</p><p>The outside lights were on when he pulled into the drive. He parked beside the truck he\u2019d given her four years ago. She\u2019d been so desperate, so frightened, and for once had looked to him to help her, really help her.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the need to be her hero and had taken the opportunity to play the part. So, he couldn\u2019t blame her for resenting and needing him at the same time.</p><p>But now. Now she was his wife.</p><p>He exhaled, parking his truck and heading inside.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still here,\u201d Summer said by way of greeting.</p><p>Gabriel hung up his truck keys and continued to the bedroom, but not before dropping a kiss on her cheek along the way. \u201cWasn\u2019t worried.\u201d</p><p>Relief flowed through her. He wasn\u2019t back to argue or fight with her. \u201cDid you have fun with your friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, even though I suck at darts.\u201d He paused at the entrance of their bedroom and gave her a self-depreciating grin. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll win next time. I\u2019m getting in the shower, to wash off the stench of Poor Boy\u2019s, if you\u2019d like to join me.\u201d</p><p>Images of him in the shower, water running down his hard body, made her squirm. She crossed her arms. \u201cI already had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said, and she watched as he disappeared.</p><p>She picked up the remote and clicked on the television, channel surfing until he appeared in the doorway again, with only a towel wrapped around his lean hips.</p><p>Her mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed now.\u201d</p><p>There was no way she would join him in there either. She had to start distancing herself. The honeymoon was over. After everything was sorted out with Ivy, their marriage would be over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired,\u201d she said, tearing her gaze away from him.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oh God. Please don\u2019t ask me to come to bed with you. She stared harder at the television.</p><p>Gabriel appeared before her. Unfortunately, he had on a pair of pajama bottoms. Though the view of his muscular chest was nice\u2014and bad. Very bad to her determination. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo play with my telescope.\u201d</p><p>Mulling over his words, Summer clicked off the television. Surely, taking part in an activity that didn\u2019t involving kissing or touching would be okay. After all, she didn\u2019t want to leave him with completely horrible memories of her.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he pulled her up from the couch and led her up the stairs to a room in a corner of the house. Since she hadn\u2019t allowed herself to explore his house, because she felt like she didn\u2019t deserve to even live here, she was seeing it for the first time. It was empty.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s your telescope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight through those doors.\u201d</p><p>Opening the French doors, Gabriel waited for her to step outside first. The night sky greeted her, saturated with stars, so many stars that the sight took her breath away.</p><p>She reached out to touch one, and then drew her hand back at her foolishness.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d he said, running his fingers though her hair. \u201cDid you know that you can buy a star for someone, and have it named for them?\u201d</p><p>No touching, she wanted to shout, but she was weak and needy for his touch. And greedy. She wanted to savor all his touches and kisses, before she had to leave him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook through here and you can see a pretty crown,\u201d he said, tapping on the end. \u201cI would have named it for you, but someone beat me to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Unsure of what to think of his statement, Summer leaned down, closing one eye and peering through the lens with the other. \u201cI can\u2019t tell which one is which.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven stars forming a u-shape. It\u2019s called Corona Borealis.\u201d</p><p>She looked up from the telescope and made a face to keep from smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s named for a beer?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, she bent to the telescope once more and found the seven stars that formed the u-shape.</p><p>\u201cLegend has it that Theseus gave the crown to Ariadne for helping him defeat the Minotaur. She wore it at their wedding.\u201d She heard him move closer to her, running his hands down her back. \u201cThey worked together, you see, to defeat something that no one else had before. Alone, neither of them would have survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they lived happily ever after?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they probably didn\u2019t.\u201d She stood and turned around.</p><p>\u201cI still like to think so,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>He made a noise. \u201cNo, you\u2019re trying to make sure yours doesn\u2019t ever change.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair. \u201cI really am going to bed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d was all he said as he walked inside.</p><p>She wanted to go after him, but she made herself remain still and calm. Once she was sure enough time had passed, she headed inside, shutting the doors behind her and hurrying to their bedroom.</p><p>The lights were off, but moonlight outlined his form in a soft, blue-white glow. She got into bed with him, curling up in a little ball, careful not to touch him. She didn\u2019t deserve to touch him.</p><p>But he had other ideas. Gabriel rolled over, snaked one arm around her middle, and hauled her against him. He sighed. \u201cMuch better.\u201d</p><p>Against her better judgment, she allowed herself to stay there and be lulled into sleep by the warmth of his body. He relaxed against her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes flew open, and she made herself scoot away, but his arm shot out again and pulled her back.</p><p>With a little sigh, she gave in again, with the knowledge that come tomorrow, she\u2019d be stronger.</p><p>Summer wasn\u2019t stronger the next day, especially after a bright, green convertible VW Bug was delivered to his house. He\u2019d even had it wrapped in a bright pink bow.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t the present itself that had made her weak; it was the meaning behind it. Still, she steeled herself, thanked him sweetly, and swore to be stronger the next day. Unfortunately, she failed miserably, and continued to do so, day after day.</p><p>She was weak, completely and utterly weak.</p><p>Why just yesterday afternoon, Gabriel had stopped by, locked the door to Carolina Dreams, and carried her upstairs, where they spent the rest of the day in bed. He\u2019d been more than a little enthusiastic when she climbed on top of him and rode him backwards. His hands had cupped her breasts and his hot breath had scalded the skin behind her ear.</p><p>Jemma Leigh snapped her fingers at Summer, and she blinked, face heating.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you say?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNewlyweds.\u201d Smiling a little, Jemma Leigh patted her hand. \u201cHave you two even finished opening all the wedding presents? I\u2019ll be happy to help you with all the thank you cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Summer hadn\u2019t opened a single present, because she planned to return every single one of them. \u201cSpeaking of presents.\u201d Summer reached into her purse and drew out a scroll, with a bright pink bow tied around the middle. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh clapped. \u201cYou remembered my birthday!\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t remember telling you, and we\u2019re not Facebook friends.\u201d She frowned.</p><p>Summer had been wanting to buy Jemma Leigh something to thank her for all of her help, but it wasn\u2019t until a day after Gabriel had shown her Corona Borealis that it hit her what she could get Jemma Leigh.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t know it was your birthday.\u201d Summer handed the scroll to Jemma Leigh. \u201cI bought this just because.\u201d</p><p>The squee that came from Jemma Leigh\u2019s mouth made the birds that had been pecking near their feet fly away. \u201cYou named a star after me!\u201d She placed a hand over her heart, giving Summer a beatific smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing to say,\u201d Summer began nervously, \u201cbecause don\u2019t best friends do stuff like this all the time?\u201d</p><p>Fat tears rolled down Jemma Leigh\u2019s face. \u201cYes, they do.\u201d</p><p>Summer shifted in her seat. \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d Jemma Leigh carefully rolled the scroll back up and secured the bow. \u201cNow I have a favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp Jeremy plan my surprise party? Maybe even go shopping with him?\u201d Jemma Leigh bit her lip. \u201cHe\u2019s very sweet, but he\u2019s not a party planner.\u201d</p> <p>Summer\u2019s heart fell to her toes. \u201cYou trust me to spend time with your husband?\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh rolled her eyes and threw back her shoulders. \u201cNo offense to the Hollands, but I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re not his type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, in that case\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the sacred bond of our friendship prevents you from even thinking about him that way, or acting on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you wouldn\u2019t, because you\u2019re not like that anyway,\u201d Jemma Leigh hastily added.</p><p>Summer blew out a breath and grabbed her coffee mug. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text him your number,\u201d Jemma Leigh said. \u201cSo, what are yours and Gabriel\u2019s plans this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s volunteering at The Center, so I\u2019m doing a movie marathon of all the Back to the Future movies until he gets home. He\u2019s cooking salmon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to see your sister?\u201d</p><p>Summer almost dropped her coffee.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first time Summer had ever sneaked around a house, but it was the first time since she\u2019d been married that she had lied to Gabriel about what she was doing.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t be helped, she rationalized. She had to do this on her own, without him. No matter how much it hurt. No matter how bad of an idea this was.</p><p>She crept up the back porch, and then peered in a window with lacey curtains. Inside, she saw her sister, Rose, and her sister\u2019s husband, Alexander, sitting at the kitchen table. Ivy sat between the two of them in a hot pink booster seat, her hand over her mouth as Alexander tried to feed her.</p><p>\u201cBut you like sweet potatoes,\u201d he said, a frown marring the perfection of his lips. He turned to Rose. \u201cHonestly, woman, I blame you.\u201d</p><p>Rose\u2019s black brows shot up, but her voice was as calm as the still waters of the Pamlico Sound. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who fed her dessert before supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful, or you might be the one not getting any dessert tonight.\u201d</p><p>What was it with men and desserts? Summer thought with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not in the mood for dessert tonight,\u201d her sister said, and then laughed at the expression of horror on her husband\u2019s face. \u201cPoor thing, I\u2019ll feed you dessert instead.\u201d</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t help but stare at her sister in rapt amazement. Growing up, Rose had been the serious one. The responsible one. The one who never flirted or laughed. Yet, there she sat, giving a gorgeous man, who made every other woman in Holland Springs tongue-tied, heavy-lidded looks while calling his bluff.</p><p>His gaze turned so hot, Summer thought her clothes were going to catch fire.</p><p>Turning away, she flattened herself against the wall. For long minutes, she listened to Rose and Alexander talk, planning their week and Ivy\u2019s schedule. One that included dance, art lessons, and Daddy\u2019s morning out. Trips for the three of them. In every outing, Ivy was not just included or accommodated, but wanted. They wanted to take her new places and to teach her new things. Ivy wasn\u2019t a burden to them.</p><p>Not that she imagined her baby girl was being neglected or even ignored. But she guessed she\u2019d hoped to see that Ivy looked as though she was missing something in her life. She\u2019d hoped to see her daughter missing her.</p><p>Hope was a double-edge sword that skewered her heart.</p><p>A cat meowed and twined around her legs.</p><p>Dropping to her knees, she scooped up Blackbeard and rubbed her nose in his fur. She had missed him while she\u2019d been living with Gabriel, despite his former reluctance to let her pet him. \u201cHave you been keeping an eye on my baby?\u201d</p><p>Blackbeard meowed again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Alexander said through a sigh.</p><p>The sound of his chair scraping against the hardwood floor had her gently dropping the family cat to the ground.</p><p>\u201cDamned beast still hogs my side of the bed. Yet I\u2019m the one forced to endure his whims.\u201d</p><p>Summer took off, managing to get around the corner of the house before the back door opened. She began walking away, thinking she\u2019d come back tomorrow night to spy on them and make doubly sure Ivy was being taken care of by her \u201cparents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty.\u201d Ivy giggled, and Summer\u2019s heart pinched.</p><p>\u201cCareful, sweet girl, the mangy cur hasn\u2019t had a bath for weeks.\u201d</p><p>Rose gasped. \u201cMy sweet kitty is neither a dog nor filthy.\u201d</p><p>Ivy giggled again. \u201cMommy, I want the kitty.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s knees gave out, sending her to the ground. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. Blood pounded in her ears. Tears ran down her cheeks. She buried her face in her hands, and then clamped them over her ears.</p><p>Mommy. Ivy had called Rose Mommy, not her. Rocking back and forth, she bit her bottom lip so hard she tasted blood.</p><p>The wind picked up. Lightning flashed in the sky, jagged as it struck. The ground vibrated in response.</p><p>Mommy.</p><p>She was stronger than this, stronger than a word. Rising on unsteady legs, she ran from the house. A house that had been rebuilt to its former glory. A house now filled with love, more love than had been there before.</p><p>Summer knew what had to be done. Deep in her heart, where hope had blossomed but the roots had never taken hold. Her daughter was happy, healthy, and loved. She refused to take that from Ivy.</p><p>Mommy.</p><p>She ran faster, tree branches smacking her in the face and arms. Scraping and bruising her skin. Still she ran, until she came to the infernal spring that had started it all. That had cursed them all, with its supposed abilities.</p><p>Falling to her knees, she ripped at the plants and flowers, at anything her hands could grasp. It didn\u2019t matter she was ripping her nails to the quick. It didn\u2019t matter that rain poured down from the sky, soaking her to the bone.</p><p>All along, she\u2019d known that taking Ivy back was the absolute wrong thing to do, but had used it as an excuse to come back here.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t say much about her. Actually, it said a lot. It said she was selfish and unappreciative of the people who\u2019d helped her in her life. It said that she was forever unfit to be anyone\u2019s mother.</p><p>Gabriel had known it all along, yet he\u2019d tried to help her see the truth.</p><p>A scream tore from her, until it scraped her throat raw. She fell on her side, sobbing as she pressed down on her abdomen. At the part of her body that had carried Ivy. She was nothing more than a uterus. Nothing more than the woman who\u2019d labored for hours. Scared and helpless, with no one, not even her family, at her side.</p><p>The only person who\u2019d been there for her was Gabriel, but he wasn\u2019t family. He was just the boy she used to love. A man who\u2019d apologized. A man who she\u2019d begun to fall for again, and not just because he\u2019d been there for her during her pregnancy.</p><p>Naturally, he had been the only person she could think to call. He had been the one who\u2019d driven her to the hospital and had stayed by her side. He\u2019d been the one saying that he\u2019d be there for her and the baby, in whatever way she needed.</p><p>His hand was always in hers, his presence comforting, despite the pain and terror. Through it all he\u2019d stayed, even as she screamed at him to go away\u2014though her heart had pleaded with him to stay. To ignore her stupid, ugly mouth.</p><p>She had hated being so vulnerable and dependent upon him. Still she had clung to him like a vine on the thick trunk of a strong tree.</p><p>So calm he\u2019d been when the doctor told her Ivy was turned the wrong way, that she\u2019d need an emergency caesarean. Her pain-filled mind had heard him tell the nurse that he\u2019d be responsible for the bill, to just help her. To do whatever they could for her.</p><p>Summer peered at Gabriel through slitted eyes. Worry lined his handsome face around his eyes and mouth. While they waited for the doctor, he knelt by her hospital bed and prayed.</p><p>Wave after painful wave of contractions washed over her, making her body run hot, and then cold. She kicked the sheets off and fumbled for something, anything to help her.</p><p>\u201cHere, sweetheart.\u201d Gabriel pressed ice chips to her lips, and she swallowed them. A slew of nurses entered the room, maneuvering him out the way as they helped her to a wheelchair.</p><p>She hunched over when another contraction hit. \u201cGabriel,\u201d she gasped, reaching for his hand.</p><p>\u201cWant me to come with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d one of the nurses informed him, and then turned to Summer. \u201cWe have to go.\u201d</p><p>She began to struggle to get out of the chair, desperate for his comfort and strength. \u201cNot without him.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel knelt before her, his large hands covering hers as he stared into her eyes. \u201cEverything will be fine. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t his face she saw when she came to, teeth chattering and strangely empty. \u201cMy baby.\u201d The nurse had told Summer the baby would be brought to her after she had time to recover from surgery. But Summer wanted her now.</p><p>Azalea smoothed back the hair on Summer\u2019s forehead and smiled. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Too exhausted to be shocked by Azalea\u2019s sudden and unwelcome appearance, she asked, \u201cWh-where\u2019s G-Gabriel?\u201d Dear God, she was cold. So cold her teeth wouldn\u2019t stop chattering. \u201cHe s-s-said he\u2019d b-be here.\u201d She tried to rise, but Azalea put a firm hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Azalea tsked. \u201cSugar, it\u2019s like I\u2019ve always told you, the only thing you can count on a man doing is never being there when you need him.\u201d She pulled the covers up. \u201cNow, about the baby\u2019s daddy. Is he planning on coming up here and taking care of y\u2019all?\u201d</p><p>Summer stared up into violet colored eyes, hating the woman who\u2019d abandoned her and her little sisters. \u201cHe\u2019s d-dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t expect me to...\u201d The frown that marred her mother\u2019s perfect face eased into a smile. \u201cWell, there are death benefits and pensions. All sorts of things a woman needs to survive. They owe you.\u201d</p><p>They owed her nothing. And she would get nothing, since she and Darius hadn\u2019t been married. He\u2019d just been a nice guy who\u2019d treated her like she was worth something. A nice guy who hadn\u2019t deserved to die in a war.</p><p>Maybe that was his punishment for being with a Holland. With her. She mentally brushed away the melancholy thoughts that threatened to overwhelm her. \u201cN-nothing\u2019s f-for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Give that baby a paternity test and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Summer said through tightly clenched teeth.</p><p>Florescent lights flickered in the room, a loud buzzing turned into an even louder pop.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all riled up.\u201d Her mother sniffed. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy, but you never listened to me. Just like you didn\u2019t listen to me when it came to that preacher\u2019s boy. He couldn\u2019t be bothered to stay. Something about not being able to handle the pressure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Summer said through gritted teeth.</p><p>A nurse came into the room, saying something to Azalea as she left. She took Summer\u2019s temperature and checked the small sutures. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see your baby in a little while.\u201d A cool hand patted her shoulder. \u201cPicked out a name yet?\u201d</p><p>Summer nodded, her arms aching to hold her. \u201cIvy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-where\u2019s G-gabriel?\u201d</p><p>The nurse\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cI was told that he needed to leave, that you only wanted family.\u201d</p><p>Azalea\u2019s doing\u2014it had to be. But why had he listened? \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour to check on you.\u201d</p> <p>The door clicked closed, making the room seem empty. The emptiness grew, until it reached every toe and finger. Until the longing to hold Ivy was overshadowed by it. All she wanted to do was sleep. To feel nothing ever again.</p><p>But her last thoughts as she drifted off were of Gabriel. Why wasn\u2019t he here with her? What had made him leave?</p><p>This time things had seemed different.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t belong here,\u201d she sobbed, breaking free from her memories. But where else did she have to go?</p><p>After a long evening at The Center, Gabriel drove down to one of the local docks, unloaded the canoe he\u2019d strapped in the truck bed into the water, jumped in, and began to row.</p><p>He rowed across the Pamlico, the oars slicing through the water with little resistance. When his arms and abs began to burn from the exertion, he braced his legs against the sides and pushed himself harder.</p> <p>He rowed until his chest ached and his brain cleared, then he rowed even more, until he came to the bridge that led to the little town of Jessamine. The only time he ever rowed this far northeast was when he had excess energy to burn off, or when he had a problem to solve.</p><p>Only Summer wasn\u2019t a problem. She was his wife.</p><p>With a great sigh, he began to row back to shore.</p><p>Once he showered and changed, he walked into the living room, only to find Summer asleep on the couch.</p><p>She was curled up in one corner of it, like a little girl, and every so often, she\u2019d hiccup and sniff. She\u2019d been crying, he realized, and everything he\u2019d rehearsed while he\u2019d been rowing flew out the window</p><p>She looked so vulnerable lying there, wearing a pale pink nightgown with butterflies on the hem. Another one of Jemma Leigh\u2019s recommendations, he\u2019d bet, smiling at little.</p><p>One of the thin straps slid down her shoulder, and he gently tucked it back in place. \u201cGabriel,\u201d she murmured, turning to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d He leaned down, picking her up as she wrapped her arms around him. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Let\u2019s get you to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need you. Now.\u201d</p><p>Her words were his undoing. She\u2019d never needed him, at least not in the way he thought she meant it.</p><p>He searched the room, zeroing in on the table. Striding to it, he sat her on the edge. \u201cThis good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She leaned forward and licked a path up his neck. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Tugging his shirt up and over his head, he fixed his gaze on her. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cTake everything off.\u201d</p><p>Not sooner than the command had finished being issued, he toed off his shoes, and rid himself of his socks and pants.</p><p>Her nightgown went flying across the room and then her very interested gaze locked on him once more. \u201cThose too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese?\u201d He tucked his thumbs into the waistband of his boxer briefs, edging them down. She licked her lips, and he applied more pressure until the material caught on the tip of his cock.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she ordered and he gave her a wicked grin before letting his boxer briefs fall around his ankles.</p><p>He barely had enough time to step out of them before she hauled him to her, locking her legs around his waist. The head of his dick brushed her silky thigh. She tackled him, grabbing his face, and kissing him with so much passion, it was like she was desperate. He kissed her back, sliding his hand under her bottom to fit her more fully to him. She moaned, her hands leaving his face to glide down his neck, his chest, over his nipples, and further still to his abs.</p><p>He sucked in his stomach and she laughed a little, but the sound was sweet.</p><p>Her warm hands encircled him, down low at the base of his cock. She stroked him, plunged her tongue into his mouth, and had him groaning with need.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wet enough,\u201d he said, falling to his knees and worshipping her with his mouth, tongue, and teeth. Only joy and passion existed when he licked her, made her cry out his name and whimper. He reveled in her taste, closing his eyes and drinking her down. Her scent was as intoxicating as her taste.</p><p>Then she was digging her nails into his shoulder as her body bowed into him. He used his shoulders to spread her thighs wider, and she began to chant his name.</p><p>Suddenly her hands were on his arms, urging him up, and somehow she managed to impale herself on him. He eased out of her, and then drove deep, making her body jolt.</p><p>Her head fell back, pale hair spilling everywhere like a waterfall. He licked the tops of her breasts, the side of her throat, and nibbled on her ear.</p><p>He rolled his hips, and she wound her legs tight around him. \u201cKeep moving,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Barely able to speak, he looked to where they were joined, watching as he disappeared inside of her.</p><p>\u201cAmazing how we fit together,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d she said and he slowed his thrusts.</p><p>\u201cI want to savor you, savor this moment.\u201d</p><p>She let her head fall on his shoulder, wrapping her body around his. The movement sent him even deeper, but he didn\u2019t succumb to the biting need to go faster. Instead, he made his strokes long and precise. He moved inside of her, firmly, consistently until he had to grit his teeth from coming. Her body flushed, a sign she was close. Hard nipples scraped his chest, and he groaned.</p><p>No more savoring. He had to move, he had to give her what she wanted. So, he picked up the pace, bracing his arms on the table, and plunged inside of her until the table began to move across the floor.</p><p>\u201cI have to... I need,\u201d she panted as she slid a hand between them. \u201cWatch me. Watch me.\u201d</p><p>He did, and the sight of her fingers sliding over her pink flesh and over his made his hips jerk. He felt his orgasm bear down on him and when her inner muscles tightened around him, he let go, coming inside of her in white-hot spurts that had him growling her name.</p><p>Only a few heartbeats behind him, she said the one thing he\u2019d been longing to hear for years. \u201cOh, Angel... my Gabriel... I love you.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed back her hair, searching her face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it back, even if I wanted to,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Lifting her from the table, he carried her to the bathroom and turned on the shower. Once steam began to billow from the top, he stepped inside and lowered her feet to the floor.</p><p>She kissed him again. Sweet little kisses that made him hug her to him. \u201cI\u2019ve decided not sue for custody of Ivy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh sweetheart, I know that wasn\u2019t an easy decision to make, but I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>She blinked up at him, her lashes wet, and her lips trembling. \u201cIt still hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for you. Whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d She hugged him tighter, the water seeping between their bodies. \u201cI really don\u2019t, not after all I\u2019ve put you through over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUtter nonsense.\u201d He threaded his fingers through her wet hair and kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Summer didn\u2019t bother going to Carolina Dreams the next day. Rose would most likely be at the store, and she did not want to face her right now. Instead, she met with Ms. Foster, informed the woman of her plans, and then walked out again.</p><p>She trudged up the street, not wanting to notice the blue sky or the bright sun. She certainly didn\u2019t want to smell the flowers.</p><p>She was in no mood for any of it.</p><p>There was no reason for her to stay in Holland Springs any longer. Her purpose for coming back was no longer a goal. She had no purpose, much less a goal.</p><p>She had no job, no place to live, and no car, because she refused to take Gabriel\u2019s thoughtful gift with her.</p><p>Her only choice was to clean out her checking account, and purchase a bus ticket to the other side of the country. This time, she would make herself stay away. She would give Gabriel the divorce he deserved, so he could be with a woman who deserved him.</p><p>She swallowed a sob, then another, until she had to sit down on the nearest bench. Breathing deeply, she tried to get her emotions under control. It wouldn\u2019t do for anyone to see her like this.</p><p>Not that anyone would care to see her like this.</p><p>Well, Jemma Leigh would care and Gabriel, maybe even Gabriel\u2019s family.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, a flash of red caught her attention. She turned, watching in disbelief as Gabriel practically danced through the park. He didn\u2019t see her. She stood, shrinking back into the shadows and behind a tree.</p><p>He looked so happy, so pleased with life, that she couldn\u2019t help but smile with him. A tear trickled down her face.</p><p>Suddenly, Elise appeared, bumping into Gabriel, and Summer\u2019s heart leapt into her throat.</p><p>Gabriel turned around, looking sheepish and apologetic. Elise burst into tears, and Gabriel\u2019s arms automatically went around her, pulling her closer. He said something to his ex-girlfriend, most likely words of comfort, because that\u2019s just who he was.</p><p>A watery smile appeared on Elise\u2019s face.</p><p>Summer couldn\u2019t take anymore. She had to leave, and not because she thought Gabriel was wrong or he would cheat, but because Elise was the woman he deserved.</p><p>The faster she left town, the better it would be for everyone.</p><p>She marched out of her hiding place, not bothering to answer when Gabriel called out her name, even as her heart screamed at her to stop.</p><p>Tears ran down her face, but she didn\u2019t bother to scrub them away. She wanted to remember this moment, this decision to be selfless for the third time, and let the one she loved have a better life. Without her.</p><p>\u201cHey you!\u201d Jemma Leigh called from their usual table at Muffin Top.</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t, Jemma Leigh,\u201d Summer said, trying in vain to keep the blonde from seeing her tears. Jemma Leigh would be nice and concerned, and make Summer feel a million times worse.</p><p>She\u2019d miss Jemma Leigh, and the knowledge hurt almost as bad as leaving Gabriel to Elise.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201d Jemma Leigh said, quickly catching up with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Summer stopped walking, and Jemma Leigh did the same.</p><p>Jemma Leigh pursed her lips, nodding. \u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat darn Bernice. I told her I didn\u2019t believe a word she was saying about you and Jeremy.\u201d Jemma Leigh tossed her head. \u201cAs if my best friend would ever mess with my husband.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s eyes grew huge. \u201cSomeone told you I was messing around with Jeremy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Bernice, but no one ever takes her seriously,\u201d Jemma Leigh said. \u201cShe wears white after Labor Day and thinks college football is boring.\u201d</p><p>Summer laid her hand on Jemma Leigh\u2019s arm. \u201cI would never, ever sleep with your husband, or anyone\u2019s husband, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>Jemma Leigh rolled her eyes and huffed. \u201cSilly woman. I know. We had an entire conversation about it. Gosh, I didn\u2019t fall off the turnip truck last night. You\u2019re my best friend, Summer Jean Holland Edwards, and nothing\u2019s more sacred a bond between women.\u201d</p><p>Summer threw her arms around the taller woman. \u201cI love you, Jemma Leigh Stratford, and you\u2019re the best friend a woman could ever have.\u201d Then she let go of her and did what she did best.</p><p>Summer ran away.</p><p>After lunch with Carlos, Gabriel strolled through the park with a smile on his face and lightness in his step. He wanted to sing and dance, and give praise. He felt like King David, when he\u2019d brought home the ark, and his joy couldn\u2019t be contained, so he\u2019d stripped down and led all his people into rejoicing.</p><p>Only he wasn\u2019t King David, he didn\u2019t have any people, and he was pretty sure he\u2019d be arrested for stripping in the middle of the park.</p><p>Still...</p><p>Summer Holland loved him. She loved him. Wait. Make that Summer Holland Edwards loved him.</p><p>Had the sun ever been any brighter? Had the sky ever been as blue? Had the flowers ever smelled so sweet?</p><p>The answer to all his questions was a big, resounding no.</p><p>Whistling, he did a little shuffle dance by a tree and almost bumped into another person.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he began, turning around and finding Elise there. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tears streaked her face. \u201cI\u2019ve made a mistake, but now it\u2019s too late, because I know\u2014I know...\u201d She burst into tears.</p><p>Immediately, he hugged Elise. She looked so lost and forlorn that he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Tell me what I can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a friend, someone to talk to,\u201d she sniffed and he got a funny feeling in his stomach. \u201cCan we go somewhere private?\u201d</p><p>That funny feeling turned right back into the off feeling he\u2019d had when they had been a couple. But he didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, not when she was obviously hurting again. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly anyone in the park,\u201d he said into her hair. He lifted his head and set her away from him, gently smiling. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down on the nearest bench and talk?\u201d</p><p>Elise looked at the bench, and then at him. \u201cSummer\u2019s cheating on you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabriel clenched his jaw. \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I have it on good authority that she\u2019s cheating with some man named Jeremy Stratford.\u201d Elise dabbed at her eyes with a lace handkerchief. She looked sincere enough, but Gabriel didn\u2019t care.</p><p>What he did care about\u2014people running their mouths about Summer.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife is sleeping with her best friend\u2019s husband?\u201d he asked tightly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m so sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have broken up with you like I did, because then you wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d She blew her nose. \u201cEveryone is talking about it.\u201d</p><p>His stomach dropped. \u201cEveryone?\u201d Oh crap. He had to warn Summer.</p><p>A familiar flash of pale hair had him reeling. Summer\u2019s brown-eyed gaze met his. She looked heartbroken while he felt like his heart was breaking. She must have heard the rumor, and now she thought he believed it, when that was the furthest thing from the truth.</p><p>Summer spun away, dashing in the opposite direction. He shouted her name and went after her.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you going to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she needs me,\u201d he tossed over his shoulder, and that\u2019s when he almost stopped in his tracks. He really did have a need to save people, to be needed, and save the day. Hadn\u2019t he automatically comforted Elise, ready to help her in whatever she needed?</p><p>Summer crossed the street, and a large moving van went by, obscuring his view of her for only a minute, but it was enough time for her to disappear.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he kept himself from roaring her name. She didn\u2019t need any more attention drawn to her, and if he acted like some jealous husband (though he wasn\u2019t), shouting at her in the middle of town, then it would only serve to make the gossips happy.</p><p>As cars passed, more than a few drivers waved at him. He waved back, heading to the parking lot where his truck and Summer\u2019s bright green VW Bug was parked, arriving in record time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>He smacked the roof of his truck and then dug into his pocket for his keys. He unlocked the door and started to get inside when another woman yelled his name.</p><p>\u201cBella,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI have to get to Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll only take a minute,\u201d Isabella pleaded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a minute, but this was his sister. \u201cYou have one minute.\u201d</p><p>Isabella nodded, her normally tan skin pale. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to wait until I\u2019m done before you get upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, Bella. I don\u2019t want to hear about Summer and Jeremy.\u201d</p><p>Isabella wrinkled her nose. \u201cThey\u2019re planning a birthday party for Jemma Leigh. It\u2019s supposed to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. His wife was actually trying to do a good deed, and this was how she was paid back. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be sure not to spill the beans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel blinked, his grip loosening on his truck. He actually felt light-headed. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel saw red. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Peter, that rat bast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the rat bastard,\u201d Isabella said, her cheeks flushing. \u201cThe father isn\u2019t from around here.\u201d</p><p>Learning that the father wasn\u2019t Peter made him feel marginally better. However, the isn\u2019t from around here descriptor didn\u2019t exactly make him all excited.</p><p>\u201cAre you disappointed in me?\u201d his sister asked in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cSoon as I become the most perfect person on the planet, then I\u2019ll be disappointed with you. Or if the baby\u2019s father is a Romanov,\u201d he joked, unsure of what else to say.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a Romanov, but he is the best friend of one.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel ran a hand through his hair, wishing he didn\u2019t have to deal with this right now. Selfish, maybe, but he needed to get to Summer before she did something dumb\u2014like skip town, without him.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you meet the best friend of a Romanov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not important, but Gabriel...\u201d Isabella\u2019s voice shook. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his little sister into his arms, kissing the top of her head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummer said I should at least give the guy a chance to have a choice in the matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife is very smart.\u201d He could only imagine how Summer felt when she learned she was pregnant, and the baby\u2019s father had been killed.</p><p>\u201cCan you promise not to tell Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel leaned back. \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to tell. It\u2019s yours, but what I can do is support you, in whatever way is best for you and the baby.\u201d</p><p>Isabella hugged him tighter. \u201cThank you. You\u2019re the best big brother a girl could ever have.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel smiled. Now all he had to be was the best husband a girl could ever have and convince his wife to stay.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Summer finished packing the last of her belongings as Gabriel walked into their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t home sooner, but Isabella needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for helping you sister. She\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled and then saw her bags. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please don\u2019t do this. \u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d She smoothed her faded red t-shirt down over her jeans shorts, and then shoved her hands into pockets that peeked out from beneath the frayed hem. Leaving the clothes Jemma Leigh had let her borrow for an indefinite amount of time was the right thing to do. \u201cI\u2019m leaving you, Gabriel, and it\u2019s for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we belong together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I could say the same.\u201d Coming back home made her entire life muddy. It made her question who she was, where she was headed, and where she\u2019d been.</p><p>He ran a hand through his hair, making it stick up in places. Making her want to smooth it back down. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re in such a hurry? Is it because you saw me comforting Elise?\u201d</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to be flippant about the whole thing. To be the old Summer who always came back home with a mountain on her shoulder. \u201cYou belong with her, not me.\u201d</p><p>Taking a step closer, his indigo eyes seemed to see right through her. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s for me to decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean, yes.\u201d She pulled her hands out of her pocket and held them up. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t expect you to understand, but there\u2019s nothing here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even me?\u201d</p><p>Pain ricocheted inside of her. She lowered her gaze to stare at his shoes. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you.\u201d Glancing back up at him, she found his gorgeous eyes full of compassion. \u201cIvy doesn\u2019t need me in her life.\u201d</p><p>His hand came up to cup her jaw, his thumb tenderly rubbing her skin. \u201cMaybe you need her in yours, and I sure as hell need you in mine.\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to lean on him, to draw in his strength when she had none of her own. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t .You need someone to love you, to be able to go to church with you, and fit in with your friends. Right now, I can\u2019t do all of those things.\u201d Brutal honesty was the only way to make him let go of her.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. His thumb kept up that slow glide. \u201cYes, you do. You\u2019re just too afraid to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d she cried, jerking her head back. \u201cLeast of all you, and what you want.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel stepped closer. \u201cBut you are. You\u2019re afraid to think that you\u2019re worth loving, you think that your past is your present and future. But I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t love you despite your past. I just love you, as you are, as you were, and as you will be. You\u2019re my heart, Summer Edwards.\u201d</p><p>Fury and self-loathing bubbled in the pit of her stomach. Why wouldn\u2019t he call her out on the selfishness that had carved its way inside of her?</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks I\u2019m cheating on you with Jeremy Stratford.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWho cares what everyone thinks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I believed the rumors, would I be begging you to stay?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here, but it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019re not that woman. You never were. She never existed.\u201d</p><p>Why did he have to say such beautiful things? \u201cI\u2019m still leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay. For me.\u201d</p><p>His words hung in the air, tantalizing and shimmering with temptation. This wasn\u2019t good. Nothing good ever came of them trying to be a couple. \u201cNo.\u201d One last desperate try. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in, his lips dangerously close to hers. She searched his face. His five o\u2019clock shadow had already made its appearance, then his cheek dimpled. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>Wetting her lips, she made the mistake of blinking. The gentle brush of his mouth on hers had her gasping for air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d He brushed her lips again, and she trembled. Her eyes were wide open, his closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the town whore, and you\u2019re the idiot who married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUtter nonsense.\u201d Another kiss, light as a butterfly perched on asters. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>Centuries must have passed while he kissed her. While he whispered \u2018stay\u2019 against her mouth. While nothing but his lips and words touched her.</p><p>She breathed him in. His kiss. His plea.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>Breathe in.</p><p>His tongue glided across her bottom lip.</p><p>Breathe out.</p><p>\u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She wrenched herself away, grabbed her bag, and ran to the silver truck, and not the VW Bug. Hands shaking, she wrenched open the door and climbed inside, but for some reason, she couldn\u2019t put the key in the ignition.</p><p>Gabriel appeared on his front porch, his face drawn tight. She stared at him, biting her lip so hard that she tasted blood.</p><p>He moved to the steps.</p><p>Her hand went to the door to pull it shut, but she couldn\u2019t do that either.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for failing you, Summer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for not being there for you, for expecting you to change when you were perfect as God made you. I failed us, and I\u2019m so damned sorry.\u201d</p><p>Tears began to fall. \u201cStop it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Summer. If you need me to tell you a thousand times a day, I will.\u201d</p><p>Bewildered, she shook her head. \u201cWhy? Why do you love me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just do.\u201d He ran a hand through his hair again. \u201cI\u2019ve loved you from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t love me,\u201d she said, \u201cnot after everything, not after...\u201d She almost choked on the words before saying them. \u201cNot after all I\u2019ve put you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrow old with me, right here in this house.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cHave lots of babies with me. Every day, I\u2019ll pick flowers for you to wear in your hair, and together, we\u2019ll watch the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she said, but her resolve was weakening. She wanted to stay. Not only was she tired of running, she wanted to be with him. Forever.</p><p>He laced their fingers together and helped her out of the truck. \u201cMake this the moment you decided to show those no-good busy bodies that you are here to stay, with me. Always and forever. You don\u2019t have to do this alone, not anymore, and not ever again.\u201d</p><p>The last of her walls came tumbling down. Taking a deep breath, she looked him straight in the eye and said, \u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret it, sweetheart,\u201d he swore.</p><p>Then he swept her up in his arms and carried her back into their home.</p><p>Gabriel squeezed Summer\u2019s hand as they stood on the front porch of Strawberry Grove. She\u2019d stayed. With him.</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t believe that particular blessing. It had been almost a week since he carried Summer back inside and made love to her, with promises for the future still fresh in their minds.</p><p>\u201cYou can do this,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, angel.\u201d</p><p>A grin kicked up the corners of his mouth.</p><p>The door swung open just as she raised her hand to knock.</p><p>A genuine smile lit her sister\u2019s face. \u201cSummer!\u201d Rose began to embrace her, but her husband appeared, holding Ivy, and Rose let her arms fall to her sides.</p><p>\u201cHang on a minute.\u201d He glared at Summer. \u201cState your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha, don\u2019t get in the middle of this,\u201d Rose warned, but she stepped back anyway.</p><p>Alexander rolled his eyes. No one but Rose called the man Sasha. \u201cNever mind. The town\u2019s do-gooder is here. All is well with the world.\u201d</p><p>Ivy wriggled out of his embrace. \u201cMommy, I want to go play with her.\u201d She pointed at Summer.</p><p>Everyone seemed to freeze and breathe at once, except for the little girl. She regarded Summer thoughtfully while Blackbeard rubbed against her legs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a lot of pictures around here,\u201d Ivy said.</p><p>Summer smiled, but her hand tightened around Gabriel\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m your...your Aunt Summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than just my auntie.\u201d Ivy held out her hand. \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Summer\u2019s gaze flew to Rose and Alexander. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>Rose bit her bottom lip and nodded, her pale blue eyes tearing. \u201cOf course you can. Ivy knows who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does?\u201d Summer slipped her hand into Ivy\u2019s, and a bittersweet expression bloomed on her face. \u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alexander cupped Rose\u2019s shoulders, his eyes kind for once. \u201cBecause it was the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re my sister, and I love you,\u201d Rose said softly.</p><p>Gabriel looked away. He had to, knuckling his eyes as he did.</p> <p>\u201cOh my giddy aunt,\u201d Alexander muttered. \u201cEdwards is spouting like a watering pot.\u201d</p><p>Summer tugged on his arm, and Gabriel looked at her. \u201cComing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Bella Edwards gave her brother a hug and then took her carry-on from him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\u201d Gabriel asked, handing her a bottle of water. \u201cWouldn\u2019t a phone call be just as good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gabe,\u201d she sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t be a worry wart.\u201d Though inside, she felt like a wart toad full of worry. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to a place where I don\u2019t know anyone. Daisy\u2019s there, and I miss her.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s gaze dropped to her stomach. \u201cWhat about\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m old enough to engage in risky behavior, then I\u2019m old enough to take the consequences like a woman,\u201d she said cheerfully. Would he go already? As much as she loved her brother, she was ready to strangle him, and she was ready to stop being so dang cheerful all the time.</p><p>\u201cYou have to move your truck, sir,\u201d a security officer said.</p><p>The roar of a plane engine made her wince. \u201cYou heard the officer. Now skedaddle. Your wife is waiting for you at home.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at the mention of his wife. Gosh, she was so happy for him and Summer. After years of suffering and misunderstandings, they\u2019d finally had it right and gotten married. Now, only two months later, he was still giddy over his wife.</p><p>One day, she wanted a man to be giddy over her. But for now, she had to tell a man about a baby.</p><p>\u201cIt is nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Gabriel mused. \u201cBy the time I get home, she\u2019ll be waiting in be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d She gave her brother a playful push. \u201cLove you. See you. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Waving once, he got in his truck and drove away. She rolled her carry-on inside the airport and headed to security.</p><p>Her stomach, not her best friend these days, roiled even more than usual.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re now boarding Flight 458 to Edinburg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she croaked. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d</p><p>With one last look at the terminal, she squared her shoulders and marched straight for the ticket counter.</p><p>A billion hours, one layover, and a taxicab later, Bella stood at the entrance of a very fashionable townhouse.</p><p>Hand shaking, she knocked on the front door. A minute later, the door swung open and a man appeared.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see Liam Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace is in his study and is expecting you. Right this way.\u201d</p><p>She guessed it was a good thing she held on to his number. A text might have been a bit impersonal, but it was the only way she could track him down.</p><p>The butler stopped at a set of massive oak doors and lightly scratched on them before opening it.</p><p>She walked inside.</p><p>Liam stood at the fireplace, one hand braced on the mantle and the other nursing a drink. His hair was the same, black as night and cut close to his head. He wore a button-down shirt with cuff links at the end, and tailored trousers that did things for his butt that should have been illegal.</p><p>\u201cHi, Liam,\u201d she said as the door shut behind her.</p><p>He turned, his black eyes roaming her body. His sexy mouth kicked up at one corner. \u201cBella, what brings you here? Your text was a bit vague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Pushing away from the fireplace, he crossed the small distance between them, tipped up her chin with one hand, and kissed her. He tasted good, so good that she wondered if he used a special mouthwash formulated to make women want to eat him up.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He pulled away, his dark eyes amused. \u201cI thought you were here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, I am.\u201d</p><p>His amused gaze gave way to confusion. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just no other way to say this, Liam, but I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Bella said in a rush. \u201cI had to tell you in person because over the phone was too impersonal, and there was no way I\u2019d tell you over email or text. So here I am. Pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your baby,\u201d she added, just in case he had doubts.</p><p>His drink hit the wooden floor with a thunk, and then he laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He only laughed harder. \u201cThis is too much. Oh God. Seriously, did Bastian put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>At least he wasn\u2019t angry or saying it wasn\u2019t his. He just didn\u2019t believe she was pregnant at all.</p><p>She grabbed his hand and placed it against her stomach, where it had just started to round and firm up a bit.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel like I\u2019m joking?\u201d she said.</p><p>His laughter died away, and his face turned serious. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re the answer to my prayers.\u201d</p><p>She was? Wait a minute. \u201cBut you don\u2019t pray.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at his hand. \u201cPerhaps I should start.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
