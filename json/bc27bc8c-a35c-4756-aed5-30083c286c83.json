Dave, her husband, was involved with someone else. Only Dave wasn\u2019t just Dave Flemming. He was Pastor Dave Flemming. The thought that her husband loved another woman was intolerable, unthinkable, unbearable. Dave\u2019s betrayal was bad enough, but disregarding his moral obligations to his congregation and his God\u2014she could hardly believe it. This shocking secret was completely inconsistent with everything she knew about her husband.</p><p>Ever since the night of their anniversary dinner, Emily had carefully guarded what she\u2019d learned. She\u2019d been in the church office, waiting for Dave, and had reached for his suit jacket, which hung on the back of his door. When she draped it over her arm, a diamond earring had fallen out of the pocket. Later she\u2019d discovered the second one in the other pocket. Emily had certainly never owned anything as extravagant as this pair of large, diamond-studded pendant earrings.</p> <p>In the beginning Emily had assumed the earrings were an anniversary present; however, she quickly realized they couldn\u2019t be. For one thing, they weren\u2019t in a jeweler\u2019s box. But even if they had been, it wasn\u2019t possible. Dave could never have afforded diamond earrings on their tight family budget.</p><p>Emily should have asked immediately...and hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d been afraid of ruining their special evening with her suspicions. But almost at once, other details had begun to add up in her mind. She could no longer ignore the fact that Dave so often worked late, especially since the private hour they\u2019d shared after dinner had gone by the wayside. It might\u2019ve been her imagination but he seemed to take extra long with his grooming, too.</p><p>Her suspicions doubled and tripled. She held them close to her heart, examining them over and over, trying to make sense of her husband\u2019s behavior. Whenever she asked where he\u2019d been, Dave\u2019s answers were vague. Another warning sign...</p><p>\u201cMommy, when\u2019s Daddy coming home?\u201d Mark, the younger of her two sons, asked as he looked up from his plate. He was eight and his dark brown eyes were identical to his father\u2019s.</p><p>Emily had the same question. \u201cSoon,\u201d she said as reassuringly as she could. Two or three times a week, Dave didn\u2019t get home until well after dinner. At first she\u2019d made excuses for him to their boys. Now she didn\u2019t know what to tell them.</p> <p>\u201cDad hardly ever eats with us,\u201d Matthew complained, sitting down next to his younger brother.</p><p>Dave\u2019s lateness had started gradually. He used to make a point of being there for the evening meal. As she stared into space, Emily couldn\u2019t help wondering if he was having dinner with some other woman...some other family. She chased away the thought with a determination that stiffened her spine.</p><p>For the sake of her children, Emily dragged out her standard excuse. \u201cYour father\u2019s been busy at the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night?\u201d</p><p>Her sons echoed Emily\u2019s own dissatisfaction. \u201cIt seems so,\u201d she returned lightly, pretending all was well as she joined them at the dinner table. They automatically clasped hands and bowed their heads while Emily recited grace. Silently she added a prayer for herself, asking for courage to face whatever the future might hold for her marriage.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait for him at least one night?\u201d Mark said as he reluctantly picked up his fork.</p> <p>\u201cYou two have homework, don\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, ignoring his question.</p><p>\u201cBut Dad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father will eat later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he get home before we go to bed?\u201d Matthew, her sensitive son, asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, swallowing hard.</p><p>She made a pretense of eating. Her appetite had disappeared the minute she\u2019d found those diamond earrings. That was the start\u2014the wake-up call she\u2019d ignored for months. Naturally, she\u2019d told herself, there could be any number of explanations for those earrings. She\u2019d intended to ask him about it the very next day...and hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Emily knew what held her back. She didn\u2019t want to hear the truth; she simply wasn\u2019t ready for it. She dreaded the consequences once she did finally confront him.</p><p>She\u2019d questioned her husband, more than once, about his late nights. But Dave brushed aside her concern and offered ambiguous excuses, mentioning people she\u2019d never met and meetings she didn\u2019t know about. He almost seemed to resent her asking, so after a while she\u2019d stopped.</p> <p>She supposed she had her answer. Since the discovery of the diamond earrings, she had a perfectly clear picture of what was happening\u2014what had already happened. Sadly, pastors were as susceptible to temptation as anyone else. Like all sinners, they, too, could be lured into affairs. They, too, could make irreparable mistakes.</p><p>If Emily had hoped this was just a misunderstanding, that she\u2019d allowed it to grow out of all proportion in her mind, those hopes had been destroyed. Earlier in the week, she\u2019d run into Bob and Peggy Beldon at the grocery store. They owned the local bed-and-breakfast, Thyme and Tide. As the three of them stood in the middle of the aisle exchanging pleasantries, Bob casually said that he missed playing golf with Dave.</p><p>As long as the weather permitted, the two of them had played weekly for the past three years. In a matter of minutes, she\u2019d ferreted out the information she\u2019d been afraid to learn. Dave had given up golfing more than a year ago. A year! Yet every week last summer, he\u2019d loaded up his golf clubs on Monday afternoons and driven off, supposedly to meet Bob. Obviously he\u2019d been meeting someone else.</p><p>Emily sighed. She couldn\u2019t continue to let her mind wander down this well-traveled path of doubt and suspicion. Half the time she acted the role of the quiet, unassuming wife; the rest of the time it was all she could do to refrain from demanding an explanation. She wanted the truth no matter how painful it might be\u2014and yet she didn\u2019t. What wife ever did?</p><p>So far she\u2019d remained silent. She was astonished by how good she\u2019d become at pretending everything was fine. None of her friends suspected. What bothered her almost as much as her suspicions was the fact that Dave didn\u2019t seem to have any idea that she\u2019d caught on. She wondered if he\u2019d broach the subject. Maybe if he knew she\u2019d figured out what was going on...Perhaps that was what she\u2019d been waiting for. She wanted him to ask her.</p><p>But Dave never asked. If she managed to put on a marvelous performance, then so did her husband. Last Sunday he\u2019d actually spoken from the pulpit about the importance of marriage, of loving one\u2019s spouse.</p><p>Emily felt like the most unloved woman in the world. She could barely stop herself from breaking into heart-wrenching sobs right there in front of the entire congregation. Naturally everyone must have assumed she\u2019d been overcome with emotion, since Dave\u2019s sermon, by implication, had honored her. She wanted to tell them that, beautiful though his words were, that was all they were. Words.</p><p>It was hard to believe this could be happening to them. Emily had always been so sure they had a solid marriage, and that Dave was her best friend. Apparently she was wrong.</p><p>The door leading to the garage opened and to her surprise he walked into the house.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Mark slid out of his chair, running toward his father as if he hadn\u2019t seen him in a year.</p><p>\u201cHey there, little man, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Dave reached down and swung their son into his arms. Mark was too big to be picked up like a child, but he craved the attention from his father.</p><p>Dave kissed Emily on the cheek, then ruffled Matthew\u2019s hair before he sat down. \u201cI\u2019m glad I made it home in time for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Mark said, his eyes glowing.</p><p>Despite everything, her own happiness sprang to life again, and Emily got up and brought a fourth place setting to the table.</p><p>When she passed him the enchilada casserole she\u2019d made, he took a heaping serving, then grinned over at her. \u201cYou fixed one of my favorites,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She met his look, letting him know with her eyes how much she loved him. Maybe, regardless of the evidence, all her unhappy suspicions were wrong.</p><p>\u201cCan you help me with my homework after dinner, Dad?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>Their younger son was the top student in his class, far ahead of the other second-graders. He didn\u2019t need any assistance. What he really wanted was time with his father.</p><p>\u201cYou promised to throw me the football, remember?\u201d Matthew said. Never mind that it was late November and already dark outside,</p><p>He, too, wanted time with Dave. The children weren\u2019t the only ones; Emily needed all the reassurance he had to offer. Hard as she tried to cast aside these doubts, they refused to die. She didn\u2019t want to lose her husband. She loved Dave no matter what and was determined to keep her marriage together\u2014or at least make every possible effort.</p><p>\u201cHold on, hold on.\u201d Dave laughingly raised both hands. \u201cGive me a minute to catch my breath, would you?\u201d</p><p>Both boys stared expectantly at their father. Emily couldn\u2019t bear to look at their eager faces. Seeing the love for him in their eyes made her feel like weeping.</p><p>\u201cLet your dad eat his dinner,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, I\u2019ll help you both, but I\u2019d like a few minutes alone with your mother first,\u201d Dave said, glancing at Emily.</p><p>A chill raced down her spine, and she was afraid to meet his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAw, Dad,\u201d Mark whined.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long,\u201d he promised. \u201cEat your green beans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Emily handed Dave the bowl of buttered beans with sliced almonds. He took a small portion. Green beans weren\u2019t his favorite vegetable, either, and this was her way of suggesting he set a good example.</p><p>Following dinner, the boys cleared the table, then went to their room for study hour. This had been Dave\u2019s idea. Whether they had homework or not, Matthew and Mark were to spend one hour every night reading, writing or reviewing their schoolwork. The television wasn\u2019t allowed to be on, nor were video games permitted.</p><p>As the boys trudged to their room, Emily made a pot of coffee, keeping her back to Dave as she worked. Asking to speak to her like that was unusual for him. If there was something on his mind, he generally discussed it with her after the boys had gone to bed.</p><p>Even before she could finish pouring their coffee, Dave asked her, \u201cAre you happy?\u201d His voice was urgent. Intense. The need to know seemed to burn inside him.</p><p>Dozens of possible questions had occurred to her, but this was one she hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cHappy?\u201d she repeated, facing him. Still not meeting his gaze, she carried two steaming mugs of coffee to the table and set them down. \u201cAm I happy?\u201d She shoved her hands in the back pockets of her faded jeans as she contemplated her response.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would take you this long to answer,\u201d Dave said. His dark eyes studied her and he seemed disappointed in her hesitation.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason I shouldn\u2019t be happy?\u201d she asked, turning the question back on him. \u201cI live in a beautiful house and I\u2019m able to stay home with the boys the way we both wanted. My husband is madly in love with me, right?\u201d she added, remembering his sermon from the Sunday before\u2014and hoping she didn\u2019t sound even slightly sarcastic. Without giving him the opportunity to answer, perhaps because she feared what he might say, she asked, \u201cWhat about you, Dave? Are you happy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I am.\u201d His reply was immediate and impassioned.</p><p>\u201cThen I am, too.\u201d Rather than join him at the table she started to load the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she did.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t been sleeping well.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d noticed. She fell asleep easily enough, but an hour or two later she\u2019d be wide awake. Then for the rest of the night she\u2019d toss and turn, sleeping fitfully if at all. The scenarios that played out in her mind wouldn\u2019t allow her to rest. Her husband might be in love with someone else. He might even be cheating on her.</p><p>Emily considered herself an emotionally strong woman, one who remained calm in a crisis. A woman others counted on for guidance and support. Yet when it came to confronting her husband with her suspicions, she was a coward.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s something bothering you, maybe I can help,\u201d he said. She recognized his tone, that caring, concerned voice he so often used with others. Only she wasn\u2019t just one of his parishioners, she was his wife!</p><p>\u201cWhat could possibly be bothering me?\u201d she asked airily. She didn\u2019t expect him to answer.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking. Are the ladies from the missionary society making too many demands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The cookbook committee had wanted her to organize the entire project and she\u2019d told them she simply didn\u2019t have the time, which was true. Apparently there\u2019d been more than a few ruffled feathers. The church family seemed to think that because Emily didn\u2019t work outside the home, she should be at their beck and call, just like Dave. Emily had no intention of becoming an unpaid employee of the church and had made that clear when they accepted the assignment in Cedar Cove. Her role was to support Dave and mother their young sons.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if you were upset, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, hoping the act of sipping coffee would hide her lie.</p><p>Mark stuck his head inside the kitchen. \u201cAre you finished talking to Mom yet?\u201d he asked his father. \u201cI need help with my math.\u201d</p><p>Dave looked at her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said emphatically.</p><p>He seemed to doubt her. She wasn\u2019t expert at lying and hated the fact that she was afraid to voice her concerns. Dave took a sip of his coffee and stood. \u201cAll right, Mark, show me what\u2019s giving you trouble.\u201d</p><p>Emily watched her husband and son walk out of the kitchen and swallowed painfully. She\u2019d been waiting for him to ask her a question like that. Are you happy? It was the perfect opportunity to address her suspicions\u2014but she\u2019d been too frightened to say anything.</p><p>The problem, she told herself, was that she wasn\u2019t prepared. For her own protection, she needed facts and details before she confronted him. He needed to realize she wasn\u2019t as naive as he obviously thought.</p><p>By nine that evening both boys were in bed and asleep. When Dave was home, getting her sons ready for the night was invariably a smooth, easy process. But anytime she was alone with them\u2014which was most nights lately\u2014they came up with a multitude of excuses to delay going to bed.</p><p>Half an hour later, she was in her sewing room, working on a quilt for Matthew. She ironed the fabric squares, pleased with her bargain. Always conscious of cost, she\u2019d bought the material, a bright cotton print, on sale at The Quilted Giraffe. As she turned off the iron she heard Dave come in. He wrapped his arms around her waist from behind. \u201cAlone at last,\u201d he whispered, kissing the side of her neck, his lips lingering there.</p><p>Emily smiled; she couldn\u2019t resist. This was how they used to be, spontaneously affectionate and teasing, until...She wasn\u2019t sure when things had begun to change. Earlier this year? \u201cOh, Dave, honestly.\u201d She gave a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cI love my wife,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She placed her hands on his, her fingers squeezing hard. \u201cDo you, Dave?\u201d She winced at the pleading quality that crept into her voice.</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart.\u201d He dropped one final kiss on her neck, then walked to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d work on Sunday\u2019s sermon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He used to write his sermons at the church office. Emily waited until he\u2019d left the sewing room before she turned from the ironing board and stood in the doorway. She watched Dave go down the hallway to his small den; without looking in her direction, he closed the door.</p><p>Until recently his door had always remained open. To the best of her knowledge he\u2019d never done this before. Slowly, she returned to her quilting, but she could no longer concentrate. She wanted to know why her husband suddenly found it necessary to shut the door.</p><p>He must have a reason. Of course\u2014he was probably making a phone call. One he didn\u2019t want her to overhear. She waited an hour to be sure he was off the phone, then made an excuse to step into his office by bringing him a fresh cup of coffee.</p><p>She knocked on the door and walked inside before he could respond. As she\u2019d expected, he sat at his desk with his Bible open and a yellow legal pad in front of him, making notes.</p><p>\u201cI brought you coffee,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow thoughtful. Thank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Setting it on the coaster, a ceramic tile Matthew had painted in first grade, Emily slipped out of the room. She closed the door quietly behind her.</p><p>Inhaling a deep breath, she went to the kitchen phone and hit the redial button. It rang three times before a woman with a soft, husky, thoroughly sexy voice answered.</p><p>\u201cIs that you again, Davey?\u201d</p><p>Davey?</p><p>\u201cOops, sorry,\u201d Emily said gruffly and replaced the receiver.</p><p>So she\u2019d had him pegged, after all. Dave had placed a phone call to another woman. In their own home! He\u2019d boldly contacted the woman who threatened to tear Emily\u2019s marriage apart. Her trembling hand still clutched the receiver. Knowing she was right didn\u2019t bring her any satisfaction\u2014not that she\u2019d thought it would.</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d A smiling Megan opened the front door and kissed Sheriff Troy Davis on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby, how\u2019re you feeling?\u201d Troy followed his daughter into the kitchen, hoping his question didn\u2019t sound too anxious. He couldn\u2019t help it, though. Megan had recently been tested for multiple sclerosis, the same disease that had claimed his wife, Sandy, several months before. Their small family was close, and the mere thought that his daughter, Troy\u2019s only child, would suffer the same debilitating disease as her mother terrified him. Megan had miscarried her first pregnancy a few months ago, and that loss, on top of her mother\u2019s death, had devastated her. And now this constant threat...</p><p>\u201cWould you stop,\u201d Megan chided as she walked over to the stove and turned down the burner. Something smelled good\u2014the aroma of a home-cooked meal tantalized him and he wondered what he\u2019d make for his own dinner. Chili out of a can, probably. If he still had any. \u201cThe tests showed nothing conclusive,\u201d she was saying, \u201cso there\u2019s no reason to worry.\u201d</p><p>Yet, Troy added to himself.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to smother her with unwanted concern and unwarranted fears, but he needed to know that she was successfully dealing with the possibility of MS, that she could cope with everything it meant. The medical world was divided as to whether or not multiple sclerosis was hereditary. So far, there was evidence supporting both beliefs.</p><p>To complicate matters, an absolute diagnosis was often difficult. In Megan\u2019s case the results had been inconclusive just as she\u2019d said. In one sense that felt like a reprieve; in another, it seemed as if they were still waiting for what appeared to be inevitable. He reminded himself not to borrow trouble. That expression echoed with a hint of foreboding, since it had been a favorite of Sandy\u2019s.</p><p>Troy was proud of Megan\u2019s newfound serenity, the way she calmly accepted the uncertainty of her situation. That was a hard-won acceptance, he knew, and he attributed a lot of it to her husband.</p><p>Thankfully, she\u2019d chosen her life partner well. Craig was a quiet, good-humored man who loved Troy\u2019s daughter and was completely devoted to her, the same way Troy had been to Sandy.</p><p>\u201cI came over to ask what I can bring for Thanksgiving dinner,\u201d Troy said. That was a convenient excuse to stop by without being too obvious about checking up on Megan\u2014although Craig and Megan no doubt saw through him quickly enough.</p><p>\u201cHey, Troy.\u201d Craig stepped into the kitchen, holding The Cedar Cove Chronicle in one hand. \u201cHard to believe Thanksgiving\u2019s this week, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLook at this\u2014more ads than news.\u201d</p><p>Megan chuckled and waved them both out of the kitchen. \u201cQuit whining, you two! Next thing I know, you\u2019ll be complaining about how commercial Christmas is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas!\u201d Craig groaned and winked at Troy.</p><p>Like her mother, Megan loved everything about Christmas. The leftovers from Thanksgiving dinner would hardly be put away before Megan would start decorating for the holidays. That involved Craig and Troy hanging strands of Christmas bulbs around the outside of the house and arranging the lighted deer in the front yard.</p><p>\u201cLet me set a place for you,\u201d Megan said, moving toward the cupboard. \u201cWe\u2019re having porcupine meatballs and a green salad.\u201d</p><p>Troy was tempted. The recipe\u2014meatballs filled with rice and then cooked in tomato soup and served over mashed potatoes\u2014was a family favorite from the time Megan had been a little girl. The salad he could take or leave.</p><p>\u201cThanks but no thanks, honey.\u201d Despite the enticing smells, Troy had no intention of intruding on his daughter and her husband. \u201cLike I said, I just came by to ask what I can contribute to Thursday\u2019s dinner.\u201d</p><p>Megan paused as though mentally reviewing the menu. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got everything under control,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe\u2019re having turkey, of course, and I\u2019m using Mom\u2019s rice-and-sausage recipe for the stuffing. Then I\u2019m making a couple of salads and that sweet potato-and-dried-apricot recipe I tried last year that everyone liked so well.\u201d</p><p>Last year.</p><p>Just twelve months earlier Sandy had been alive; she\u2019d spent Thanksgiving with them. It seemed impossible that she was really gone. They\u2019d brought her from the chronic care facility, setting her wheelchair at the table, helping her eat.</p><p>One year, and so much had changed. Troy had buried Sandy and then, a short while later, reconnected with Faith Beckwith. The thought of his high school girlfriend brought with it a rush of sadness. They\u2019d become a couple again earlier that summer, he and Faith, and everything had looked promising\u2014until Megan\u2019s miscarriage.</p><p>When his daughter had learned Troy was dating someone, she\u2019d been shocked. More than shocked. Hurt and angry. She knew nothing about Faith, not even her name, but in her emotionally volatile state, she couldn\u2019t tolerate the idea of her father seeing another woman. Troy loved his daughter and couldn\u2019t risk alienating her. The night she\u2019d lost the baby, he\u2019d been with Faith. Not wanting a call from Megan to interfere with his evening, he\u2019d turned off his cell phone, an act he\u2019d lived to regret again and again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the possibility that Megan might have MS, Troy had made the painful decision to sever his relationship with Faith. He missed her, missed their long telephone conversations, missed spending time with her. There was no alternative, though. Painful as it was to accept, Faith was out of his life.</p><p>Ironically, in a recent conversation Megan had implied that it was time he moved on with his life. Troy wished he could believe she meant it, but he was afraid to put too much credence in her words. Yes, she\u2019d attained a new maturity and had reconciled herself to\u2014maybe\u2014living with MS. But her reaction when she\u2019d found out he was seeing someone indicated all too clearly that his daughter was nowhere near ready for him to begin a new relationship. A woman in his life, a woman other than Sandy, seemed a betrayal of her mother\u2019s memory. So, even though Megan was now saying what he wanted to hear, he\u2019d reluctantly decided he couldn\u2019t act on it.</p><p>However, whether she truly approved of the idea or not, Megan wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d mentioned that he should start dating. A deputy friend of his had suggested setting him up with his mother-in-law\u2014Sally Something. Troy had absolutely no interest in a blind date. The only woman he wanted to see was Faith, and he\u2019d ruined any chance of that.</p><p>\u201cLast year,\u201d Megan repeated slowly, breaking into his thoughts. \u201cMom was here...\u201d The realization that Sandy had been with them for Thanksgiving had obviously just struck her. \u201cMom always loved the holidays, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>Troy nodded. Despite her physical limitations, Sandy had cherished family traditions and done her utmost to be part of them. He found comfort in the fact that his daughter was continuing where her mother had left off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serving mashed potatoes and gravy, too, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He used the question as a diversionary tactic to turn their thoughts from Sandy.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about pies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPumpkin and pecan. Oh, and I have a small surprise to go with dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>Megan\u2019s eyes sparkled with delight. \u201cI have one jar of the sweet pickles Mom and I made the summer before last. I was saving them for a special occasion.\u201d</p><p>Sandy hadn\u2019t been able to do any of the work, but Megan had brought her mother from the care facility to Troy\u2019s house. Together, they\u2019d spent the day canning cucumbers, Sandy giving directions and advice, the two of them laughing often. That afternoon had been one of the best of the entire year for his wife. Sandy had treasured the time with Megan and loved being back in her own home, albeit briefly.</p><p>\u201cYour mother will be with us, whether or not we have those sweet pickles,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Megan shrugged helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d</p><p>Rather than watch his daughter get emotional, he said, \u201cHow about if I bring the dinner rolls on Thursday? And a bottle of wine.\u201d</p> <p>Megan seemed to struggle with her composure for a moment, then smiled. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Troy left a few minutes later. The evening stretched before him, long and empty. Instead of going home immediately, he drove to the local Safeway store, still wearing his uniform. He needed a few groceries and since he was already there, he might as well pick up the wine and dinner rolls he\u2019d promised Megan.</p><p>Troy reached for a cart and wheeled it toward the vegetable aisle, starting in the same part of the store Sandy always had. He wasn\u2019t sure why he bothered to purchase anything fresh, because all it did was rot in his refrigerator. He was checking out the bananas when he saw her.</p><p>Faith.</p><p>He stopped abruptly and stared at her. It\u2019d been two weeks since they\u2019d spoken. That conversation had been among the most uncomfortable of his life. When she\u2019d answered the phone, she\u2019d been so excited to hear his voice. She\u2019d told him her Seattle house had sold; before he could say anything else, she\u2019d announced that she was moving to Cedar Cove. She\u2019d said this with such joy and enthusiasm, expecting him to be just as pleased. And then he\u2019d told her he wouldn\u2019t be seeing her again.</p><p>Even now he could clearly recall her pain. It haunted his sleep. He remembered how calmly Faith had listened as he haltingly explained about Megan. She hadn\u2019t raised her voice or argued. In the end, she\u2019d wished him well.</p><p>At that moment, Faith glanced up and saw him standing not more than two feet away. Her reaction was the same as his\u2014she went completely still as their eyes met over the large pile of bananas.</p><p>Troy was good at reading faces. Her initial reaction was shock, followed by a flicker of undiluted misery. Both emotions were quickly gone as she visibly took a breath and schooled her expression.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Troy,\u201d she said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d He inclined his head slightly and wondered if she heard the regret in his voice.</p><p>Looking at her cart, he was surprised to see it filled with essential items\u2014flour, sugar, coffee, milk, some fruit and vegetables. That suggested she was already living in Cedar Cove. He knew she\u2019d sold her home, but he\u2019d assumed it would be months before he\u2019d see her again\u2014months during which he could prepare for her presence in his town. He certainly wasn\u2019t mentally or emotionally ready for a face-to-face encounter so soon after their break-up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve left Seattle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you my house sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, but...\u201d He couldn\u2019t make his tongue cooperate. He was about to argue, to tell her this wasn\u2019t fair. However, when it came to being fair, he didn\u2019t have a lot of ground to stand on. He\u2019d treated her badly.</p><p>His reaction apparently made her want to explain. \u201cOne of the stipulations was that the closing would be before the end of November, preferably before Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019re living in town now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...yes.\u201d She seemed as uncomfortable as he was. \u201cI just never thought I\u2019d run into you so soon\u2014my very first day. I\u2019d hoped...\u201d She let the rest fade.</p><p>Troy knew exactly what she meant. He\u2019d hoped, too. Hoped they wouldn\u2019t see each other for a long time, because the pain of losing her, the disappointment of it, would be hard to conceal. Especially since he\u2019d brought it on himself.</p><p>They had a history; they\u2019d been high school sweethearts and then Troy had gone into the service after graduation to avoid being drafted for Vietnam. He\u2019d planned to propose to Faith once he\u2019d completed his basic training. Unbeknownst to them, Faith\u2019s mother had thwarted the relationship by withholding Troy\u2019s letters. Mrs. Carroll had decided they were too young to be so seriously involved.</p><p>Troy had gone on to meet Sandy later that summer, and Faith had left for college and met her future husband. Nearly forty years had passed before they reconnected\u2014only to be separated by circumstances once again. Except that this time it wasn\u2019t Faith\u2019s mother but Megan who\u2019d come between them.</p><p>\u201cI saw Grace Sherman,\u201d Faith murmured, breaking eye contact.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Harding now.\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. She\u2019s remarried. And I met Cliff. They\u2019ve both been a great help. I simply haven\u2019t had time to look for a place to buy, and I didn\u2019t want to make a hasty decision I\u2019d later regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if that was an oblique comment on their relationship.</p><p>Speaking quickly, she said, \u201cI was visiting my son and his family last week. Scottie read the classifieds in the paper, and he mentioned the rental house on Rosewood Lane.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cA day or so after that, I ran into Grace. I\u2019d taken my grandchildren to the movies, and Grace and Olivia were just coming out. When I told them I was moving to Cedar Cove, Grace said her rental house had recently become vacant. It turned out to be the same place.\u201d</p><p>Despite the awkwardness of the situation, Troy grinned.</p><p>Faith frowned, obviously puzzled by the fact that he was smiling.</p><p>Troy felt obliged to tell her why. \u201cGrace had bad renters, deadbeats who trashed the place, and it looked like it might take months to get them out legally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that. So...what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff and Olivia\u2019s husband, Jack Griffin, used a...rather inventive means of convincing them to move\u2014that same night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why the walls have all been freshly painted,\u201d she said. He saw her fingers tighten around the cart handle and suspected she was about to leave.</p><p>Regardless of his own discomfort, Troy didn\u2019t want her to go. He\u2019d missed her even more than he dared to admit. Seeing her unexpectedly was simultaneously agonizing and exhilarating, like warming frostbitten fingers before a fire.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shopping for Thanksgiving?\u201d he asked, gesturing at the contents of her cart, which included sweet potatoes and a bag of fresh cranberries.</p><p>She picked up a small bunch of bananas and added them to her groceries. \u201cNo. I\u2019m buying a few things to stock my cupboards and my fridge. My daughter and daughter-in-law are at the house now, unpacking. I didn\u2019t intend to be gone long.\u201d</p><p>He should let her go, he realized, nodding mutely.</p><p>\u201cNice seeing you,\u201d she said, but she was obviously just being polite.</p><p>She took a few steps, nudging her cart, then hesitated. \u201cListen, Troy, I don\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry?\u201d Was she talking about Megan? He\u2019d made a point of not bringing up the subject of his daughter and was grateful that Faith hadn\u2019t asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to make a habit of running into you. I\u2019m sure you feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis was purely coincidental.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d followed her into the store.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I\u2019ll do my shopping when you\u2019re at work, and I doubt we\u2019ll frequent the same places.\u201d She threw back her shoulders as if that was her last word on the subject.</p><p>He managed a faint smile. \u201cGood to see you again, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Troy.\u201d Her steps were purposeful as she moved past him with her cart.</p><p>Troy watched her go, trying not to stare, forcing himself not to rush after her.</p><p>With a determined effort, he continued down the produce aisle and hurried through the rest of the store, collecting what he needed. Bananas. Paper towels. Cans of soup and chili, a couple of frozen entr\u00e9es. Dinner rolls and wine for Thursday. When he\u2019d finished, he pushed his cart over to the checkout.</p><p>As luck would have it, Faith was at the counter beside his, waiting her turn. He felt guilty glancing in her direction but caught her looking at him, too.</p><p>Finally he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He stepped away from his cart and toward her. \u201cListen, Faith, let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go for coffee, all right? If now isn\u2019t convenient, then perhaps tomorrow. If you prefer to do it after Thanksgiving, that would be fine, too.\u201d He hadn\u2019t figured out what he\u2019d say to her, but he\u2019d come up with something. At least he could sit there and look at her.</p><p>He could tell immediately that Faith didn\u2019t share his enthusiasm. \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was right, of course. In retrospect it was perfectly idiotic. He was asking her to see him on the sly, and that must have seemed contemptible to her. But much as he wanted to spend time with Faith, Megan could never know. His motives were entirely selfish.</p><p>His suggestion might not have been very honorable, and yet if he wanted to see her, there was no other option.</p><p>He loved Faith. He was convinced she loved him, too. However, she wasn\u2019t going to let him into her life a third time when he\u2019d already broken her heart twice.</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t blame her.</p> <p>\u201cHave a nice holiday, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she whispered with a catch in her voice.</p><p>Troy paid for his purchases and carried the bags out to his vehicle. If it hadn\u2019t been completely clear before, it was now\u2014he\u2019d lost any chance he\u2019d ever had with Faith.</p><p>Three</p><p>Tannith Bliss didn\u2019t want to attend the Thanksgiving bonfire at the high school on Wednesday evening. She hated school. The only reason she\u2019d agreed to go was to get her mother off her back. Anything was better than staying home and pretending their lives were normal.</p> <p>Nothing would ever be normal again. Sometimes her mother acted like her dad hadn\u2019t died, like he might walk through the door any second, and that upset Tanni. A lot. She didn\u2019t understand why her mother was working so hard to make this stupid Thanksgiving dinner. It was senseless to bother with turkey and dressing and all that stuff when it would only be the three of them.</p><p>Thanksgiving was just the start of it. Soon it would be Christmas and that was another nightmare in the making. Their first Christmas without Dad.</p><p>She was late, so the school parking lot was already full. Tanni didn\u2019t know why she was even looking for a space. Wishful thinking, she supposed. The only place left was on the street and she was fortunate to find that. With her hands deep in the pockets of her full-length black coat, she hunched her shoulders against the bitter wind and trudged up the hill toward the football field.</p><p>As she neared the fence she could hear the laughter and the shouting. This was going to be even worse than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cTanni, over here!\u201d Kara Nobles called when Tanni reached the field.</p><p>She acted as if she hadn\u2019t heard. Kara was one of those bright, bouncy girls Tanni found annoying. Keeping her head lowered, she weaved through the crowd and walked to the opposite side of the field, as far away from anyone who might recognize her as she could get. No one else acknowledged her, which suited her just fine.</p> <p>A goth group stood close by. Tanni wasn\u2019t one of them. She dressed in black most of the time simply because she liked black. It matched her mood and her disposition. She was in mourning, after all. Her mother might want to pretend but Tanni didn\u2019t. Her father was dead. He wasn\u2019t going to come home the way he used to at the end of a flight, hug them all and bring her small gifts. Everyone else in their family might want to forget Dad, but not her.</p><p>Standing by herself, Tanni stared into the fire. The flames were mesmerizing as they crackled and sizzled, thrusting orange-and-yellow tongues toward the night sky.</p><p>One of the guys from the goth crowd separated from the group and walked in her direction. She didn\u2019t want to look at him for fear that would encourage conversation. Still, she gave him a brief surreptitious glance but didn\u2019t recognize him. That didn\u2019t mean much, since Tanni tried to remain as inconspicuous as possible. She didn\u2019t want or need anyone\u2019s attention. If she could\u2019ve found a way to get out of school altogether, she would gladly have taken it. All she wanted was to be left alone.</p><p>The boy didn\u2019t say anything. If he\u2019d spoken a single word, she would\u2019ve told him to go away.</p><p>Instead he just stood there, silent as a rock.</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>He ignored her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Shaw, you gotta see this,\u201d one of the other goths shouted.</p> <p>This was Shaw Wilson? Tanni had heard plenty about him. He wasn\u2019t a student at Cedar Cove High anymore. Rumor had it that he\u2019d never graduated. He hung around town and drove a blue Ford station wagon that everyone seemed to think was cool. The little Tanni knew about Shaw she liked.</p><p>The whole school had taken sides when Anson Butler was accused of starting the fire at The Lighthouse Restaurant two years ago, when Tanni was a freshman. The arson had been the main topic of conversation for months.</p><p>Shaw was Anson\u2019s best friend; he\u2019d defended him no matter what anyone said. Allison Cox had, too, since she was Anson\u2019s girlfriend.</p><p>Later, when it turned out that Anson was innocent and some crooked builder had been responsible for the fire, most of the kids said they\u2019d believed Anson from the get-go. Yeah, right. The same people who were ready to hang Anson out to dry were now claiming to be his close personal friends.</p><p>Other than Allison, the only person who\u2019d been loyal from the very beginning was Shaw. He\u2019d been the one real friend Anson had, and if no one else remembered that, Tanni did. She valued that kind of loyalty and hoped Anson appreciated everything Shaw had endured on his behalf.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Shaw?\u201d she asked, looking directly at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re Tanni, right? Tanni Bliss.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Trying not to be obvious, she stepped closer to Shaw.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you around,\u201d he said. Like her, he kept his hands buried in his coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you around\u201d was another way of saying he\u2019d noticed her. Despite everything, Tanni felt pleased. If she had to be noticed, she wanted it to be by someone like this.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you with your friends?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged rather than explain that she didn\u2019t really have friends. Okay, she had a few sort-of friends, Kara for one, but she didn\u2019t consider any of them good friends. Her old pals had drifted away after her father died in a motorcycle accident. Well, actually she\u2019d pushed them out of her life because most of them seemed to think there was a prescribed amount of time to grieve and then she was supposed to snap out of it. It hadn\u2019t even been a year. But apparently Tanni was taking longer than they deemed necessary.</p><p>One so-called friend had said she should just \u201cget over it.\u201d The thing was, Tanni didn\u2019t want to get over losing her father. She wanted to cling to every precious memory, remember every detail she could.</p><p>\u201cI saw your pencil drawing,\u201d Shaw said, breaking into her thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d His words flustered her. The graveyard sketch had been a project her art teacher had praised. Without Tanni\u2019s knowing it, Mrs. White had entered the sketch in a local competition. Then, at some art fair sponsored by the community, Tanni had been awarded top prize. She didn\u2019t really care. The attention embarrassed her. Besides, her mother was a fabric artist who sold her stuff at the local art gallery, and Tanni was afraid that some friend of hers might have been a judge and given her the prize out of pity. She didn\u2019t need pity. What she needed was her father.</p><p>Not only that, Tanni preferred to avoid being identified with her mother. They\u2019d never gotten along well, and it was worse now than ever. The last thing she wanted was any comparison between her art and that of the great Shirley Bliss.</p><p>\u201cI draw, too,\u201d Shaw said. He must have regretted saying anything, because he added, \u201cMy drawings aren\u2019t nearly as good as yours, though.\u201d</p><p>Tanni didn\u2019t comment. Drawing came easily to her; it always had. Some people were smart at algebra and others struggled with it. Drawing happened to be her particular skill\u2014and her escape.</p><p>She could sit in class, any class, and act as if she was taking copious notes when in reality she was making little sketches. Doodles\u2014geometric and circular designs\u2014and tiny portraits of the people around her. Trees and flowers and horses and dogs. She\u2019d filled notebook after notebook with these drawings. No one had ever seen them, not even her mother. Especially not her mother. If her dad was alive, she might\u2019ve shown him, but no one else. Shortly after her father died, she\u2019d destroyed a bunch of those notebooks in an act of grief and rage.</p><p>\u201cHey, Shaw, you comin\u2019 or not?\u201d</p><p>Shaw glanced over his shoulder and then at her. \u201cSee you, Tanni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d As he started to leave, Tanni realized she didn\u2019t want him to go. \u201cHow\u2019s Anson?\u201d she asked quickly.</p><p>Shaw hesitated, then turned back with a shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he\u2019s working with Army Intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impressive. What about Allison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be around this week. You know she\u2019s going to the University of Washington, don\u2019t you? In Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Tanni\u2019s brother was coming home from college, too, and their mother was making a big fuss about that. Still, Tanni would be glad to see Nick. He was supposed to arrive this evening, driving over from Washington State University in Pullman. By the time Tanni got back to the house, Nick would probably be there.</p><p>She missed her brother, although she\u2019d never expected to. They used to fight constantly, but after the accident they\u2019d established a fragile peace while they dealt with the upheaval in all their lives. Nick was the one person she talked to about her dad, the only person who felt the way she did.</p><p>Shaw took one step toward her. \u201cI was thinking, you know, if you want, I could show you some of my drawings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou doing anything after the bonfire?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like she had to check her social calendar. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could meet you at Mocha Mama\u2019s in an hour.\u201d</p><p>Tanni looked at her watch. Mocha Mama\u2019s was new in town. She hadn\u2019t been inside yet but she knew where it was. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and she smiled back. Despite the cold wind, she felt a rush of warmth that didn\u2019t come from the blazing fire.</p><p>After a few minutes, Shaw and his goth friends took off. Tanni watched the bonfire for another twenty minutes. Her mood had improved since she\u2019d talked to Shaw, so she walked over to where Kara stood with a group of friends.</p><p>Tanni wasn\u2019t sure why she hung out with Kara at all. Kara and the others were cheerleader types, although none of them was likely to make it onto any squad. They weren\u2019t really part of the popular crowd. But then, neither was Tanni.</p><p>Half an hour later, she parked in front of Mocha Mama\u2019s on Harbor Street. She entered the caf\u00e9, looking around with interest. The decor was typical coffeehouse, with lots of dark wood and old-fashioned lamps. There were only a few other customers\u2014a couple engrossed in their conversation, heads close together, and two older men. Shaw sat at one of the half-dozen tables positioned near the window, nursing a cup of coffee. He\u2019d dyed his hair black but his blond roots were showing. He used to wear it spiked, but he didn\u2019t anymore. While attending Cedar Cove High he\u2019d sometimes worn dark, garish makeup; he didn\u2019t do that anymore, either.</p><p>He raised his head as she approached the table. \u201cWant anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She did if he was buying. \u201cCoffee, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stood and walked over to the counter and brought her back a steaming mug. \u201cIt\u2019s on the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cWhy? Do you work here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If you ever want a frappachino or anything, let me know.\u201d</p><p>Shaw didn\u2019t look like the barista type. \u201cHow long have you worked here?\u201d she asked. The coffee he\u2019d brought her was black, like his, but she decided not to add sugar or cream.</p> <p>\u201cSince it opened. My aunt and uncle own the place. I manage it for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Shaw pulled a sketchbook out of his backpack, which rested on the floor next to the window. \u201cMy work\u2019s pretty amateurish compared with yours.\u201d</p><p>Tanni hated it when people said that. They demeaned their own efforts because she was supposedly so talented.</p><p>Tanni sipped her coffee as she started flipping through the pages of his sketchbook. The first bitter taste warmed her instantly. She studied each page. Shaw had talent, although the first few sketches, done in charcoal, were dark and weird. Buildings that had collapsed, blighted landscapes, a battlefield.</p> <p>Suddenly Tanni turned a page and came across a field of blooming yellow tulips against the backdrop of a blue spring sky. The piece was done in pastels, so she was careful not to smudge it. She was surprised by the abrupt change in subject matter.</p><p>\u201cI was up in the Skagit Valley,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tanni felt his scrutiny. He seemed to be waiting for her to comment.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he pressed. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your work. Do you like it or not?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to know what to say.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d she said, shoving the sketchbook across the table. \u201cThe one you did after seeing the Skagit Valley. What did you feel while you were working on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeace,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cThis?\u201d She flipped the page back to the previous one, done in charcoal, a picture of the cratered devastation after an earthquake.</p><p>Shaw raised his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to let him sidestep the question. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have drawn it if you weren\u2019t feeling something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger, all right?\u201d he said with barely controlled emotion. \u201cMy mother told me she didn\u2019t want me drawing those kinds of pictures in the house. That made me mad. I hate being censored, as if I\u2019m only allowed to have the thoughts and emotions she thinks are okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel it,\u201d she murmured, studying the picture again.</p><p>\u201cYou feel what?\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, meeting his gaze. \u201cYour anger.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the true sign of an artist. If I can feel what you did while you were creating this sketch, then it\u2019s good. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. You\u2019ve got to believe in yourself, Shaw. No one else will if you don\u2019t.\u201d It was as simple to Tanni as that. She and her father had often discussed art, even though he wasn\u2019t the artist; her mother was. He\u2019d told her that craft and technique were important but they were a means to an end, which was the expression of emotion. It could be a reaction to something outside the artist, but it had to express what the artist felt about the scene or person or situation.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel the peace?\u201d he asked eagerly, turning the page back to the yellow tulips.</p><p>She stared at the tulip picture a long time and then answered truthfully. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>It obviously wasn\u2019t the response he\u2019d expected. For a few seconds, it looked as if he was going to grab the sketchbook and shove it in his backpack. A moment later, he asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have any real feelings when you painted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were too concerned about color and shadowing to recognize your feelings about what you were seeing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I\u2019d have to get all touchy-feely to be an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt is feelings,\u201d Tanni said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is to me, at any rate.\u201d Her sketches in the past year were the outpouring of her emotions after losing her dad. Her classroom scribblings were about her thoughts and feelings. Wasn\u2019t that the point? As her dad had said, any great piece of art made you feel. It used to annoy her when he used her mother\u2019s quilts and fabric collages as an example, but okay. She knew what he meant.</p><p>Shortly after her father\u2019s funeral, her mother had escaped into her workroom and hadn\u2019t come out for days. Tanni knew her mother must have slept some and eaten, too, but she never saw her do either. When Shirley finally emerged, she\u2019d constructed a huge fabric fire-breathing dragon that Tanni had to admit was an incredible piece of art. No one needed to explain to her that the dragon was death. After her creative frenzy, her mother was better\u2014more herself, less frantic. The dragon still hung in her workroom. Few people saw it and Tanni suspected the new owner of the Harbor Street Gallery would love to have it on display if her mother would agree. She wouldn\u2019t\u2014at least, not yet.</p><p>\u201cThe emotion is what makes your art so good then,\u201d Shaw commented.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever draw people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard, you know.\u201d</p><p>She did. \u201cIs that what you want to draw?\u201d</p><p>Shaw leaned back in his chair. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>That sounded bogus to her. \u201cYou think so? You mean, you\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes. I want to draw people.\u201d He made it seem like a big confession.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t show me any of those pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Although she asked the question, she already knew. Shaw was afraid her criticism would rob him of the joy he derived from his portrait work.</p><p>\u201cShow me one,\u201d she said.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it.\u201d</p><p>He blinked as if he couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d read him so easily.</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d Tanni wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer.</p><p>Shaw stared down at the table. \u201cIt\u2019s no good. I did it fast and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I want to see it. Besides, you asked me to look at your art. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, remember?\u201d</p><p>His hand hovered protectively over his backpack.</p><p>\u201cDid you feel anything while the pencil was in your hand?\u201d</p><p>A hint of what could\u2019ve been a smile flickered in his eyes. \u201cYeah, I felt something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d She waited and when he continued to sit there in silence, she said, \u201cSo, are you going to show it to me or not?\u201d She was getting impatient. Either he showed her his real work or she was out of there.</p><p>Slowly, reluctantly, Shaw reached inside his bag and withdrew a second sketchbook. He hesitated before he slid it across the table.</p><p>Tanni opened it. When her eyes fell on the picture, her breath froze in her lungs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...I know.\u201d He spoke in a low, halting voice.</p><p>\u201cTonight, while I was at the bonfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>In a few quick lines Shaw had captured her defiance and isolation, her anger and pain. Her long straight hair was flung about her face by the wind, half-covering her mouth and her chin. Her posture revealed a combativeness, a sense of lonely struggle. In those simple, economical lines Shaw had revealed her. He\u2019d drawn the essence of her, Tanni Bliss, as she was right now.</p><p>Her throat thickened with tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong,\u201d she whispered, despite the lump in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s some of the best portrait work I\u2019ve seen.\u201d</p><p>Shaw stared at her intently. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just saying that, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, regaining her composure. \u201cNothing I ever did was this good. Besides, I\u2019d never tell you something was good if it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She could see that pleased him. \u201cMaybe we could get together again,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Tanni nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow? Oh, forget that, it\u2019s Thanksgiving and you\u2019re probably tied up with family and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d She didn\u2019t care what day it was; she wanted to be with Shaw.</p><p>\u201cYou can get away?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again.</p><p>\u201cFive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you here at five,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Shaw stretched his hand across the table and clasped hers. He held on tightly, intertwining her fingers with his own. Perhaps, Tanni thought, she\u2019d found a friend, after all.</p><p>Four</p><p>Early Thanksgiving morning, Emily Flemming tiptoed into the kitchen, moving as quietly as possible. She didn\u2019t want to disturb her sleeping husband or the boys. As was their tradition, her parents had driven over from Spokane to spend the holiday with her family. She could hear her father snoring in the back bedroom, the sound comforting as she made a pot of coffee.</p><p>Soon the house would be bustling with activity. Dave and her father would be watching the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade on television, while the boys raced around the house and Emily and her mother worked in the kitchen, preparing the twenty-two-pound turkey for the oven. Most likely these few moments of peace were all she\u2019d get. If she was going to pull off today\u2019s dinner without her mother suspecting anything was awry, then Emily would need this time.</p><p>She\u2019d always been close to her mother, and it wouldn\u2019t be easy to fool Barbara Lewis. Emily sat at the kitchen table, taking deep calming breaths, trying to control her emotions. Her unopened Bible rested in front of her. She\u2019d begun reading it every morning, seeking and finding solace in Psalms.</p><p>The coffeepot gave one last sizzling refrain. She got up and had just reached inside the cupboard for a mug when her mother strolled into the kitchen.</p><p>Barbara tied her long housecoat at the waist and covered a yawn. \u201cI thought I heard you up and about. My goodness, what time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Barbara frowned at the oven clock. \u201cIt isn\u2019t even five!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d As it was, Emily had awakened before three, tossing and turning before giving up any hope of going back to sleep.</p><p>Her mother sat down. \u201cThe coffee smells great. Is it ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d Emily poured a second mug, added cream to both, and brought them to the table, joining her mother.</p><p>After a few sips, Barbara looked directly at Emily, who tried to meet her eyes but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSomething on your mind, Em?\u201d her mother said, eyebrows raised.</p><p>Hoping to distract Barbara, she murmured, \u201cI was reviewing our menu. I was thinking we should make a double batch of stuffing this year. Everyone loves leftovers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the cranberry salad yesterday before you arrived.\u201d The salad, which was more of a dessert, was a longtime family favorite and served only at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Cranberries, gelatin and whipped topping were stirred together and placed in the freezer.</p><p>Seeing that her mother was about to speak, Emily interjected. \u201cInstead of Brussels sprouts this year, I thought I\u2019d make a broccoli casserole. I found a recipe on the Internet that looks absolutely delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBy my calculations, we should get the turkey in the oven around eight if we want to have dinner on the table by four this afternoon.\u201d Emily knew she was rambling, but she couldn\u2019t stop herself.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what\u2019s bothering you or are you going to make me guess?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Emily closed her eyes, then abandoned the pretense and buried her face in her hands. She wasn\u2019t someone who easily gave way to emotion. If she had been, the tears would\u2019ve flowed nonstop.</p><p>Her mother rested her hand on Emily\u2019s forearm. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t tell me. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered brokenly.</p> <p>\u201cI knew the minute I walked into the house that things weren\u2019t right. Is it to do with the boys?\u201d</p><p>Emily shook her head. \u201cNo, they\u2019re fine.\u201d She thanked God for that.</p><p>\u201cDave?\u201d Her mother sounded hesitant, as if she didn\u2019t really believe there could possibly be a problem. Everyone knew Dave Flemming was a good man. He was everything Emily had ever dreamed of finding in a husband\u2014loving, responsible, caring, gentle and so much more. She\u2019d fallen in love with him while they were in college, and her love had grown and matured in the years since. Not once had she even considered looking at another man. She\u2019d been so sure he loved her just as much until recent events gave her cause to wonder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s working too hard, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>Emily swallowed. She couldn\u2019t deny that, although not for the reasons her mother assumed. \u201cHe\u2019s gone a lot, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all those committee meetings, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Barbara pursed her lips. \u201cChurch duties can steal away family time if he lets them. He needs to take a stand.\u201d</p> <p>Emily straightened. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I...\u201d She could barely utter the words. \u201cI believe...I have reason to think that Dave\u2014\u201d she paused, hardly able to continue \u201c\u2014that he might be involved with another woman.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes widened in shock before she categorically denied the possibility. \u201cNot Dave, Em. He\u2019s simply not the type. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to assume that, too,\u201d Emily said flatly. \u201cDo you honestly think this is something I want to believe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...no.\u201d Her mother was suddenly speechless, and for Barbara Lewis, that was unusual indeed.</p><p>\u201cThe evidence had to practically hit me over the head before I recognized it for what it was,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Emily shrugged helplessly. \u201cI don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She\u2019d racked her mind in a futile effort to figure out who it could be. The only person she could remember him spending a lot of time with in the past year was Martha Evans. She was the elderly widow who\u2019d died in September. Dave had gone to visit her every week. Visiting the sick and bedridden was one of his pastoral duties, of course, but he\u2019d told her Martha was a friend, that they\u2019d grown especially close.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, perhaps he hadn\u2019t been with Martha all those times. Visiting Martha might\u2019ve been a convenient excuse Dave had given her and others. Maybe he\u2019d spent those afternoons\u2014not to mention all the evenings he\u2019d come home late\u2014with someone else.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth is I have no idea who it might be,\u201d Emily confessed miserably, remembering the woman\u2019s voice on the phone Monday night.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Her mother raised one hand, her expression thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m getting ahead of myself. In the first place, what makes you think Dave\u2019s involved with anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me,\u201d she whispered, keeping her voice low for fear another early riser might overhear.</p><p>\u201cOut and out lied?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Emily considered this. \u201cI suppose it was more a sin of omission.\u201d She explained about her chance meeting with the Beldons, when she\u2019d learned that Dave was no longer meeting Bob for their regular golf game. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of other evidence, too,\u201d she added sadly.</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t...we haven\u2019t...\u201d It was more than a little embarrassing to discuss her sex life with her mother. \u201cWe\u2014you know...haven\u2019t...in over a month.\u201d Prior to this point, they\u2019d enjoyed a satisfying sexual relationship. Emily missed her husband in every way. On the few nights he was home early, Dave was often asleep by the time she got into bed. The nights she went to bed first, he crept silently into the room and slid between the sheets, doing his best not to wake her. Only Emily wasn\u2019t asleep. It troubled her to realize that if he had reached for her, she didn\u2019t know how she would\u2019ve responded.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t as interested in you physically as he once was. Is that what you\u2019re trying to say?\u201d</p><p>With her cheeks warming, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you checked credit card receipts?\u201d her mother suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d First of all, it hadn\u2019t occurred to Emily, and secondly, she might have ended up with information she didn\u2019t want, information she wasn\u2019t ready to face.</p><p>\u201cEm, it seems to me that you\u2019ve blown a few minor details out of proportion,\u201d Barbara continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you keep your doubts buried. Ask him. Dave is your husband. He\u2019ll probably be shocked when he finds out you think he\u2019s got a woman on the side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll say it isn\u2019t true, of course. What good would it do to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll clear the air. And his reaction will tell you if you actually have reason to worry.\u201d</p><p>Emily had given the subject a great deal of thought. She wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, confront Dave. If she was right, he\u2019d only deny it\u2014and if she was wrong, her husband would be deeply hurt that she\u2019d accused him of such a fundamental betrayal. As far as she was concerned, it was a lose-lose proposition.</p><p>\u201cMy guess is that you\u2019ve allowed your suspicions to build up,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cA few unrelated events don\u2019t necessarily equal an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Dave. It just isn\u2019t in him to do this.\u201d</p><p>Emily so badly wanted to believe that, and yet...</p><p>\u201cDave is a terrible liar,\u201d her mother went on. \u201cIf something\u2019s going on, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll pick up on it.\u201d</p><p>Emily grinned. True enough, her mother had a nose for anything suspicious. Emily and her brother had gotten away with very little while living under their mother\u2019s watchful eye. \u201cI certainly never managed to hide anything from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarn right.\u201d Barbara smiled back. \u201cNow put this out of your mind\u2014at least for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d Emily promised.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lot for which to be grateful,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThis is your first Thanksgiving in your beautiful new home, and you have every reason to feel loved and cherished by your family. Don\u2019t allow your suspicions to ruin Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>Emily had to agree. Still...\u201cYou\u2019ll tell me if you think something\u2019s wrong with Dave?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I\u2019m positive you\u2019re imagining it. A week from now, you\u2019ll be phoning me, embarrassed you\u2019d ever suspected Dave of anything so out-of-character.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the day, Emily did as her mother had suggested and tried to put the doubts and fears completely out of her mind.</p><p>Just after two, Barbara helped her set the table. The formal dining room was one of Emily\u2019s favorite things about this new house. She\u2019d always wanted one. For the first time since she\u2019d been cooking the family\u2019s Thanksgiving dinner, they\u2019d be able to eat someplace besides the kitchen.</p><p>She\u2019d worked hard to make the dining room as festive as she could. The mahogany table, chairs and matching hutch came from a second-hand store and had been a real bargain. Emily had loved the dining set the moment she saw it. She\u2019d shown it to Dave, although even second-hand, the price was well out of their range. Later\u2014to her surprise and delight\u2014it had been delivered to the house. Dave told her he\u2019d talked to the dealer, who\u2019d agreed to sell it to them at almost half the asking price.</p><p>Looking at it now, she still felt thrilled. She\u2019d used a dark green linen tablecloth and spread an array of colorful maple leaves all around it. Then she\u2019d created a cornucopia for a centerpiece, filling it with yellow, green and orange gourds, as well as miniature pumpkins. Lighted pale green candles provided the final touch.</p><p>The table hit exactly the right festive note, she thought. It could\u2019ve appeared in one of those glossy home magazines\u2014and she should know because they were one of the few extravagances she allowed herself. The china had been a wedding gift and was only used once or twice a year, so arranging it on a real dining room table was a special treat.</p><p>As she stood back to examine her handiwork, Dave stepped up behind her and placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou did a beautiful job,\u201d he said, kissing her affectionately.</p><p>Her mother smiled at her and then, as Dave turned away, she mouthed, \u201cI told you so.\u201d</p><p>Emily rolled her eyes.</p><p>Once all the serving dishes were on the table and Dave had carved the turkey, it was nearly four. Everyone was hungry, since lunch had consisted of crackers and cheese.</p><p>\u201cI get the wishbone this year,\u201d Matthew called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do,\u201d Mark insisted. Scowling, he protested, \u201cMatthew got it last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, don\u2019t squabble.\u201d Dave looked sternly in their direction. They both instantly went quiet.</p><p>\u201cShall we say grace?\u201d Dave said.</p><p>They all joined hands around the table and bowed their heads as Dave offered up a simple, yet heartfelt prayer of gratitude. When he\u2019d finished, everyone at the table murmured, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass the stuffing,\u201d Matthew said before Emily had even opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMatthew, the dish will come to you soon enough,\u201d Emily reminded her oldest son. \u201cAnd it\u2019s please pass the stuffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stuffing\u2019s my favorite,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Mark said. \u201cI like it with lots of gravy.\u201d</p><p>Soon the platter and bowls circled the table and everyone\u2019s plate was heaped with turkey, dressing, two different potato dishes, special salads and more.</p><p>When they\u2019d had dessert\u2014the two pies, with whipped cream or ice cream\u2014the family lingered at the table and chatted amicably, teasing one another, joking and sharing stories. This was Emily\u2019s favorite part of the holiday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe boys and I will load the dishwasher,\u201d Dave announced as he stood up half an hour later.</p><p>Matthew wore a horrified look. \u201cDad!\u201d he burst out. \u201cDon\u2019t volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Even Mark seemed appalled. \u201cThere must be a hundred thousand dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest we get started.\u201d</p> <p>Both boys groaned.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and grandmother spent all day cooking this wonderful meal.

Nevertheless, I\u2019m fairly certain Dave\u2019s keeping some kind of secret from you.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Christie Levitt sat by herself at the bar in The Pink Poodle, her regular watering hole, and took a sip of her beer. She wasn\u2019t good company tonight. The Friday after Thanksgiving was the biggest shopping day of the year. The retailers called it Black Friday; she did, too, but for different reasons.</p><p>Christie had been at her job at the Cedar Cove Wal-Mart before six that morning. It was now 7:00 p.m. She\u2019d spent a long day standing at that cash register and she was tired, not to mention cranky. Larry, the bartender and owner, plus everyone around her, correctly gauged her mood and gave her a wide berth. Fine, she\u2019d rather avoid everyone, including her sister, who was probably mad at her. Christie was a no-show at the big Thanksgiving feast Teri had made yesterday.</p><p>Generally Christie was the life of any party. Tonight, however, she had other things on her mind. Although it wasn\u2019t a thing so much as a person.</p><p>James Wilbur.</p> <p>Christie wasn\u2019t sure why this man, with his refined and formal ways, intrigued her. But he did. Her heart seemed to speed up whenever she thought of him, which was far more often than she should.</p><p>The two of them had nothing in common. Nothing. James drove the limo for Christie\u2019s sister and brother-in-law. Teri had sent James to pick her up any number of times, and they\u2019d often chatted during the drive. Initially, their conversations had been stilted and, on her part, even hostile. That had begun to change. Then, one night, she\u2019d found a red rose on the seat. Only later did she discover the rose was from James and not her sister.</p><p>Men didn\u2019t give her flowers. She wasn\u2019t that kind of woman and she hardly knew how to react when a man did something nice for her. James\u2019s interest terrified her; Teri said it was because Christie didn\u2019t know how to respond to a decent, hardworking man. She was more accustomed to losers, men who stole from her and smacked her around.</p><p>Even now she had no idea what had caused this brain malfunction when it came to men. Her genetic makeup must\u2019ve gotten all messed up; it was the only reason Christie could figure. Either that, or a lifetime of bad examples\u2014although Teri had broken the pattern when she met Bobby Polgar. In any event, Christie would meet a man, generally unemployed and down on his luck, which was all too frequently a permanent condition. Substance abuse, whether drugs, alcohol or both, always seemed to be involved as well. These guys would tell her their tales of woe: The world was against them, they\u2019d been cheated by bosses and partners, cheated on by wives and girlfriends\u2014an endless series of sad complaints that, somehow, all sounded the same.</p><p>Nonetheless, her heart would ache for them and before she knew how or why, Christie would end up taking responsibility and trying to make everything better. In no time, she\u2019d be head over heels in love.</p><p>Talk about stupid, and yet she did it again and again. She wished she could meet someone like Bobby, someone who\u2019d love and respect her the way Bobby loved and respected Teri.</p><p>Now Bobby\u2019s driver was interested in Christie. In contrast to all the previous men in her life, James Wilbur was the perfect gentleman. In fact, his politeness was downright excessive. And calling her Miss Christie, as if she was\u2014oh, she didn\u2019t know what. Special? Hardly. It was just one of his affectations, she told herself grumpily. He irritated her so much that she\u2019d insisted she didn\u2019t want him driving her anymore. She had her own means of transportation, such as it was, but despite the bald tires and faulty transmission, she did not require a chauffeur.</p><p>Teri might be used to such exalted treatment, but Christie didn\u2019t like it. Besides, James showing up at her apartment complex in that fancy car caused too much speculation among her neighbors. It embarrassed her.</p><p>James made her feel self-conscious, opening the door for her, helping her in and out of the limousine. She didn\u2019t need assistance to get into a car or out of one, either. That was so ridiculous it was laughable.</p><p>And yet, she had to admit his intentions were good. There was a kindness about him.... Christie closed her eyes. She couldn\u2019t bear to think of him in pain. He\u2019d been hurt recently, beaten by a couple of thugs who\u2019d attempted to kidnap her sister, only they got her friend Rachel Pendergast instead. And they got James.</p><p>It all had to do with a chess tournament and a rival player who\u2019d wanted Bobby to throw the match. He hadn\u2019t; he\u2019d won through some complicated maneuver and in the end the other player had been arrested.</p><p>Christie hadn\u2019t expected to like Bobby Polgar. And she hadn\u2019t gotten along with her sister for years. They\u2019d simply avoided each other. It was just better that way.</p><p>Then all of a sudden they were back to being friends...being sisters. Christie wasn\u2019t sure who\u2019d done the maturing\u2014probably both of them. And she suspected Bobby\u2019s influence had made Teri more confident, more tolerant and forgiving. Bobby had been a good friend to James, too\u2014not that she knew much about their history.</p><p>She reached for her beer and sipped it, wishing she could stop thinking about James. He lingered in her mind and she couldn\u2019t make him disappear, which flustered her. She\u2019d demanded he leave her alone, and he had, which flustered her even more. No one had ever done what she\u2019d asked before.</p><p>When she learned he was hurt, she\u2019d hurried to him, but James no longer wanted anything to do with her. He\u2019d made it plain that he didn\u2019t want her company. Christie got the message. She left him a rose, the way he\u2019d left her one, and slipped out of his living quarters, feeling lower than dirt.</p><p>\u201cYou need another beer?\u201d Larry asked, filling a couple of glasses from the tap.</p><p>Christie shook her head. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She quickly changed her mind. \u201cOn second thought, maybe I will.\u201d</p><p>Larry nodded approvingly, then leaned against the bar and whispered, \u201cYou feeling down about something?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Larry set a glass of cold beer on the counter. \u201cIf you want to talk about it, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>Christie shook her head again. Her feelings for James confused her; she wouldn\u2019t know what to tell Larry or anyone else. The person she needed to talk to was her sister. Maybe Teri would help her understand what was happening.</p><p>\u201cHey, look!\u201d Kyle, a plumber and a regular at The Pink Poodle, called out. \u201cThat limousine\u2019s parked here again.\u201d</p><p>Christie instantly felt heat invade her face. James was parked outside, waiting for her.</p><p>A couple of men walked over to stare out the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a limousine doing here?\u201d Bill asked. He worked at the shipyard and was another regular. Both men were divorced and preferred spending time at the Poodle to sitting alone in front of the TV. Christie understood that desire for a social outlet; it was one of the reasons she was a regular herself.</p><p>\u201cI saw that car before,\u201d Kyle commented.</p><p>\u201cWho in here would ever need a fancy vehicle like that?\u201d Bill asked, turning to look at Larry.</p><p>\u201cWe never found out.\u201d Larry headed to the beer taps with two clean glasses. \u201cThe car just seems to show up now and then. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let him use your parking lot like that?\u201d Christie asked, fearing the other regulars might connect her with the limousine. She\u2019d never hear the end of it if they did.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d Kyle was the one who responded. \u201cIt brings a bit of class to the place, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He directed the question to the bartender.</p><p>Larry was too busy filling glasses to respond.</p><p>Christie finished her second beer. She usually drank three, but after two she\u2019d begun to feel light-headed. A third, which normally didn\u2019t faze her, might be too much. Time to call it quits. Besides, she was tired.</p><p>\u201cYou goin\u2019 home?\u201d Larry asked when she paid her bill.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need me to call you a cab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d he said.</p><p>Christie waved goodbye, pulled on her short wool jacket, then wrapped the scarf around her neck and set out to brave the elements. The wind had begun to rise, picking up the last few scattered leaves and sending them hither and yon. Christie noticed that the smell of snow hung in the air and while the schoolkids would love a snowfall, she could do without it.</p><p>Outside The Pink Poodle, she heaved a sigh of relief that James had apparently given up and left. He\u2019d come here to talk to her. When she didn\u2019t immediately appear, he\u2019d gotten the message that she wasn\u2019t interested, and that was okay with her. Moreover, she didn\u2019t want anyone seeing the two of them together.</p><p>In spite of all that, she felt disappointed. She was still worried about him and hoped his condition had improved. But ever since the kidnapping he\u2019d acted as if he didn\u2019t want her around. Fine. She, too, could take a hint.</p><p>A hundred thoughts swirled frantically, like the autumn leaves at her feet, as she struggled against the wind and around to the side of the building, where she\u2019d parked her car.</p><p>\u201cChristie.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d recognize his voice anywhere. Peering into the darkness, she saw him. The limousine stood beside her dilapidated Ford and James was waiting for her there, out of sight of those inside the tavern.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded in a none-too-friendly voice. Her lack of welcome was part shock, part feigned anger.</p><p>\u201cI came to check on you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d she protested. \u201cDid Teri and Bobby send you?\u201d That would be just like her sister.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Christie knew that Teri and Bobby wouldn\u2019t have missed her yesterday; they\u2019d invited plenty of friends to their Thanksgiving dinner party. Having to be at work so early this morning was a convenient excuse. Not that she\u2019d given anyone the opportunity to question her about it. She\u2019d stayed home all day and hadn\u2019t answered her phone, although it must have rung a dozen times.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come to dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo? I didn\u2019t realize you were keeping tabs.\u201d She kept the derision in her voice so he wouldn\u2019t think she cared about his opinion of her. An opinion he would no doubt divulge any second now.</p><p>There it was. \u201cYou were rude to let your sister down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now I\u2019m rude,\u201d she muttered. \u201cAnd you\u2019re an expert on polite behavior?\u201d Actually, he was, and he rightly ignored her question.</p><p>\u201cMiss Teri held off serving dinner while she tried to reach you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Christie felt bad about that, although she wouldn\u2019t let James know. \u201cWhat\u2019s it got to do with you?\u201d she asked flippantly.</p> <p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t usually a rude person, Christie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently I proved you wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stayed away because of me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself,\u201d she responded, although of course he was right. She\u2019d skipped Teri\u2019s Thanksgiving event for fear of another rejection from James. Instead of feasting on turkey dinner at her sister\u2019s, she\u2019d eaten a microwave pizza and watched reruns of Seinfeld for three hours straight.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here? To criticize me? If so, message received. Can I go now?\u201d she asked as though she\u2019d grown bored with the conversation. Her ears were getting cold, even if her heart was pounding unmercifully fast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to apologize,\u201d James said.</p> <p>\u201cFor what? Embarrassing me in front of my friends just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cFor the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other night?\u201d she asked, pretending that his hurtful words had no impact on her, that she\u2019d forgotten whatever he\u2019d said. In reality, it was something she\u2019d never forget.</p><p>\u201cLast month. You came to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she returned breezily. \u201cHey, don\u2019t worry about it. You didn\u2019t want me around. I understand. It\u2019s not a problem\u2014at least not for me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, shaking his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want your sympathy. Or anyone\u2019s,\u201d he added in a lower voice.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like the sympathetic sort?\u201d she asked, making a joke of it. \u201cLike I said, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She forced a laugh and with it came a loud hiccup, which mortified her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She did an exaggerated double-take. \u201cYou think I sat in The Pink Poodle and drank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d She\u2019d had two beers over the course of as many hours. She was perfectly capable of driving herself home.</p><p>\u201cChristie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to put up with any more of his disapproval. \u201cJust leave me alone. You don\u2019t want to see me and that\u2019s fine, because I don\u2019t want to see you, either. Do I need to make it any clearer than that?\u201d</p><p>He turned away, then seemed to change his mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said, wrenching open her car door, which to her intense embarrassment made a loud groaning noise. She should\u2019ve taken it to the repair shop, but hadn\u2019t\u2014because of the inconvenience and, more than that, the bill. A squeaking door was the least of her problems with this vehicle. It was on its last legs\u2014or tires.</p><p>Rather than stand in the cold arguing with James, Christie climbed inside her car and started the engine. Thankfully it didn\u2019t die right then and there, as she\u2019d half expected. That would\u2019ve made her humiliation complete.</p><p>Without looking behind her, she backed out of the parking place and pulled into the street.</p><p>One glance in her rearview mirror told her that James had pulled in directly behind her. He followed her all the way to the apartment complex and waited there until she\u2019d parked. Even then he didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>Christie was tempted to march over and demand he stop following her. Otherwise, she\u2019d threaten to call the authorities and get a restraining order. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time she\u2019d filed one against a man.</p><p>But she decided not to let on that she\u2019d noticed him. She hurried into her apartment and slammed the door, breathing hard. Several minutes passed before she regained her composure. The first thing she saw in the dark room was the light blinking on her answering machine.</p><p>Five calls, all of them from Teri. Her sister was determined to leave messages until she phoned back. Still, Christie resisted. Teri was bound to lecture her for not coming to Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>After ten minutes she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and grabbed the phone. Teri answered after two rings.</p><p>\u201cOkay, go ahead and be mad,\u201d Christie greeted her sister. \u201cYell at me and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad? Why would I be mad?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t show up yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Teri sighed. \u201cAnd we both know the reason for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to be to work at six this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBzzz.\u201d Teri imitated an annoying buzzer sound. \u201cWrong answer. You didn\u2019t show up because you were afraid to face James.\u201d</p><p>No use trying to fool her sister.</p><p>\u201cHe came looking for me tonight,\u201d Christie confessed.</p><p>\u201cI know. How\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>Christie closed her eyes, debating how much to tell her. \u201cNot good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>She settled for the plain, unvarnished truth; Teri was going to find out, anyway. \u201cHe...tried to apologize but...I wouldn\u2019t let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie,\u201d her sister said, \u201cI thought you liked James.\u201d</p><p>Like was such a mild word for the way she felt about him. \u201cI do,\u201d she whispered, wondering why she went to such lengths to prove the opposite.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you\u2014Oh, never mind, I know why. I did the same thing with Bobby. When he first showed interest in me, I did everything I could to chase him off. I thank God every day that he didn\u2019t listen. What\u2019s wrong with us, little sister, that we don\u2019t recognize love when it comes knocking at our door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames doesn\u2019t love me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop right this minute,\u201d Teri said. \u201cHe cares about you\u2014a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why did he send me away when he was hurt?\u201d she cried, unable to disguise her pain. \u201cI wanted to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was embarrassed, Christie. Surely you can understand. He didn\u2019t want you to see him in that condition. He\u2019d been beaten up! Give him a chance, will you?\u201d</p><p>Christie was afraid to. She\u2019d experienced so many disappointments\u2014and this one would be the worst. \u201cIt won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d Teri argued. \u201cLook at Bobby and me. Who\u2019d ever think the two of us would fall in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, it might\u2019ve worked out for you and Bobby, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will for me. Let me deal with this my own way, all right?\u201d</p><p>Something in her voice must have alerted her sister to the fact that Christie was serious. \u201cAll right,\u201d Teri agreed with obvious reluctance, \u201cif you\u2019re sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Christie said firmly. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll stay out of it.\u201d</p><p>Teri sighed. \u201cOkay then, if that\u2019s how you want it.\u201d</p><p>But Christie didn\u2019t. Not really.</p><p>Six</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Roy McAfee asked. His stomach growling, he glanced up from the Saturday edition of The Cedar Cove Chronicle and waited for his wife\u2019s answer. It seemed to him that Corrie had been in the kitchen longer than usual.</p><p>\u201cLeftovers.\u201d</p><p>Again? Corrie was an excellent cook but it was the same every Thanksgiving. She chose the largest fresh turkey the store had available and then they ate bird for weeks on end. Really, how much turkey could four people consume? And how many versions of turkey did one man have to eat? Not that Roy was complaining\u2014not really. He\u2019d enjoyed Thanksgiving, and having two of his three children with Corrie and him was special enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making turkey pot pie,\u201d she called from the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019ll be out of the oven in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack will be joining us for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lately Roy and his son had come to an understanding. He\u2019d had high expectations of his only son. Then, as a teenager, Mack had rebelled and they\u2019d been at odds ever since. All those years Roy was furious that Mack had refused to take his advice. Instead of finishing college and pursuing a solid career he\u2019d dabbled in all kinds of things, often doing what Roy considered menial work, not worthy of his talents. They couldn\u2019t spend an hour together without arguing. Everything had changed around the time Gloria entered their lives.</p><p>Gloria was the daughter he\u2019d fathered with Corrie back in college. When he broke off the relationship he hadn\u2019t realized she was pregnant. Not until much later did he learn that she\u2019d borne their child and given Gloria up for adoption. For Corrie, pregnant and alone, it had been the right decision at the time. Still, their marriage had been haunted by the loss of the child they\u2019d never known.</p><p>But life had, in a way, come full circle, bringing their child back to them. Gloria had searched for her birth parents, craving a relationship. And she\u2019d found them. Roy had tried to steer his son into police work but it was Gloria who\u2019d gone into law enforcement. She\u2019d recently left the Bremerton police department to work for Troy Davis at the local sheriff\u2019s office. Roy was proud to see her in uniform, serving the community he and Corrie\u2014and now Gloria herself\u2014called home.</p><p>Corrie stuck her head out of the kitchen. \u201cI forgot to tell you Linnette phoned this afternoon while you were at the office.\u201d As a private investigator, he often went in to work on weekends, especially if he had a backlog of cases.</p><p>Roy set the newspaper aside. Linnette was living in North Dakota, working as a waitress, and claimed to be loving it. Or perhaps it was more accurate to say that what she loved was the town of Buffalo Valley. He\u2019d sided with his daughter when she\u2019d announced she was leaving Cedar Cove, although personally he hadn\u2019t been in favor of it. However, as he\u2019d told Corrie, it was Linnette\u2019s life and Linnette\u2019s decision. After the failure of her relationship with Cal Washburn, she\u2019d been heartbroken and humiliated. She wanted out; Roy didn\u2019t blame her. He hurt for her.</p><p>\u201cShe told me Thanksgiving with Pete and his family was very nice,\u201d Corrie said, coming all the way into the living room now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His wife\u2019s face was flushed from the kitchen\u2019s warmth and her hair was disheveled from running floury hands through it. Corrie had put on a few pound over the years\u2014but then who hadn\u2019t? To him, she was more beautiful at fifty-six than she\u2019d ever been.</p><p>\u201cRoy McAfee, why are you looking at me like that?\u201d Corrie demanded.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking I\u2019m married to a gorgeous woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly!\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hear about Linnette?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnything new with her?\u201d He couldn\u2019t imagine there would be. They\u2019d talked a couple of days before Thanksgiving, as well as on Thanksgiving itself. Linnette had spent the day with Pete Somebody, a farmer she\u2019d met. From the sound of it, he was a decent, hardworking young man. It was a bit soon for anything serious between them, but he trusted Linnette\u2019s judgment and wanted her to be happy. He just wished she\u2019d found that happiness a little closer to home.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been working with Hassie Knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old woman who owns the pharmacy in Buffalo Valley?\u201d he asked. It was hard to keep them straight, all the people Linnette mentioned in her phone calls. Generally, she spoke to Corrie and then his wife relayed the information to him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking on what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGetting a medical clinic up and running,\u201d Corrie said excitedly.</p><p>This was news, and Roy couldn\u2019t believe she was just telling him now. He\u2019d been home for a couple of hours. \u201cHey! That\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffalo Valley is growing and they need a clinic. Hassie claims it\u2019s divine providence that brought Linnette to their town.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, pleased that Linnette would be using her education. She\u2019d worked hard to become a physician assistant and it\u2019d be a shame to see all that effort go to waste. Roy had said she\u2019d eventually go back to medicine, and he\u2019d called it right.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thrilled about this opportunity. You might give her a call later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d he agreed, although it was always Corrie who did the phoning.</p> <p>Roy had never been comfortable expressing emotion or, for that matter, being on the receiving end. Nevertheless, he loved his wife and his children, all three of them. They made him proud. Even Mack...</p><p>There was a knock at the door, but before Corrie could open it, their son stepped into the house. A blast of cold air came in with him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019re cooking smells great,\u201d he said appreciatively, rubbing his bare hands.</p><p>Corrie cradled his face and kissed him loudly on the cheek.</p><p>\u201cThat was the right thing to say,\u201d Roy told him with a grin. \u201cNot that it isn\u2019t true,\u201d he added swiftly.</p><p>Mack guffawed. \u201cGood save, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Roy lifted his hand in acknowledgment but didn\u2019t get up. He\u2019d injured his back years before and as a result had taken early retirement from his job with the Seattle police. His back still caused him pain, which he did his best to ignore. Some days he succeeded at that better than others. This was one of his less successful days.</p><p>Mack pulled out the ottoman and sat down near his father. \u201cI stopped by the Cedar Cove fire station this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Roy straightened. This was what he\u2019d been waiting to hear. He wanted to ask if Mack had been chosen for the position, but was patient enough to let him make his own announcement.</p><p>\u201cGood grief, Mack,\u201d Corrie cried. \u201cDon\u2019t keep us in suspense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe captain said there\u2019s a letter waiting for me in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Corrie\u2019s obvious disappointment echoed Roy\u2019s. He\u2019d hoped a job in Cedar Cove would bring him and Mack closer. They\u2019d come a long way in the last two years but, as Roy was the first to admit, they still had a long way to go.</p><p>\u201cWhy the sad looks?\u201d Mack asked. \u201cMy application\u2019s been accepted! Effective December fifteenth, I\u2019ll be working for the Cedar Cove Fire Department.\u201d</p><p>Corrie covered her mouth with both hands and shrieked with delight.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, son,\u201d Roy said. Leaning forward, he slapped Mack on the shoulder. Despite his more temperate response, he was no less elated than his wife.</p><p>Corrie\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cOf course you\u2019ll stay with us until you find a place to rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Corrie frowned. \u201cBut...we\u2019re your family. Where else would you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I\u2019ve found a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and it works out great. Would you believe I\u2019ll be living in Linnette\u2019s old apartment? Will Jefferson\u2019s subleting it, and I\u2019m assuming his lease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will going?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cHe\u2019s barely moved in. You mean to say he\u2019s moving out already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe purchased the Harbor Street Art Gallery.\u201d</p><p>That was old news. Big news when it happened, because it had looked as if the gallery was about to close its doors for good. No one wanted that. The entire community had breathed a collective sigh of relief when Will Jefferson decided to buy it.</p><p>\u201cYes, we know about Will taking over the gallery,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cHe\u2019s not leaving town, is he? After all this, it would be a shame if he turned over the management to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like that,\u201d Mack explained. \u201cApparently the gallery has a small apartment that\u2019s been used for storage during the past few years. Will couldn\u2019t see any reason to pay rent when he already has a place he could live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the gallery had an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIt\u2019s got a second story, though, so it doesn\u2019t really surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp until now it\u2019s been crammed full of junk. Will\u2019s been working all weekend to get it cleared out. At last count he\u2019d made three trips to the garbage dump. He\u2019s having painters come in on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place could probably use updating, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Corrie asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help him whenever I can,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>From habit Roy nearly spoiled everything by making some disparaging comment about Mack\u2019s carpentry skills. Thankfully, he stopped himself in time. His son was a capable carpenter; not only that, he\u2019d worked as a painter and part-time post-office employee. He\u2019d done a dozen other jobs since he\u2019d dropped out of school.</p><p>\u201cWill said he\u2019ll eventually buy his own place, but at this point, he\u2019s content to fix up the apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d Roy murmured. \u201cMakes sense to stay on the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the cop in you talking, Dad,\u201d Mack said with a laugh.</p><p>Corrie laughed, too. \u201cSo when are you moving into Linnette\u2019s old apartment?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I can make the arrangements. The lease is up in a few months and that\u2019ll give me time to decide what I want to do\u2014buy or continue renting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, son.\u201d</p><p>Mack met his eyes and they exchanged a smile. This was progress, real progress, for both of them.</p><p>The oven timer went off, and Corrie returned to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cLet me set the table,\u201d Mack offered, following his mother.</p><p>Roy reached for the paper but he didn\u2019t see the words in front of him. Instead he pondered the state of his children\u2019s lives. Gloria was doing well. Linnette was going to start a medical clinic in Buffalo Valley, North Dakota. And now Mack was taking on a responsible job with the Cedar Cove Fire Department.</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t think life could get much sweeter than this.</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Cliff Harding said, standing behind Grace as she prepared their morning pot of coffee. He placed his big hands on her shoulders in a comforting gesture of love and concern.</p><p>Grace pressed her hands over his and wished she felt as confident as he seemed to be. Olivia, her best friend, her life friend, had cancer. The word struck terror in her heart. This wasn\u2019t the first time a friend, someone she cared about, had been diagnosed with breast cancer. But this was Olivia, who was as close to Grace as a sister. They\u2019d been best friends from the moment they\u2019d met in first grade.</p><p>They\u2019d seen each other through every life crisis\u2014from Grace\u2019s teenage pregnancy to her first husband\u2019s suicide. From the death of Olivia\u2019s son Jordan to her divorce. They\u2019d been through so much together, nearly every loss a woman could experience. Olivia knew Grace better than anyone. And Grace knew Olivia.</p><p>But cancer...Grace wanted to scream, to howl, to weep. She felt helpless, impotent, with no idea what to say or how to support her friend. Her fears for Olivia overwhelmed her.</p><p>Cancer was so unfair. It didn\u2019t make sense. This shouldn\u2019t be happening to a woman as conscientious and positive and kindhearted as Olivia. She was the one who watched her diet religiously. She took her vitamins every morning without fail. She exercised and looked after herself emotionally and spiritually. What more could she possibly have done?</p><p>\u201cYou going to the hospital?\u201d Cliff asked, although he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cI told Jack I\u2019d sit with him while...while they do the surgery.\u201d She turned around and slid her arms around Cliff\u2019s waist and hid her face in his chest. A shiver went through her.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey, relax,\u201d Cliff whispered soothingly, stroking her hair. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to relax until we know for sure the cancer hasn\u2019t metastasized.\u201d So far, the tests were encouraging, but until the surgery was done, they wouldn\u2019t know whether the cancer was localized and her lymph nodes were clear. Grace wanted reassurance and she wouldn\u2019t rest until she heard the physician say the words.</p><p>Even when things were at their worst, Olivia had always seemed to be in control. From the time they were in grade school, Grace had admired her. Young as she was, Olivia had been so well put-together, so smart and organized. She wore crisp dresses with Mary Jane shoes and perfect pigtails. In high school she\u2019d been elected a class officer every year. She was popular, intelligent, capable and her peers recognized it and sought her out.</p><p>But that lifelong sense of control had abandoned Olivia now.</p><p>When the coffee finished brewing, it was Cliff who got two mugs and filled them both. He handed the first one to Grace. \u201cWould you like me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s immediate reaction was that she would\u2019ve liked nothing better. Then she remembered that Cliff had a meeting with a horse breeder he\u2019d been looking forward to seeing for weeks. His willingness to reschedule the appointment touched her deeply.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll be fine\u2014and so will Olivia.\u201d She forced a smile, sipped some more of her coffee and then walked back to their bedroom to change out of her nightclothes. As she sorted through her wardrobe, she wondered what one wore to an event like this. Her normal attire at the library was a cotton turtleneck pullover with a jumper. She had quite a few jumpers, some of which she\u2019d sewn herself. In the end, she opted for tan khaki slacks and a rust-colored V-neck sweater over a white polo shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace couldn\u2019t imagine why her outfit seemed so important, yet somehow it was. She wondered if this could be a way of distracting herself from Olivia\u2019s surgery. Or perhaps it was a more complex psychological phenomenon, like...like suiting up for battle. Because this was battle, even if she was going to be standing on the sidelines.</p><p>When she arrived at the hospital, she discovered that Olivia had already been checked in and given a sedative before the surgery.</p><p>As Grace entered her hospital room, Olivia raised her head and glanced at the door. Grace hesitated. Seeing her dearest friend so vulnerable nearly brought her to tears. But the last thing Olivia needed was for Grace to turn into an emotional wreck. Swallowing the giant lump that blocked her throat, she managed to grin. \u201cHello, there,\u201d she said with a heartiness she was far from feeling.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Olivia whispered. \u201cI told you it wasn\u2019t necessary to come. I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d never listen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of being anywhere else,\u201d Grace said. \u201cI need to be here\u2014if not for your sake, then my own.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes were serious and she nodded slightly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Grace reached for her friend\u2019s hand and they held on to each other the way they had countless times through the years.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d Grace asked after a moment, wondering why Olivia\u2019s husband wasn\u2019t with her.</p><p>\u201cHe went to get coffee,\u201d Olivia explained. Their eyes met and Olivia bit her lip. \u201cThe coffee\u2019s just an excuse. He\u2019s not dealing with this well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m not exactly a pillar of strength myself.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cancer?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that, too. But I was talking about something else.\u201d Grace paused to take a long breath, trying not to cry. \u201cYou\u2019re the one with cancer. Jack and I love you and so do Will and Charlotte and your kids. We\u2019re all willing to do whatever we can to help you through this. Unfortunately, we\u2019re falling apart, at least Jack and I are.\u201d She laughed, but it sounded more like a sob. \u201cThe crazy part is that you\u2019re the one who\u2019s comforting us.\u201d</p><p>Olivia dismissed her words. \u201cNonsense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook at me, Liv,\u201d Grace said, dashing tears from her face. \u201cI\u2019m a mess. I want this to go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t?\u201d Olivia teased. \u201cI never thought it would happen to me. There\u2019s no history of breast cancer in my family. I eat right, exercise, get my yearly checkup and yet here I am. This isn\u2019t fair, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancer usually isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>They continued to hold hands, still clinging to each other when Jack walked in holding a foam coffee cup. He looked as if he hadn\u2019t slept all night and was as pale as Olivia.</p><p>An orderly stepped into the room directly behind him. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for you now, Ms. Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for you, too,\u201d Olivia murmured. Her gaze moved from Jack to Grace and she gave them both a reassuring smile. \u201cI don\u2019t want either of you to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Grace lied.</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Olivia said.</p> <p>That sounded too much like resignation to Grace. This wasn\u2019t the time for acceptance; it was a time to fight.</p><p>Jack walked by Olivia\u2019s side, holding her hand, with Grace trailing behind. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Olivia whispered back.</p><p>The orderly rolled the entire bed out of the room and down the hall to the surgery center.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s going to be just fine,\u201d Grace reiterated aloud because she needed someone to say it, even if that someone was her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>By unspoken agreement they moved toward the surgical waiting area. Jack sat in one of the upholstered chairs, which were clustered into groups of four and six. He drank his coffee as he stared into the distance. Right now they were the only people there and had chosen the chairs closest to the door.</p><p>\u201cDid Olivia wonder why I took so long getting the coffee?\u201d he asked, looking in her direction for the first time.</p><p>\u201cIf so, she didn\u2019t say anything to me,\u201d Grace assured him, although it wasn\u2019t the complete truth.</p><p>A sigh rumbled through his chest. \u201cI decided to go to the hospital chapel,\u201d he said, his voice low. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of things I\u2019m not especially proud of through the years. I wasn\u2019t sure I had the right to ask God for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Grace had plenty of lapses herself, plenty of misgivings about her own right to ask.</p><p>\u201cI took my chances and asked God to be with Olivia,\u201d Jack said. He leaned forward and splayed his fingers through his hair. \u201cI want to do every single thing I can for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already are.\u201d Falling in love with Jack Griffin, marrying him, had changed Olivia\u2019s life, bringing her more happiness than she\u2019d ever expected. This man had stood by her and always would.</p><p>Grace glanced at her watch, astonished to realize it\u2019d been less than ten minutes since the orderly had come for Olivia. Time seemed to creep by; Grace felt conscious of every second. When another five minutes had slowly passed, Olivia\u2019s daughter, Justine, and her mother, Charlotte, walked into the waiting area. Charlotte, as usual, toted an enormous knitting bag.</p><p>\u201cIs Mom in surgery?\u201d Justine asked.</p><p>Grace nodded.</p><p>Charlotte sat down next to Jack and automatically pulled out her knitting. \u201cIt calms my nerves,\u201d she announced to no one in particular. Her fingers worked at an impressive speed, and Grace tried to guess what the multicolored yarn would become.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve seen her before the surgery,\u201d Justine said, pacing restlessly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, dear,\u201d Charlotte said calmly. \u201cYour mother knows how much you love her. She knows you would\u2019ve been here if you could.\u201d</p><p>Justine continued pacing. \u201cI used to think I didn\u2019t really need my mother.\u201d She sounded close to tears. \u201cI was so confident that I knew what I was doing.\u201d She gave a little shake of her head. \u201cMom never liked me dating Warren Saget. She didn\u2019t trust him. I think in some ways I went on seeing him out of spite, just so I could prove how wrong she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine,\u201d Charlotte said quietly, setting her knitting down in her lap. \u201cAll daughters go through that with their mothers. Olivia did with me, as well. It isn\u2019t until we\u2019re mothers ourselves that we understand.\u201d</p><p>Justine folded her arms. \u201cShe was right, you know\u2014about Warren, about me loving Seth and...and everything else. I need her in my life. Leif needs his grandma and so does our new baby.\u201d She flattened her palm against her stomach.</p><p>Grace had recently learned that Justine was pregnant with her second child and knew Olivia was ecstatic.</p><p>They all grew quiet for several minutes. In the distance Grace saw workers setting up Christmas trees and hanging decorations. She\u2019d forgotten that this was the first of December.</p><p>Charlotte was knitting steadily, her fingers slowing to a more relaxed pace. \u201cI told Ben this morning that we should cancel the cruise. I want to be with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Mom would be furious if you did that,\u201d Justine said. \u201cYou and Ben have been planning this vacation for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo, Charlotte,\u201d Jack told her. \u201cJustine\u2019s right. Olivia would be upset with you for staying home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. Still...\u201d</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t finish what she was about to say. Her eyes brightened and she smiled as Pastor Dave Flemming joined them in the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pastor,\u201d Charlotte murmured in relief. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you were able to make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to do it,\u201d Dave said, sitting next to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s in surgery now,\u201d Jack explained. \u201cEverything depends on whether the cancer has spread. We won\u2019t know exactly what we\u2019re dealing with until we know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever happens, I wanted to tell you I\u2019m available anytime. All you need to do is call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Justine said.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to pray with you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d It was Charlotte who answered. She set aside her knitting needles and bowed her head.</p><p>Justine sat beside Grace and closed her eyes. Seeing how shaken she was, Grace took the younger woman\u2019s hand in her own. Justine held on tightly.</p><p>Pastor Flemming\u2019s prayer was brief, but it brought Grace a sense of peace. She didn\u2019t know what the outcome would be, but for the first time she was ready to leave that with God.</p><p>When Pastor Flemming finished, the small group whispered, \u201cAmen.\u201d</p><p>The prayer affected them all. Jack looked more composed and so did Justine. Charlotte picked up her knitting needles. Grace found herself breathing normally again.</p><p>They chatted amicably with Pastor Flemming for a few minutes until he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting, so I\u2019d better leave now.\u201d He got to his feet.</p><p>Jack stood, too. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough for stopping by.\u201d</p><p>The pastor nodded and patted Jack\u2019s shoulder affectionately. \u201cWe can\u2019t always know what the future holds, but we know Who holds the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we do,\u201d Charlotte concurred, her fingers busy.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Pastor Flemming said, \u201cif there\u2019s anything you need, day or night, call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d Grace told him, grasping his hand as they exchanged goodbyes. \u201cPlease pray for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he promised. \u201cOlivia is in my prayers, as she is in yours.\u201d</p><p>He left soon afterward and the small gathering continued their visit, newly energized or so it seemed to Grace. As they talked, Jack reached sheepishly inside his pocket for a hand-held gadget.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Justine asked, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cVideo poker,\u201d Jack mumbled. \u201cBob Beldon bought it for me. He said it\u2019d help distract me while Olivia\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>Justine planted her hands on her hips and glared at him. \u201cYou mean to say my mother\u2019s fighting for her life in there and you\u2019re going to sit here playing video games?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d Jack hesitated, then nodded decisively. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Justine paused. \u201cDo you think they have those in the hospital gift shop?\u201d she asked, breaking the tension.</p><p>Grace burst into laugher, and so did Justine and Jack. Charlotte looked up, but didn\u2019t seem to understand the joke. They were still chiding one another when the surgeon entered the waiting room.</p><p>Simultaneously they all stood, their laughter instantly cut short. Every eye was on Dr. McBride.</p><p>The silence seemed to pulse through the room.</p><p>\u201cWe were fortunate to have detected the tumor when we did,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it hasn\u2019t metastasized?\u201d Grace asked in a hushed voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t look like it.

The attorney had asked to see him before Thanksgiving, but with his busy schedule and the holidays pressing in on him, this was the first opportunity Dave had found.</p> <p>Harris\u2019s office was off Harbor Street. Dave parked as close as he could, which happened to be two blocks away. At some point over the weekend, Christmas decorations had begun to appear. Evergreen boughs stretched across Harbor from one lamppost to another, strung with twinkling white lights. Every year the holiday season seemed to sneak up on him. He didn\u2019t have time to consider what this added expense would do to the family\u2019s already tight budget. Frankly, he preferred not to think about it.</p><p>The wind off the cove was cold and Dave hunched his shoulders against it as he walked up the steep hill to the office. When he stepped inside, Geoff Duncan, Allan\u2019s legal assistant, glanced up.</p><p>\u201cHello, Geoff,\u201d Dave said, holding out his hand. He knew the young man casually. They\u2019d talked once or twice after Martha Evans\u2019s death. Allan Harris had been in charge of Martha\u2019s legal affairs; he was a man the older woman had trusted.</p><p>\u201cPastor.\u201d Geoff got up, his own hand outstretched. A moment later, Dave turned to a row of pegs and hung up his coat.</p><p>Geoff was a likeable young man with a firm handshake. He dressed professionally in a suit and tie, and his demeanor was low-key, unthreatening. A good attribute for someone in a small-town legal practice, Dave thought.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Harris phoned a few minutes ago and is tied up in a meeting,\u201d Geoff said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be more than fifteen minutes. Would it be possible for you to wait?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, no problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Geoff rubbed his palms together. \u201cCan I get you anything? Coffee, tea, water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m fine. Thanks, anyway.\u201d Dave strode over to the small waiting area and sat down. No one else was in the office. He rested his ankle on the opposite knee and reached for a three-month-old issue of Sports Illustrated.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Geoff said, following him. \u201cI was hoping for a chance to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Dave closed the magazine. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Allan mentioned it or not, but I\u2019ve recently become engaged.\u201d The young man\u2019s lips tilted in a pleased smile.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Geoff\u2019s smile grew wider. \u201cI feel like the luckiest man alive because Lori Bellamy\u2019s agreed to marry me.\u201d</p> <p>The Bellamys were major landowners on Bainbridge Island. Dave had heard the name any number of times through the years because of the family\u2019s many philanthropic projects. If he remembered correctly, the Bellamys owned a theater and various prime pieces of waterfront in the downtown area of Winslow.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune,\u201d Geoff said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect month for a wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Geoff lowered himself into the chair next to Dave. \u201cLori said something about premarital classes. What\u2019s your feeling about those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly recommend them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Geoff didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cShe seems to think they\u2019re important, but...\u201d</p><p>Dave tried to reassure the young man. \u201cThey help alleviate problems later on, Geoff,\u201d he went on to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial for a young couple to establish the lines of communication before they say their vows.\u201d</p><p>Geoff shifted a bit and looked away. \u201cAre these classes expensive?\u201d</p><p>That was a tricky question. Dave didn\u2019t charge anyone in his congregation for counseling, whether individual or in a class; however, he couldn\u2019t speak for other churches. \u201cI don\u2019t believe they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLori\u2019s family are willing to pay for them\u2014along with everything else.\u201d This last part was said with some bitterness. \u201cI don\u2019t mind them picking up the cost of the wedding\u2014that\u2019s traditional\u2014but for the rest, I believe Lori and I should pay.\u201d</p><p>Dave approved of his attitude. He speculated that while Geoff made a decent wage as a legal assistant, he couldn\u2019t handle an extravagant lifestyle. But Dave liked the young man\u2019s sense of honor, his determination to pay his own expenses.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I could set you up with a couple of sessions,\u201d he offered. \u201cYou and Lori can meet with me and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Dave shook his head. \u201cYou can make a donation to the church later if you decide it was worth your time.\u201d</p><p>Geoff looked shocked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I want you to start your marriage on the right foot.\u201d He paused, thinking a moment. \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be more convenient for you to do the sessions in Cedar Cove, anyway, rather than on Bainbridge Island, since you\u2019re working here. What about Lori? Does she work in the area?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a part-time job at a dress shop in Silverdale. This should be good for both of us,\u201d Geoff said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Lori and get back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>Geoff returned to his desk, and Dave picked up the magazine again. He hadn\u2019t read more than a few paragraphs of an article about steroid use in professional sports before the front door opened and Allan Harris exploded into the room. He was a burly, energetic man.</p><p>\u201cDave, Dave,\u201d he muttered, \u201csorry to keep you waiting.\u201d</p><p>Dave placed the magazine on the nearby table and stood. \u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>Allan shrugged out of his wool overcoat and hung it on the peg next to Dave\u2019s. \u201cDid Geoff offer you coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m full up, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Allan lifted the glass coffeepot, which sat in an alcove next to his office, and poured himself a cup. \u201cIt\u2019s colder outside than a witch\u2019s\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cBeg your pardon, Pastor.\u201d</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t bother hiding his amusement. People seemed to assume he\u2019d never heard or uttered a swearword in his life, when in fact, he was as fallible and as prone to weakness as anyone else.</p><p>Perhaps even more so, he mused, cringing at the thought. He hated what was happening between him and Emily but seemed unable to tell her the truth. After Christmas, he\u2019d fess up. That was a promise he fully intended to keep.</p><p>Carefully holding his mug, Allan led the way into his office. He motioned to the visitor\u2019s chair across from his desk, then claimed his own.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that you\u2019re willing to meet with me,\u201d Allan said, setting his mug on a coaster amid the clutter of papers and books.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m curious as to why.\u201d Dave guessed this had something to do with Martha Evans. The elderly woman had died in September. During her last year, Dave had made a point of visiting her as often as he could. In many ways, she reminded him of his own grandmother with her indomitable spirit and sharp wit. She kept a Bible close at hand and had memorized large sections of Scripture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to the heirs,\u201d Allan said.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Dave couldn\u2019t help noticing that the attorney suddenly seemed agitated, rolling a pen between his open hands.</p><p>Allan stared hard at him. \u201cSeveral pieces of Martha\u2019s jewelry are missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d But Dave didn\u2019t understand what that had to do with him. He\u2019d already spoken to Sheriff Davis and told him everything he knew about the missing jewelry, which was next to nothing.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind going over the details of the morning you discovered her body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Dave hesitated. He\u2019d described it to the sheriff more than once, and had the creeping sensation that Allan was viewing him as a suspect. That unnerved him. \u201cI stopped by two or three times a week to visit,\u201d he began.</p><p>Allan nodded, encouraging him to continue.</p><p>\u201cThat particular day was a Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Allan concurred.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t respond to the doorbell. Martha no longer left the house for anything other than doctors\u2019 appointments. When she didn\u2019t answer, I was afraid something might be wrong.\u201d</p><p>Allan dropped the pen and leaned forward. \u201cDid you phone 911?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised him. \u201cNot right away. I didn\u2019t want to do that until I was sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went directly into the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I knew where Martha hid the spare key, so I unlocked the front door and let myself in.\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019d done this before,\u201d he added, \u201csince Martha always kept the door locked. It saved her the effort of getting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was dead when you went in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. According to the coroner\u2019s report, she died peacefully sometime during the night. When I first saw her, I actually thought she was still asleep.\u201d Although he should\u2019ve been emotionally prepared, Dave had felt a deep sense of loss at the old woman\u2019s death. She\u2019d become his friend, and his confidante.</p><p>\u201cHow long after you discovered her body did you contact the authorities?\u201d Allan asked next.</p><p>This was beginning to sound as if Allan was writing a police report. Dave had answered these same questions the day Martha died, when Sheriff Davis interviewed him, and again later.</p><p>\u201cI walked into the bedroom, checked for a pulse and got out my cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t use her phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Allan made a notation on his pad.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Allan assured him. \u201cHow long before the paramedics arrived?\u201d</p><p>Dave needed to think about that. \u201cNot long. Between five and ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Allan Harris nodded. \u201cWhere did you wait for them? Inside the house or outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside.\u201d Actually, he\u2019d knelt at Martha\u2019s bedside and prayed. He met the attorney\u2019s gaze. \u201cIs there a specific reason you\u2019re asking me these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I explained\u2014\u201d Allan cleared his throat \u201c\u2014Martha\u2019s daughters came by to tell me that several pieces of their mother\u2019s jewelry are missing. They\u2019ve already spoken to the sheriff and are pretty upset. Apparently Martha kept a number of valuable pieces in the house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seriously think I\u2019d steal from Martha, do you?\u201d Anger rose to the surface and he struggled to disguise how insulted he was by such an accusation. Getting upset might imply guilt, however, so he held on to his temper.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know Martha had a lot of expensive jewelry.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d searched the old woman\u2019s cupboards or dresser drawers.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Allan said, \u201cbut the family insists everything was there on Friday evening, when they visited her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they were so concerned about the jewelry, why didn\u2019t they put it in a safer place?\u201d</p><p>Allan shrugged. \u201cI asked them the same question. I gather they weren\u2019t comfortable suggesting it to their mother.\u201d</p><p>Dave could understand that. Once Martha made a decision she wouldn\u2019t budge. If she felt her jewelry was perfectly safe at the house, then little would persuade her otherwise.</p><p>\u201cNone of it was locked up?\u201d Dave asked. He knew Martha kept at least some of her jewels hidden in the freezer; she\u2019d told him so. But he\u2019d certainly never looked.</p><p>\u201cApparently not,\u201d Allan said. \u201cShe liked things done her own way.\u201d</p> <p>Dave was well aware of that, too. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t help you any more. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me...\u201d He refused to answer anything else. He didn\u2019t like Allan\u2019s implications or the tone of his questions.</p><p>Geoff was in the hallway outside the office when Dave opened the door. He seemed startled to see Dave and moved quickly out of his way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you soon,\u201d Geoff told him. \u201cAbout those marriage counseling sessions,\u201d he added.</p><p>Dave responded with a nod, happy to be about his business. Because he was irritated and needed to calm down, he pulled out his cell and called home. Emily answered almost right away.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your Monday going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She sounded depressed.</p> <p>\u201cJust okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Monday, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about lunch?\u201d she said. \u201cWe could meet at the Pot Belly Deli or the Wok and Roll.\u201d</p><p>Both were favorites of his but Dave automatically declined. \u201cNot today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her voice was reluctant; she wasn\u2019t pleased and let him know it.</p><p>Dave hated disappointing her. \u201cMaybe later in the week.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then asked, \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been all morning? You left the house with barely a word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart, I had to get to the hospital. Olivia Griffin was going in for cancer surgery. Her family\u2019s pretty shaken up, and I felt I should stop by. The morning got away from me because I had to meet with Allan Harris right afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllan Harris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha\u2019s attorney. I thought\u2014\u201d He paused, feeling stupid now and annoyed with himself. \u201cI thought she might\u2019ve left something to the church in her will and that was the reason Allan wanted to chat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...not that I\u2019m aware. Of course, I would never have suggested it to her, but I had the idea in the back of my mind.\u201d His presumption embarrassed him, and he felt guilty for having entertained the notion.</p><p>\u201cSo what did he want?\u201d</p><p>Dave debated how much to tell his wife. He didn\u2019t want her to worry about any of this. \u201cHe had a few questions for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing important,\u201d he said dismissively, unwilling to lie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Rather than launch into a lengthy discussion, Dave made an excuse and got off the phone. He had somewhere else he needed to be\u2014a place he didn\u2019t want Emily to know about.</p><p>Nine</p><p>Moving back to Cedar Cove was a mixed blessing, Faith Beckwith decided as she prepared for her first day of work. The Cedar Cove medical clinic had advertised for a part-time nurse and she\u2019d been hired right away. Her entire life had changed in the blink of an eye\u2014or so it felt. It\u2019d all begun with the sale of her home in south Seattle.</p><p>A widow for three years, Faith had rattled around the big house in the Seattle neighborhood where she and Carl had raised their family. It really was time to downsize, but she\u2019d assumed that because of market conditions the sale would take months. Instead, the first family who\u2019d stepped over the threshold had made a full-price offer with the stipulation that she be completely out of the house by Thanksgiving. If not for the help of her two children, Scott and Jay Lynn, Faith would never have been able to make the transition to Cedar Cove so quickly. Thinking about the last few weeks\u2014and the way her whole life had changed\u2014gave her a breathless feeling.</p><p>Faith would\u2019ve preferred to start her new job after January first, but it became apparent that if she didn\u2019t accept the position now, the clinic would hire someone else. Faith chose to start work.</p><p>With her children\u2019s assistance, she\u2019d unpacked nearly forty years of her life in a rental house on Rosewood Lane, one that belonged to her high school friend, Grace Sherman. Except, as Troy had reminded her, it was Grace Harding now.</p><p>While Faith enjoyed living near her grandchildren, it also meant she was in close proximity to Sheriff Troy Davis. Her encounter with him Thanksgiving week had upset her. Living in a town the size of Cedar Cove made such meetings inevitable, she supposed. Still, she didn\u2019t expect to see Troy very often\u2014especially if she was careful and Faith fully intended to be. She hoped to avoid any and all contact with Sheriff Davis.</p><p>The man had broken her heart, not once but twice. Okay, to be fair, her mother was responsible for the circumstances that had led to their breakup the first time. They\u2019d been young; nevertheless, she still felt shocked that Troy could ever have believed she\u2019d casually dump him for someone else after he went into the service. In retrospect, she wondered if he\u2019d been so willing to accept her mother\u2019s lie because he was looking for an excuse to break off their relationship. Her mother had made it easy.</p><p>The second time she\u2019d mailed him a sympathy card after hearing about the death of his wife, and they\u2019d reconnected. Just when she\u2019d made a commitment to him, to their relationship, he\u2019d ended it. Well, enough was enough.</p><p>None of that made any difference now, she reasoned, annoyed that she was thinking about Troy at all.</p><p>Faith parked in the clinic lot, collected her purse and her lunch and walked inside, feeling excited\u2014and a little nervous\u2014about her first day. She was assigned to Dr. Chad Timmons, whom she\u2019d liked on sight. He was certainly attractive, and she imagined he\u2019d broken more than one heart.</p><p>Thinking about broken hearts brought her right back to the sheriff. Faith had to forcefully stomp on that thought. It might take some doing, but she was going to put him completely out of her life.</p><p>The morning went smoothly, and Faith discovered that she fit in well with the rest of the staff. Tuesdays and Wednesdays were apparently the least busy at the clinic, which was why she was scheduled for those two days this month. After the first of the year, she\u2019d be working Monday, Thursday and Friday.</p><p>Her morning consisted of routine cases, innoculations and paperwork. She had one last patient to see before lunch\u2014a twenty-nine-year-old woman by the name of Megan Bloomquist. Apparently Megan was distraught because she thought she might be pregnant. It seemed to be a case more appropriate for Pregnancy Crisis than the medical clinic.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Faith said, opening the exam room door. \u201cI\u2019m Faith Beckwith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d The young woman sat in the chair with her ankles crossed. Her red-rimmed eyes were fearful. \u201cYou\u2019re not the doctor, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Dr. Timmons\u2019s nurse.\u201d</p><p>The young woman nodded, clenching and unclenching her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to take your blood pressure and your temperature and find out how Dr. Timmons can help you,\u201d Faith explained. She pressed the thermometer lightly against Megan\u2019s forehead. Her temperature registered and Faith noted it on the medical chart\u2014normal.</p><p>Megan sniffled. \u201cI think I\u2019m pregnant and I...don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Faith noticed the wedding ring on her finger. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do...\u201d She covered her face with both hands and started to sob. After a moment she regained some control of her emotions. \u201cCraig and I want children, but...but I had a miscarriage three months ago. I\u2019ve only had one period since then.\u201d She took out a small day planner to check the dates.</p><p>Faith felt a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach as she noted the details of Megan\u2019s last period. Troy\u2019s daughter was named Megan and she\u2019d recently miscarried. Could it be? How was it that her very first day on the job, Faith would run into Troy\u2019s daughter? She struggled to hide her dismay.</p><p>\u201cI took a home pregnancy test and it was positive.\u201d Slowly Megan straightened. \u201cBut I just need to be sure, and my own doctor\u2019s booked solid.\u201d</p><p>Faith didn\u2019t bother to point out that home tests were pretty reliable these days. She could understand Megan\u2019s uncertainty after having a miscarriage.</p><p>She was startled to hear Megan say, \u201cCraig and I decided that it might not be a good idea for me to get pregnant again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d That seemed a rather drastic decision.</p><p>\u201cWell, certainly not this soon,\u201d Megan told her. \u201cWe...we were hoping for some definitive word on my health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>Megan lowered her head. \u201cI might have MS. It\u2019s in the family and because there might be a genetic link...\u201d</p><p>This could only be Troy\u2019s daughter. Looking away, Faith reached for the blood pressure cuff. \u201cThere are tests you can have that will reassure you,\u201d she said briskly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ve had those tests.\u201d</p><p>Faith waited.</p><p>Megan\u2019s shoulders drooped. \u201cThe MRI was inconclusive. You see, my mother was diagnosed with it when I was young, and it was after she\u2019d miscarried several times. When I lost my pregnancy it occurred to me that it might be for the same reason.\u201d</p><p>Faith checked Megan\u2019s blood pressure and wrote it down. Again, normal. After Troy had used his daughter as an excuse to end the relationship, Faith had done a bit of research on MS, looking at reputable Internet sites and talking to a few doctors she knew.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should mention MS, because I recently read an article about the latest findings and heredity as a potential cause.\u201d Faith did her best to sound professional.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d Megan\u2019s eyes widened with interest.</p><p>\u201cThe article\u2019s about a University of Washington study. It states that the children of people with MS have a one percent chance of inheriting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one percent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Mayo Clinic site says the chances are four to five percent. Either way, those odds are in your favor.\u201d</p><p>The young woman stared at her intently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be this concerned, Megan. Your mother would want you to live your life without this worry hanging over your head.\u201d She gave the girl\u2019s arm a squeeze.</p><p>Fresh tears welled in Megan\u2019s eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s really wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could be any number of reasons you miscarried your first pregnancy. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraig and I were devastated.\u201d She blinked back tears. \u201cMy father, too...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never easy to lose a child,\u201d Faith said gently. \u201cI had a miscarriage myself. That was many years ago, of course. Both my children are grown and married with children of their own. Yet even now I sometimes wonder about that lost baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLosing the pregnancy came so soon after my mother\u2019s death,\u201d Megan whispered brokenly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Faith took hold of Megan\u2019s hand, and the young woman gripped her fingers painfully hard.</p><p>Apparently unable to speak, Megan hiccupped a laugh. \u201cThat pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned, either. You\u2019d think Craig and I would know how babies are made. I swear we do...It\u2019s just that...well, we didn\u2019t use the protection we should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait and make absolutely sure you are pregnant, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I guess I have to believe that whatever happens, God doesn\u2019t make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Timmons will be able to tell if you\u2019re pregnant, and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Megan\u2019s voice was a little stronger now.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need,\u201d Faith said next, \u201cis something to help you relax.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean drugs. Do you have any hobbies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do some scrapbooking, but I\u2019ve been meaning to take up knitting. It\u2019s so popular now and if I really am pregnant, I\u2019d like to knit a blanket for the baby\u2014if I can hold on to this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink positive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnitting isn\u2019t hard to learn,\u201d Faith said encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cA friend showed me the basic stitches last year. I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t have any problem picking it up again, but I don\u2019t remember how to cast on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you knit?\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. Her last project had been socks for Troy Davis. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you now,\u201d she said, lightly touching Megan\u2019s arm. \u201cDr. Timmons will be in to see you shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019ve been very kind.\u201d</p><p>Faith managed a smile before she left the room, a smile that slipped as soon as she\u2019d closed the door. What were the odds of this happening? Faith would never have thought that eliminating Troy Davis from her heart and her life would be this difficult.</p> <p>Her lunch break was an hour long. Faith had brought a sandwich from home and an apple. When she\u2019d eaten, she still had ample time to run a few errands, so she headed for The Quilted Giraffe, the local fabric store. Her granddaughter wanted Faith to sew her a special dress for the Christmas Eve church service.</p><p>Faith had chosen her fabric\u2014a green velvet Kaitlyn would love\u2014when Megan Bloomquist approached her.</p><p>\u201cHello, again,\u201d the young woman said, looking far more peaceful now than she had earlier.</p><p>Faith knew from the notation Dr. Timmons had made in her chart that Megan was indeed pregnant. That should make Troy happy.</p><p>She was doing it again. This constant thinking about Troy had to stop!</p><p>\u201cHello, Megan,\u201d she said cordially, if a bit stiffly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right that I talk to you, isn\u2019t it? I mean, I don\u2019t want to go against medical protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Faith felt that her response might have been a bit cool.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that I\u2019m definitely pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The young woman\u2019s happiness appeared genuine. \u201cYou were wonderful. Thank you for helping me gain some perspective on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan, really, I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI was an emotional wreck when I walked into the clinic and after speaking to you I felt a thousand times better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I could help.\u201d Faith pulled the bolt of fabric off the shelf and carried it to a clerk to be measured and cut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking your advice,\u201d Megan said, following her. \u201cLook.\u201d She lifted a small wire basket draped over her arm. Inside were knitting needles, several skeins of a variegated yarn in pastel colors and a pattern book that included a selection of baby blankets.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find that nothing calms you the way knitting does. In fact, there are studies that prove it.\u201d</p><p>Megan smiled. \u201cYou like reading studies, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Faith smiled back. \u201cI guess I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady at the counter said she\u2019d teach me how to cast on,\u201d Megan said, \u201cbut she\u2019s been busy ever since so I\u2019ve been waiting around until she\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Faith set her fabric on the cutting table. \u201cI can show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you!\u201d</p><p>Faith removed the needles from their packaging and pulled the yarn free from one of the skeins. In a few minutes, Megan had caught on.</p><p>While the woman behind the counter measured and cut the green velvet, Faith reviewed the pattern instructions with Megan to be sure she understood how to get started.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough,\u201d Megan said when she\u2019d finished.</p><p>With their purchases in hand, Faith and Megan walked to the front door together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back to work,\u201d Faith told the younger woman.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I work at the frame shop on Harbor. If you ever need anything framed, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, thank you.\u201d Faith almost mentioned that her son, Scottie, had recently had something framed at that very shop. But it was best for her emotional health not to encourage a relationship with Troy\u2019s daughter, so she walked away after a simple goodbye.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Teri Polgar hadn\u2019t heard from her sister in well over a week. A year ago that wouldn\u2019t have been unusual. They rarely saw each other regularly until last summer, when things between them had started to improve. They\u2019d had their share of differences; still did. But despite their difficult history, family was important to Teri. She and Johnny, her younger brother, were close. More and more, Teri found reasons to keep in touch with Christie, too.</p><p>A week without any form of communication from Christie wasn\u2019t typical these days. What bothered her more was that Christie hadn\u2019t returned any of her phone calls. Teri knew her sister wasn\u2019t shy about sharing her feelings. If Teri had done something to upset her, Christie would\u2019ve let her know. All Teri could come up with was Christie\u2019s ongoing determination to avoid James.</p><p>\u201cBobby, I\u2019m going shopping.\u201d She didn\u2019t say for what. Bobby didn\u2019t concern himself with budgets. He had enough money for all their wants and needs; that was the only thing that mattered on the financial front. His life revolved around chess\u2014and her. He was a master chess player, one of the world\u2019s best. He\u2019d always watched over her with vigilance, and now that she was pregnant, Bobby doted on her even more than usual.</p><p>He barely glanced up from the computer screen. \u201cI\u2019ll call James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby, no. I can drive to Wal-Mart on my own.\u201d</p><p>The look he cast her was filled with doubt and worry.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d It was easier to acquiesce than to argue. Bobby was far too protective, but how could she complain when he loved her so much? Ridiculous though it was to have a driver when she\u2019d been driving all by herself since she was sixteen years old, she knew it set Bobby\u2019s mind at rest.</p><p>Within five minutes James, who lived on the property, had the car parked in front of the house, waiting for Teri. He stood by the passenger door formally dressed in his black suit and billed cap.</p><p>When Teri was first married to Bobby, she felt embarrassed to have a car and driver, especially in a town the size of Cedar Cove. However, she\u2019d grown accustomed to it, and apparently so had everyone else. No one commented on it\u2014not to her, anyway.</p><p>As she approached the vehicle, James held the passenger door open.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James,\u201d she said as he helped her inside.</p><p>He stepped around the vehicle and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWhere to, Miss Teri?\u201d</p><p>No matter how many times she asked him to drop the Miss, which made her sound like a preschool teacher, James persisted. After all these months she\u2019d finally given up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go to Wal-Mart, James.\u201d</p><p>His back stiffened ever so slightly. \u201cWal-Mart, Miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d Teri couldn\u2019t quite restrain a smile. James knew very well that Christie was currently employed as a cashier at the local Wal-Mart.</p><p>\u201cRight away, miss.\u201d</p><p>Teri relaxed in the luxurious leather seat as she listened to the soothing music coming from the speakers. \u201cWhat are you playing, James?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cVivaldi, miss. The Four Seasons.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>James preferred classical and used his own CDs. Early on, she\u2019d requested he find a country-western radio station instead, and to his credit, he\u2019d done so. Only when she saw him insert cotton balls in his ears did she stop requesting anything other than the classical music he chose. She\u2019d come to see beauty in it and not boredom.</p><p>She was fond of James, more than fond; she now considered him a friend, although she let him impose the limits on their friendship. She also felt he was perfect for her sister.</p><p>The problem was that Christie was so closemouthed about the relationship. James was even worse. The two of them were equally adept at keeping secrets.</p><p>When they pulled into the Wal-Mart lot, she saw dozens of cars circling, searching for a parking space. Christmas shoppers were out in full force, although it was a midweek afternoon and still early in the month.</p><p>\u201cJames, do you have plans for Christmas?\u201d Teri asked curiously. She knew so little about him.</p><p>\u201cPlans? No, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be traveling anywhere to visit family or friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss.\u201d</p><p>She forged ahead. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll join Bobby and me, then.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo need for a response just yet,\u201d she assured him. \u201cThe invitation is open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, miss.\u201d</p><p>He parked by the front entrance, leaped out and came around to open her door.</p><p>\u201cGive me an hour, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the store, receiving curious looks and hearing a few veiled whispers. Okay, so maybe not everyone in town was accustomed to seeing her with a driver.</p><p>Checking the long row of cashiers, Teri saw Christie in Lane Ten. Without looking, she grabbed a handful of sale items, had a word with the manager and then stood in her sister\u2019s line. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She waited patiently for her turn, then set the Thanksgiving decorations she\u2019d scooped up on the counter.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Christie said automatically before she looked up and saw it was Teri. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded in a fierce whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t return any of my phone calls,\u201d Teri whispered back. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you were alive or dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive. I\u2019ve been working a lot of extra hours. In case you hadn\u2019t noticed, this is the Christmas season.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>Christie\u2019s supervisor approached the register and placed a Closed sign behind Teri. \u201cLane Three is opening up,\u201d she told the other customers. \u201cChristie, take your lunch break now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Christie asked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t Cookie go first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Teri inserted. \u201cI asked your supervisor to give you your break so you and I could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I should\u2019ve known you wouldn\u2019t leave well enough alone.\u201d Christie slapped the sales items in a white plastic bag and handed it to Teri, then collected payment. When she\u2019d finished, Christie checked her watch. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to take long, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on you,\u201d Teri responded.</p><p>They decided to eat at the fast-food place near the store. Once they\u2019d ordered, they were fortunate enough to find a vacant table, although the place was busy. Christie opened her container of chicken nuggets and the small peel-away top on the dipping sauce. Teri watched her sister with a look of envy.</p><p>Teri was being careful about her weight because of the pregnancy, so she\u2019d ordered a Caesar salad. Her weight gain at her last doctor\u2019s appointment had been substantial. Okay, her diet hadn\u2019t been ideal. She cheated a bit now and then. Nevertheless, she didn\u2019t deserve to gain seven pounds in a single month. She\u2019d protested loudly, but her obstetrician had dismissed her cries that the scale had been tampered with. Reluctantly Teri tore open the low-fat dressing packet and poured it over the romaine lettuce.</p><p>\u201cI guess this has to do with James,\u201d Christie said with the air of someone resigned to an unpleasant conversation.</p> <p>\u201cWell, actually...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Her sister bit savagely into a nugget.</p><p>Something had obviously happened between her sister and James, during their encounter last week, and Christie assumed Teri knew all about it. James, of course, hadn\u2019t said a word.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Christie stated emphatically, leaning forward. \u201cI wasn\u2019t drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Teri murmured, wondering how to ferret out information without letting on that she had no idea what Christie was talking about.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to stop doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Teri said firmly. \u201cThis can\u2019t continue.\u201d</p> <p>Christie looked more than a little surprised to find Teri taking her side. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Christie leaned even closer and lowered her voice. \u201cWhen James parks the limousine at The Pink Poodle, everyone stares out the window and asks questions. It\u2019s only a matter of time before someone figures out he\u2019s there because of me.\u201d</p><p>This was beginning to make sense. \u201cYou mean he never goes inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d As if her appetite had completely abandoned her, Christie pushed away the remaining chicken nuggets. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe the way Larry and the others were gawking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually James moved around to the side of the building where I\u2019d parked my car.\u201d</p><p>The scene was taking shape in Teri\u2019s mind. \u201cSo, when you came out, he figured you\u2019d had too much to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was wrong,\u201d Christie insisted. \u201cWrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d</p><p>Teri nodded sagely.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I thought he\u2019d left. One of the guys said he saw the car drive away. How was I supposed to know he\u2019d only moved it?\u201d Christie reached for her napkin and began to shred it. \u201cIf waiting for me wasn\u2019t bad enough, he followed me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone from The Pink Poodle see?\u201d</p><p>Christie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope not.\u201d She gazed at the strips of paper, then wadded them up. \u201cTell him something for me, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...I, uh...\u201d Teri would rather not serve as a messenger between them, although she was certainly eager to keep track of what was going on.</p><p>Before she could argue, Christie raised her hand. \u201cAll you have to do is tell James I don\u2019t want to see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about that?\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s hesitation was brief. \u201cPositive,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t like him,\u201d she continued as though convincing herself. \u201cHe\u2019s a stuffed shirt.... All that formality drives me insane.\u201d</p><p>Teri frowned. That wasn\u2019t the impression she had.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d Christie said.</p><p>\u201cLook at you how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike...like you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>She gestured vaguely. \u201cI can\u2019t help remembering how worried you were when we found out James had been kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Christie swallowed and glanced away. When she did speak, her voice was almost a whisper. \u201cHe might be stuffy, but he\u2019s a real gentleman, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Teri agreed softly. She remembered her own reaction to James at their first meeting. So tall and frightfully thin, so formal and reserved. In the beginning his manner had irritated her until she realized what a good friend he was to her husband. He cared for Bobby, looked after him and saw that her absentminded husband reached his appointments on time. Bobby needed James, relied on him. And James had been a friend to her, too. Not only that, his actions during the kidnapping were nothing short of heroic, as Rachel could attest.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Teri said. \u201cI want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re saying here. Because\u2014as we\u2019ve discussed before\u2014you don\u2019t seem to like men who treat you with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Christie leaned away from the table, apparently studying something on the floor. She\u2019d taken Teri\u2019s napkin and begun to shred it, too. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to relate to a man who doesn\u2019t abuse me in one way or another,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cListen, Christie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen have used me my entire life. You\u2019d think I\u2019d hate them all by now.\u201d For a moment she looked as if she might dissolve into tears. \u201cI meet one of these losers and I immediately want to fix his life and make everything right. I always figure that once I do, he\u2019ll love me and cherish me forever.\u201d She gave Teri a watery smile. \u201cHow come I can see the pattern but I can\u2019t break it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess what, Christie, we share more than the same genes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have Bobby and he loves you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d Sighing, Teri placed both hands on her stomach. \u201cI tried to send Bobby away. I felt the same things you do. I didn\u2019t want him to love me, and I did everything I could to keep him out of my life.\u201d</p><p>Christie shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that because you think it\u2019ll make me feel better. You\u2019ve always made good decisions. You have a career and friends and...now you have Bobby and a real family.\u201d Her gaze fell to Teri\u2019s stomach and her eyes softened with longing.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll be stuck with losers for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>Her sister didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cSo you reject any decent guy who comes around.\u201d Teri didn\u2019t mean to sound sarcastic. \u201cListen, Christie, you say you want to break the pattern. James is your chance to do it.\u201d</p><p>Christie still didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s attracted to you.\u201d</p><p>Her sister shook her head again. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. Otherwise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherwise he wouldn\u2019t have driven down to The Pink Poodle and waited outside for you,\u201d Teri said, cutting her off. \u201cWhy else would James do that?\u201d</p><p>Christie gave an unenthusiastic shrug.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to talk to you,\u201d Teri explained as if speaking to a third-grader. \u201cThat\u2019s why he did it.\u201d</p><p>Gathering up the pieces of her second shredded napkin, Christie swallowed several times. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Her sister\u2019s eyes were suddenly hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI can try to help,\u201d Teri said. \u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll arrange an opportunity for the two of you to meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner,\u201d she suggested. \u201cBobby and I can invite you both to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Christie instantly dismissed the idea. \u201cThat would be awkward for everyone.\u201d</p><p>True, Teri thought, but that way she\u2019d have a close-up view of the proceedings. However, discretion won out over curiosity. \u201cOkay, then, see James on your own,\u201d she said mildly.</p><p>Christie seemed to be considering that. \u201cYou really think I should?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Teri offered her a smile of encouragement. She wanted Christie to experience the same happiness she\u2019d found with Bobby. \u201cWill you do it?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>Christie nodded, tentatively at first, then more vigorously. Teri was relieved to see the light of anticipation back in her sister\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Olivia sipped her tea and enjoyed the sheer luxury of being home in the middle of a workweek. She\u2019d taken a medical leave of absence from the courthouse, and this was the longest she\u2019d been at home since the children were born. Under normal circumstances, she\u2019d be presiding over her courtroom right now, hearing cases, making judgments that would affect the lives of people in her community. Olivia took her job as a family court judge seriously, which was probably the reason some of her decisions had been controversial.</p><p>Once she\u2019d denied a divorce on a technicality when it was obvious to her, but seemingly to no one else, that the young couple standing before her was still in love. She\u2019d followed her heart and her instincts. Same with a joint custody situation in which she\u2019d ruled that the kids would stay in the house, with the parents moving back and forth.</p><p>Olivia returned her teacup to the saucer and stretched out her legs so they rested on the footstool. She admired her fuzzy new slippers, a gift from Grace. Her dressing gown was from Grace, as well. The sun shone warmly into the room and, childish as it sounded, she felt as if it were shining just for her.</p><p>\u201cYou need anything else?\u201d Jack called from the kitchen. He was home on his lunch break in order to coax her to eat. Her appetite was practically nonexistent.</p><p>Olivia sipped a little more of her tea. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about some Christmas cookies?\u201d The day before, Justine had brought over a batch of Charlotte\u2019s special Russian Tea Cookies. Her Christmas baking was a family tradition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d The tea had been soothing, but the thought of food held no appeal. She knew this was only going to get worse once she started chemo in early January. Jack was worried about her lack of appetite and seemed determined to keep her from losing any more weight than she already had.</p><p>\u201cI picked up those iced raisin cookies you like at the grocery store,\u201d he called back, obviously trying to tempt her.</p><p>\u201cNot interested, but thanks.\u201d She wasn\u2019t unappreciative, but she didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d manage a lunch of soup, let alone adding cookies.</p><p>Jack stuck his head out of the kitchen. A smudge of powdered sugar ringed his lips as he frowned at her in consternation.</p> <p>\u201cJack,\u201d she protested, struggling not to laugh. \u201cCookies aren\u2019t on your diet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you I ate those cookies?\u201d His gaze narrowed.</p><p>\u201cCome here and I\u2019ll show you,\u201d she teased, motioning him forward.</p><p>He walked in and Olivia held her arms open, inviting him into her embrace. When he bent forward, she sat up and tapped his lips, murmuring \u201csugar,\u201d then kissed him.</p><p>When the kiss ended, Jack eased away. \u201cYes, I\u2019m your sugar,\u201d he said and she laughed. With a deep sigh, he looked at her. \u201cThat was nice.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIn fact, it was very nice...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI liked it too,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cDo I have powdered sugar on my lips now?\u201d she asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gave a guilty start. \u201cI only ate one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne?\u201d Olivia had tasted those cookies from the time she was a youngster and eating just one would\u2019ve been impossible. Besides, her husband had a notorious sweet tooth.</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he said again, then glanced at his watch. \u201cIn the last ten minutes, I only had one.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled again. No point getting upset. After Jack\u2019s heart attack, she\u2019d watched his diet religiously although she tried to resist nagging. Following her divorce it had taken her nearly twenty years to fall in love again and she was determined not to lose Jack any earlier than she had to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being careful,\u201d he promised, almost as if he was reading her thoughts. \u201cI exercised this morning, and I had oatmeal for breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood boy.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cThe person who needs to eat these sweets is you.\u201d He sat on the footstool and gazed at her, worry tightening his expression. Then he took both her hands in his own. \u201cWill you try to eat something?\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he coaxed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have soup.\u201d Because she loved him, Olivia was willing to make the effort, although even the thought of soup or cookies\u2014or anything else\u2014made her feel queasy.</p><p>\u201cTomato?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVegetable beef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay until you\u2019re finished,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cHoney...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean sugar?\u201d he asked, grinning. \u201cAnyway, no objections allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, oh, great and mighty one.\u201d It was important to him to prove that he was capable of handling this stress without turning to alcohol. Sobriety was hard-won for Jack. She knew he\u2019d faltered when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She\u2019d been badly thrown herself. Now, on the other side of surgery, she was confident they\u2019d both survive; she thanked God for that.</p><p>While Jack prepared her luncheon tray, Olivia closed her eyes, lulled by the warm sunshine. It seemed only seconds later that he returned, carrying a tray with a steaming bowl of soup, two cookies and a small vase with a single rose. He\u2019d even taken the time to fold a linen napkin.</p><p>\u201cHave you been watching the Home Decorating channel again?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI thought the rose would brighten your day.\u201d He reached for her hand, raised it to his lips and kissed her knuckles. \u201cNow, eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He sat next to her until she\u2019d finished the entire bowl of soup and even nibbled at one of the cookies.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d she asked. She simply couldn\u2019t eat another bite.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He brought the tray to the kitchen and when he came back, he\u2019d put on his long raincoat, although he seemed reluctant to leave her. \u201cI\u2019ll get home as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace is coming over?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cShe should be here in an hour or two. And Pastor Flemming said he\u2019d drop by later this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Between Jack, her daughter, her mother, Grace and her brother, Will, she was hardly ever alone. Olivia didn\u2019t mind being by herself, but she understood that this was their way of showing how much they loved her.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jack left for the newspaper office, and Olivia settled down with a new women\u2019s fiction title Grace had recommended. The doorbell chimed. When she opened the front door, she was delighted to see Pastor Flemming.</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t come at a bad time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Olivia told him as they walked into the living room.</p><p>\u201cI realize I told you I\u2019d come around four when I talked to you on the phone yesterday, but I had a free hour and thought I\u2019d visit now, if that\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Olivia had hoped to take a nap before Grace arrived, but she could go without one. Napping in the middle of the day could easily become addictive, and she couldn\u2019t allow that. As she\u2019d joked to her husband, it wouldn\u2019t look good if she started yawning in court.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down.\u201d Olivia gestured toward the chair across from her own.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that.\u201d He reached for his Bible and Olivia saw his wristwatch fall to the carpet. Frowning, Pastor Flemming picked it up. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the clasp. I\u2019ll need to have this repaired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely watch.\u201d Even to Olivia\u2019s untrained eye, this was an expensive one. It seemed well-worn and well-loved; perhaps it had come from his father or grandfather.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He appeared to be flustered by her compliment and quickly changed the subject. The visit lasted about thirty minutes, long enough to drink yet another cup of tea, and after a short prayer, Pastor Flemming left, first returning their cups to the kitchen.</p><p>Olivia did get some reading done before Grace arrived. Much as she looked forward to seeing her friend, she also enjoyed the hour or so of solitude, although more than once she\u2019d almost drifted off as she read.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you anything?\u201d Grace asked the instant she stepped inside. Her eyes were somber with concern. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to, but...what if it becomes a habit?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cOlivia. Your body\u2019s telling you it needs rest. For heaven\u2019s sake, listen to your body!\u201d</p><p>This was sensible advice. \u201cI\u2019ll only sleep for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep until you\u2019re ready to wake up.\u201d Grace walked ahead of her into the bedroom to pull back the covers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start dinner while you\u2019re resting,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Olivia told her as she got into bed.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I want to.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t argue. Like Jack, Grace needed to feel useful. She settled the covers over Olivia and tucked them around her shoulders. Then she drew the curtains, and as quietly as possible, tiptoed out of the room.</p><p>Olivia nestled against the thick down pillows and closed her eyes, savoring the indulgence of sleeping in the middle of the day.</p><p>Tired as she was, she assumed she\u2019d immediately fall asleep. Instead, her mind took a series of unexpected twists and turns. It struck her as odd that Pastor Flemming would show up unannounced instead of at the time he\u2019d previously set. She\u2019d never known him to do that before.</p><p>Although he\u2019d been solicitous and caring, Olivia was left with the distinct impression that something was troubling him. He seemed unusually rushed and unfocused, eager to be about his business.</p><p>After fifteen minutes, Olivia realized trying to sleep was pointless. She folded back the blankets and climbed out of bed.</p><p>Grace met her in the hallway, hands propped on her hips. \u201cWhat are you doing up so soon?\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You were about to keel over from exhaustion when I got here.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wished she could put her concern about Dave Flemming into words. A visit from the pastor had been a gesture of kindness. It shouldn\u2019t matter that he\u2019d arrived at a time other than the one he\u2019d arranged earlier. Yet it was more than that. She wondered what he was so worried about that he\u2019d actually lost track of the conversation twice.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I make us some tea,\u201d Grace suggested.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>They sat in the kitchen, across the round oak table from each other. \u201cAnything new?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. The pathology report came back and it confirmed that the cancer didn\u2019t spread to my lymph nodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Grace raised both hands to her mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s so great!\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Olivia nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible relief. Now, what about you\u2014anything new at the library?\u201d</p><p>Grace launched into a description of a board meeting she\u2019d attended, and her plans for a Christmas story program for kids. She also mentioned that her new tenant, Faith Beckwith, whom they\u2019d both known in high school, although she\u2019d been Faith Carroll then, had visited the library. Olivia remembered that Will had done the same thing some time ago\u2014and it wasn\u2019t to check out books.</p><p>\u201cMy brother hasn\u2019t made any inappropriate appearances, has he?\u201d As much as Olivia loved Will, if he tried to get between Grace and Cliff again, she\u2019d never forgive him. Will had begun an Internet\u2014what? dalliance? fling? certainly not a relationship\u2014with Grace. And he\u2019d done it while he was still married, telling her he was divorcing his wife. The divorce came later, at his ex-wife\u2019s instigation.</p><p>\u201cWill\u2019s too busy with the art gallery to worry about me.\u201d Looking thoughtful, Grace raised her teacup, elbows on the table. \u201cI have to admit that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>Olivia agreed with her. \u201cHe needs that kind of goal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should keep him out of trouble for a while.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cCliff came by the library this morning with some news,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cGood news, I hope?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged as if to suggest she wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cYou decide. Cliff told me Cal and Vicki are moving to Wyoming to work with a mustang rescue operation.\u201d</p><p>Olivia felt this was both good and bad. Cal had been seriously involved with Linnette McAfee and then broken off the relationship when he fell in love with one of the local vets. From a superficial perspective, it was difficult to understand why a handsome man like Cal Washburn would be attracted to a woman as plain and unassuming as Vicki Newman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In retrospect, of course, it seemed completely logical. Cal and Vicki shared a passion for horses that had brought them together, a passion more intense than his feelings for Linnette.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine how Corrie\u2019s going to react,\u201d Grace said. \u201cRemember how upset she was when she found out Linnette was leaving town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been upset, too.\u201d Olivia sympathized with Corrie.</p><p>\u201cThe reason Linnette left was so she wouldn\u2019t run into Cal. She didn\u2019t want to see him, especially with Vicki,\u201d Grace added.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now Cal leaves the area anyway. Vicki, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look people in the face when you\u2019ve been humiliated,\u201d Grace said quietly. \u201cI know that from experience.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cSo, when are they going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon. It puts Cliff in a difficult position. He\u2019s going to be shorthanded until January, when he can hire someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he be able to manage?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d Grace shrugged and sipped her tea. \u201cWe\u2019d already agreed to house the animals for the live Nativity scene, but Cliff doesn\u2019t seem worried about that. I told him I\u2019d do what I could to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Cal\u2019s leaving before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cApparently Vicki\u2019s sold her share of the practice and they\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Cedar Cove will get a new vet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that way,\u201d Grace said. \u201cFrom what Cliff said, Cal and Vicki are going to California, where Vicki has family, and they\u2019ll be married there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish them the best,\u201d Olivia said. She also wished Linnette hadn\u2019t been hurt, but it was too late to avoid that now.</p> <p>Corrie had told her Linnette was seeing someone in the small North Dakota town where she\u2019d ended up. She seemed to be happy, according to her mother, and Olivia certainly hoped that was the case.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Grace asked suddenly, sitting up straighter and staring at the floor behind Olivia.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d Olivia echoed, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>Grace stood and walked over to the kitchen sink. There, lying on the mat, was a man\u2019s wristwatch. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, picking it up.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pastor Flemming\u2019s lost his watch.\u201d Olivia might not have recognized it if the same thing hadn\u2019t happened earlier.</p><p>\u201cPastor Flemming?\u201d Grace frowned, studying the back of the watch. \u201cThat\u2019s not the name inscribed here. It says, \u2018Micah Evans. June 23, 1977 for Thirty Years of Loyal Service.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah Evans must be some relative,\u201d Olivia speculated. He\u2019d been concerned about losing the watch when it fell off his wrist the first time. It obviously held some emotional significance for him.</p><p>Grace continued to frown. \u201cEvans...Evans,\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cFor some reason, that name sticks in my mind.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t in mine,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019d better call to tell him I have his watch, otherwise he\u2019ll wonder.\u201d He\u2019d behaved oddly and seemed almost sorry that she\u2019d seen it. \u201cThere appears to be something wrong with the clasp.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulled the telephone directory from the kitchen drawer and set it on the counter, opening it to the Fs.</p><p>\u201cAre you calling the church office?\u201d Grace asked as Olivia scanned the listings.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d try his house first,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHe said he\u2019d be out all day. If I contact the church office, he won\u2019t get the message until tomorrow morning, if then. I\u2019ll get in touch with his wife. Let me see. Flemming, D. 8 Sandpiper Way.\u201d</p><p>Olivia punched in the number, and Emily Flemming answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cDave\u2019s gold watch?\u201d she said when Olivia had identified herself and explained why she was calling.</p><p>\u201cYes, it fell off his wrist while he was here visiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The pastor\u2019s wife sounded tearful.</p><p>\u201cI just found it,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cor I would\u2019ve called before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me know,\u201d Emily Flemming whispered. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Olivia hung up the phone with the oddest sensation. \u201cSomething isn\u2019t right between Dave and Emily Flemming,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Intuition, I guess.\u201d She clapped the phone book shut. \u201cBut mark my words, that relationship is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Emily Flemming hung up the phone after her conversation with Judge Griffin and for a long moment didn\u2019t move. She bit her lower lip hard enough to taste her own blood. The news about the lost watch bothered her, but that wasn\u2019t the most upsetting detail.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, she still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d The front door opened and Matthew slammed into the house. \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d he yelled. His backpack slid from his shoulders and fell unceremoniously to the kitchen floor.</p><p>The door opened again as Mark came rushing in. \u201cWhat\u2019s for snack?\u201d he demanded, following Matthew into the kitchen.</p><p>Generally Emily had something ready for her sons as soon as they got home. Heartsick, she\u2019d forgotten.</p><p>She reached for two napkins and the large plastic barrel of pretzels she\u2019d bought earlier in the month at Costco.</p><p>\u201cPretzels,\u201d Mark whined. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause cookies aren\u2019t good for you, stupid,\u201d Matthew muttered.</p><p>When Emily didn\u2019t instantly protest, Mark did. \u201cMom! Matthew called me stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it again,\u201d she said halfheartedly. She set the napkins on the table and poured a pile of pretzels onto each. The juice she gave them was a special treat; it came in small boxes complete with their own straws.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will Dad be home?\u201d Mark asked, then stuffed his mouth full of pretzels.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Matthew wanted to know.</p><p>Emily glanced over at the stove. When the phone rang she\u2019d been assembling a large pan of lasagna. After speaking to Judge Griffin, she\u2019d gotten sidetracked. The sauce had cooled on the stove as she\u2019d stood by the phone, trying to understand what she\u2019d learned. This shouldn\u2019t be happening, and yet it made a weird kind of sense. It wasn\u2019t as if Emily hadn\u2019t suspected Dave had been lying to her. She\u2019d known all along.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Matthew asked her again. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFood, stupid,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call your brother stupid,\u201d she returned automatically.</p><p>\u201cHe called me stupid first.\u201d</p><p>Emily would go slowly insane if she had to listen to this constant bickering. \u201cBoth of you, to your rooms.\u201d She pointed in the direction of the hallway. They had their own bedrooms since the move to Sandpiper Way, which had been one of the many attractions offered by this house.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Matthew shouted. \u201cWe just got home from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your homework!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about study hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do homework then, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sucks!\u201d Mark dragged his feet and his backpack down the hallway. She didn\u2019t bother to reproach him for using a word she hated.</p><p>Emily waited until her sons were well out of earshot. With her mind in turmoil, she walked over to the telephone and called the church office.</p><p>Angel, the secretary, answered right away. \u201cCedar Cove Methodist,\u201d came her well-modulated voice. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Emily,\u201d she said, trying to sound calm, despite the staccato beating of her heart. \u201cIs Dave there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi, Em,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSorry, he\u2019s been out and about all afternoon. You might want to try his cell. He had it with him when he left the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe either has it turned off or the battery\u2019s gone dead.\u201d Emily hoped God would forgive her for that lie.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t reach him then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Emily could hear Angel flipping pages of what she assumed must be Dave\u2019s appointment calendar. \u201cIt says here that he\u2019s supposed to visit Judge Griffin. She\u2019s home from the hospital now, but I guess you already know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Angel made a small humming sound. \u201cFour, according to his calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Emily repeated dully. \u201cFour this afternoon?\u201d The secretary\u2019s words confirmed everything she suspected.</p><p>\u201cYup. That\u2019s what it says,\u201d Angel said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay, thanks.\u201d Emily quickly got off the phone. At first she was too numb to think. Then, marching over to the sink, she looked down at the lasagna noodles she\u2019d cooked. Lasagna was one of Dave\u2019s favorite meals. He\u2019d asked her to make it again soon, and like a gullible, simple-minded wife eager to please her husband, she\u2019d happily complied.</p><p>Four o\u2019clock.</p><p>He\u2019d written down that he\u2019d be visiting Judge Griffin at four this afternoon.</p><p>Yet that very morning, Dave had made a point of telling her he\u2019d be home late this evening. Late because he had an appointment with Olivia Lockhart Griffin at six o\u2019clock. Not only that, he\u2019d apparently gone to see her well before the scheduled time of four.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult for Emily to surmise what he was doing during those unaccounted for hours.</p><p>He was with another woman. Someone he didn\u2019t want her or Angel or anyone in town to know about.</p><p>Why else would her husband, the minister, the pastor of their church, lie to his wife?</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Matthew stood in the kitchen doorway. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cOf course. Why not?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a funny look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d She tried to relax. \u201cHow would you boys like to go out for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Mark joined his brother. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She eyed the sauce cooling on the stove and the pile of grated mozzarella cheese.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Matthew asked when she started running water and turned on the garbage disposal. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I ruined dinner,\u201d she said as she dumped the entire pan of sauce down the disposal. It made a disgusting gurgling noise as it ground up the meat, onions, tomatoes and herbs that had been simmering for hours. She followed that with the mozzarella, then painstakingly fed in the wide noodles.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Mark said loudly. \u201cI really like lasagna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it again soon,\u201d she promised, but just then it gave her a perverse kind of pleasure to discard the whole meal. Despite the waste\u2014and she knew she\u2019d feel guilty later\u2014she needed the angry satisfaction of doing this. \u201cThe three of us are going out to McDonald\u2019s, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dad?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>\u201cHe can fend for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be late,\u201d she informed her sons.</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d both boys chimed.</p><p>\u201cGet your coats.\u201d Emily made an effort to sound excited. She grabbed a tissue to dab her eyes, which had begun to brim with tears.</p><p>This would never do. She squared her shoulders and determined then and there that she wasn\u2019t going to cry. She would hold her head up and give the performance of her life. Her husband had lied. He might well be with another woman this very moment, but Emily would see to it that anyone looking at her, including her sons, would never guess. She refused to act devastated\u2014or worse, humiliated.</p> <p>\u201cHey, boys,\u201d she said, collecting her coat and purse. \u201cWhat would you think of me as a blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your hair?\u201d Matthew asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my hair. I\u2019m going to have it dyed blond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Mark studied her inquisitively.</p><p>\u201cBecause blondes have more fun.\u201d</p> <p>The boys turned to each other and Matthew shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down to the mall to see if Get Nailed can squeeze me in.\u201d On Thursdays the shop was open until eight. With luck one of the stylists had a cancellation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you each a roll of quarters and you can play at the video arcade while I\u2019m in the beauty salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Neither boy seemed enthusiastic, however.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather stay with Mrs. Johnson?\u201d she asked. The woman served as their babysitter on the rare occasions Dave and Emily left their sons for a night out. It\u2019d been weeks since they\u2019d last had a \u201cdate.\u201d No wonder, she thought bitterly. Dave was apparently dating someone else these days, while his wife sat home, cooking lasagna for him and ironing his shirts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather come with you,\u201d Mark said.</p> <p>Emily looked at her oldest son. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Matthew shrugged again. \u201cMe, too, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guess?\u201d she said with a flippant air.</p><p>The boys silently followed her to the garage and slid into the backseat of the SUV. Christmas music was playing on the car radio but none of them sang along the way they usually did. The boys\u2019 mood seemed to reflect hers, and their skepticism was all too apparent. Impulsive spending wasn\u2019t normal behavior for Emily and they knew it. She wanted to reassure them but couldn\u2019t. She felt as if her entire marriage had been a sham.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll check to see if I can get a hair appointment first,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mark murmured.</p><p>They stopped at Kitsap Bank for quarters, then drove to the mall. Everyone at Get Nailed was busy and Emily had to wait at the counter for several minutes before the receptionist reappeared.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering...\u201d Suddenly she wasn\u2019t so certain anymore. Her anger, which had kept her determination alive, had begun to dissipate and she felt deflated.</p> <p>\u201cI realize it\u2019s last-minute and everything, but is there anyone available to color my hair this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>The young woman checked the appointment book. \u201cRachel had a cancellation earlier. I can ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d Emily took this as a sign. \u201cPlease check. It would be great if she could fit me in.\u201d</p><p>The receptionist returned a moment later. \u201cShe said that would work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d</p><p>Emily handed each of her sons a roll of quarters, with instructions to make the money last until her hair was done. They tore off for the video arcade across from the salon as the receptionist led her to Rachel\u2019s station. Fortunately Emily could keep an eye on them from her chair.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rachel,\u201d a dark-haired woman introduced herself, draping a plastic cape around Emily\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cEmily Flemming,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t met before. Teri did my previous cut\u2014\u201d she frowned \u201c\u2014sometime this summer.\u201d</p><p>Rachel ran her fingers through Emily\u2019s hair. \u201cSo you want to be a blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I hear they live life to the fullest and that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do.\u201d It was a flimsy reason, at best, and a silly one at worst, but at this point Emily didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Soon she was at the shampoo bowl and her hair was lathered and rinsed twice. While the water sprayed her hair, Emily closed her eyes, trying not to think but unable to stop the thoughts from tramping through her brain, one after the other.</p><p>It didn\u2019t hit her until the coloring process was underway that she\u2019d forgotten a crucial part of the conversation with Judge Griffin.</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t own a gold watch.</p><p>At least not one that she knew about. Since it was unlikely he\u2019d purchased it for himself, that left only one other option. Someone else had given it to him.</p><p>A woman.</p><p>Fine, she decided furiously. She\u2019d ask him about it. She was through letting her husband ruin their lives. Through with pretending nothing was wrong. Through with turning the other cheek. The pride, the pretense of indifference, was for public consumption. But Dave\u2014she was going to confront him with the truth. Demand answers. Then she\u2019d figure out what to do next.</p><p>When Rachel was finished, Emily barely recognized herself. Her straight dark hair was gone, replaced with a shorter, more stylish do. She was blond, all right. Very blond.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good color for you,\u201d Rachel was saying. \u201cI was a little concerned when you wanted to go this light, but I have to admit it looks really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Emily swallowed hard. The style and color were certainly...different. Eventually she\u2019d get accustomed to this new look and so would everyone else. And when it grew out, she could always revert to her natural color. Depending on how she felt at the time....</p><p>She paid the bill, wincing at the cost. Well, one extravagance wasn\u2019t going to ruin them. Dave would just have to live with it. She suspected he didn\u2019t have any qualms about spending money, even if it wasn\u2019t on her or the boys. In fact, she planned to check his credit card statements at the first opportunity, an idea her mother had suggested and she\u2019d initially rejected.</p><p>Matthew and Mark stood outside Get Nailed, waiting for her as she left the salon. Neither said a word.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked them, patting the side of her head. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, um, different,\u201d Matthew ventured.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Emily turned to Mark for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like my mom anymore,\u201d her younger son declared.</p><p>\u201cBut I am your mom. Now let\u2019s go have dinner. I bet you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>Matthew and Mark wolfed down their hamburgers and fries and then chased each other around the play area. Emily couldn\u2019t eat. Her stomach was in knots. She\u2019d ordered a burger but after a single bite set it aside.</p><p>When they returned to the house, she saw Dave\u2019s car in the garage. She wasn\u2019t ready to see him yet, but as soon as she\u2019d pulled in beside his car, he opened the door from the kitchen and stepped out.</p><p>The boys leaped from the backseat and ran toward their father. Dave hugged each of his sons in turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? You didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly and a shocked look came over him. His head reared back as he stared at her. \u201cWhat on earth did you do to your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom colored it,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She kept her voice casual as she entered the house. \u201cYou asked me where I was and the answer should be obvious. I was at the hairdresser\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom took us to McDonald\u2019s for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to your rooms now, boys,\u201d Dave said curtly. \u201cIt\u2019s time for your homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Dad,\u201d Mark whined as Matthew groaned. \u201cBut we just got home!\u201d One look from Dave quelled their protest.</p><p>Sensing that it was probably best to do as they\u2019d been told, Matthew and Mark moved sluggishly toward their bedrooms. Emily walked to the far side of the kitchen with Dave on her heels.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you change your hair?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d she fired back. Leaning against the kitchen counter, she glared at him.</p><p>\u201cLie? About what?\u201d he asked with an innocence she found a little too practiced.</p><p>She whirled around. \u201cYou told me you were visiting Judge Griffin, and you implied it was this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d He raised his voice in defiance.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, Judge Griffin phoned the house. Apparently you left your gold watch there when you went to visit early this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>His reaction was immediate. She saw the alarm flash in his eyes. She didn\u2019t know why it surprised her.</p><p>\u201cYou have a gold watch? This is news to me. Exactly where did you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, it\u2019s not the way it sounds.\u201d He sat down at the table, rubbing his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me there\u2019s no other woman in your life, Dave? Because if you do, that\u2019ll just be another lie.\u201d</p><p>The expression on his face was one of horror. \u201cHow can you even suggest such a thing? There\u2019s never been anyone but you. Never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as naive as you seem to think,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cBelieve what you want, Emily, but there\u2019s no one else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I suppose that same no one is responsible for the gold watch you had on?\u201d</p><p>His hand went to his left wrist. \u201cDoes Olivia have it?\u201d</p><p>The concern in his voice cut her to the quick. \u201cShe does, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>With that, she walked out of the kitchen and into their bedroom, closing the door with a resounding bang\u2014a clear signal to her husband not to follow.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Rachel Pendergast\u2019s schedule at Get Nailed was booked for the entire month of December. It seemed that every woman in Cedar Cove\u2014and some of the men\u2014had decided to cut, restyle, perm or color their hair.</p><p>She got to work early each morning and often stayed late. Bruce, her fianc\u00e9, and his daughter, Jolene, both complained that they missed her, but for the time being that couldn\u2019t be helped. The extra money she earned would go toward their February wedding.</p><p>The buzzer on the dryer went, and Rachel folded a load of towels. When she\u2019d put away the last one, she saw that it was already nine-fifteen. The mall had closed at nine. Earlier Bruce had phoned to say he\u2019d take her to dinner, and while she appreciated the thought, all Rachel wanted to do was put her feet up and relax.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished here,\u201d she told Jane on her way out the door. Jane usually stayed the longest, since she and her husband owned Get Nailed.</p><p>With the mall closed, the hallway leading to the exit was semidark and deserted. The dim light wouldn\u2019t have bothered her as little as two months ago, but everything had changed the night she was kidnapped.</p><p>Being abducted by two thugs had been the most frightening experience of her life. The bizarre thing was that they\u2019d gotten the wrong woman. The kidnappers assumed they had Teri Polgar because Rachel was in the limo driven by James Wilbur. Teri hadn\u2019t been ready to leave and had offered Rachel a ride. When the kidnappers discovered that, the terror level had escalated by several incalculable degrees. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a short while Rachel had been convinced they were going to kill her and James and dump their bodies somewhere. They spoke in a language she didn\u2019t understand\u2014Russian, she\u2019d later learned\u2014and frankly, she was grateful for her lack of comprehension. She was terrified enough.</p><p>Knowing she might be dead within a few hours, Rachel analyzed her life. Well, not analysis exactly; more like an instantaneous assessment. Oddly, she remembered thinking she hadn\u2019t made her bed that morning because she was running late. The one time she\u2019d left her bed unmade! After her body was found, or her disappearance noticed, all those deputies would traipse through her bedroom and figure she was a slob.</p><p>With that rather trivial concern established, her mind had immediately shifted from the mundane to the momentous. All at once it came to her that she might never see Bruce Peyton or his twelve-year-old daughter, Jolene, again. That was when she knew with complete certainty that she loved Bruce. At the time she\u2019d been practically engaged to Nate Olsen, a navy chief. Only it wasn\u2019t Nate who flashed into her mind. Suddenly it became crucial to stay alive. She needed to tell Bruce she loved him. She wanted to be Jolene\u2019s stepmother and have other children with him and spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>Once they\u2019d admitted their love, everything had fallen swiftly into place. When they\u2019d discussed a wedding date, Jolene, with a young girl\u2019s sense of the romantic, had chosen Valentine\u2019s Day.</p> <p>Rachel wasn\u2019t sure she could get everything organized by then and favored a spring wedding, but Bruce insisted they should be married and living as husband and wife before the end of the year.</p><p>So Jolene was campaigning for February, Bruce said December and Rachel wanted April. In a spirit of compromise Rachel and Bruce agreed on Valentine\u2019s Day. Jolene felt vindicated.</p><p>Lately, however, two and a half months seemed too far away. Rachel was ready to be Bruce\u2019s wife and Jolene\u2019s full-time mother. Now.</p><p>A shadow moved and Rachel automatically tensed. She quickly realized the movement came from a security guard rounding the corner. Exhaling sharply, she walked toward the exit at a faster pace.</p><p>Bruce stood waiting for her at the outside entrance, pacing back and forth. When he saw her approach, he smiled\u2014a slow, easy smile that crinkled the corners of his blue eyes and heightened the appeal of his all-American good looks.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re later than you said you\u2019d be,\u201d he told her when she stepped into the cold night air, the mall door swinging shut behind her. The lights in the parking lot shone with a steady, reassuring glow. \u201cI was getting worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Rachel hated the thought of him waiting in the cold. She\u2019d told him she could make her own way home, but Bruce came for her as often as he could, intent on making sure she got to her car safely. The kidnapping had frightened him as much as it had her. She\u2019d suggested he come inside the mall to wait, but he declined, preferring to sit in his car and listen to the radio until Rachel finished work.</p><p>Rachel cupped her warm hands over his cold ears and reached up to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d he whispered. He brought her close and clung to her for a moment before reluctantly letting her go.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too,\u201d he murmured, taking her hand. \u201cHow much longer are you going to be working these late nights?\u201d</p> <p>Rachel knew he\u2019d rather she spent the evenings with him and Jolene, but this time of year was just too hectic.</p><p>\u201cAfter Christmas everything slows down,\u201d she said. She assured him of this at least once a day.</p><p>Bruce tucked her arm in his and they walked to her car. It was silly for him to come at all, and yet she appreciated his vigilance. Eventually he would believe she was safe. Eventually she\u2019d feel safe again, too. The trauma of the kidnapping would stay with them both, but the possibility of anything like that happening again was remote at best.</p><p>\u201cChristmas.\u201d Bruce gave a disgruntled sigh.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bah-humbug me, Bruce Peyton. I love Christmas and Jolene does, too.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why women are so crazy about holidays. Especially Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary that you understand.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve had quite an influence on my daughter. She said almost the identical thing to me.\u201d</p> <p>Jolene and Rachel had shared a special relationship for years. Because she\u2019d grown up without a mother, too, Rachel recognized the girl\u2019s need for a close connection with an adult friend who could occasionally act as a maternal figure. She\u2019d willingly stepped into that role when Jolene was in first grade, six years ago.</p><p>Rachel slipped her arm around Bruce\u2019s waist and leaned against him.</p><p>\u201cHave you had anything to eat since lunch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>At his question Rachel realized how hungry she was and her stomach growled in response. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Taco House is in business now,\u201d he said. The restaurant, formerly The Taco Shack, had reopened earlier that week, and long lines had been reported. Rachel was eager to try it, but not late on a Friday night when she\u2019d been on her feet most of the day.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I\u2019m too tired. Maybe next week?\u201d She\u2019d read in the Chronicle that the new restaurant was owned by the same couple who\u2019d run The Taco Shack, which had been one of their favorite places to eat. When it closed, Rachel had been extremely disappointed. It had seemed to echo the end of her relationship with Bruce, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do about dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of chicken pot pies in my freezer. I\u2019ll pop them in the microwave,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat way I can relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay long,\u201d Bruce said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jolene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoller skating with her friends. She has a ten-thirty curfew tonight, and Carrie\u2019s mom is driving her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that gives us about an hour.\u201d</p><p>They grinned at each other.</p><p>Rachel got into her car and Bruce waited until she\u2019d locked the door. Then he sprinted over to his own. He followed her home, arriving at almost the same time she did.</p><p>Opening her front door, Rachel collected the mail and the paper and set everything on the kitchen counter. She hung up her coat and Bruce\u2019s.</p><p>He turned on the television. As was his custom he made himself at home, slumping on her sofa with his legs stretched out. He flicked through channels with the remote control, stopping occasionally at a talk show or newscast.</p><p>Bruce wasn\u2019t romantic; he didn\u2019t shower her with words of love. But Rachel knew how deeply he loved her. She didn\u2019t doubt the sincerity of his feelings. Not for a minute. Not for even a second.</p><p>While the pies heated in the microwave, she sorted through the mail, which included a number of Christmas cards and, as always, bills. She hesitated when she saw the San Diego return address on a square red envelope. Even though there wasn\u2019t a name, the APO address instantly told her who the card was from.</p><p>Nate Olsen.</p><p>They\u2019d dated for about three years. He was the navy man she\u2019d met through the Dog and Bachelor Auction sponsored by the local humane society. For a while she thought she was in love with him, and he with her, until she discovered that Nate was more interested in how a relationship with her could advance his political career. He was from a wealthy, well-connected family, and marriage to an \u201cordinary\u201d woman like her would heighten his appeal to the voters.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Bruce asked as he came into the kitchen.</p><p>She considered hiding the fact that Nate had contacted her, but decided against it. Their relationship had to be open and honest from the very beginning.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Nate sent me a Christmas card.\u201d</p><p>Bruce\u2019s gaze held hers, although he didn\u2019t reveal his thoughts. \u201cAre you going to open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Bruce didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWould you rather I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as if it were of little concern. \u201cMight as well read it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. \u201cA small display of jealousy wouldn\u2019t be amiss, you know.\u201d</p><p>Bruce sent her a lopsided grin. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing my engagement ring, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d he said with unwavering confidence.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t disagree.</p><p>\u201cYou had your chance to marry Nate. As I recall, I actually encouraged you to accept his proposal. He certainly had more to offer you than I ever will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as you recall, that infuriated me.\u201d It still did. What Bruce had to offer her was a love as unconditional as another person\u2019s love could be.</p><p>His grin widened. \u201cYou love me,\u201d he said again, \u201cand that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d</p><p>Playfully Rachel wagged her index finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure of yourself, Bruce Peyton. It\u2019s a woman\u2019s prerogative to change her mind.\u201d</p><p>Bruce got a soda cracker from the box on the counter behind her and bit into it. \u201cYou won\u2019t. Or you would\u2019ve already done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She carefully slit the red envelope. Sliding out the glittery Christmas card, she opened it so Bruce couldn\u2019t see what Nate had written. She lingered over each word.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he asked after a long moment.</p><p>Purposely she closed the card and set it aside.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Bruce asked, following her to the microwave.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you feel like telling me.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cNate said he\u2019ll always love me and that losing me has been the turning point in his life. He begged me to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Bruce put down the soda cracker and his eyes darkened.</p><p>The timer buzzed; Rachel removed the pies. \u201cYou can read it for yourself if you want,\u201d she said as she retrieved two plates from the kitchen cupboard.</p><p>Bruce declined with a shake of his head. \u201cHe addressed it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you permission to look at it.\u201d</p><p>Again, he declined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so cocky now, are you?\u201d she teased, bringing the plates to the small kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying me,\u201d he stated flatly, but he didn\u2019t sound as confident as he had earlier.</p><p>She derived a small degree of satisfaction from the way his arrogance had suddenly diminished. But she\u2019d made her choice and, in her heart, she knew it was the right one. Her future was with Bruce and Jolene and whatever children they might have.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she said as they sat down. She purposely changed the subject. \u201cI\u2019d like to get pregnant soon.\u201d</p><p>He blinked hard. \u201cHow soon? Tonight? I\u2019m certainly willing but you\u2019re the one who says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d His gaze traveled back to the Christmas card, which still lay on the kitchen counter.</p><p>Rachel stood and handed the card to Bruce, who took it with some reluctance.</p><p>He opened it slowly, read the two short lines. When he finished he raised his eyes to hers. \u201cAll he says is Merry Christmas, Nate.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s all that garbage about him never loving another woman?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid I say that?\u201d she asked with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not in those precise words, but basically, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to read between the lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll he said was Merry Christmas,\u201d Bruce pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes, that\u2019s what he wrote, but you and I both know he meant a whole lot more than that.

After a moment, he asked, \u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted at the uncertainty in his eyes. She couldn\u2019t continue to tease him. \u201cNate is out of my life. I\u2019m madly, senselessly in love with you, Bruce.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear it once in a while, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, and about this she was serious. While her fianc\u00e9 might not be a man of eloquent words, it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he expressed his feelings now and then.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I tell you how much I love you every day for the rest of our lives?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould that be enough?\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled. \u201cThat would definitely be a good place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow about starting something else\u2014our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d This was a subject Rachel could get excited about.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>\u201cYou were right about the knitting.\u201d</p><p>The young female voice seemed to come out of nowhere. Startled, Faith Beckwith looked up from the pattern book she was studying. She sat at a table in The Quilted Giraffe, searching for a knitting project, only to find Troy\u2019s daughter, Megan, staring down at her.</p><p>\u201cMegan.\u201d She hoped the shock didn\u2019t show in her eyes. It took her an instant to get past the fact that this was Troy\u2019s daughter. Despite her intentions, forgetting about him was a futile effort. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally good,\u201d Megan said, then lowered her voice. \u201cThis pregnancy feels so different from my first one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it,\u201d Faith murmured, genuinely happy for Troy\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone about the baby. Except Craig. I had to tell my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d Faith was relieved to hear that. She hated the thought of Megan keeping this pregnancy to herself.</p><p>\u201cMy dad and my in-laws don\u2019t know yet.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to tell my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t you?\u201d Faith asked. Troy would make a wonderful grandfather.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really close,\u201d Megan went on to say. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to worry unnecessarily.\u201d She smiled slightly smile as she pulled out a chair and sat next to Faith. \u201cI have a good feeling, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know when the time\u2019s right to tell your father and your in-laws,\u201d Faith said without meeting her gaze. It felt odd to speak about Troy in such an abstract way. She noticed, however, that Megan looked healthy. Color showed in her cheeks and her eyes were clear and bright.</p><p>\u201cI was glad when I saw you here,\u201d Megan said as she set her gigantic purse on the table. \u201cYou were so helpful the day I went to the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was my first day on the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding!\u201d</p><p>Faith laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cI felt like you were there just for me. I was feeling so emotional. You calmed me down, and after we talked, I felt...a real sense of hope.\u201d</p><p>Faith was grateful for those kind words.</p><p>\u201cBut it was more than that,\u201d Megan continued. \u201cYou said knitting would be good for me. You were right. Every time I feel anxious about the baby, I pick up my needles and I remember what you said. It\u2019s almost as if...\u201d She hesitated again. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get the wrong impression or anything, but you said exactly what I would\u2019ve wanted my mother to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your mother would have been just as reassuring if she was with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her every single day,\u201d Megan said. She sniffled loudly. Obviously embarrassed, she searched inside her purse for a tissue. \u201cMy hormones are so out of whack these days, I burst into tears at the drop of a hat.\u201d She tried to laugh and only half succeeded.</p><p>\u201cI was like that when I was pregnant,\u201d Faith told her. \u201cI can remember watching a rerun of the old Mary Tyler Moore show, the one where Chuckles the Clown dies. Even though it\u2019s a comedy, I was bawling my head off and then all of a sudden I was laughing and crying at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked The Mary Tyler Moore Show?\u201d Megan asked, her eyes wide. \u201cMy mother and I used to watch it at the care facility. I know exactly which episode you\u2019re talking about. That was Mom\u2019s very favorite show.\u201d</p><p>Then, as if she\u2019d suddenly remembered why she was at the fabric store, Megan reached inside her purse and brought out her knitting. \u201cI came here hoping I could find someone to help me with this.\u201d She set her yarn and needles on the table.</p><p>Faith saw immediately that Megan had stopped knitting in the middle of a row, never a good idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I dropped a stitch and I didn\u2019t know what to do next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you with that,\u201d Faith murmured, looking at the half-completed baby blanket.</p><p>Retrieving a crochet hook from her own knitting bag, Faith captured the renegade stitch and wove it into place. Then she slipped it back on the needle. \u201cThere,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cNow you can finish the row. You saw how I did that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cI should probably buy a crochet hook, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an excellent tool to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it today. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Faith glanced down at the pattern book and tried not to think about Troy and how much she missed him.</p><p>\u201cWould you...I mean...\u201d Megan looked uncertain. \u201cI realize you\u2019re working at the clinic and you don\u2019t really know me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Faith prompted.</p><p>\u201cWould it be all right if I came to see you sometime? Not as a patient, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean as a friend?\u201d Faith asked.</p><p>Megan nodded eagerly. \u201cLike on your coffee break or maybe even for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Faith was in a quandary. If Troy learned about their friendship, he\u2019d assume she\u2019d somehow arranged this because of him. He\u2019d assume she was trying to reconnect with him through his daughter and nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>\u201cWould it be improper?\u201d Megan asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cNot...improper,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could meet outside the clinic,\u201d Megan suggested, as if she\u2019d stumbled upon the perfect solution.</p><p>\u201cWe could meet here at the store, I suppose,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you with your knitting. This blanket\u2019s an excellent project but I could also show you how to knit booties and a hat for the baby to wear home from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...could,\u201d Faith told her. \u201cI have a pattern I use whenever there\u2019s a new baby in the family. We could meet right here at the table they have for classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! Thank you, Faith.\u201d Megan paused, a look of concern in her eyes. \u201cIs it okay if I call you Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Faith is just fine.\u201d</p><p>They set a date for the following week and Faith wondered\u2014fearing for her own peace of mind\u2014if this was such a smart idea. She hadn\u2019t meant to get involved with Troy\u2019s daughter. Yet, at the same time, Megan was emotionally needy, especially with this second pregnancy so soon after losing the first.</p><p>Still, Troy might think\u2014</p><p>No. She would not allow Troy Davis into her mind. It was over. If she became friends with Megan, it would have nothing to do with Troy. Megan was her own woman. So was Faith.</p><p>When she returned home from the fabric store, Faith made a pot of tea, then sat down in her living room. She\u2019d found a lovely natural-fiber yarn in earth tones and had decided to knit a sample afghan. Eager to start the project, she picked up her needles and the new yarn and was about to cast on stitches when the doorbell rang.</p><p>Although it was only a little past four in the afternoon, the day had already grown dark. Faith turned on her porch light and checked the peephole in the door.</p><p>And then she saw him.</p><p>Troy Davis.</p><p>No doubt he\u2019d heard about Megan and Faith meeting and felt he needed to wade right in, making unwarranted assumptions and judgments. If that was the case, and it probably was, Faith didn\u2019t intend to listen. She didn\u2019t require his permission to see Megan.</p><p>With reluctance she unlocked the door and opened it. She\u2019d hung an evergreen wreath on the outside, and the scent, with its memories of childhood Christmases, wafted into the room.</p><p>Still in uniform, Troy stood there, his hat in hand. \u201cHello, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy.\u201d She nodded, keeping her voice level and cool.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk for a few minutes?\u201d he asked when she didn\u2019t immediately open the door.</p><p>Without smiling, she unlatched the screen door and he came inside.</p><p>She noticed that he\u2019d lost a few pounds since she\u2019d last seen him almost two weeks ago and wondered briefly if he\u2019d been ill. Worried despite her own resolve, she watched him closely\u2014as if she were starved for the very sight of him, she thought with disgust.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to care about Troy Davis. Didn\u2019t want to feel even a flicker of emotion. Letting him back into her life would only bring more pain. He\u2019d proved that.</p><p>Troy entered the living room. \u201cWould it be all right if I sat down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Faith nodded. Her lack of welcome and warmth went against the grain, but she was protecting herself. She had no choice.</p><p>She sat down again in the overstuffed chair that was her favorite and Troy took the one across from her. He sat on the edge of the cushion, hat still in his hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak for an interminable moment. \u201cYou\u2019re looking well,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she returned stiffly. She had to bite her tongue to keep from bragging how well she really was and how nicely she\u2019d gotten along without him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was thinking...\u201d</p><p>Faith reached for her knitting needles, needing something to occupy her hands.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking, actually I was hoping, you might be free for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Faith set the needles in her lap and raised her eyebrows. \u201cI beg your pardon? Did you just ask me to dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Cedar Cove has several good restaurants and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you, Troy Davis.\u201d</p><p>He blanched.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you wrong two months ago, not to mention last week? Did I somehow misconstrue your words or intentions?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Troy frowned uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, you said it would be best if we no longer saw each other. That\u2019s the way I remember it, so correct me if I misunderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did say that,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut at the time I didn\u2019t have any idea how difficult that would be. I love you, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she said flatly, unwilling to fall under his spell yet again.</p> <p>His head snapped back as if she\u2019d struck him.</p><p>\u201cIf you loved me,\u201d she continued in a cold voice, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have been so quick to break my heart. You have a habit of doing that, Troy, and I\u2019m through. This was the last time.\u201d She picked up her knitting again, avoiding his eyes. \u201cAs for your dinner invitation\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow her to finish. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Faith.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d missed him, too, more than she wanted to admit, but that didn\u2019t change what he\u2019d said\u2014that he could no longer see her. She recognized how concerned he was about his daughter, and she sympathized, especially now that she\u2019d met Megan. She would\u2019ve understood if he\u2019d asked for her patience. Instead he\u2019d cut her out of his life. Just like that. If she hadn\u2019t pressured him, he wouldn\u2019t even have given her a reason. Oh, no. She was done with Troy Davis.</p><p>\u201cNot a day passes that I don\u2019t think about you,\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>She refused to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhenever I drive past your house, I call myself every kind of fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a few other names I could add to your vocabulary.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t meant it as a joke, but he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suppose you could.\u201d</p><p>Her hands tightened around the knitting needles.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s taken me this long to find the courage to come to your door. It isn\u2019t dinner I\u2019m asking for, Faith. What I really want...is a second chance.\u201d</p><p>She pinched her lips together. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a third chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou broke my heart when I was a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Faith, not that again. You broke mine, too, and if you\u2019re blaming me for that, then you\u2019re way off base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother lied to me,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed her! You didn\u2019t even talk to me. You took her at her word and went about your merry way and met Sandy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou met Carl and married him quickly enough.\u201d Anger flared in his eyes.</p><p>There was no point in arguing. They were at a standstill, neither of them willing to budge.</p><p>\u201cThat was years ago,\u201d Troy said after a tense moment. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, it was unfortunate, but it happened. We both went on with our lives and found other people. You married a good man and I married a woman I loved. We both had families. Everything turned out the way it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>He made it all sound so reasonable. Troy didn\u2019t know how many nights she\u2019d cried herself to sleep back in college, wondering why he\u2019d dumped her\u2014why he\u2019d been so cruel. Yes, she\u2019d met and married Carl but getting over Troy hadn\u2019t been easy. She\u2019d genuinely loved him then\u2014and she genuinely loved him now.</p><p>\u201cFate brought us back together,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you blew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, and I apologize,\u201d he said without hesitation.</p><p>At least he admitted that much.</p><p>\u201cI assumed Megan wouldn\u2019t accept another woman in my life,\u201d he explained, \u201cespecially so soon after Sandy\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Faith was curious as to whether Megan had mentioned her. Since she\u2019d kept her pregnancy a secret from her father and in-laws, Faith suspected she hadn\u2019t said anything about their recent friendship, either.</p><p>\u201cMegan\u2019s my only child and I love her, but I have my own life.\u201d He paused, then added in a soft, coaxing voice, \u201cRight now my life feels very empty without you.\u201d</p><p>Faith could feel herself weakening.</p><p>\u201cShall we try again?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>Despite her stubborn insistence that they were through, she wavered. He watched her, waiting, his expression hopeful. Faith forced herself to look away. \u201cI need to think about it.\u201d She paused. \u201cAre you sure this time, Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Faith wanted to trust him but was afraid to. She knew she couldn\u2019t tolerate another rejection, another betrayal. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to make that decision yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>For a fleeting moment Troy seemed disappointed. But his demeanor quickly changed, becoming more businesslike. \u201cFair enough.\u201d He stared down at his hat as if carefully considering his next statement. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Once you\u2019ve made your decision, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t trouble you again, Faith.\u201d He stood, walking toward the front door. \u201cNo need to show me out.\u201d</p><p>Nevertheless she got up and accompanied him.</p><p>Troy\u2019s posture was stiff and straight. She knew he\u2019d stand by his word; he wouldn\u2019t contact her again.</p><p>The next move, if there was one, would have to come from her.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Justine Gunderson could hardly wait to see her mother. She called Olivia once or twice a day, but hadn\u2019t been able to visit since Wednesday. She wanted to continue their ongoing conversation about her new restuarant, a conversation that brought great pleasure to them both. The Victorian Tea Room was now under construction and Olivia\u2019s suggestions had made all the difference.</p><p>Her mother seemed to be recovering from the surgery well, with her chemotherapy scheduled to begin in early January. \u201cWhat a way to start the new year!\u201d she\u2019d joked and they\u2019d both laughed. After all, there wasn\u2019t anything to do but laugh\u2014laugh and endure.</p><p>Justine finished her Saturday-morning errands: the dry cleaners, then the library and finally the grocery store to buy powdered sugar for the gingerbread house she was making with Leif that afternoon. Throwing everything in the car, she hurried to her mother\u2019s place on Lighthouse Road.</p><p>She parked in front of the house and bounded up the porch steps. After knocking once, loudly, she opened the door. \u201cMom? Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d her mother called from the bedroom.</p><p>Justine ventured down the hall. It was unusual for her mother to still be in bed on a Saturday morning. Justine knew the surgery and anesthetic had taken their toll on her energy, but despite that, she couldn\u2019t help feeling a little shocked. Olivia was a lifelong early riser, and this was just so...uncharacteristic.</p><p>As she entered the darkened room, she found her mother sitting on the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cCould you hand me my housecoat?\u201d she asked groggily.</p><p>Justine did. \u201cShall I open the drapes for you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As she let in the day\u2019s weak light, she asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared up at her. \u201cOh...He\u2019s writing a sports piece on youth soccer in Kitsap County,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis was the only time he could get the interview.\u201d Her mother stood and tied the sash to her housecoat. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back any minute.\u201d Blinking, she asked, \u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen-fifteen.\u201d</p><p>Olivia rubbed her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I slept this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously needed it. Shall I make us a pot of tea?\u201d</p><p>Yawning, Olivia nodded. \u201cThank you, dear.\u201d</p><p>Justine loved this old house, especially the kitchen. She knew it as well as she did her own. She moved confidently from stove to cupboard, putting on water to boil, setting out her favorite white ceramic teapot, choosing peppermint tea bags. She figured it was better for both of them at this point than the strong Irish Breakfast they tended to prefer.</p><p>\u201cIs Leif at home?\u201d her mother asked, joining her ten minutes later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s visiting his other grandparents with his daddy.\u201d Justine had already set two cups and saucers on the kitchen table. She poured the hot tea, breathing in the fresh, minty aroma, as Olivia settled in her chair. She was still in her flannel pajamas with their snowflake pattern and her red fleece housecoat, a get-well gift from Grace Harding.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you, Justine,\u201d her mother said, smiling over at her.</p><p>\u201cYou, too, Mom. I meant to stop by yesterday afternoon, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t mean to imply that you should\u2019ve been here. We talk every day.\u201d</p><p>Her relationship with her mother was on solid ground. It hadn\u2019t always been, and Justine didn\u2019t want to do anything to impede the progress they\u2019d made since she married Seth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling well?\u201d her mother asked, looking pointedly at Justine\u2019s stomach.</p><p>\u201cFabulous. A hundred years ago, I probably would\u2019ve been one of those women who gave birth every year or two. I\u2019m perfectly healthy and I love being pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled. \u201cI loved it, too. With you and your brother...\u201d She hesitated as she sometimes did when referring to Jordan. Pain shadowed her eyes for a moment, but if she hadn\u2019t known her mother so well, Justine might have missed it. She felt that sense of loss, too. Loss for the twin brother who\u2019d died the summer they were thirteen.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I might have twins?\u201d Justine asked. She and Seth had been wondering about it; she supposed the coming ultrasound would give them a definite answer.</p><p>\u201cThey do run in the family.\u201d Her mother smiled again, clearly pleased by the thought.</p><p>\u201cGrandmother had twin brothers, right?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. Her two grand-uncles were both gone now, but Charlotte had an album full of pictures.</p><p>\u201cJustine, do you feel as if you\u2019re carrying twins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cAnyway, Mom, I wanted to tell you what\u2019s happening at the Tea Room.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sat up straighter. \u201cOkay, fill me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve decided to paint the outside a lovely shade of pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPink,\u201d Olivia repeated. \u201cPink,\u201d she said again, frowning as though she hadn\u2019t heard correctly.</p><p>Justine grinned at her mother\u2019s expression. \u201cYour reaction is the same as Seth\u2019s when I told him.\u201d He hadn\u2019t tried to dissuade her but she could tell he found her choice odd. Justine was very sure about the color, though. She\u2019d gone over every detail at least a dozen times.</p><p>She was at the site every day, discussing the project with her builder. So many decisions had to be made daily that it was prudent and sensible to check in with the construction crew. After every visit she felt more excited about the new restaurant and what it would mean to the Cedar Cove community, especially the women. They\u2019d adore going out to lunch. It would be a special place to meet that catered to them specifically.</p><p>\u201cThe Tea Room\u2019s going to be a destination restaurant,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be pink as a flamingo,\u201d her mother teased, \u201cwhich should make it easy to find.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, pink as in dusty rose.\u201d Feeling almost giddy, Justine laughed and her mother joined in. It took Justine a moment to realize that her mother\u2019s laughter sounded forced.</p><p>She wanted to ask if anything was wrong, but didn\u2019t. If her mother and Jack had quarreled, Justine had no intention of prying. Anything Olivia meant to share, she\u2019d tell Justine without prodding.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired,\u201d Olivia said weakly, sipping her tea.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go back to bed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I should. In a few minutes.\u201d She finished her tea and reached for the white pot. It shook precariously in her hand.</p><p>\u201cHere, Mom.\u201d Justine quickly took the teapot away from her. \u201cLet me do that.\u201d Her mother\u2019s frail condition after the surgery worried her. She looked dreadful, something Justine hadn\u2019t wanted to admit earlier. Her skin was flushed and she shifted uncomfortably in her chair.</p><p>\u201cIs your grandmother done with the recipes?\u201d Olivia asked, diverting Justine\u2019s interest.</p><p>\u201cAlmost. Oh, Mom, you won\u2019t believe what a fabulous job Grandma\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded, smiling. \u201cI knew she would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s been collecting recipes for weeks.\u201d All Justine had asked for was a few of Charlotte\u2019s special recipes, but her grandmother had gone far beyond her expectations.</p><p>\u201cGrandma\u2019s determined to finish organizing everything before she and Ben leave on their Christmas cruise in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has quite a few, then?\u201d Her mother\u2019s hand trembled as she lifted her cup.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say a couple of hundred. Mom, you\u2019ve just got to see it. Ben typed everything into the computer for her. Then Grandma read over each of the recipes and added special touches and little anecdotes. She made me my very own family cookbook. She even included recipes from friends like Grace and Corrie McAfee and Peggy Beldon. All her holiday dishes are there, too. But the best part is the little notes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cWell, for instance, on her recipe for cinnamon rolls, she says that if she\u2019s baking them for Jack to leave out the raisins.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother nodded.</p><p>\u201cGrandma thought it was funny that Jack would hate raisins since he likes grapes.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes softened. \u201cHe likes plums, too, but not prunes, you know.\u201d</p><p>Justine thought they should avoid any further comment on Jack\u2019s dislike of dried fruit. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she went on, \u201cGrandma has all kinds of hints, plus she explains where she got some of the recipes. Remember all those wakes she attended over the years?\u201d Justine and Olivia shared a complicit grin. \u201cMom, the cookbook\u2019s a real treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your grandmother,\u201d Olivia murmured. \u201cWhen she sets her mind on something, there\u2019s no holding her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful gift she could\u2019ve given me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s favorite cookies were gingerbread.\u201d Her mother seemed lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJordan. Only he didn\u2019t want me to bake them in the shape of little men. He was far too cool for that. So I made them round like every other cookie.\u201d</p><p>Justine didn\u2019t remember that.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to bake them for him.\u201d</p><p>They seldom talked about Jordan\u2019s youth. Even now, after more than twenty years, it was simply too painful. The fact that her mother was talking about his favorite cookies was decidedly odd.</p><p>\u201cJordan wanted you to bake cookies? When?\u201d He\u2019d died in August and it was unlikely that their mother would\u2019ve been baking cookies on one of the hottest days of the summer.</p><p>Olivia threw Justine a puzzled look. \u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>Justine froze. When she spoke, she kept her voice soft. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have talked to Jordan this morning, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at her blankly and then, seemingly embarrassed, shook her head. \u201cOf course it wasn\u2019t this morning. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking. Jordan can\u2019t ask me to bake cookies, can he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, he can\u2019t.\u201d Alarmed, Justine studied her mother carefully. Her eyes were far too bright, and they glittered with fever.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so thirsty,\u201d Olivia said. She picked up her cup and this time her hand shook uncontrollably. Tea splashed over the sides before the cup fell from her fingers and crashed to the table, spilling tea on the Christmas-themed place mats.</p><p>Leaping to her feet, Justine dashed to her mother\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Olivia cried. \u201cLook at this mess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019m getting you back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Olivia regarded Justine with a confused expression, as if unsure where she was.</p><p>Supporting her mother, Justine managed to get her out of the kitchen and down the long hallway to the master bedroom. With one arm around her waist, she half carried, half dragged her to the bed.</p><p>Once Olivia was covered by the sheet, Justine felt her mother\u2019s face and nearly gasped aloud at how hot she was to the touch. She located a temperature strip in the bathroom, then pressed it against Olivia\u2019s forehead.</p><p>The reading nearly sent her into a panic. No one needed to tell her that with a temperature of a hundred and five degrees her mother was in a life-threatening situation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Justine,\u201d Olivia insisted in a slurred voice. \u201cJack will be home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling him right this minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...don\u2019t do that. No need. I\u2019ll go back to sleep and...be fine.\u201d</p><p>Rather than argue, Justine left her mother and rushed into the kitchen. She ignored the spilled tea as she scrambled to find Jack\u2019s cell number. Ever organized, her mother had written it neatly in the telephone directory under Jack.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for three rings.</p><p>It felt more like three years. When he did pick up, Justine burst out, \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Mom. Her temperature\u2019s a hundred and five...she\u2019s talking to Jordan.... Jack, what should I do?\u201d</p><p>To his credit, Jack didn\u2019t ask any questions. \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cI\u2019ll get in touch with her oncologist right now. I\u2019m close...I\u2019ll be there in under ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Justine went back to check on her mother, only to find that Olivia appeared to be having entire conversations with Jordan now. She chuckled at something and murmured, \u201cOh, Jordan, you always made me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, Mom.\u201d Justine sat on the edge of the bed and took her mother\u2019s hand. Her heart raced and she struggled to hold back the tears.</p><p>The sound of a speeding car reached her. Justine ran into the living room, praying frantically that it was Jack. Instead it was a teenage boy, driving recklessly in a souped-up vehicle without a muffler. She scanned the road for any sign of Jack.</p><p>In another five minutes, he was there. He banged the door open and dashed into the house, shouting for her.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d Justine cried.</p><p>Jack tore into the bedroom. Olivia gazed up at him as though she\u2019d never seen him before.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of her mind with fever,\u201d Justine said, not even trying to hide her fear. \u201cIt\u2019s high, Jack. Way too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Franklin said we\u2019re to get her to the hospital.\u201d He scooped Olivia into his arms, blankets and all, and started for the front door. By this point Olivia was too weak to protest.</p><p>Justine hurried along at his side, gathering up the dragging blanket. They got Olivia into the backseat of his car and drove straight to the hospital in Bremerton. Justine rode with her mother.</p><p>\u201cHe never grew up,\u201d Olivia said, turning to Justine.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean Jordan, Mom?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and laid her head against the seat. \u201cWhen he asked about the gingerbread cookies, he was thirteen. He still is...\u201d</p><p>Justine clutched her mother\u2019s hand, working hard to keep the emotion at bay. Jack went over the speed limit when he could, with the windows open so the cold December air blew into the car. It was his desperate attempt to bring down her fever. Olivia closed her eyes as the icy breeze touched her heated face. Justine shivered. She hadn\u2019t bothered to grab her jacket or purse, and her teeth were beginning to chatter.</p><p>Once they arrived at the hospital, everything happened quickly. Her mother\u2019s physician had phoned ahead and the hospital staff was waiting for them.</p><p>Justine and Jack sat in silence until Dr. Franklin, the oncologist, appeared. His face was grim. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Olivia has a massive infection at the site of her incision,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow could this be?\u201d Jack demanded. \u201cWe were so careful. We followed all the instructions to the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe probably won\u2019t ever know the exact cause. Our biggest concern at the moment is to get her temperature down. We\u2019ll be starting her on antibiotics intravenously.\u201d</p><p>He left them, saying he\u2019d be back as soon as Olivia had been admitted.</p><p>Jack was pale, the look on his face anguished. He seemed to blame himself. \u201cI should never have gone out,\u201d he said over and over. \u201cThank God you were there.\u201d</p><p>The Christmas music playing in the background seemed incongruous, but it reminded her that she and Seth had planned to put up their tree this afternoon. Now the prospect of preparing for the holidays was the farthest thing from her mind.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she said because she needed to hear it. Needed to say it.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack confirmed, but he didn\u2019t sound confident.</p><p>While they waited for news, Justine phoned Seth to explain where she was. He assured her that he could easily keep Leif occupied and sent Olivia his best wishes.</p><p>When Dr. Franklin returned, his voice was grave. \u201cOlivia is stable. As I told you, I\u2019ve started her on a high dose of antibiotics. Her temperature is down a couple of degrees. We have her lying on an ice blanket, which has helped quite a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Jack whispered again.</p><p>\u201cAlthough she\u2019s in stable condition, I don\u2019t want to discount the seriousness of this infection. Another four or five hours, and we might not have been able to save her.\u201d</p><p>Justine\u2019s hand flew to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this to the best of our ability. The problem, of course, is that Olivia\u2019s immune system is already compromised. This isn\u2019t something we can deal with overnight. She\u2019ll probably be here for several days.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay with her if I could.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Franklin nodded.</p><p>When he\u2019d gone, Jack turned to Justine and handed her the keys to his car. She stared at them, not understanding his intent.</p><p>\u201cTake the car home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you come back, bring me a set of clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving Olivia again,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m never leaving her alone again.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Shirley Bliss glanced out the front window. The streetlights had come on more than an hour ago. Tanni was late for dinner again, which wasn\u2019t an unusual occurrence since she\u2019d taken up with Shaw, the boy who seemed to have only one name. Shirley had met him once, briefly. Tanni was none too eager for her to talk to this young man, for reasons Shirley didn\u2019t understand. It was times like this that she missed Jim the most. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her husband had been close to Tanni, and their daughter had never recovered from his death.</p><p>Shirley would never recover, either.</p><p>It was almost a year now. A very difficult year.</p><p>As long as she lived, Shirley would remember that January afternoon, when the young officer from the Washington State Patrol rang her doorbell. She\u2019d been in her art room in the basement, working on a new quilt, and the interruption had annoyed her. Jim, a pilot for Alaska Airlines, had left for the airport two hours earlier. He usually flew the Seattle-Anchorage route. As he often did, he\u2019d taken his Harley-Davidson motorcycle rather than his car.</p> <p>At first Shirley couldn\u2019t figure out why there was a patrolman at her door. She had trouble taking in his words\u2014that there\u2019d been an accident and her husband had not survived.</p><p>Even then Shirley hadn\u2019t understood. There must be a mistake, she\u2019d said. Two hours ago Jim had kissed her on the cheek, not wanting to disturb her work, and set out for the airport. Two hours earlier, the man she\u2019d spent twenty years of her life with had told her he\u2019d see her the following night.</p><p>Now he was dead? It couldn\u2019t be. It wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>The officer, apparently accustomed to this sort of reaction, had asked if there was someone he could contact on her behalf, a family member, a pastor or perhaps a friend.</p><p>Closing her eyes, Shirley tried to force her thoughts away from that horrible afternoon, a time that had forever changed her life and the lives of her children.</p> <p>Of the three of them, Nick seemed to have adjusted the most successfully to the loss of his father. He was protective of both Shirley and his younger sister. He\u2019d stepped into that role in a way that astonished her. Jim would\u2019ve been so proud of their son. Over Christmas, when Nick was home from school for a couple of weeks, Shirley planned to talk with him about Tanni.</p><p>Tanni wasn\u2019t the same after Jim\u2019s death. Unlike her brother, she\u2019d withdrawn from her friends and family, especially Shirley. In fact, Tanni seemed to blame Shirley for the accident; she\u2019d said as much. If Shirley had made more of a fuss, perhaps Jim wouldn\u2019t have bought that stupid motorcycle. Shirley should\u2019ve insisted he take the car that afternoon. She should\u2019ve known, should\u2019ve stopped him, should\u2019ve done something. On and on. That was pretty well the extent of any conversation with Tanni. Shirley had stopped trying to defend herself. There was no point. These days, their daughter was immersed in her art, spending hours alone in her room. She talked to Shirley as little as possible and refused to show her anything she\u2019d drawn.</p><p>In the beginning, Tanni\u2019s relationship with Shaw had encouraged Shirley. For the first time since her father\u2019s death, Tanni had shown some enthusiasm for life. She had a friend, someone who was important to her. They\u2019d met around Thanksgiving and been practically inseparable ever since.</p><p>Shaw always picked her up in front of the house and dropped her off there. Whenever he pulled up she shot out the door with barely a word and didn\u2019t return for hours. That left next to no opportunity for questions. When Tanni did get home, she hated what she called \u201cthe inquisition\u201d and ignored her mother completely.</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d That seemed to be her daughter\u2019s mantra.</p><p>But Shirley couldn\u2019t do that. Her fear was that in her vulnerable emotional state, Tanni would become physically involved with Shaw. Her imagination ran wild with distressing scenarios, from teen pregnancy to disease to substance abuse. Tanni was too young for such an intense relationship. Too trusting, too naive, too hurt.</p> <p>Shirley felt helpless. Every time she tried to talk to her daughter, Tanni shut her out.</p><p>The phone rang, and it caught Shirley off guard. She reacted with a physical jerk, then reached for the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d She hoped she\u2019d hear her daughter, calling with a reason for being late. Or, better yet, a promise to get home soon.</p><p>\u201cIs this Shirley Bliss?\u201d It was a male voice, one she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said anxiously. Her pulse raced. Worried as she was about Tanni, she was terrified that this stranger had bad news. After all, if it had happened once, it could happen again.</p><p>\u201cHello, Shirley. I\u2019m Will Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>The name seemed familiar, but she couldn\u2019t immediately recall where she\u2019d heard it before. Then it came to her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my contacting you like this.\u201d</p> <p>She thought the new gallery owner sounded a little too smooth and polished. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mr. Jefferson?\u201d She spoke in a businesslike tone.</p><p>\u201cPlease, it\u2019s Will.\u201d</p><p>Shirley rolled her eyes. \u201cYou called because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recently purchased the Harbor Street Gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She was grateful the gallery had found a new owner and that there\u2019d be an outlet for her work. Many of the local artists depended on the income generated there.</p><p>\u201cI was told you\u2019d be a good person to talk to,\u201d Will explained. \u201cI\u2019m interested in showing your work, of course, but I also have some ideas for renovating the gallery. I hoped we might have a chance to chat. I\u2019d appreciate your feedback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize this is Saturday afternoon and it\u2019s a very busy time of year, but I was hoping we could get together early in the week. Would that work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Shirley raised her head as she heard a car door closing in the distance.</p><p>\u201cHow about Tuesday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d At this point she just wanted to get off the phone.</p><p>Will suggested they meet at the gallery and she noted the date and time on her calendar.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to seeing you again,\u201d Will said, as they ended the conversation.</p><p>She frowned. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we met briefly a couple of weeks ago when you picked up the check for the sailboat piece\u2014the fabric collage.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes\u2014they had met. Shirley remembered exactly what he looked like now. Will Jefferson was strikingly attractive\u2014and his reputation had preceded him. Apparently he\u2019d been born and raised in Cedar Cove and was a known ladies\u2019 man, although he\u2019d been back in town for only a few weeks. But she didn\u2019t generally pay much attention to gossip; she preferred to form her own opinions.</p><p>The front door opened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, then,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks, Shirley.\u201d There was a significant pause. \u201cI have the feeling we\u2019re going to become great friends. See you Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d</p><p>Shirley stared down at the phone as she hung up. Their conversation, however short, had left her with the impression that he had an elevated view of himself and his charms.</p><p>Tanni went directly to her room and closed the door.</p><p>Shirley followed and knocked politely.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d her daughter demanded.</p><p>Rather than ask questions that would only be resented, Shirley took another approach. \u201cDinner\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already ate,\u201d Tanni said without opening the door.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like some company. Eating by myself every night is boring.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>She waited several minutes and then, dismayed, walked back to the kitchen. Earlier that afternoon, Shirley had made a soup that had been one of Jim\u2019s favorite\u2019s\u2014cauliflower, potato and cheese. It was the perfect meal for a cold winter night.</p><p>She ladled a scoop into her bowl, then sat down at the kitchen table. As was her practice, she bowed her head for a brief prayer, adding a request for help in reaching her daughter.</p><p>When Shirley raised her head, Tanni was entering the kitchen. Rather than reveal any satisfaction, she shook out her linen napkin and placed it on her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Tanni asked, gesturing at the Crock-Pot.</p><p>\u201cSoup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh, I can see that. What kind?\u201d</p><p>At another time, Shirley would have reacted to Tanni\u2019s rudeness; for now she\u2019d disregard it. She knew its source, and knew it was more important to leave herself open and available. So she answered mildly, \u201cThe cauliflower recipe.\u201d</p><p>Tanni\u2019s eyes showed the first sign of pleasure Shirley had seen in weeks.</p><p>\u201cWant to join me?\u201d she asked, then instantly wished she could cancel the invitation. Anytime she showed any desire for her daughter\u2019s company, Tanni withdrew.</p><p>\u201cI said I already ate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>Her daughter lingered in the kitchen, which encouraged her. Shirley dipped her spoon into the soup, afraid to say anything more.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist for long. \u201cDid you and Shaw have a good time?\u201d The question was a risk but Shirley hoped it was benign enough not to offend her daughter. She took another spoonful of soup\u2014and did her best to ignore the hickey on Tanni\u2019s neck.</p><p>Tanni shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to ask where they\u2019d gone, but decided not to jeopardize this opportunity for communication.</p><p>\u201cI was on the phone when you came in,\u201d Shirley said pleasantly. \u201cThe man who bought the Harbor Street Gallery wants to meet with me next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the gallery sold,\u201d Tanni murmured. \u201cWhat does he want to talk to you about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe renovation he\u2019s got planned. Apparently he\u2019s interested in my ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Tanni pulled out a chair and sat down across from her.</p><p>Shirley tried to conceal her surprise\u2014and relief. Then it dawned on her that if Tanni was willing to talk, it was probably because she wanted something.</p><p>\u201cDo we have plans for Christmas?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Shirley didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d The question sounded more like an accusation than a request for information.</p><p>\u201cYour brother will be home and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Shirley added pointedly, \u201cwe\u2019re going over to see your grandparents.\u201d Jim\u2019s parents lived in Seattle, and Shirley felt it was important for their sakes, as well as Nick and Tanni\u2019s, that they keep in touch.</p><p>\u201cI can see them anytime,\u201d Tanni protested.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but unless you set a date, it doesn\u2019t happen. They\u2019re really looking forward to our coming.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Tanni glanced down at her hands; she seemed to be struggling, caught between duty and desire.</p><p>\u201cDid you have someplace you\u2019d rather go?\u201d Shirley asked without censure.</p><p>Her daughter shrugged. \u201cShaw and I...\u201d She didn\u2019t complete the thought.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to invite him to join us?\u201d</p><p>Tanni raised her head. She seemed to seriously consider the question. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s talented, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Shirley didn\u2019t want to appear dense, but she had no idea how this supposed talent manifested itself. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArt.\u201d She sighed as if it should\u2019ve been obvious.</p><p>That explained a great deal. Tanni was gifted, too, although she hadn\u2019t let Shirley see her work in ages. No one was more surprised than Shirley when she learned that her daughter had won a local art competition. Tanni\u2019s teacher had entered the drawing and hadn\u2019t told her. Tanni had been upset, insisting the whole thing was \u201cmeaningless.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you like me to look at his work?\u201d she offered casually.</p><p>Again her daughter mulled over the question. \u201cHe\u2019s not ready yet, but I think he will be soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, then. Whenever he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is...\u201d Tanni paused.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stuff he draws might bother you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can look beyond the subject matter,\u201d she assured her daughter.</p><p>\u201cCould you...\u201d Tanni seemed uneasy about whatever she wanted to ask.</p><p>\u201cCould I what?\u201d Shirley pressed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you think his work is good\u2014and I do, Mom, I really do\u2014could you talk to Mr. Jefferson about Shaw?\u201d</p><p>Shirley needed a moment to make the connection. \u201cYou want me to find out if he\u2019d be willing to display Shaw\u2019s art?\u201d</p><p>Tanni\u2019s eyes met hers and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s as good as you say, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d</p><p>Tanni smiled at her, something she hadn\u2019t done in months. Granted, it was more of a quirk of her lips than a real smile. But it would do.</p><p>\u201cSo...you think he\u2019s got talent.\u201d</p> <p>Tanni nodded.</p><p>\u201cMore than you?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter hesitated and then responded without vanity. \u201cNo, but then he doesn\u2019t have a mother who\u2019s an artist or a dad who was really interested in art, so he hasn\u2019t got that advantage.\u201d</p><p>Her heart warmed at the acknowledgment\u2014and at Tanni\u2019s reference to her dad. She hardly ever spoke of him, let alone in such a natural, easy way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teaching him everything I learned from you guys,\u201d she was saying.</p><p>In the early years, before Shirley had begun to work with fabric, her daughter would play at her feet while Shirley drew. She gave Tanni her first sketchbook when she was four and the girl had been drawing from that point on. Shirley was devastated when she\u2019d learned that Tanni had destroyed those early sketchbooks after Jim\u2019s funeral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy you\u2019re teaching Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe relationship isn\u2019t as one-sided as that makes it sound,\u201d Tanni said, smiling again. Her fingers crept up to cover the hickey on the side of her neck. \u201cShaw\u2019s teaching me quite a bit, too.\u201d</p> <p>That was exactly what she was afraid of.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>The tension between Dave and Emily had escalated until he found it almost intolerable. Whenever he tried to talk to her, she acted as if he were invisible. As soon as he made an attempt, she simply walked into another room.</p><p>Although they were civil in front of the children, Emily avoided him as much as possible. She didn\u2019t speak to him unless it was to answer a question, and then, only if others were present. Moreover, she\u2019d answer it with the minimum number of words. Her blond hair taunted him. Still, Dave was reluctant to tell her the truth, fearing what that would do to their marriage.</p><p>Sunday morning\u2019s sermon was the most difficult Dave had preached in all the years of his ministry. Afterward he knew, deep inside himself, that he\u2019d let down his congregation, his family and, most important, his God.</p><p>By the time the church emptied, Emily had already taken the two boys home. Dave stayed behind, sitting in the front pew, feeling like a complete failure. He\u2019d lied to his wife, misled his staff and tried to hold everything together on his own. He\u2019d failed every person in his life.</p><p>The only thing to do now was admit to his shortcomings. This situation couldn\u2019t go on.</p><p>Dave accepted what he had to do, but wasn\u2019t sure how to do it. For a full thirty minutes, he sat there in church, pondering the conversation with Emily. Who would\u2019ve guessed he\u2019d have such a problem telling the truth?</p><p>He bowed his head and prayed, asking God to forgive him. When he finished, he left the church to seek forgiveness from his wife.</p><p>As he walked into the parking lot, he felt as if someone had poured lead into his shoes. He would\u2019ve welcomed some kind of interruption, anything that allowed him a few minutes\u2019 reprieve while he tried to overcome his qualms, his feelings of inadequacy. He\u2019d never meant for things to go this far. If he could have turned back the clock, made better choices, he would\u2019ve done so. Instead he had to confess his pride and where it had led him. Now he had to confess to his wife that he\u2019d fallen into the trap that very pride had set.</p><p>When he arrived at the house on Sandpiper Way, he sat in his car for several minutes. Emily loved this house. She\u2019d wanted it so badly and because he loved her and tried to please her, he\u2019d done everything possible to make it happen. He hadn\u2019t predicted all the grief this house would bring him. Yet he had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>The boys, who sat at the kitchen table, looked up when Dave came in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad, Mom made macaroni and cheese.\u201d</p><p>Dave ruffled his youngest son\u2019s hair. \u201cYum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d Matthew asked. \u201cMom said we shouldn\u2019t wait lunch for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your mother?\u201d Dave asked, instead of answering his son\u2019s question. He\u2019d do his best to make it up to his sons, compensate for all the time he\u2019d cheated them out of. He hoped to make it up to Emily, too.</p><p>\u201cIn your room, I guess,\u201d Mark responded. His face was concerned. \u201cMom\u2019s not feeling good. She made lunch and then went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Matthew said. \u201cShe was crying, too.\u201d</p><p>The boy seemed to look straight through Dave, as if silently blaming him for his mother\u2019s tears. Dave\u2019s stomach tensed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go check on your mother. Listen, you two, save some of that macaroni and cheese for me.\u201d He added this on a cheerful note, although it sounded forced even to his own ears.</p><p>Dave made his way down the hall to the master bedroom. He hesitated before opening the door and stepping inside. The drapes were closed. It took him a few seconds to adjust to the darkness. Once he did, he saw that Emily was in bed, either asleep or pretending to be.</p><p>Undecided, he hesitated once more, weighing his options. He was tempted to delay this, and yet he knew his confession wouldn\u2019t be any easier if he put it off.</p><p>Slowly he approached the bed. When he sat down, the mattress dipped slightly with his weight. Emily lay on her side, facing him. Even after four days, he wasn\u2019t used to seeing her as a blonde. The new color and style had received plenty of attention at church that morning. Of course, that was what she wanted. Attention. Love. Recognition. All of which Dave had failed to give her.</p><p>Her eyes remained closed. If she was awake, she certainly succeeded at pretending otherwise. But then, she\u2019d become an expert at ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to resolve this, once and for all,\u201d he said. His voice was tight and controlled.</p><p>In response Emily rolled over, now facing the opposite wall. Apparently she wasn\u2019t interested in clearing the air. He understood her anger; nevertheless, he forged ahead.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m having an affair, don\u2019t you?\u201d He realized almost immediately that he shouldn\u2019t come at her with questions. What his wife needed was reassurance. \u201cDon\u2019t answer that,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot important?\u201d Emily startled him when she bolted upright and glared at him.</p><p>Once again Dave saw his mistake. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I think you do.\u201d She folded her arms across her chest, her body language unambiguous.</p><p>\u201cEmily, on my life, I swear I\u2019ve always been faithful to you and I always will be.\u201d She deserved that assurance, that pledge. Everything else could wait. It was crucial that she know he\u2019d never betray her or the vows they shared.</p><p>Her face soured with skepticism and doubt. \u201cEvery husband who\u2019s cheating swears he\u2019s being faithful.\u201d She spoke with open sarcasm. \u201cShall I bring out the Bible so you can swear on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know the signs? Well, I\u2019ve got them memorized and frankly, the evidence damns you.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so knowledgeable that her unwavering certainty struck him dumb.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m naive and stupid, don\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded, eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019ve read articles on the subject. All wives know. This kind of betrayal is too deep, too fundamental not to feel it, not to recognize it on a gut level. Some women choose to ignore the signs, but on a subconscious level each one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say the wife\u2019s the last to find out. Wrong. We\u2019re the first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, if you\u2019d listen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s your turn to listen to me. Do you honestly believe I didn\u2019t notice those two and three nights a week you were late? It got to be like clockwork. How stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was three nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re admitting an affair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had a hard time getting in even one-word responses. He decided just to let her vent. When she\u2019d finished, he\u2019d explain.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. You\u2019re going to try and talk your way out of this. But I won\u2019t pretend any longer, Dave. If you want a divorce, you can have one. I\u2019m through.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could have shocked him more. \u201cI don\u2019t want a divorce! If you\u2019d give me a chance, I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off yet again. \u201cOf course you don\u2019t want a divorce. It wouldn\u2019t look good on your pastoral r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to say you\u2019re a divorced father of two, now, would it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, stop! This is crazy.\u201d</p><p>Tossing aside the covers, she rose onto her knees. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stop! There\u2019s a lot of anger stored up inside me. I\u2019m ready to explode with it. How dare you embarrass me in front of my family and friends! Even my mother said she thought something wasn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talked to your mother about this?\u201d It was all he could do not to groan out loud.</p><p>\u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>It did, and it humiliated him even further. \u201cYou shared your suspicions with your mother and not with me?\u201d That hurt. It hurt more than the fact that she\u2019d brought her doubts to his mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t want to know,\u201d Emily said. \u201cNo wife cares to admit that her husband\u2019s involved with someone else. According to the articles I read, that\u2019s common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d he began forcefully. \u201cI\u2019m saying it again, and it\u2019s the truth. I am not having an affair.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes toward the ceiling, her arms still crossed, blocking him out. \u201cRight,\u201d she muttered with more than a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cI took a part-time job.\u201d</p><p>Her arms fell to her sides as she studied him, her eyes puzzled. Confused. Dave met her gaze full on, not flinching.</p><p>\u201cA...job?\u201d she asked after a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working at First National Bank as a security guard after hours, three nights a week.\u201d He\u2019d considered it the perfect solution. He was inside the building ninety-nine percent of the time, so no one saw him. Very occasionally, he filled in for someone else, like the afternoon he\u2019d gone to Olivia\u2019s house. Normally, though, he did swing shift, from four to ten. Not much was asked of him, other than to watch a series of television monitors. It was a position created after a series of break-ins in the area. He didn\u2019t carry a gun, just a radio. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emily\u2019s mouth sagged open as she weighed the viability of his explanation.</p><p>Dave could see her wondering whether to believe him, wondering whether this was another lie, like so many others.</p><p>\u201cWhy...why would you do that?\u201d she asked in a quavering voice.</p><p>This was the most difficult part of his confession. Before he could explain, she came up with her own reasoning.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a gambler, Dave?\u201d</p><p>Dave was beginning to get irritated. \u201cHow can you ask me something like that?\u201d Despite his best efforts, he couldn\u2019t keep the anguish out of his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you know me at all, Em? Have I destroyed everything because I wanted you to have this house you love so much?\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye, her expression went from suspicion to shock. \u201cThe...house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a financial stretch when we signed the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...I assumed...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I let you,\u201d Dave said, not allowing her to finish. He was the one to blame. Little did he realize at the time that he\u2019d set them up for financial ruin. Emily had wanted the house and Dave wanted her to have it. He handled all the finances, paid the bills. Every month he gave Emily a budget and she did a masterful job of keeping their living expenses within it.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to say we can\u2019t afford this house?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His heart in his throat, Dave lowered his head, unable to meet her eyes. \u201cThe mortgage broker managed to get the payments within reach, with the understanding that they\u2019d increase every six months.\u201d As it was, their budget had been strained to the breaking point and then, six months out, the mortgage company had hit him with the first increase.</p><p>\u201cYou took on an extra job without talking to me...without telling me why?\u201d Pain bled into each word.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to worry that we might lose the house,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather let me think you were with another woman?\u201d</p> <p>It hadn\u2019t actually dawned on him that she\u2019d make such an assumption. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think you\u2019d notice. I thought you\u2019d figure I was just working later than usual.\u201d There were often committee meetings in the evenings, and he\u2019d figured Emily would believe he\u2019d skipped dinner and stayed late because of them.</p><p>\u201cI did think that in the beginning,\u201d she murmured softly. \u201cBut I started to notice how distracted you\u2019d become. It wasn\u2019t like you. Then...\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cIt was a few weeks ago. You closed your office door, and after a while I picked up the phone and hit Redial.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cA woman answered and asked if it was Davey.\u201d</p><p>Dave nearly groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s Maxine. She works as a guard, too. She needed to change schedules with me. She\u2019d left a message on my cell and I called her back to arrange it. If you met her, you\u2019d see that she\u2019s sixty years old\u2014and a grandmother. I\u2019m not involved with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you were gone so often.\u201d</p><p>Dave had to agree the extra hours had drained his energy to the point that when he arrived home, he was exhausted and out of sorts.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sell the house,\u201d Emily said. \u201cYou can\u2019t continue like this.\u201d</p> <p>With that part, Dave agreed. He\u2019d grown tired and impatient with those around him. Even Angel, his assistant, had commented. He hated the changes he saw in himself and yet seemed powerless to overcome them.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sell.\u201d They were trapped. This was the worst of what he had to tell her.</p><p>\u201cOf course we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, don\u2019t you suppose I\u2019ve thought of that?\u201d he said. \u201cIn this market, the house is no longer worth what we paid for it. I got us into a huge financial hole.\u201d</p><p>She sank down, sitting on her heels. \u201cI\u2019ll get a job,\u201d she said, as if that would solve everything. \u201cI\u2019ve been volunteering at the school, and a position may be opening up there. I\u2019ll apply....\u201d She closed her eyes in concentration. \u201cI can try The Quilted Giraffe, too. They all know me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe decided when we married,\u201d Dave reminded her, \u201cthat you\u2019d be a stay-at-home mother for our children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure it\u2019s understood when I apply that my hours have to coincide with the boys\u2019 schedule.\u201d</p><p>Even then Dave didn\u2019t really like it. \u201cI hate the thought of you having to get a job. I should be the one to provide for our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Dave, get a grip. Join the twenty-first century. I appreciate that you\u2019d like me to be at home and I enjoy it, but I want to make a financial contribution to our family. Besides, the boys are older now. And I need to help. In fact, I insist on it.\u201d</p><p>It went against his pride to acknowledge his relief. \u201cYou really think the school or the fabric shop would agree to those hours?\u201d This was a solution, although not one he would\u2019ve asked Emily to consider.</p><p>His wife nodded enthusiastically. \u201cThe job at the school would be as a classroom aide. The principal already suggested I apply if they get permission to post it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d If she\u2019d mentioned it earlier, he didn\u2019t remember.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWell, no, because I was still thinking about it. I do have a few secrets of my own, you know.\u201d</p><p>Dave felt almost dizzy with relief. \u201cI should\u2019ve said something sooner. I should\u2019ve told you what was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should have.\u201d</p><p>A huge weight had lifted from his shoulders. He was a pastor, a man of God, and yet he\u2019d ignored a basic creed found in the Bible. The truth shall set you free. And he was free for the first time in months.</p><p>Emily moved closer to him and Dave slipped his arms around her. For a long moment all they did was hold each other. Emily had her arms around his neck. When she whispered something in his ear, he stiffened.</p><p>\u201cThe watch?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better explain that to me as well.\u201d</p><p>Dave sagged onto the bed. He\u2019d been sick with guilt over losing that watch. And yet its appearance at the judge\u2019s house embarrassed him all the more.</p><p>\u201cDave,\u201d Emily said. \u201cWhere did you get a gold watch?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and then explained. \u201cBefore she died, Martha Evans gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>His wife frowned as if she didn\u2019t believe him. This was his biggest fear. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThat I should never have accepted a family heirloom, and you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I was thinking...\u201d Emily withdrew her arms and stared at him with such intensity that Dave wanted to cry out in anger and frustration.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously believe I\u2019d steal Martha\u2019s jewelry?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst you accuse me of having an affair and now you suspect I\u2019m a thief.\u201d His wife\u2019s low opinion of him shocked Dave. Despite what she\u2019d assumed was evidence, Emily was the one person he\u2019d expected to stand by his side. Now it was clear his own wife doubted him. And if Emily did, so would everyone else. Thankfully he had proof of Martha Evans\u2019s intentions.</p><p>Emily was quick to apologize. \u201cI know, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days before she died, Martha told me she wanted me to have her husband\u2019s retirement watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refused,\u201d he broke in. \u201cI had no interest in accepting such a gift, but Martha said she\u2019d talked to her attorney and everything had already been settled. She left that watch to me in her will.\u201d</p><p>Dave wasn\u2019t entirely innocent in the matter. He should\u2019ve asked Allan for confirmation. He was uncomfortable with the fact that the attorney hadn\u2019t said anything about the watch. \u201cAs you might understand, when I heard that some of Martha\u2019s jewelry had turned up missing, I was afraid suspicion would fall on me because I had the watch in my possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear the watch until this week?\u201d she asked, making his behavior sound suspect, just as he\u2019d feared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t wear it. Then I decided I didn\u2019t have anything to hide. She gave it to me, and that\u2019s noted in the will, which the family has read. So there wasn\u2019t any reason not to wear it. My own watch needs a new battery. What I didn\u2019t realize was that the clasp on the gold watch was loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never take anything that didn\u2019t belong to me.\u201d That was not only a fundamental tenet of his faith, it was a painful lesson Dave had learned in his youth. Even his wife didn\u2019t know about his criminal record as a teenager.</p><p>Emily remained silent.</p><p>\u201cYou believe me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her hesitation was slight, but Dave noticed it nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d she said and hugged him again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI should\u2019ve told you about our money problems, and about the watch, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be more aware of our finances, Dave.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d In fact, he\u2019d be more than happy to hand over the bill-paying to Emily so she\u2019d appreciate the pressure he\u2019d been under. Despite his part-time position, things hadn\u2019t really improved.</p><p>Every time he thought they were making headway, something would come up. Last month it was new tires for Emily\u2019s car. They couldn\u2019t afford them, but Dave refused to ignore the safety of his wife and children. He\u2019d cut up all but one credit card and that was just for emergencies. He was maxed out on that card and only able to make minimum payments.</p><p>Dave wished he\u2019d sold the gold watch. It had been a foolish mistake to wear it and even more imprudent to lose it...especially at Judge Griffin\u2019s house.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>It was late afternoon. Grace Harding dozed fitfully in a chair in Olivia\u2019s hospital room, jerking awake every once in a while. Olivia was hooked up to an IV; antibiotics flowed through it, as did a saline drip to prevent dehydration. She was connected to various pieces of monitoring equipment via other tubes, as well. The fever was down, thank God, but the medical staff continued to watch her carefully.</p><p>The room was dark now, and Grace glanced at her watch. The daylight hours were dwindling as winter solstice approached. Signs of Christmas were everywhere, but rarely had Grace felt less like celebrating. Her dearest friend was seriously ill. And soon after Olivia had recovered from this, she\u2019d be starting her chemotherapy. There was no way of knowing yet how bad that would be.</p><p>Straightening, Grace bent forward to get the kinks out of her neck. Jack would be returning any minute, and the last thing he needed was to find her fearful and worried. He\u2019d been at Olivia\u2019s side constantly. Grace and Cliff had come at noon, and Grace had finally convinced him to leave for a few hours\u2014to let Cliff drive him back to the house to shower and change clothes. Even then, Jack had been reluctant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door slid open and Cliff stuck his head in. \u201cAny change?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNone that I can see.\u201d Olivia had been asleep the entire time. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe met Justine in the hallway. He\u2019s giving her an update.\u201d</p><p>Grace would be forever grateful that Justine had gone to her mother\u2019s house yesterday morning. It might well have meant the difference between life and death.</p> <p>\u201cCharlotte and Ben are here, too,\u201d Cliff said. Olivia\u2019s mother had spent the morning at the hospital, along with Ben. They\u2019d gone home for a few hours but were obviously back.</p><p>The private room was small, and when Justine and Jack came inside a few minutes later, Grace decided to take a break. She needed a cup of coffee and some fresh air. Cliff sat with Charlotte and Ben in the waiting area, watching television.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going down to the cafeteria for a cup of coffee,\u201d she announced.</p><p>Charlotte, who was contentedly knitting, was the only one who seemed to hear. \u201cOh, you\u2019re up,\u201d she said. \u201cI glanced in earlier but I didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p><p>Ben and Cliff were both concentrating on the last few minutes of the Seattle Seahawks football game.</p> <p>\u201cDoes anyone need anything?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Charlotte looked up from her knitting again. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Grace, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff? Ben?\u201d</p><p>Her husband smiled briefly in her direction. \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Ben returned without moving his eyes from the screen.</p><p>Cliff had told her that this game would determine the team\u2019s ranking in the playoffs later in the season. Grace liked football well enough, but at the moment it seemed irrelevant to her. She was too concerned about Olivia.</p> <p>When she got to the cafeteria, she stood in line with a couple of male nurses and reached for a midsize cup. Someone came to stand behind her, but she didn\u2019t look over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grace.\u201d</p><p>She made an effort to disguise the effect Will Jefferson\u2019s voice had on her. She shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he\u2019d shown up at the hospital. Olivia was, after all, his sister, and he was as worried as anyone. Apparently he\u2019d visited Olivia yesterday evening, but their paths hadn\u2019t crossed.</p><p>She turned. \u201cHello, Will.\u201d She spoke in a controlled, even voice. Their history made her wary of him. It wouldn\u2019t be out of character for Will to say or do something to make her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any change since early this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out of danger, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cImmediate danger, yes. She\u2019s still fighting the infection.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor Liv,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Grace reached the coffee machine and filled her cup. Will followed and filled his own. She noticed that his shoulders were wet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining?\u201d she asked, disappointed because that meant she couldn\u2019t go out for fresh air.</p><p>\u201cAfraid so,\u201d Will said. \u201cActually, I was hoping for snow.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cYou and every school-age child in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>Will grinned back at her. \u201cHey, I guess I\u2019m still a kid at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently so.\u201d In more ways than one, she mused. She got to the cash register and was digging in her pocket for change when Will beat her to it.</p><p>\u201cBoth coffees,\u201d he instructed the cashier.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Will, but that isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cConsider it a peace offering.\u201d He gestured toward an empty table. \u201cDo you have a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>Grace hesitated.</p><p>\u201cIf Cliff objects, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew he was baiting her. Her husband wasn\u2019t an unreasonable man, nor was he particularly jealous, although Will had given him cause to doubt her.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to ask you a few questions about the gallery,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked pointedly at her watch. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose five minutes would hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He led the way to a small table and sat down.</p><p>Grace joined him.</p><p>\u201cI signed the final papers last week,\u201d he said proudly.</p><p>\u201cAlready? I didn\u2019t think you were taking over until January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either, but the paperwork went smoothly and there was no reason to wait. The previous owners thought it would be to their advantage tax-wise to close early, so I agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d She raised her cup in a gesture of celebration.</p><p>Will touched his own cup against hers. \u201cIf not for Olivia, I would never have known about the gallery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe community is grateful.\u201d Grace knew the art gallery had given many local artists their start. Jon Bowman, her son-in-law, was one of them. His photography was first displayed at the Harbor Street Gallery back in the days when Maryellen had managed it.</p><p>In fact, they\u2019d met through the gallery. Jon\u2019s work was displayed in a large Seattle gallery these days, and he now had an agent. His photographs appeared in print ads, including a series of high-profile tourism ads for the state.</p><p>\u201cI was astonished at the amount of artistic talent in this area,\u201d Will told her. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you were in the gallery?\u201d</p><p>Grace had to admit it had been some time. \u201cI\u2019ve only been by once or twice since Maryellen left.\u201d Her daughter had been instrumental in the success of the Harbor Street Gallery. When Maryellen was forced to give up her job due to a difficult pregnancy, the gallery\u2019s fortunes had steadily declined.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the message I\u2019m getting from everyone,\u201d Will said. \u201cI\u2019m talking to Maryellen, of course, but I\u2019m also meeting with local artists and getting their suggestions on how to generate interest in the gallery again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea,\u201d she said, and meant it.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He accepted her praise in an offhand manner. Staring down at his coffee, he asked, \u201cDo you know Shirley Bliss?\u201d</p><p>The name was vaguely familiar to Grace. \u201cI think so...I seem to recall Maryellen being impressed with her work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a fabric artist. She quilts, but she also uses other techniques and she\u2019s very inventive about materials. Her work\u2019s really exciting.\u201d</p><p>The gallery had occasionally displayed fabric art, like Shirley\u2019s, but had tended to feature paintings and photography.</p><p>Will glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Shirley has some fresh ideas. We\u2019re meeting this week. I\u2019d like to do more with fabric art.\u201d He added a little more sugar to his coffee and stirred. \u201cQuilting and knitting are incredibly popular activities these days\u2014as my mother has pointed out.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom thought I should have a special quilt display,\u201d Will said. \u201cThey\u2019re usually seen as practical\u2014you know, a traditional domestic craft\u2014but they can be works of art.\u201d</p><p>Grace was pleased by Will\u2019s enthusiasm...and relieved that he\u2019d found a focus for his time and energy. She finished her coffee, then said, \u201cI really should get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Will held his cup with both hands. \u201cTell everyone I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Grace stood and turned to leave. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>When she entered the waiting area, the football game appeared to be over. Both Ben and Cliff spoke animatedly about the last-second win.</p><p>As Grace took the seat next to her husband, Cliff reached for her hand and intertwined their fingers.</p><p>\u201cI met Will in the cafeteria,\u201d Grace told Charlotte casually.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad,\u201d Charlotte murmured, pausing in the middle of counting stitches. \u201cHe said he was coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked for a few minutes.\u201d She mentioned this so it wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, should Will bring it up in front of Cliff.</p><p>Her husband nodded, not questioning the comment, and she squeezed his fingers.</p><p>Justine came out of the hospital room and joined them, with Jack following a moment later.</p><p>\u201cShift change,\u201d he explained. Everyone was asked to leave when the next staff group came on duty and the nurses were updated on each patient\u2019s condition.</p><p>\u201cHow does Olivia look?\u201d Charlotte asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Justine answered. \u201cMom\u2019s a trooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s awake now,\u201d Jack informed them. \u201cYou were right,\u201d he told Cliff and Grace, \u201cshe didn\u2019t know I\u2019d been gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d Justine said with the certainty and optimism of the young.</p><p>Grace had every intention of believing those words. And if love, faith and prayers could make a difference, Olivia would indeed be fine.</p><p>\u201cHey, everyone.\u201d</p><p>Grace glanced up as Will stood in the entry to the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cHello, Will.\u201d Cliff got up and offered his hand.</p><p>They shook hands, then Will bent to kiss his mother\u2019s cheek and sat down next to Ben.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear the Seahawks won?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cI heard it from one of the physicians in the elevator.\u201d He leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees. \u201cSo what\u2019s the latest on my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s improving,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cAlthough she gave us all a fright.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s doing better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all are,\u201d Charlotte said with feeling. \u201cBut I\u2019m still not sure Ben and I should be taking that cruise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma.\u201d Justine shook her finger at Charlotte. \u201cYou\u2019re going. If Mom hears you\u2019re even thinking about not getting on that ship she\u2019ll have a fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did purchase travel insurance,\u201d Ben told everyone, \u201cso we can cancel if we have to. I want Charlotte to have a good time, and she can\u2019t do that if she\u2019s worried about Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s only one thing to do,\u201d Jack said, looking at each person gathered there. \u201cWe\u2019ll all have to make sure Olivia recovers quickly.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte beamed. \u201cI\u2019m going home and making my chicken noodle soup. It worked when Olivia was a little girl and it\u2019s bound to work now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that soup,\u201d Will said, smiling at his mother. \u201cI used to pretend I was sick just so Mom would make a batch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sneak!\u201d Charlotte burst out, and everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cBut like you always said, Mom, it cures whatever ails you.\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cI wonder if those cancer specialists know about the medicinal qualities of Charlotte\u2019s soup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them,\u201d Justine said.</p><p>Charlotte shoved her knitting in her bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Ben. We\u2019ll be back with a thermos of chicken noodle soup.\u201d She stood up slowly, reaching for her husband.</p><p>Not for the first time, Grace noticed that Charlotte was showing her age. Ben, too, she thought as he rose awkwardly to his feet. They held each other, arms linked, and shuffled out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack\u2019s gaze met hers, and it was plain that they shared the same concern. If Charlotte was going to make a batch of her chicken noodle soup, it might be a good idea if she and Ben had some, too.</p><p>A few minutes later, a nurse stepped into the waiting area.</p><p>\u201cOlivia is now receiving guests,\u201d the woman said cheerfully. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well. I spoke with her physician, and Dr. Franklin thinks she should be able to go home in another day. Two at the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great news!\u201d Grace said, clasping her hands together.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d Jack agreed. \u201cAnd she hasn\u2019t even had her chicken soup yet.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. If Jack\u2019s sense of humor was back, things really were looking up.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Christie was embarrassed to admit how nervous she felt about this dinner party her sister had arranged. When they\u2019d met the previous week, Christie had agreed to contact James on her own. It\u2019d sounded like a good idea at the time....</p><p>And yet Christie couldn\u2019t make herself do it. The fear of rejection was just too strong. In exasperation Teri had intervened and asked both James and Christie to dinner. Christie knew James would be attending, but apparently he\u2019d been left in the dark. She wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with that\u2014it didn\u2019t seem fair\u2014but Teri insisted she knew what she was doing.</p> <p>The two sisters had discussed their plan several times over the course of the day.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d Teri asked an hour before Christie was due to arrive.</p><p>So far she hadn\u2019t decided. She\u2019d tried on almost every outfit she owned and discarded them all. \u201cI...don\u2019t know yet. Do you have any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing too fancy,\u201d Teri cautioned. \u201cThe evening\u2019s supposed to be relaxed, low-key. Think casual.\u201d</p><p>Christie glanced at her reflection in the bedroom mirror and started to unfasten the sequined top. She hadn\u2019t liked the way it fit, anyway. \u201cHow about jeans and a sweater?\u201d she asked next. Earlier that week, Wal-Mart had offered jeans on sale. Christie knew a bargain when she saw one and with her employee discount, the store had practically given her those Levi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little too casual. Do you have any black pants?\u201d</p> <p>Christie\u2019s gaze shot to her closet. \u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d Somewhere buried deep in the back there was probably a pair. She tended to stick to jeans; they fit well and were comfortable.</p><p>\u201cWear those and a sweater. Listen, I\u2019ve got to scoot if I\u2019m going to get dinner on the table.\u201d</p><p>Christie stopped her. \u201cJames still doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m coming, right?\u201d</p><p>Her sister hesitated. \u201cUnfortunately he does. Bobby wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything but he forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>That hardly seemed long enough. Christie tore into her closet again. Clothes were scattered all over the floor and across her bed. Anyone looking at her room would assume she\u2019d been the victim of a burglary. She\u2019d worked today, so she hadn\u2019t bothered to make her bed, and between that and the clothes strewn everywhere, the room was a hopeless mess. Christie was pretty sure she knew what James would think if he were to see it.</p><p>Instantly the image of James naked and in her bed flashed into her mind. She couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what kind of lover he\u2019d be. Polite to a fault, no doubt. She shook her head to dispel the image. Her heart raced, and she couldn\u2019t even figure out why she cared about this overpolite stuffed shirt, anyway.</p><p>But for reasons she didn\u2019t completely understand, she did care. She wanted him to like her; she wanted to be a better person for James.</p><p>She could still see the disappointment in his eyes when she\u2019d come out of The Pink Poodle. Yes, she\u2019d been drinking, but she wasn\u2019t drunk. Far from it. Besides, it wasn\u2019t any of his business where she was or who she was with or what she was doing. But...she couldn\u2019t forget that look in his eyes.</p><p>As Teri had said, James Wilbur was the first decent man who\u2019d shown interest in her, and that left Christie feeling vulnerable and exposed. The man seemed to disapprove of Christie as much as he was attracted to her, which confused Christie. That confusion made her resentful, and her resentment made her...confused.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s date was a perfect example. It wasn\u2019t really even a date, just a \u201ccasual\u201d dinner, and she should wear what she wanted. Yet here she was, worrying about every aspect of her appearance simply because James was going to be there.</p><p>Walking closer to the mirror, Christie studied her reflection. The woman who stared at her revealed none of the poise or elegance she\u2019d worked so hard to create. Shaking back her hair, Christie wondered if this was just another instance of wanting what Teri had.</p><p>As a kid, Christie had followed her big sister around like a shadow. Teri had hated it and done everything she could to ditch her. In their teens and twenties, the animosity between them had nearly destroyed their relationship. If Teri had it, Christie wanted it. It included boys. And later, men. She asked herself if what Teri had this time was really so appealing. Well, yes.</p><p>First, her sister was married to a man who loved her, while Christie\u2019s marriage, brief though it was, had been a disaster from the start. The man who\u2019d promised to cherish her had beaten her in a drunken rage instead. At the rate the violence had escalated, Christie figured she would\u2019ve been dead within the year.</p><p>Her sister had security, too\u2014financial and emotional. That was something neither of them had experienced in their youth. Teri wasn\u2019t the same person she\u2019d been before marrying Bobby. Love had changed her. Christie envied her that.</p><p>Christie frowned at herself in the mirror. She didn\u2019t have time to stand here analyzing her feelings for James. They were just...there. Right now, she had an outfit to throw together, makeup to put on, hair to brush.</p><p>When she finally arrived at her sister\u2019s house, Christie was fifteen minutes late. She hadn\u2019t located a single pair of black slacks and had worn gray stretch pants and a long red sweater. The combination was festive. She chose a necklace made of silver bells that jingled whenever she moved. Her shoes were too tight but there was nothing she could do about that.</p><p>Teri opened the door, looking pregnant and just as radiant as a pregnant woman was supposed to.</p><p>\u201cChristie, you\u2019re late,\u201d Teri hissed, grabbing her arm and dragging her into the house. It\u2019d been a while since Christie had been inside and she was astounded at the transformation that had taken place. Every nook and cranny was decorated for Christmas.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, gazing around. From where she stood in the entry she could see three Christmas trees\u2014on the landing, in the living room and in a corner of the hall. She saw Nativity sets of different styles and sizes on various available surfaces.</p><p>\u201cBobby said I could decorate for Christmas however I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy all the trees?\u201d Christie asked, forgetting about James for the moment. \u201cHow many are there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive decorated Christmas trees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Christmas,\u201d Teri announced.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Christie muttered. She loved Christmas, too, but she could never have afforded anything like this\u2014or had the space for it. \u201cThis must\u2019ve cost a fortune.\u201d</p><p>Teri smiled sheepishly. \u201cBobby doesn\u2019t care, as long as I\u2019m happy.\u201d</p><p>Christie scowled at her. \u201cIt would be easy to hate you.\u201d</p><p>Teri giggled. \u201cNone of this means anything without Bobby and the baby.\u201d She rested her hand on the gentle swelling under her green velvet tunic.</p><p>Christie glanced around again, half expecting to find James standing awkwardly in the corner. He wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhere\u2019s James?\u201d she asked, lowering her voice.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t here yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames is late?\u201d That didn\u2019t sound like him.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t coming,\u201d Bobby said as he stepped into the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Christie, I let the beans out of the bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpilled the beans, sweetheart,\u201d Teri corrected her husband. \u201cOr let the cat out of the bag.\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded solemnly. \u201cWhen I told him you\u2019d be at dinner, too, James said he couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>Christie shrugged. \u201cHey, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She removed her coat and draped it over the back of a chair, then left her purse there, too.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s almost ready,\u201d Teri said as she picked up Christie\u2019s coat and hung it in the closet. When they\u2019d walked into the kitchen together, Teri hurried over to the oven and opened the door to peek inside. \u201cThis is one of Bobby\u2019s favorite dishes,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Christie peeked, too, and couldn\u2019t see anything special about the rice casserole. Her stomach had been upset most of the day and the truth was, she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite. It was just as well James wasn\u2019t coming or she wouldn\u2019t have been able to eat at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you,\u201d Teri said. \u201cI know you were looking forward to this evening.\u201d</p><p>Christie shrugged again. \u201cHey, I\u2019ve scared off better men than James.\u201d</p><p>Teri said something Christie didn\u2019t catch. \u201cI\u2019m so upset with him I can\u2019t even tell you,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You suggested I approach James and when I couldn\u2019t, you arranged this party and now it\u2019s backfired. From my perspective this romance simply isn\u2019t going to happen. C\u2019est la vie.\u201d</p><p>Teri raised her eyebrows. \u201cYou speak French now?\u201d</p><p>Christie slapped her sister\u2019s arm and they both giggled.</p><p>Dinner was pleasant enough, although Christie ate very little. She didn\u2019t want Teri or Bobby to know how depressed she was, so she kept up a steady stream of chatter. As soon as she could, she made her excuses and gathered up her coat and purse. Besides, Teri looked tired. She\u2019d been decorating and cleaning all day. Twice during the meal, Christie caught her sister yawning.</p><p>Bobby said good-night and disappeared into his study, then Teri walked her to the door. They both glanced up at the large three-car garage with James\u2019s living quarters above. The lights were on, so he was obviously home.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him,\u201d Teri urged in a whisper.</p><p>Christie shook her head. \u201cForget it.\u201d He didn\u2019t want anything to do with her and in retrospect that was probably for the best. She had enough to deal with in her life without this aggravation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call later. I\u2019ve got a doctor\u2019s appointment on Wednesday. I\u2019m getting my first ultrasound, and he said I could have a picture of the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Christie couldn\u2019t wait to see that. They hugged goodbye and she headed for her car. As she slipped inside, her gaze fastened on the light coming from James\u2019s apartment. Coward! As far as she was concerned, James Wilbur was a full-fledged coward. Fine. But she wasn\u2019t chasing after him.</p><p>Christie inserted her key in the ignition. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing.</p><p>It cranked and cranked and wouldn\u2019t start.</p><p>Great, just great. She was stuck. Bobby Polgar wouldn\u2019t be any help. All he knew was chess. Teri wouldn\u2019t know what to do, either. And Christie wasn\u2019t going to drag her pregnant sister out on a chilly night. There was no point in going in to phone the auto club, either, because she\u2019d let her membership lapse years ago; she couldn\u2019t afford it.</p><p>Reluctantly, Christie looked at the upstairs apartment. Apparently she was going to see James, after all. She trudged up the outside staircase and knocked twice, then stepped back and waited.</p> <p>James opened the door wearing a suit. Christie wondered if he even owned a pair of jeans.</p><p>\u201cMy car won\u2019t start,\u201d she said without preamble.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Triple A?\u201d he asked, still holding the door handle as if he thought he might have to close it quickly.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d be here pestering you if I was a member?\u201d she asked sharply. She modulated her voice. \u201cI would very much appreciate a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll be just a moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d This was so embarrassing.</p><p>When he returned, he\u2019d donned an overcoat, hat and gloves. \u201cI\u2019d like to see if I can get your vehicle started, if that\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She gestured toward her car. \u201cHave at it.\u201d</p><p>James released the latch and raised the hood. He fiddled with the engine for a couple of minutes, then looked at her gravely.</p><p>\u201cI believe you need a new alternator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d She had no idea how expensive that would be, but it went without saying she couldn\u2019t afford it. With rent and debts to pay, she was barely subsisting as it was.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring the car around,\u201d James told her.</p><p>She nodded, still numb at the news. Somehow or other, she\u2019d have to get the car towed from Teri\u2019s to a repair shop. That wouldn\u2019t be cheap, either. This couldn\u2019t have happened at a worse time.</p><p>James slowly backed the limousine out of the garage. He stepped out and opened the passenger door for her.</p><p>\u201cI can open my own door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d James said in the formal tone she hated.</p><p>\u201cI told you before I don\u2019t want you to call me miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cThen why do you insist on doing it? Do you look for ways to irritate me?\u201d She was angry now. This entire evening had been a disaster and that was his fault. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t need a ride, after all, thank you very much. I prefer to walk.\u201d She slammed the car door, jerked her purse strap over her shoulder and started walking. The bells on her necklace jingled with every step. Her feet already hurt but it wasn\u2019t as if she could take her shoes off.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t gone more than a few yards when James silently joined her.</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d When he didn\u2019t respond, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t want you walking with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alone. It isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been alone practically my whole life. I don\u2019t need a bodyguard, understand?\u201d She made her voice as hard and unwelcoming as she could.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d She turned to glare at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d Her voice cracked and she buried her hands deep in her pockets, shivering against the cold.</p><p>\u201cChristie.\u201d His voice was soft, soothing, as if he were speaking to a child.</p><p>That irritated her even more. \u201cGo away!\u201d she shouted. \u201cJust leave me alone. I don\u2019t want you walking with me,\u201d she said again. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it?\u201d They hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the long hilly driveway and already she was winded and her feet had begun to swell. Her apartment had to be a good five miles away.</p><p>He drew back slightly, but still he followed her.</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re this big hero,\u201d she muttered, trying to distract herself from the agony of walking. \u201cYou fought those two thugs and Teri says you might have saved Rachel\u2019s life.\u201d She stopped for a few seconds. \u201cOnly I know the real truth about you, James. You\u2019re a coward, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He said nothing.</p><p>Whirling around she confronted him face-to-face. \u201cDid you hear me, coward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The man infuriated her and she childishly stamped her foot\u2014big mistake\u2014before whirling back around and walking again. A blister had begun to form on her heel. She\u2019d known the shoes, very cute ballet flats, were a size too small, but they\u2019d been on sale and they went so nicely with her red sweater.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you limping?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted back, struggling not to cry. \u201cI hate my life, I hate myself and I hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>The man was impossible to fight with. She\u2019d had it. Turning abruptly, she placed her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it going to take to get you to leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cFine, if that\u2019s how you want it, walk behind me.\u201d She made it all the way to the end of the street before she just couldn\u2019t walk anymore. Her right shoe rubbed against raw, bloody flesh. Now she had to stop and remove it. She\u2019d taken about five uneven steps when James came from behind her and casually swept her into his arms as if she weighed next to nothing.</p><p>\u201cPut me down, you idiot!\u201d</p><p>She wanted to kick and scream and argue with him. His jaw was tight, and from the angry set of his mouth she could see he wasn\u2019t going anywhere without her.</p><p>She sniffled.</p><p>\u201cAre you in pain?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded and sniffled again. \u201cWhy do you hate me?\u201d she asked plaintively, furious with herself for caring. She didn\u2019t want his gentleness or his kindness; they confused her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t come to dinner tonight because I was there.\u201d</p><p>He remained stubbornly silent.</p><p>After another minute, she demanded he put her down. \u201cPlease, please just leave me alone.\u201d She was an emotional wreck. Tears stung her eyes, but the last thing, the very last thing, she wanted was for James to see her cry.</p><p>He sighed audibly, but instead of releasing her, he held her closer. Christie rested her head against his shoulder and absorbed the warmth and comfort he offered.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to drive you home?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She was in such pain, and she was finished being stupid. She\u2019d been ridiculous to think she could actually walk that distance.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He carefully lowered her to the ground.</p><p>Holding hands, they walked side by side. Clutching her shoe in her other hand, Christie limped back down the driveway. Once they reached the car, James opened the passenger door for her. This time she didn\u2019t protest.</p><p>She was half in the vehicle and half out when he stopped her. Leaning forward, James pressed his mouth to hers. His hand was in her hair, his lips urging, questing, deepening the kiss until she trembled. When he lifted his head, she nearly fell the rest of the way into the car.</p><p>She wanted to ask why he\u2019d done that, but found she couldn\u2019t speak. She didn\u2019t say a word during the drive. At her apartment complex, he parked and helped her out.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded formally.</p><p>She lingered, hoping he\u2019d kiss her again.</p><p>James didn\u2019t disappoint her. He kissed her long and hard. While she was still reeling from his touch, he climbed into the car and drove away.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Troy\u2019s daughter had called her at work that morning, and Faith was actually looking forward to seeing her. Poor Megan had sounded hesitant about interrupting her at the clinic, but it was the only number she had, since Faith\u2019s home phone was unlisted.</p><p>In the intervening days since she\u2019d seen Troy, Faith had thought almost constantly about his visit. Perhaps she\u2019d been more unyielding than necessary. She also wondered\u2014had to wonder\u2014whether he\u2019d used Megan as an excuse. Megan didn\u2019t seem unreasonable and she clearly loved her father. Faith couldn\u2019t believe she wouldn\u2019t want him to be happy. Perhaps Troy had misread his daughter\u2019s attitude. Or perhaps he was inconsistent about his own feelings for Faith.</p><p>\u201cCould we get together?\u201d Megan had asked. \u201cI\u2019m having some problems with the baby blanket. I\u2019d really appreciate if you\u2019d take a look at it for me. I\u2019ll buy your lunch,\u201d she\u2019d added.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You don\u2019t need to pay for my lunch and I\u2019d be happy to look at the blanket.\u201d They arranged to meet at the deli Tuesday afternoon, during their lunch break.</p><p>Afterward Faith reviewed their brief telephone conversation. The two of them had developed a relationship, although Megan didn\u2019t know Faith had been involved with Troy. This lunch would be the perfect opportunity to tell her. Faith had no interest in the kind of secrecy Troy had tried to maintain. She\u2019d noticed early on that he hadn\u2019t wanted his daughter to know they were seeing each other. In any event, it couldn\u2019t possibly matter now.</p><p>When she got to the restaurant, Megan was already there, having secured a table by the window. She waved, and Faith walked across the crowded room to join her.</p><p>\u201cI came a bit early so I could grab us a table,\u201d Megan explained. She stood, quickly hugging Faith.</p><p>Megan looked healthy, Faith observed; her hair shone and her color was good. That clich\u00e9 about pregnant women glowing was certainly true for her. Knowing how close Troy was to his daughter, she assumed he was thrilled with the news of this pregnancy. If Megan had told him...When the opportunity arose, she\u2019d ask.</p><p>The waitress rushed over to their table, menus tucked under her arm and two water glasses in her hands. \u201cThe soup of the day is broccoli and cheese, and the special is a crab melt,\u201d she informed them.</p><p>Megan and Faith each ordered soup and decided to split the crab melt. They both wanted tea, so the waitress returned minutes later with a large blue teapot and two cups.</p><p>Megan brought out her knitting. \u201cI made a mistake way back here,\u201d she said, her brow furrowed as she stared down at the blanket. The pattern was relatively simple but did involve a four-row pattern. Faith knew, at a glance, what Megan had done wrong. She\u2019d repeated the third row twice.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d Faith asked, studying the half-completed blanket.</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t think it would, so I just kept knitting.\u201d</p><p>Faith had done that plenty of times herself. \u201cBut now, it seems glaring, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go back and correct it,\u201d Faith advised.</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re saying I should tear all this out?\u201d She sighed as if that was exactly what she\u2019d been afraid of hearing.</p><p>\u201cI do it quite a lot,\u201d Faith told her. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll tear out a section three or four times before I get it right. If the mistake\u2019s really minor, I might leave it in. In those cases I\u2019m usually the only one who knows it\u2019s there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a big mistake, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends on how you see it,\u201d Faith said carefully.</p><p>\u201cIf something like that bothers you, you tear it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I generally do. I feel better about the project, and it seems that whatever I reknit goes twice as fast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll rip away,\u201d Megan said, apparently satisfied with her decision. \u201cBy the way, I told my dad and Craig\u2019s parents about the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they were all excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially my dad.\u201d Megan returned her attention to her knitting.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll help you with that after lunch.\u201d</p><p>Their tea had steeped, and Megan put the knitting back in her bag, then filled their cups. \u201cThank you for meeting me like this,\u201d she said, engrossed in the task of pouring tea.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, Megan.\u201d She strongly suspected it wasn\u2019t merely\u2014or primarily\u2014the knitting question that had prompted Megan\u2019s invitation. \u201cIs there anything else I can do for you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Megan leaned back in her chair. \u201cI guess you could see through me asking to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. If there\u2019s something on your mind, though, I\u2019d like to help if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Faith, thank you,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cI needed to talk to someone, and I\u2019ve been on pins and needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored that you chose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly the right person,\u201d Megan insisted. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be honest with me and...and I trust your advice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Faith murmured, although she did feel a little guilty.</p><p>\u201cI told you how close I was to my mom when she was alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw her every single day. By the end she couldn\u2019t speak all that well, but she always listened. Dad and I were with her when she died and it was...beautiful.\u201d Megan tried to blink away tears. \u201cDeath can be beautiful, can\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I believe it can.\u201d Faith reached across the table and squeezed Megan\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cMom was sick for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Megan struggled visibly with her emotions and managed to control them. When she spoke again, her voice had gained strength and conviction. \u201cShortly after my mom died, my father implied there was someone he wanted to date. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how horrified I was.\u201d</p> <p>Faith\u2019s guilt quotient rose several degrees. Obviously Troy hadn\u2019t exaggerated his daughter\u2019s reaction, and she understood more clearly why he\u2019d hidden their relationship.</p><p>Megan pursed her lips. \u201cAt first I thought he was joking. Good grief, Mom had only been gone a few months.\u201d</p><p>Faith hesitated, unsure what to do. Megan didn\u2019t have any idea that the woman Troy had been seeing was her. Mentioning it now would be awkward beyond belief.</p><p>\u201cAs you said, your mother had been ill for a long time,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cI know, and I also realize how lonely my father must\u2019ve been all those years. The thing is, he was completely dedicated to my mother.\u201d</p><p>The waitress approached with their order and a spare plate. They spent a few minutes dividing the crab melt, tasting their soup, commenting on the food. Faith welcomed the interruption. She needed to think. It was wrong to accept Megan\u2019s confidences without telling Megan about her involvement with Troy.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s Troy Davis, the sheriff, isn\u2019t he?\u201d she asked. She had to introduce the topic somehow and this seemed a relatively safe way to start.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Megan\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI do. Your father and I went to high school together.\u201d She held her breath waiting for Megan\u2019s response.</p><p>Megan clapped her hands delightedly. \u201cOh, my goodness, I would never have guessed. That\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was a handsome young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Megan said, beaming with pride. \u201cI looked through his high school yearbooks and he was just so cute.\u201d</p><p>Faith had thought so, too. She still did.</p><p>\u201cSo your father wants to date again?\u201d</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cI told him not long ago that I think he should, but I\u2019m not sure he believed me, especially after the fuss I made earlier.... I regret that now, but it was such a shock. It didn\u2019t occur to me that he\u2019d be interested in anyone so soon after losing Mom.\u201d Megan lowered her gaze. \u201cIt was probably selfish of me, but I couldn\u2019t help feeling the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s entitled to their feelings, Megan. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.\u201d</p><p>Megan swallowed a spoonful of soup before she responded. \u201cDad isn\u2019t that old. He doesn\u2019t want to spend the rest of his life alone and I don\u2019t blame him. I mean, it wouldn\u2019t be easy seeing my dad with someone other than Mom, but I don\u2019t want to be selfish, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your feelings are only natural,\u201d Faith murmured. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re talking to your father about your concerns is important.\u201d</p><p>Faith took a bite of her meal, then broached the subject. \u201cThis might come as a surprise, but your father and I dated in high school.\u201d</p><p>Megan stared at her. \u201cYou and my dad?\u201d</p><p>Faith paused ever so slightly, then nodded. \u201cAs you said earlier, he was a popular guy.\u201d</p><p>Megan giggled. \u201cThat is so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked him a lot back then,\u201d Faith told her, using the past tense to keep the situation in perspective. Eventually, if there was an easy way to do so, she\u2019d lead into the fact that they\u2019d briefly reconnected following Sandy\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI think I could accept it better if Dad was dating someone like you,\u201d Megan said, picking up her spoon.</p><p>It was on the tip of her tongue to explain that she had been seeing Troy, when Megan continued.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t like this other woman at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther woman?\u201d Faith blurted out, unable to stop herself.</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cHer name\u2019s Sally, and she\u2019s a widow.\u201d</p><p>The chills that ran down Faith\u2019s back had nothing to do with the December weather. Troy Davis was just as inconsistent as she\u2019d suspected. Worse than that, he was fickle, swearing undying love one day and taking up with someone new the next.</p><p>\u201cI got the feeling he didn\u2019t want me to know about her,\u201d Megan said with a frown.</p><p>Faith rested her spoon beside her plate. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t,\u201d she said tartly. Apparently keeping his romances a secret was quite a pattern of his.</p><p>\u201cCraig says,\u201d Megan went on, \u201cthat some men need a woman in their lives. I would never have thought my father was one of them, but now I think he must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Faith asked, a little fearful of the response.</p><p>\u201cWell, because,\u201d Megan said. \u201cThere was that other woman earlier on and now there\u2019s Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be the same person,\u201d Faith suggested. How was she to know when Troy had started seeing this Sally? Her face burned with anger and mortification. It wouldn\u2019t surprise her to discover he\u2019d been dating both of them at the same time.</p><p>Megan was quiet for a moment. \u201cNow that you mention it,\u201d she said, \u201cSally might be the woman Dad alluded to after Mom died.\u201d</p><p>Faith was finding this rather difficult to take. Anger surged to the surface. How dare he treat her in such an underhanded way? He\u2019d led her to believe she was the only woman he cared about. He\u2019d even said he loved her!</p><p>\u201cSo you met...Sally,\u201d Faith said. Apparently the other woman was higher on the food chain than Faith, who\u2019d never been introduced to Troy\u2019s daughter.</p><p>Megan took a sip of her tea. \u201cCraig and I were out Christmas shopping and we ran into Dad and Sally at Wal-Mart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...see.\u201d That was an interesting note, considering how Troy felt about shopping.</p><p>\u201cI could see right away that Dad was embarrassed. He tried to pretend he didn\u2019t see me.\u201d</p><p>Faith nodded. She\u2019d just bet he did. \u201cWhat\u2019s Sally like?\u201d she asked. If this other woman was young, tall and blond, Faith didn\u2019t know if she could be held responsible for her actions.</p><p>\u201cSally? Oh, she\u2019s okay, I guess. She\u2019s around Dad\u2019s age and kind of...I don\u2019t know, dumpy-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about her?\u201d Faith asked, disgusted with herself for encouraging Megan.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, she\u2019s bossy,\u201d Megan said without hesitation.</p><p>\u201cBossy,\u201d Faith repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She said she and Dad were going out for sushi later and I happen to know my father hates sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like shopping, either.\u201d</p><p>That, Faith knew. \u201cSo, your father must be quite impressed with...Sally.\u201d Faith could barely get the other woman\u2019s name out of her mouth. She felt her anger growing and knew she should leave.</p><p>She resolutely picked up her purse and set it on her lap. Only a few days ago Troy had been at her front door trying to talk her into giving him another chance. The man juggled women the way a clown juggled balls. Hmm. Clown. Not a bad word for Mr. Sheriff Troy Davis.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d Megan asked, looking expectantly at Faith.</p><p>Caught up in her own emotions, Faith didn\u2019t understand what she was asking.</p><p>Megan, apparently sensing her confusion, explained, \u201cShould I say anything to Dad about Sally? I mean, I don\u2019t like her and if he does, well...I think it could be a problem. If she\u2019s that bossy with Dad, she will be with me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed. \u201cI suppose it really isn\u2019t any of my business. I should probably keep my nose out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I\u2019m not...well, quite sure what to tell you. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s just that...\u201d In the course of a few minutes, Faith had turned into a stuttering fool.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why my dad doesn\u2019t realize Sally\u2019s all wrong for him.\u201d Megan shook her head as if she couldn\u2019t fathom what had gotten into her father.</p><p>\u201cYou have a point there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen can be dense, can\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d Faith muttered, faking a short laugh.</p><p>The restaurant was filling up and it was time for both of them to return to work. The waitress had dropped off the bill at their table, and Faith reached for it.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d let me pay for your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Faith insisted, opening her purse. Her hands shook as she withdrew the cash from a small zippered pouch. \u201cThat should cover my half plus tip,\u201d she said, placing twelve dollars on the table.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your coming on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>Faith did manage a genuine smile. \u201cIt was my pleasure. I don\u2019t know that I was much help, though.\u201d This lunch had been instructive and in that sense probably more of a help to her than Megan. Her eyes had been opened in regard to Troy Davis. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you were,\u201d Megan said. \u201cReally, you were.\u201d</p><p>With a minimum of farewells, Faith was out the door. Because of the cold, she\u2019d driven to the restaurant and parked on a side street. Slipping into her car, she started the engine and the heater, then sat there as the anger subsided and became sadness instead.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>This was Emily Flemming\u2019s first day at her new job\u2014which was also the first job she\u2019d had since the early days of her marriage. The quilt shop was ideal for her. And it felt good to be part of the solution to their money woes. In fact, Emily felt good about a lot of things today, but mostly about Dave; her faith in him had been restored. Of course, there were still those diamond earrings to be explained, and she\u2019d ask him, in time. Emily was confident that he\u2019d have a logical explanation. She\u2019d actually forgotten about the earrings when they\u2019d spoken on Sunday. But she suspected Martha had given them to Dave, along with the watch, and he was waiting for Christmas to present them to her.</p> <p>In retrospect, Emily knew she\u2019d been foolish not to confront Dave with her suspicions earlier. If she had, she could\u2019ve saved herself, and her husband, a lot of grief.</p><p>Of course, Dave had been at fault, too. He should\u2019ve told her about their financial problems sooner. Until he\u2019d shown her the stack of unpaid bills, she\u2019d had no idea how precarious their situation was. The fact that her husband had taken a second job in order to make ends meet had come as a total shock.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, after Emily got the boys off to school, she drove to The Quilted Giraffe, in the same mall as several other local businesses, among them Get Nailed. Roxanne York\u2019s store sold a large range of fabrics, yarn and quilting supplies. Not only that, she offered classes of various kinds, including one by well-known fabric artist Shirley Bliss, who\u2019d taught a class there last year, before her husband\u2019s accident. Unfortunately Emily hadn\u2019t been able to attend because those sessions conflicted with a series of women\u2019s group meetings at the church. Emily would\u2019ve preferred the quilt classes but she\u2019d already committed herself and couldn\u2019t, in good conscience, back out.</p><p>Over the years Emily had frequented the store and become friends with the owner. On several occasions, Roxanne had asked Emily to work for her. She and Dave could hardly believe how easily everything had fallen into place. In minutes she had a job, with the hours she wanted.</p><p>When she announced that she\u2019d taken the job, her boys had immediately objected. They hadn\u2019t like the idea of Emily working and barraged her with questions and complaints.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens if I get sick and somebody has to pick me up at school?\u201d Matthew had asked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019ll bake cookies for after school?\u201d was Mark\u2019s main concern.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me,\u201d she assured her oldest son, \u201call you have to do is phone and I\u2019ll be right there. It won\u2019t be any different than if I was at home.\u201d</p><p>Matthew wasn\u2019t mollified and sulked the rest of the morning.</p><p>\u201cAs for cookies, I\u2019ll still bake them,\u201d she told Mark.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d he\u2019d asked skeptically.</p> <p>\u201cI promise.\u201d She\u2019d bought everything she needed for his favorite date bars. She usually baked them only during the Christmas season.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Roxanne,\u201d Emily said happily, entering the familiar store. Business was especially good at this time of year, and Roxanne was delighted with the extra help.</p><p>Her employer had a name badge for Emily, plus a special apron with half a dozen pockets. After putting her coat and purse in the back room, where she\u2019d been given shelf space with her name on it, Emily proudly donned the apron and tag. She was ready for business. Roxanne had an errand to run at the bank, and within ten minutes of her arrival, Emily was alone in the store.</p><p>That didn\u2019t last long. All too soon, before she\u2019d even finished reviewing the new inventory, she had her first customers.</p><p>\u201cEmily, you\u2019re working here now?\u201d Peggy Beldon asked, coming in with her friend Corrie McAfee. \u201cOh, I like your hair!\u201d Whether or not that was true, it was nice of her to say so.</p><p>Peggy was an excellent quilter. Her eye for color had long been the envy of everyone in the quilters\u2019 guild. She and her husband, Bob, owned Thyme and Tide, a local bed-and-breakfast that had received a glowing review in a national travel magazine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my very first day,\u201d Emily said, smiling. She\u2019d worked briefly at a large department store after she\u2019d married Dave and before the boys were born, and she found herself grateful for that experience.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you with anything?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Corrie responded. Corrie was new to quilting but had taken to it with enthusiasm. She\u2019d joined the quilters\u2019 guild, too. In Emily\u2019s opinion, Corrie couldn\u2019t possibly have a better mentor than Peggy Beldon.</p><p>The two women wandered along the rows of fabric.</p><p>Emily never liked it when a sales clerk hovered over her, so she remained at the cash register, waiting in case they required assistance. Roxanne would be back soon, if Peggy and Corrie had any questions Emily couldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cRoy\u2019s in one of his moods,\u201d Corrie was saying as she smoothed her hand over a bolt of fabric.</p><p>Emily knew all about men and their moods. Dave hadn\u2019t been himself for months; thankfully she now understood why. Money problems were the worst.</p><p>\u201cSomething on his mind?\u201d Peggy questioned.</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with Martha Evans\u2019s missing jewelry. Roy and the sheriff have been discussing it.\u201d</p><p>Emily came out from behind the register and moved closer to the two women. She occupied herself with a display of pattern books because she didn\u2019t want to look as if she was intentionally listening in on their conversation. In truth, however, she was curious to hear what they had to say.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Troy, Martha\u2019s daughters are terribly upset,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cThey\u2019ve come to him several times. Their mother hadn\u2019t insured the jewelry properly and her policy has a low loss limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine those pieces have a sentimental value, too.\u201d</p><p>Emily swallowed, feeling guilty about eavesdropping on their private conversation...and yet, she felt she had no choice. She needed all the information she could get.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt, but I couldn\u2019t help overhearing you. I\u2019ve been praying the jewelry will turn up,\u201d Emily said. It was all rather embarrassing because Troy was well aware that Dave was the one who\u2019d found Martha\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cI think everyone must be,\u201d Corrie commented. \u201cThe latest has to do with her husband\u2019s gold watch.\u201d</p><p>Emily\u2019s skin prickled.</p><p>\u201cMartha\u2019s oldest daughter...I\u2019ve forgotten her name. Roy said she was in to see the sheriff just yesterday. She says she\u2019d forgotten all about it. She wanted to add it to the list of what\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Emily returned to the front of the store. Her legs were shaky, like they might go out from under her. Dave claimed Martha had given him the gold watch. He\u2019d actually been wearing it! No thief in his right mind would flaunt such a thing. There had to be some mistake.</p><p>Thinking over their conversation, Emily remembered Dave telling her that he\u2019d been reluctant to accept such a valuable gift. He\u2019d told Emily that Martha had the watch entered into her will so there\u2019d be no question about it later.</p><p>\u201cMack\u2019s completely moved into his apartment,\u201d Corrie said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news,\u201d Peggy murmured as she lifted a bolt of fabric from the rack. \u201cI understand Will Jefferson\u2019s living above the gallery now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Mack said, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we still have an art gallery.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the conversation flew past Emily.</p><p>The two women each purchased several yards of fabric and then drifted out of the store, discussing where to have lunch.</p><p>Emily found herself reeling. The gold watch was said to be missing and now listed as one of the items that had been stolen? That had to be a misunderstanding. Well, it was one that could easily be resolved. Emily would see to it herself.</p><p>On her lunch break she drove to Allan Harris\u2019s office, which was empty except for a well-dressed young man at the front desk. He looked up when Emily walked in.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Emily Flemming,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d It was clear he hadn\u2019t made the connection between her and Dave.</p><p>\u201cPastor Flemming\u2019s my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d Instantly Geoff was on his feet, extending his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Geoff Duncan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Geoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke with Pastor Dave a little while ago, he agreed to give my fianc\u00e9e and me premarital counseling.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, unsure how to bring up the subject of the missing gold watch. She was convinced this was all a mix-up and once she showed Sheriff Davis a copy of the will, everything would be sorted out.</p><p>\u201cDave enjoys working with couples,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cDo you need an appointment?\u201d Geoff asked. \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Harris is currently in court and isn\u2019t expected back until late this afternoon. I can schedule you in then, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a real appointment.\u201d They were already in a financial bind, so Emily didn\u2019t want to complicate their problems by adding attorney\u2019s fees, especially for a matter as simple as this. \u201cI just need some information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps I can help,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI...I need to see something.\u201d It seemed terribly bold and perhaps unethical to ask for a copy of someone else\u2019s last will and testament.</p><p>Geoff stared at her blankly.</p><p>\u201cSomething my husband mentioned,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d Geoff\u2019s questioning eyes searched hers.</p><p>Emily hadn\u2019t come this far to leave without answers. Taking a deep breath, she plunged ahead. \u201cI need to see a copy of Martha Evans\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Geoff\u2019s eyes narrowed and he slowly shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIs it wrong of me to ask for something like that?\u201d</p><p>He clasped his hands in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, drat,\u201d Emily said, feeling like a fool.</p><p>\u201cIs it important?\u201d Geoff asked.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried. He must know she\u2019d never make a request like this if it wasn\u2019t. Emily considered it her responsibility to uphold her husband\u2019s good name in the community. Olivia Griffin had seen the watch; she wouldn\u2019t be shy about pointing the finger at Dave. And the earrings...Would they turn up on the list of stolen jewelry, too?</p><p>Geoff studied her for several seconds. \u201cCan you tell me why it\u2019s so important?\u201d</p><p>Emily wasn\u2019t sure how much she could explain without implicating her husband. \u201cAs you\u2019re probably aware, Dave found Martha\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose...I suppose it\u2019s only natural that, since things are missing, suspicion might fall on him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Geoff frowned. \u201cPastor Flemming wouldn\u2019t take anything that wasn\u2019t his.\u201d</p><p>Emily loved the way Geoff was so quick to defend her husband. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha gave Dave a gold watch that had belonged to her husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said tentatively.</p><p>\u201cI asked him about it when I found out he\u2019d lost it. The clasp was broken and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost the watch?\u201d An alarmed look appeared on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, it was recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness. A gold watch is expensive to replace.\u201d</p> <p>There would be no replacing it on their budget, but Emily didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to explain that. \u201cThankfully, Judge Griffin found it following a visit Dave made after her surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Geoff commented.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Dave\u2019s been wearing the watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. There wasn\u2019t any reason not to, seeing that it was a gift.\u201d</p><p>Geoff sat back in his chair. \u201cIt gets a bit sticky because of the missing jewelry, though, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Geoff understood the situation perfectly. Emily didn\u2019t dare mention the earrings. She\u2019d check into those, too, but so far, she was the only one who knew Dave had them.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Mrs. Evans\u2019s will have to do with all this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d she said, leaning toward his desk. \u201cMrs. Evans told him she\u2019d have the watch included in the will as a gift to my husband. I need to see if it\u2019s there as she intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you know why I need a copy of the will.\u201d</p><p>Geoff tapped his ballpoint pen. \u201cOh, boy,\u201d he muttered under his breath. \u201cI mentioned that Pastor Dave offered to counsel my fianc\u00e9 and me, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Emily nodded.</p><p>\u201cAs you might\u2019ve guessed, I don\u2019t make a lot of money as a legal assistant.\u201d</p> <p>Emily wouldn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cYour husband is such a kind man, he\u2019s giving us the counseling sessions gratis.\u201d</p><p>That sounded just like Dave, always willing to help others.</p><p>Geoff sighed and glanced around the room, although no one else was present. Lowering his voice, he told her, \u201cIf anyone finds out I gave you a copy of that will I could lose my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never ask that of you,\u201d Emily said immediately. \u201cI\u2019d never want you to take that risk.\u201d</p><p>Geoff raised his hand, stopping her. \u201cIf this clears your husband\u2019s name, then it\u2019ll be worth the risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Mr. Harris is in court right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it might make more sense for me just to read the will. I\u2019ll make a copy of the pertinent page and if anyone\u2014like Troy Davis\u2014asks him about it, then Dave will have the proof.\u201d</p><p>Geoff stood. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent suggestion,\u201d he said, walking toward a tall filing cabinet behind him.</p><p>Emily remained standing. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the pastor\u2019s doing me a favor, and if I can help him, I\u2019m happy to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be our little secret,\u201d Emily promised him. \u201cNo one ever needs to know. The only other person who\u2019d see it is the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be able to trust you.\u201d She could hear caution and concern in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou have my word I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d Emily\u2019s fingers itched to grab the will and start flipping pages.</p><p>Geoff located the file and removed it from the cabinet. He took out the stapled will, which he handed to Emily. She sank onto the leather sofa in the waiting area and began to rapidly turn pages. While she might not have a law degree, she realized that anything aside from the standard clauses would be on a separate schedule. Sure enough, she came across those pages toward the end.</p><p>She scanned the items listed. Martha had an extensive jewelry collection. Dave had once mentioned that she liked to reminisce about the traveling she and her husband, an executive in a paper products company, had done through the years. He\u2019d delighted in buying her beautiful jewelry, much of it antique, and each ring or pair of earrings had reminded her of a particular place. The schedule included two entire pages of itemized pieces, each with a designation of her chosen recipient.</p><p>Emily didn\u2019t see any notation having to do with the gold watch. She read the list a second time, more carefully now.</p><p>\u201cDid you find it?\u201d Geoff asked a bit anxiously.</p><p>Emily swallowed. \u201cIs there another section of the will not included here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind checking the file?\u201d she asked, making an effort to sound positive.</p><p>Geoff returned to the filing cabinet. \u201cOh, wait, there is something else here.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Emily relaxed. For a moment there, she\u2019d started to panic.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Geoff\u2019s voice lost some of its enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>\u201cThe jewelry. Mrs. Evans had several pairs of diamond earrings and some emerald brooches. The pictures are to distinguish which piece of jewelry she meant.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI believe Mr. Harris had been urging her to do this for some time because she wasn\u2019t adequately insured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see that?\u201d Emily asked. She knew it was risky to delve into this any further and yet she couldn\u2019t stop herself. She reached for the document.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the gold watch is in here,\u201d Geoff suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d Emily said with a confidence she didn\u2019t feel. Flipping through the pages, she glanced at each photograph until she saw the one she\u2019d hoped not to find.</p><p>The diamond earrings.</p><p>The pair she\u2019d accidentally discovered in Dave\u2019s suit pockets the afternoon of their wedding anniversary.</p><p>\u201cDo you have what you need?\u201d Geoff asked, his anxiety growing. If anyone were to step into the office and discover what he\u2019d done, he could be in serious trouble.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Emily said and handed him back the will and the papers.</p><p>Geoff immediately filed them and closed the drawer. He studied Emily. \u201cIs everything all right, Mrs. Flemming? You look pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cWell...I hope that answered all your questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your help,\u201d she said, evading the question.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone I let you see what was in Mrs. Evans\u2019s file,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo one will ever know,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Only a few hours earlier, Emily had felt that her marriage was rejuvenated. Dave loved her. He was doing two jobs because of the increase in their house payments. Now, in an effort to do her share, Emily had started work, too.</p><p>They needed money if they were going to hold on to the house she loved.</p><p>All Emily could do was hope Dave hadn\u2019t found another way of paying their bills...a way that could land him in prison.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>Teri Polgar was still reeling. The gynecologist\u2019s news had been a shock. An incredible, wonderful, joyous shock, but a shock nonetheless, and she wasn\u2019t sure Bobby was ready to hear it. She hadn\u2019t completely taken it in herself.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she murmured from the backseat of the car. \u201cPlease drive me over to Get Nailed.\u201d She needed to talk to someone, and she couldn\u2019t think of anyone better than her best friend, Rachel.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Miss Teri,\u201d James responded. He rarely had a comment or a question.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Teri started chewing on her thumbnail, then jerked her hand out of her mouth as soon as she realized what she was doing. Nail-biting was a bad habit of hers, one she\u2019d managed\u2014for the most part\u2014to break.</p><p>James pulled up in front of the Cedar Cove mall. Without giving him a chance to come around and open her door, she leaped out.</p><p>He stood uncertainly by the driver\u2019s door. \u201cWould you like me to wait?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Teri said over her shoulder. The mall was busier than she could ever remember seeing it. A woman standing beside a huge red kettle rang a bell, reminding others of those less fortunate than themselves. Teri automatically stuck a twenty-dollar bill inside. As kids growing up with an alcoholic mother, she and Christie had a very limited experience of Christmas, which might explain why she went overboard now. The only gifts they received came from charities like this one. Any extra cash her mother had was spent on booze.</p><p>The warmth inside the mall chased away the chill that had come over her. She moved quickly, eager to get to the salon. When she arrived, she walked directly through the waiting area and into the main body of the shop.</p><p>\u201cHey, look who\u2019s here!\u201d Jane called out. She wore a sprig of plastic holly in her hair as she worked on a customer\u2019s nails.</p><p>Teri was instantly surrounded by her friends.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri, it\u2019s so great to see you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew instinctively to Rachel. Rachel would reassure her. Rachel would help her put everything in perspective. Rachel would calm her nerves.</p><p>Intuitive as always, Rachel recognized immediately that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cCan you talk?\u201d Teri asked, grabbing her friend\u2019s hands.</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cI just finished my perm. Mrs. Holman\u2019s coming in for a cut and style, but I can put her off for a few minutes. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Teri released Rachel\u2019s hands and gestured weakly toward the break room. Her knees felt unsteady. \u201cLet\u2019s talk privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d Rachel\u2019s eyes turned soft with concern.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. Just...overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>Rachel led her to the back of the shop and pulled out two chairs. Teri nearly collapsed into hers. \u201cI had the ultrasound this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cBobby\u2019s so anxious about the baby. He had an important radio interview so he couldn\u2019t go with me. I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for him to be there, anyway. He worries too much.\u201d She exhaled slowly.</p><p>Rachel frowned. \u201cYour appointment was at nine, right?\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly noon. Why\u2019d it take so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause about a dozen people had to take a gander. Let me tell you there\u2019s nothing like having your stomach exposed to the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse. It could\u2019ve been your butt.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Rachel to look at the bright side.</p><p>\u201cEverything is all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d her friend asked, studying her closely.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d With trembling hands, Teri opened her large purse and took out the photograph the technician had given her. She laid it gingerly on the table, watching Rachel\u2019s face as she did.</p><p>Her friend studied the photo. \u201cTeri!\u201d she cried a moment later. \u201cYou\u2019re having twins!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook again,\u201d she said, her voice catching.</p><p>Rachel stared at the hazy picture and then gasped. Her hand went to her heart. Her eyes widened. She swallowed hard. \u201cTriplets?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Teri nodded. \u201cLast week the doctor told me he thought he heard two heartbeats, which is why he scheduled the ultrasound.\u201d The shock had yet to fade. Twins she could\u2019ve dealt with\u2014once she got used to the idea\u2014but triplets? Bobby was already a local celebrity and here she was, pregnant with triplets.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t using fertility drugs, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, no.\u201d That was one of the reasons the ultrasound had attracted so much attention. Natural triplets were exceedingly rare.</p><p>\u201cThis is why you\u2019ve been feeling so drained and tired.\u201d</p> <p>Since this was her first pregnancy, Teri hadn\u2019t known what to expect. \u201cI\u2019ve been really emotional, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOriginally, the doctor said I might\u2019ve been farther along than we assumed. I never keep track of my periods, so I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat extra weight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I made Dr. Joyce apologize about that. I told him I\u2019d been eating properly and that I didn\u2019t deserve to gain so much weight.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel grinned. \u201cI can imagine you\u2019re pretty shaken, but Teri, this is wonderful news. You\u2019ve told Bobby, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>That was the problem. \u201cI haven\u2019t said a word and I\u2019m not sure I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep this from your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe I should. He\u2019s worried about me giving birth to one baby and now you want me to casually announce I\u2019m having three? Three babies. Rachel! I\u2019m scared out of my wits.\u201d</p><p>Her friend dismissed her concerns a little too easily. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a terrific mother. And don\u2019t worry, Bobby will take it in stride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking one baby,\u201d Teri moaned, \u201cand now I learn I\u2019m practically going to have my own hockey team.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive yourself a chance to adjust first, and then tell Bobby,\u201d Rachel advised.</p><p>Teri was lost in her thoughts. She didn\u2019t have much of a role model when it came to mothering. She\u2019d already read six books on parenting. None of them had truly reassured her. Some of the information conflicted with other information. One theory clashed with the next.</p><p>\u201cThree babies,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do great\u2014and you can afford to hire help if you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nanny?\u201d That hadn\u2019t occurred to Teri. A nanny could come in part-time and help her feed and bathe the babies.</p><p>\u201cCan I see the picture again?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cI was so surprised when I looked at it that I didn\u2019t notice if they\u2019re boys or girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of each and the third\u2019s turned in such a way that it\u2019s impossible to tell,\u201d Teri told her friend. She buried her head in her hands.</p><p>\u201cI have news of my own,\u201d Rachel whispered. She checked over her shoulder as if she wanted to make sure no one else could hear.</p><p>Teri looked up.</p> <p>\u201cBruce and I are getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not news. I\u2019ve had Valentine\u2019s Day circled on my calendar for weeks.\u201d It was such a romantic date. Rachel wanted a nice, formal wedding and even though Teri would be almost six months pregnant, Rachel had asked her to serve as matron of honor.</p><p>\u201cThe reception\u2019s taking place in February,\u201d Rachel confided. \u201cBut...are you doing anything December twentieth?\u201d she asked, keeping her head lowered.</p><p>Teri stared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married early?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of waiting another two months? We both know what we want and the wait\u2019s driving us crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove in with him now,\u201d Teri suggested. \u201cPeople do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but there\u2019s Jolene to consider. We\u2019re trying to do everything properly for her sake. But Bruce is getting impatient and frankly, so am I. I\u2019m so much in love with him, I don\u2019t want to wait a minute longer than I have to.\u201d</p><p>Teri understood. Her own wedding had been a rushed affair. Bobby had insisted on marrying her rather than just living together. As Bobby had somehow known\u2014and as Teri had discovered\u2014it wasn\u2019t the same. Marriage was a promise. A promise that was often broken, but a promise nonetheless\u2014of enduring love, of enjoying the good and coping with the bad together. A marriage was more than a living arrangement, according to Bobby.</p><p>For a girl who\u2019d been around the block more times than the mailman, this told her everything she needed to know about Bobby. The memory of their wedding night brought quick tears to her eyes.</p><p>Rachel noticed right away. \u201cTeri, are you still worrying about the babies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I was just thinking about Bobby and how much I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him soon,\u201d Rachel urged. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be thrilled. Yes, he\u2019ll be concerned. Who could blame him? He probably won\u2019t let you out of his sight until May.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, April. The doctor wants to schedule a C-section for the last week of April. He\u2019s afraid of complications, so the babies are now due April twenty-seventh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Teri, this is so exciting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt certainly explains why I feel like Elsie the Cow at three and a half months,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cCan you picture me at eight?\u201d Teri didn\u2019t even want to think about it.</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019ve got you here,\u201d Rachel murmured. \u201cGive me an update on what\u2019s happening with your sister and James.\u201d</p><p>Teri knew the abrupt change of subject was Rachel\u2019s way of distracting her from her worries. Teri had been keeping her friend updated on the romance, such as it was, between Bobby\u2019s driver and her younger sister.</p><p>\u201cWhere did I leave off?\u201d Teri asked, leaning closer.</p><p>\u201cLast I heard, you and Bobby had invited them both to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that totally backfired. James refused to come.\u201d</p><p>Rachel rolled her eyes. \u201cMen are so stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thought exactly,\u201d Teri said. \u201cSomething must\u2019ve happened afterward, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. The next morning, my sister\u2019s car was still in the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie didn\u2019t leave? Do you mean to tell me she spent the night with James?\u201d</p><p>Teri shrugged. \u201cWell, she wasn\u2019t with us, so I assumed the same thing as you. But...I assumed wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where was she if she wasn\u2019t with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home.\u201d Teri had been discouraged by the news. \u201cApparently her car wouldn\u2019t start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Rachel sounded disappointed, too. \u201cSo James gave her a ride home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt appears that way. When I asked him about it, he was pretty closemouthed. I only know she was having car problems because James was out tinkering with her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fixed it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. The next time I looked out, the car was gone and so was James.\u201d She sighed. \u201cUnfortunately he wasn\u2019t away for long, which tells me he probably dropped off the car without saying a word to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with that man?\u201d Rachel asked, groaning theatrically. Ever since the kidnapping incident, she\u2019d taken great interest in the health and happiness of James Wilbur.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, I know my sister. She\u2019s falling for James, but she\u2019s fighting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames would certainly be an improvement over her ex,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cA serial killer would be an improvement over her ex,\u201d Teri joked. \u201cWell, not really, but you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Rachel glanced out at the shop. Her client was waiting at her station; someone, most likely Jane, had already put a plastic cape around her shoulders and given her the current Vogue. \u201cI need to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for listening, Rach.\u201d</p><p>They stood and hugged. \u201cKeep December twentieth hush-hush, okay?\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t told anyone else yet, not even Jolene. Pastor Flemming offered to marry us in the church that afternoon. It\u2019ll be a private ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m invited, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I can\u2019t get married without my matron of honor, can I? Not to mention her husband.\u201d</p><p>Teri gently squeezed her friend\u2019s arm. \u201cBobby and I will be there,\u201d she promised. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cAnyway, I should go. Some of us still work for a living.\u201d Her good-natured laugh told Teri there was no jealousy in her words. Rachel was merely teasing, exercising her privilege as best friend.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell Bobby about the babies,\u201d Rachel said as they left the break room. \u201cAnd call me tonight. He\u2019s going to be thrilled,\u201d she insisted again.</p><p>Teri wished she felt as confident as Rachel. She was the one who\u2019d wanted to get pregnant. Bobby had been afraid for her physical safety and thought they should wait. The news that they were having a multiple birth was bound to send him into a panic.</p><p>As soon as Teri left the mall, James brought the limousine toward her. Before she could open the door, he was out of the car and opening it for her. Once she was tucked inside, he took his position behind the wheel.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, Miss Teri?\u201d he asked with a look of concern.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think so. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>James started the engine. \u201cYour doctor\u2019s appointment was exceptionally lengthy and you seemed upset. Then you asked me to take you directly to the salon\u2014to Miss Rachel, I presume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel\u2019s my closest friend. She\u2019s\u2014Oh, sorry.\u201d Her cell phone interrupted her. She took it from her purse and saw at a glance that it was her sister.</p><p>\u201cHi, Christie,\u201d she said, flipping it open. She watched as James\u2019s shoulders tightened.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Christie returned. \u201cI called the house and Bobby said you weren\u2019t home from your appointment yet. Are you doing anything this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind giving me a haircut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Can you come around four?\u201d That should leave ample time to tell Bobby her news, with a few hours built in to let him adjust. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there at four.\u201d Her sister hesitated. \u201cDo you think James will be around?\u201d</p><p>Teri squelched a smile. \u201cI imagine so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe fixed my car,\u201d Christie said, speaking quickly. \u201cSo I bought him a little gift as a thank-you. Could you give it to him for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should do it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay it by ear, then,\u201d Teri said. \u201cLet\u2019s see how things go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They hung up soon after that and Teri stuck her cell phone back inside her purse. \u201cMy sister\u2019s stopping by later this afternoon,\u201d she said blandly.</p><p>\u201cIs there still a problem with her vehicle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf there is, she didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer car isn\u2019t going to last much longer, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d James shook his head. \u201cShe needs new tires, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Teri was worried about Christie driving that old rattletrap. But she\u2019d worry about it another day.</p><p>\u201cMy sister has something for you. A small token of appreciation for helping her with the car,\u201d Teri said, studying his reaction.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a good heart, James.\u201d</p> <p>In the rearview mirror she saw his face redden at her praise.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>By the time they arrived at the house on Seaside Avenue, Bobby was outside pacing. \u201cWhat took so long?\u201d he demanded, thrusting his head into the car as soon as James had opened her door.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Bobby,\u201d Teri said calmly. \u201cBut I do have news.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looked perplexed\u2014and fearful. \u201cNews from the doctor? What kind of news?\u201d He helped Teri out of the car, then took her hand as they walked into the house.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better sit down,\u201d Teri suggested.</p><p>His face went, if possible, even paler. He chose the sofa and Teri sat on his lap, looping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say if I told you we\u2019re having twins?\u201d she asked, thinking she\u2019d ease him into the idea of a multiple birth.</p><p>\u201cTwins!\u201d He nearly unseated her. \u201cTwins,\u201d he repeated, as a slow grin slid into place. \u201cTwins,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that exciting?\u201d</p><p>Bobby nodded. \u201cA boy and a girl?\u201d</p> <p>Teri cleared her throat, which immediately told Bobby there was something else. He looked at her warily.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, what\u2019s one more?\u201d</p><p>He frowned as only Bobby could. \u201cOne more what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want another baby?\u201d He seemed completely confused.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cthere already is another baby.\u201d</p><p>It took him a moment to catch on. His eyes met hers. \u201cAre...are you t-telling me we\u2019re having t-triplets?\u201d he stammered.</p><p>Teri nodded.</p> <p>\u201cTriplets,\u201d he said again, and he started to laugh. Sober, serious Bobby Polgar laughed, a rich, joyous sound that seemed to come from deep inside him. Then he was hugging and kissing her, proving in every possible way how much he loved his wife.</p><p>And Teri loved Bobby right back.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Christie knocked politely at James\u2019s apartment door. Drawing in a deep breath, she stepped back and squared her shoulders. As she waited she raised her hand to her hair. Teri had cut it shorter than it\u2019d been in years. Christie had been wearing it shoulder-length, but this new style suited her and was easy to care for.</p><p>James answered her knock.</p><p>For a moment all they did was stare at each other.</p><p>Then, remembering the reason for her visit, Christie thrust out a small wrapped package. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>James glanced down at it, seemingly embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cI...I wanted to thank you for fixing my car,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI was able to get the alternator working. But you\u2019re going to need a new car. Soon.\u201d With that he accepted the gift, still looking uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t afford a new car,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even afford to have this one fixed on what I make.\u201d Living alone, it was difficult enough to cover rent and pay off her ex-husband\u2019s debts, plus meet all her other expenses, so overtime during the Christmas shopping season was a real bonus.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the gift,\u201d James murmured, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big.\u201d She hoped he liked Almond Roca candy, which was made locally. Wal-Mart had it on sale, and she\u2019d bought some pretty silver wrap.</p><p>\u201cThis was nice of you.\u201d</p><p>She began to turn around and walk back down the stairs.</p><p>James stopped her. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t be driving that car anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>She lifted her shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d She was on borrowed time with this vehicle and she knew it. In the next little while, something else would go wrong. The car would die, and that would be that. Then she\u2019d have to investigate public transportation, and in a town the size of Cedar Cove, there weren\u2019t a lot of options. In the meantime, James had made it possible for her to drive to work, at least for this week, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>He continued to hold the box of candy in both hands, as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with it.</p><p>\u201cCould I ask you something?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou cut your hair,\u201d he said, apparently just noticing.</p><p>\u201cTeri did. Do you like it?\u201d Her hand went to the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou look different.\u201d</p><p>His answer probably meant he didn\u2019t approve of the change. Every man she\u2019d ever dated had wanted her to keep her hair long. Not that she was exactly dating James, but that wasn\u2019t the point. Christie didn\u2019t understand men\u2019s attitudes toward women\u2019s hair, although Teri no doubt had some opinions on that subject.</p><p>He\u2019d evaded her question, but she wasn\u2019t going to let him sidetrack her. So she asked another one. \u201cWhy\u2019d you kiss me Monday night?\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s mouth was a stern line. \u201cDo you want me to apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to know why.\u201d Naturally she hoped he\u2019d admit he was attracted to her, that she\u2019d driven him mad with longing. That was a bit melodramatic\u2014perhaps, but it was nice to dream.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you\u2019d rather not,\u201d she said when it was obvious he didn\u2019t plan to answer her question. Maybe he didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cI was relieved that you were willing to listen to reason that night,\u201d he finally told her. \u201cYou seemed so angry at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd irrational.\u201d</p><p>She had to agree. But she\u2019d been desperate. He would\u2019ve felt the same way if it\u2019d been his car and he didn\u2019t have the money to fix it, especially if he needed to get to work at six the next morning.</p><p>\u201cOkay, the first kiss was about you feeling relieved,\u201d she said. That had been gentle, almost a brushing against her lips. \u201cWhat about the second kiss?\u201d She\u2019d felt his longing and his need, and it\u2019d matched her own.</p><p>He blinked hard. \u201cThat was pure selfishness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her hand reached for the stair railing.</p><p>\u201cDid it shock you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d James apparently didn\u2019t know much about her past. One hungry kiss wasn\u2019t likely to offend her. There\u2019d been a sweetness in it, an appreciation. She would hardly have called it \u201cselfish.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t stop her, she started reluctantly down the stairs. With each step she prayed James would say something to delay her departure. There was nothing else she could come up with; as it was, she\u2019d already asked every question she could think of. It was dark now, time to head home. The December sky was clear and bright with stars.</p><p>\u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of his voice, she whirled around with such speed she nearly slid off the step. \u201cYes?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cBe careful driving, understand?\u201d</p><p>Her disappointment was like a weight that made her shoulders droop and her feet drag. But she didn\u2019t know why she should care if James invited her into his apartment. Why did it matter whether or not he wanted to see her again? There were plenty of men who\u2019d welcome her company. So what if he wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cYour tires are nearly bald.\u201d</p><p>She pretended not to hear him. Her ego had endured as much of a battering as it could take. What did it matter, anyway? Besides, she didn\u2019t even like him with his fussy manners and his formal speech. Fine. She wouldn\u2019t go out of her way for him again.</p><p>Driving home, she went past The Pink Poodle and was tempted to stop in. Beer cost money, though; she might be in the mood to drown her sorrows, but there were more productive ways to while away an evening. Instead, she drove down to the waterfront park, which was gaily decorated for Christmas. There\u2019d been a notice in the Wal-Mart employee lounge indicating that the high school band was giving a Christmas concert that evening. She could use a bit of holiday cheer.</p><p>She was fortunate to find a parking space. As she walked toward the gazebo and the public seating, she recognized several customers\u2014people she\u2019d seen in her cash register line. Sheriff Davis was there with a young couple, obviously his daughter, judging by the family resemblance, and his son-in-law.</p><p>Charlotte and Ben Rhodes were seated in the front row. Everyone in town knew them. Charlotte had gone shopping that afternoon, picking up supplies for her cruise. She\u2019d been high-spirited, excited about the trip, and they\u2019d chatted away as if they were old friends.</p><p>Next she saw Grace Harding from the library. She and her husband stood on the outskirts of the crowd. He\u2019d slipped his arm around her waist, and her head rested against his shoulder. There was something touching about the pose, something that bespoke tenderness and trust. Beside Grace were two young women and their husbands and families. Each held a baby in her arms. Christie knew they were Grace\u2019s daughters, but she couldn\u2019t remember their names.</p><p>The high school band began to play Christmas music, starting with a lively \u201cJingle Bells,\u201d accompanied by actual sleigh bells. By the time they got to \u201cO, Little Town of Bethlehem,\u201d Christie felt the overwhelming urge to cry. All these people around her had someone who cared about them. Someone to whom they were special. Everyone except her. She could vanish off the face of the earth and no one would notice. Well, Teri and maybe their brother, Johnny, but not for days or even weeks.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes and she dashed them away with her bare hand. Being alone at Christmas was the worst. Teri had invited her for Christmas dinner, but it was a pity invite. Johnny already had plans to spend the day with his new girlfriend\u2019s family, so there\u2019d only be Christie. She hadn\u2019t given Teri an answer yet. She figured she\u2019d just be in the way. Bobby and Teri didn\u2019t need her intruding on their home and their lives, especially now that Teri was pregnant with triplets. She didn\u2019t need the extra bother of guests at her Christmas celebration.</p><p>Feeling morose and sorry for herself, Christie left the park and strolled along the waterfront. She could still hear the music as she paused in front of the marina and watched the sailboats. Many of them had Christmas lights strung on their masts, and a few had Christmas trees on their decks.</p><p>As she turned away, ready to go back to her car, she saw that the library had set up a huge barrel to collect new toys for disadvantaged children. Growing up, she\u2019d been one of those children.</p><p>That was when she knew exactly how she wanted to spend Christmas. She\u2019d volunteer to deliver food baskets and gifts. Instead of moping around, filled with self-pity, she\u2019d do something positive. More than one person had generously reached out to her when she was a hurting little girl, and now it was her turn to help others.</p><p>Yes, that was what she\u2019d do. And if she couldn\u2019t deliver gifts, perhaps she could serve dinner at a nursing home Christmas Day.</p><p>Feeling better, Christie hurried back to her car and drove home. When she got there, she was astonished to see James parked outside her apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He climbed out of his car when she stepped out of hers.</p><p>Her heart pounded furiously as he came toward her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a volunteer,\u201d she said excitedly, needing to tell someone about her momentous decision.</p><p>He blinked as though she\u2019d spoken in a foreign language.</p> <p>\u201cIf I can, I\u2019m going to deliver charity baskets and gifts to underprivileged children on Christmas Eve.\u201d She laughed at his puzzled expression. \u201cI was feeling sorry for myself, and then it occurred to me that what I need to do is reach out to someone else.\u201d All at once she realized that she didn\u2019t know why he was there.</p><p>She stopped and waited for him to tell her.</p><p>James never seemed to find it easy to explain himself.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything, she asked, \u201cDo you want to volunteer with me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you like...\u201d She almost said a beer. \u201cTea,\u201d she offered instead.</p><p>\u201cYes, please,\u201d he said with a grin.</p><p>She led him into her apartment, which was clean for a change. It wasn\u2019t the Ritz, by any means, but at least it was comfortable. In a burst of holiday enthusiasm she\u2019d strung a tinsel garland across her drapery rod and stuck a ceramic snowman in the middle of her coffee table.</p><p>James folded his coat neatly and laid it on the back of her sofa.</p><p>\u201cDid you, um, have a reason for coming?\u201d she asked as she filled her teakettle.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d he asked, which seemed to be a habit of his\u2014answering a question with a question.</p> <p>\u201cDown to the waterfront. The high school band\u2019s is putting on a Christmas concert. I listened to the music for a while and that\u2019s when I decided to be a volunteer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy at Christmas, though?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to tell him she didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. It was too personal, too...embarrassing. Too sad. \u201cPayback,\u201d she told him. \u201cSomeone was kind to me when I was a little girl without a gift at Christmas. Now I\u2019m returning that kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very thoughtful thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Rather than discuss the worthiness of her idea, she said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question. Why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you. I thought you\u2019d go to The Pink Poodle.\u201d</p><p>She almost had. \u201cYou wanted to see me. That\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>He nodded rather sheepishly.</p> <p>\u201cI like you, James.\u201d</p><p>There it was\u2014without a lot of fancy words to dress it up\u2014just the plain truth. He could accept it or reject it and frankly, she wasn\u2019t sure which he\u2019d do.</p><p>His gaze held hers for a moment, and then the most enchanting smile fell into place. \u201cI like you, too.\u201d</p><p>That was as big an admission as he\u2019d ever made in their decidedly odd relationship. Fearing he\u2019d see the joy it gave her, she busied herself getting tea bags and sugar from the cupboard.</p><p>As soon as their tea was ready, she carried the two mugs to the small coffee table and set them on her Christmas coasters. There was only the one sofa, so she had no choice but to sit next to James.</p><p>He waited until she\u2019d sipped from her tea before he picked up his own mug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d she said, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d He paused, then added, \u201cI like your hair.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d almost forgotten she\u2019d had it cut. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very pretty.\u201d</p><p>Christie was accustomed to flattery. Most men seemed to know exactly what to say in order to get what they wanted from her. She listened to their lies because she so badly needed to believe they were true. James\u2019s three words meant more to her than any compliment she\u2019d ever received.</p><p>For several minutes she couldn\u2019t respond. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured at last. \u201cDo you want to kiss me again?\u201d she asked, only half joking.</p><p>He took her seriously. \u201cYes, but not yet. Later.\u201d</p><p>She nearly laughed out loud. Later? Any other man would\u2019ve had her in bed by now. They would\u2019ve found more interesting ways of keeping warm than sipping tea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been Bobby\u2019s driver for how many years?\u201d She waited for him to answer. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBobby and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been friends for a long time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched between them. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to know anything else, is that it?\u201d</p><p>He shifted uneasily. \u201cMaybe now,\u201d he said, leaning forward to set his mug on the coaster.</p><p>She frowned, not understanding. \u201cMaybe now what?\u201d</p><p>He smiled that sweet boyish smile of his and took her tea out of her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s time to kiss again.\u201d He moved closer and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>Christie nearly gasped at the explosive desire that erupted inside her. \u201cJames,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh, James.\u201d She locked her arms around his neck and kissed him back. But he wouldn\u2019t allow her to deepen the contact. He maintained his gentle pressure until she thought she\u2019d melt at his feet if he didn\u2019t hurry up and kiss her properly.</p><p>Then his hands were in her newly short hair. He angled his mouth over hers and showed her that there was no need to hurry, after all. He was hers and she was his.</p><p>When he released her, Christie collapsed against the back of the sofa. Her eyes were still shut and she couldn\u2019t catch her breath for what seemed like minutes.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cThat was nice,\u201d he agreed. He, too, was breathing hard.</p><p>She leaned foreward and touched her forehead to his. \u201cJames, there are things you don\u2019t know about me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me.\u201d She wanted to tell him the truth so there\u2019d be no surprises later on. \u201cI\u2019ve been married before.... It wasn\u2019t a good marriage.\u201d She gave him some of the details, just enough so he\u2019d understand that her husband hadn\u2019t been her first lover nor had he been her last.</p><p>James listened quietly, then held and kissed her again. Occasionally he\u2019d ask a question. When tears fell from her eyes, he kissed them away. Once she\u2019d finished her confession, she buried her head in his shoulder.</p><p>James cradled her with comforting hands. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t figure out why he\u2019d say that and looked up. His eyes met hers. \u201cTelling me all this couldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m important to you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cImportant enough that I want you to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple. \u201cThe truth is a precious gift.\u201d</p><p>He continued to hold her. Then, reluctant to leave, he murmured against her hair, \u201cI have to get back to the house.\u201d When he came to his feet, he seemed a bit unsteady. \u201cThank you, Christie,\u201d he said a second time.</p><p>She gestured weakly, not knowing what to say. A plea to see him again was on the tip of her tongue. She swallowed the question unasked. He would call her. She saw it in his eyes. She was important to him, too, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have come. She\u2019d poured out her heart to him, and he\u2019d accepted what she had to say without censure. He knew everything about her now; she\u2019d held nothing back. She hated that he had to go.</p><p>After one last kiss, James saw himself out, which was a good thing. Her legs didn\u2019t seem to work properly. He\u2019d been gone for at least five minutes before she found the strength to stand.</p><p>She\u2019d never done anything so bold as to lay out her sins for a man to examine. In a strange way she felt better. Telling James everything had unexpectedly freed her. At first she was afraid she\u2019d chase him away, but nothing could be further from the truth. His touch had been gentle, his words kind and encouraging. He hadn\u2019t said he loved her, but he did. She knew it. She felt it. And Christie knew something else.</p><p>She loved him, too.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cMom, I know you\u2019re disappointed,\u201d Linnette said into her cell phone. She was just as disappointed, but she couldn\u2019t possibly return to Cedar Cove for Christmas. Not if she was going to accomplish everything that needed to be done for the Buffalo Valley medical clinic to open on schedule.</p><p>Linnette cast an apologetic glance at Pete Mason. He\u2019d invited her to lunch and they sat in the Three of a Kind restaurant and bar, where Linnette had, until recently, worked as a waitress. They\u2019d just been served their meal and Linnette had taken a couple of bites of her sandwich when her cell phone rang. She wished she hadn\u2019t answered it, but too late now.</p><p>\u201cYou told us over Thanksgiving you\u2019d make it home for Christmas,\u201d her mother protested.</p><p>\u201cI know I did, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She already felt guilty, and hearing the frustration in her mother\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t helping.</p><p>Silence followed Linnette\u2019s announcement. Repressing a sigh, she wondered what else she could say to comfort Corrie\u2014and herself. She missed her family and her friends in Cedar Cove. She\u2019d like nothing better than to spend the holidays at her parents\u2019 home. But she was deeply involved with the medical clinic, which would be opening\u2014she hoped\u2014by February. Not only that, she didn\u2019t have the extra money to make such a trip. Airfares at this time of year were simply out of reach.</p><p>\u201cMack will be with you. And Gloria will, too. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d Her mother didn\u2019t hide her distress. \u201cThey\u2019re both the most recent hires, so I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll end up working. It won\u2019t be Christmas without my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said again. Changing the subject, she asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Mack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. He\u2019s settling into his job with the fire department. He seems to be enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he would,\u201d Linnette murmured.</p><p>\u201cI had a surprise for you, too,\u201d her mother lamented.</p><p>\u201cA...surprise?\u201d Linnette felt guilty enough.</p><p>\u201cYes. Bob Beldon got your father and your brother parts in the live Nativity scene at the church.\u201d</p><p>Linnette could hardly believe it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking! Dad\u2014and Mack, too?\u201d She could imagine Mack enjoying such an event, but it must\u2019ve taken some fast talking to get her father to agree.</p><p>\u201cMack\u2019s playing a shepherd and your father\u2019s one of the Wise Men.\u201d</p><p>Linnette giggled, thinking she\u2019d love to see that. \u201cHow did Pastor Flemming and Mr. Beldon convince Dad to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, but whatever they said worked.\u201d Her mother finally seemed to relax. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen Mack chasing sheep at the first practice,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cReal sheep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. We\u2019ve got a camel, too,\u201d Corrie bragged. \u201cI have no idea how Pastor Dave managed it, but he found a camel for your father. Roy\u2019s going to lead him\u2014or is it her?\u2014around the stable where Jesus, Mary and Joseph are on display.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDad...and a camel?\u201d</p><p>Pete\u2019s eyebrows shot up and Linnette sent him a smile.</p><p>\u201cCamels can be nasty. I don\u2019t think anyone but your father could handle him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear they spit and bite,\u201d Linnette said, enjoying this.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes. You heard right.\u201d She paused. \u201cGloria and I laughed ourselves silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad must\u2019ve been seriously annoyed.\u201d The image of her father in robe and sandals struggling with a recalcitrant camel almost made her rethink the possibility of going home.</p><p>\u201cWe were going to surprise you,\u201d her mother was saying in that wistful tone.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll take lots of pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. In fact, I bought myself an early Christmas gift\u2014a digital camera. I can even take movies. Your dad\u2019s showing me how it works.\u201d Linnette knew that her father, as a private investigator, had used one for years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll e-mail you a movie of the Nativity scene. Or,\u201d she added dryly, \u201cI\u2019ll get Roy to send it for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please do. I want to see it all.\u201d Linnette suddenly felt more homesick than she had the entire time she\u2019d been here. This would be her first Christmas away from her family.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you do about Christmas if you won\u2019t be home?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Linnette turned to Pete and apologized that this conversation was taking so long. She gestured for him to continue eating his lunch, which he did. \u201cI\u2019m spending the day with Hassie Knight. We\u2019ll make a small dinner and play cards.\u201d Hassie owned Knight\u2019s Pharmacy and was the inspiration behind the medical clinic. She\u2019d formed a committee that included Linnette and several local businesspeople; they were working with state agencies and applying for a grant.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be with Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, Mom. He has his own family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned him quite a few times now. But I\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re sensible enough not to get serious about this farmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to say any more than that; her mother knew what she meant. Linnette\u2019s relationship with Cal Washburn was over, and she didn\u2019t need a rebound romance. The last news she\u2019d received was that Cal and Vicki were now married and had moved to Wyoming. She wished them every happiness\u2014and she was sincere in that.</p><p>The funny thing was, she didn\u2019t feel any lingering pain over losing Cal. In retrospect, their break-up was probably for the best. She and Cal had been too different in both their interests and expectations. She\u2019d loved him, and she\u2019d been devastated when he ended the relationship, but as with most life experiences, Linnette had learned valuable lessons.</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s in Wyoming,\u201d her mother said, as if reading Linnette\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said without emotion. \u201cHow\u2019s Judge Griffin doing?\u201d she asked, moving to another subject. During their previous conversation, her mother had told her that Olivia had suffered a medical setback.</p><p>\u201cMuch, much better. She\u2019s home from the hospital and the infection\u2019s under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard for her husband,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cOh,\u201d she added, \u201cspeaking of Jack Griffin, he wrote a hilarious piece on the Nativity scene. There was a practice with the animals\u2014they\u2019re being kept at Cliff Harding\u2019s place,\u201d she said quickly, and Linnette suspected she was worried about referring to Cliff\u2019s ranch, since Cal had lived and worked there, and Linnette would always associate it with him.</p> <p>\u201cSend me the article, okay, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Her mother sighed again. \u201cI do wish you could come for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, please. Don\u2019t make me feel worse.\u201d Any more of this and she\u2019d start to cry. \u201cThe airfare is outrageous and it isn\u2019t safe for me to be driving all that way by myself in winter.\u201d She looked out the window, her gaze falling on a two-foot-high bank of snow.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I will pay for your ticket.\u201d</p><p>The offer was tempting, but Linnette couldn\u2019t let them do that. \u201cNo, Mom, I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019ll be home for a visit soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA visit,\u201d her mother repeated slowly, her meaning clear. Corrie wanted Linnette to move back to Cedar Cove, especially now that Cal and Vicki were gone.</p><p>The truth was that Linnette hadn\u2019t once considered doing so. She\u2019d found solace in this small Dakota town. When she\u2019d graduated as a physician assistant, it had always been her goal to use her medical skills in an out-of-the-way area, some rural community where the need was greatest.</p><p>Her parents, particularly her mother, had been unhappy when she left her job at the medical clinic in Cedar Cove. But more than ever, Linnette realized it\u2019d been the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you\u2019re spending Christmas Day,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to open gifts around ten. I suppose I can mail yours, although I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll reach you in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, thank you, but I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have an apartment now?\u201d</p><p>Linnette nearly laughed out loud. Never having seen Buffalo Valley, her mother couldn\u2019t begin to guess what this place was like. Until recently, she\u2019d lived in a small room on the second floor of Three of a Kind. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any apartments here, Mom. At the moment I\u2019m renting a room from Hassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt works out well for both of us.\u201d If everything went as she hoped, Linnette would have living quarters at the medical clinic. The state needed to approve all this, of course. The house they planned to use, which had been vacant for several years, would require a lot of renovation. Once the funding approval came through, at least twenty men and women\u2014even teenagers\u2014were ready, willing and able to tackle the project.</p><p>\u201cYou left a lovely apartment here,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cOne with a great view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mack told me he\u2019s moving in! You must be pleased about that. And speaking of Mack, is there anyone special in his life these days?\u201d</p><p>Her mother exhaled. \u201cNot anyone he\u2019s mentioned, but then you know your brother\u2014he\u2019s pretty tight-lipped about anything personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Linnette said. She\u2019d have to have a conversation with him soon, see what she could ferret out. \u201cListen, Mom, I\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>Her mother tried one more time. \u201cAre you positive you won\u2019t let your father and me buy you an airline ticket home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. I\u2019ll call on Christmas Day, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be the same,\u201d Corrie muttered.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>They said goodbye and Linnette closed her cell phone, setting it on the table.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s awfully disappointed, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Pete asked, his blue eyes studying her. \u201cAnd so are you.\u201d</p><p>Linnette shrugged, wanting to make light of her own disappointment. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m a big girl. I don\u2019t have to rush home to my family for the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d like to be there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course.\u201d She picked up her bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, but her appetite had vanished. Putting it back on her plate, she shoved it aside, leaving the bag of potato chips untouched.</p><p>Elbows on the table, Linnette surveyed the restaurant with its handful of customers. She knew it well; after all, Buffalo Bob Carr had hired her when she ended up in this town, low on cash and looking for a place to stay.</p><p>Now that she was here, however, she couldn\u2019t imagine living anywhere else. Not even Cedar Cove.</p><p>Bob came out from the kitchen, wearing a stained white apron. \u201cThe cream of mushroom soup\u2019s ready, Pete, if you\u2019re still interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing,\u201d Pete called back.</p><p>\u201cYou can finish my sandwich if you want,\u201d Linnette told him. Pete was six-three and had a hearty appetite.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. You should have it.\u201d</p><p>Bob carried out a large bowl of soup, which he deposited in front of Pete. He glanced at Linnette. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked with a concerned frown.</p><p>\u201cOf course...I\u2019m just not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your lack of appetite that worries me. It\u2019s the miserable look on your face,\u201d he said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI am not miserable,\u201d she said and then, to prove her point, she smiled up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s December. Christmas is around the corner. How can I possibly be blue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of \u2018Blue Christmas,\u2019 haven\u2019t you?\u201d Buffalo Bob asked. \u201cElvis sang that for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou \u2018Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,\u2019 Bob,\u201d she bantered back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you too,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cBut seriously, Linnette\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s physical appearance led strangers to assume he was a biker. He was a burly man who always wore jeans and a leather vest over a short-sleeved T-shirt. His thin hair was tied in a ponytail that hung nearly to the middle of his back. He might seem menacing, but as Linnette had immediately discovered, he had a huge heart. Watching him with his wife, Merrilee, and their three kids had told her exactly what kind of person he was.</p><p>Pete finished his sandwich and soup and reached for the bill. \u201cMy treat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, feeling a little chagrined. She hadn\u2019t been good company, especially with her mother phoning in the middle of their lunch. She realized a lengthy conversation at a restaurant was rude, but she couldn\u2019t seem to do much about it. Pete, however, didn\u2019t take offense easily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get that part my brother needs and head back to the farm,\u201d he said.</p><p>He\u2019d driven the hour into town to pick up a tractor part Dennis Urlacher had ordered for them. Linnette knew he jumped at any excuse to come to town\u2014because of her. Frankly she enjoyed his visits. Pete had made his feelings plain and she felt comfortable with him. It was too soon to make a commitment, although she sensed he\u2019d like that. They were still in the getting-to-know-you stage, and Linnette was in absolutely no rush to leap into another relationship as intense as the one she\u2019d had with Cal.</p><p>\u201cThe movie\u2019s changing this weekend,\u201d Pete said. He pulled his wallet out of his hip pocket and placed twenty dollars on the table. \u201cAre you interested? I\u2019ll buy you the biggest popcorn they have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to bribe me, Pete. I\u2019d love to go to the movie.\u201d The theater only had one screen, unlike the multiplex in Cedar Cove, and the movies were often second-run, weeks if not months behind the major markets. When she\u2019d first moved to town, Linnette had been amused to see the theater playing shows that were just a week or two from being released on DVD.</p><p>Pete\u2019s grin was as big as if she\u2019d announced he\u2019d won the state lottery. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at Hassie\u2019s around six.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He took her long wool coat from the back of her chair and helped her into it. Linnette wrapped her scarf around her neck twice, then slipped on her hat and gloves. The winters in North Dakota were frigid; she needed a heavy coat, boots and all the other cold-weather paraphernalia, even if she was only walking from Three of a Kind to the pharmacy, a distance of less than one block.</p><p>Stepping outside, Linnette accompanied Pete to his truck. This was a new model and although it was just a few months old, it already had several scratches and dents. She\u2019d been upset when she saw the first minor dent, but Pete had said this was a working truck and a few \u201cdings,\u201d as he described them, were to be expected.</p><p>He touched her face briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Saturday, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She hunched her shoulders against the sharp wind.</p> <p>\u201cCall you later,\u201d Pete said.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He seemed reluctant to leave her. \u201cYou can spend Christmas with me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPete, stop it. Hassie and I will be fine. It\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sighed. Looking around to be sure no one was watching, he kissed her. Not a deep or lingering kiss, but a very nice one nonetheless.</p> <p>Pete didn\u2019t normally display his affection publicly, and the gesture surprised her. She smiled up at him. Then, with a quick goodbye, she hurried down the street to the pharmacy.</p><p>Hassie was all smiles when Linnette got there. \u201cI heard from the state. We got the funding for the clinic!\u201d</p><p>Linnette clapped her gloved hands together. \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already got the word out.\u201d</p><p>Her head was spinning. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any idea it would happen this fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d Hassie winked at her \u201c\u2014is because I know the right people in Bismarck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou certainly do.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Linnette was over at the abandoned house that would become the new clinic. Men from town, including Buffalo Bob, had started to arrive, and before long an entire wall was down. The renovations had begun. When school ended for the day, a group of teenagers came by to sweep up and carry out debris. Several times, Linnette found herself in the way, more of a hindrance than a help.</p><p>As dusk fell, everyone else left. She parked the broom and dustpan in a corner, glancing around the large front room with satisfaction. An astonishing amount of progress had been made in just half a day. Her cell phone rang and she scrabbled for it in her coat pocket.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Pete, guess what?\u201d The sound of the door opening made her turn, and Pete Mason walked in. She laughed, closing her phone. \u201cYou heard?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cCongratulations! But that\u2019s not the only news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>Pete brought her close, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re going home for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m what\u2014I can\u2019t possibly leave, Pete, especially now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving you. Everyone\u2019s pulling together and all the supplies can be delivered by the weekend. We should have the renovations finished within ten days if we work weekends. Then as soon as everything\u2019s done, you and I are taking off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drive straight through to Cedar Cove so you can surprise your parents.\u201d</p><p>Emotion welled up inside her. \u201cOh, Pete.\u201d She threw her arms around him and hugged him with all her might. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d</p><p>His arms slid about her waist. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting your family,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria and Mack, as well as your parents,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about all of them. Seeing that I hope to be part of this family one day, I feel it\u2019s time to meet them.\u201d</p><p>Linnette\u2019s eyes widened and she could feel the wariness in her expression.</p><p>Pete must have read her stricken look because he was quick to add, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to rush you. All I ask is that you let me know when you\u2019re ready. Until then, I\u2019m willing to wait. Like I told you before, I\u2019m a patient man.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Just when it seemed Dave Flemming\u2019s life was back on an even keel, he noticed that something else was bothering his wife. Emily hadn\u2019t been herself for a few days. At first he\u2019d assumed it was because of her new job, but that didn\u2019t appear to be the case. In fact, anytime she talked about the store, her face lit up.</p><p>Dave hadn\u2019t questioned her, hoping that whatever was wrong would take care of itself. He was busy doing two jobs, preparing for all the Christmas events at the church, including the live Nativity scene, plus his other pastoral duties. He didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with a moody wife.</p><p>Any other time of year he would have asked, but right now the demands on him were too consuming. He figured that sooner or later, Emily would approach him and they\u2019d talk about her problem, whatever it was. If that hadn\u2019t happened by New Year\u2019s, he\u2019d definitely ask her.</p><p>Thursday afternoon Emily arrived at the church just as he was about to leave.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she announced. Entering his office, she closed the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting in ten minutes with the choir director and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His wife cut him off. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to be late.\u201d Her authoritative tone shocked him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said in a resigned voice. He sat back down, hoping this wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Emily sat across from his desk, clutching her purse with both hands. Her eyes darted every which way.</p><p>Dave waited patiently for several minutes. \u201cEm?\u201d he finally prodded.</p><p>A sigh shuddered through her. \u201cI went to Allan Harris\u2019s office Tuesday morning,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>All kinds of crazy thoughts flew through his head. Was she in legal trouble? Did she want\u2014God forbid\u2014a divorce? Did she\u2014</p><p>\u201cI asked to see Martha Evans\u2019s last will and testament.\u201d</p><p>Dave stared at her. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d Besides, he knew very well that it would be unethical to reveal a document like that to anyone other than family. \u201cEmily, they can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, cutting him off again. \u201cThe nice young man was kind enough to allow me a peek. He could lose his job over this, so I\u2019m asking you not to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d At the mention of Allan Harris\u2019s assistant, Dave remembered that he needed to set up another marriage counseling session with the couple. Geoff had canceled the first one.</p><p>Tears filled his wife\u2019s eyes. \u201cEmily, what is it?\u201d he asked urgently. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the will that says Martha wanted you to have her husband\u2019s gold watch.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Dave was on his feet. \u201cThere has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Dave, there isn\u2019t. I read the will and I didn\u2019t see one single word about it.\u201d</p><p>He felt suddenly queasy. He couldn\u2019t believe his wife had checked up on him\u2014or that Martha hadn\u2019t done what she\u2019d said. But she had; he knew that without a doubt. \u201cIt has to be there. Martha showed it to me herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the letter she wrote for Allan Harris. It said she\u2019d voluntarily given me the watch that had belonged to her husband. Since she didn\u2019t have sons to pass it to, it was her wish that I wear it in good health.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her sons-in-law?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Dave shrugged uneasily. \u201cThe older daughter\u2019s divorced. And I gather Martha never saw eye to eye with her younger daughter\u2019s husband.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat watch meant a lot to her, and I was really honored that she gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t have grandsons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dave couldn\u2019t understand why his wife was questioning him this way. Her obvious lack of trust offended him\u2014and wounded him.</p><p>Emily continued to study him. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize how bad this looks?\u201d</p><p>The queasiness intensified. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll return the watch immediately.\u201d He should never have taken it, only Martha had been so insistent. And as he\u2019d told Emily, he\u2019d appreciated the old woman\u2019s gesture in presenting him with a gift that meant so much to her.</p><p>Dave stood up and started to pace the small office. This whole mess was a big misunderstanding. He\u2019d call Harris and ask about the letter. He hadn\u2019t actually seen Martha hand it over, but she\u2019d had an appointment with Allan that very day.</p><p>Dave\u2019s last conversation with the attorney had been awkward. Unpleasant. Allan had drilled him with questions about the day he\u2019d found Martha\u2019s body. He\u2019d been irritated by the man\u2019s tone; Harris had practically implied that Dave was responsible for the missing jewelry. Because of that, Dave had acted defensively. Otherwise, it would\u2019ve occurred to him to have Allan check the will to make sure the matter of the watch was settled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better talk to Allan soon,\u201d he mumbled, eager to clear the air.</p><p>Emily remained in her chair. \u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d he asked with a groan.</p><p>Emily opened her purse clasp and withdrew a clear plastic bag that she held out to him.</p><p>Dave stared at the diamond earrings, then back at her, utterly perplexed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She sounded astonished.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He was beginning to feel angry. What was she up to?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t recognize these earrings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d He dropped them on his desk.</p><p>Reaching inside her purse for a tissue, Emily dabbed her eyes. \u201cI found them in your suit coat pocket.\u201d</p><p>She might as well have hit him in the stomach with a baseball bat. Dave literally fell back in his chair. It took a moment for the information to sink in. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night of our anniversary dinner. I picked up your coat and one of them fell out. I discovered the second one in the other pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought...\u201d He couldn\u2019t say the words.</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning I assumed you were involved with another woman. Then later, after I learned about the watch, I assumed Mrs. Evans had given you the earrings, too, and that...that you intended to give them to me for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe earrings belonged to Martha?\u201d</p><p>Tears spilling down her pale cheeks, Emily nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I saw a photograph of them in the file that came with her will.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Emily had been so moody. Dave shook his head helplessly. \u201cEmily,\u201d he said, holding her gaze, \u201cI swear to you on my life that I\u2019ve never seen those earrings until this minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they get into your pocket then?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an explanation nor could he guess how it had happened. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pressing her hands to her mouth, Emily doubled over and started to weep in earnest.</p><p>Dave felt like weeping himself. The news about the watch had horrified him, but that was minor compared to what he felt now. \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt just can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw a picture with my own eyes,\u201d she said through her tears. \u201cMrs. Evans had more than one pair of diamond earrings, so...so she had everything photographed.\u201d</p><p>Dave was too stunned to speak.</p> <p>Emily had managed to control her sobbing, which had dwindled down to a series of indelicate sniffles. \u201cI think you should talk to Troy Davis,\u201d she said, her eyes imploring him.</p><p>Had she lost all sense? \u201cHe\u2019ll arrest me if I do.\u201d The evidence pointed directly at him and Troy wouldn\u2019t have any choice but to hold Dave for questioning.</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d Emily insisted. \u201cOtherwise no one will ever believe you.\u201d</p><p>But Dave had nothing to offer the sheriff. Nothing to justify his possession of the watch, unless that letter came to light. And certainly nothing to explain the earrings. He wouldn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He had to get through Christmas first and then he\u2019d deal with this situation. He simply couldn\u2019t do it now.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She watched him intently.</p><p>\u201cEmily, think about it. We\u2019re less than two weeks from Christmas. I\u2019m responsible for organizing all our Christmas events, which includes delivering the charity baskets. And I have my hours at the bank.\u201d His mind whirled with everything that needed to be done before and during the holidays. He had yet to write his sermon for the Christmas Eve service and frankly he\u2019d prefer not to do it in jail.</p><p>\u201cDave, you can\u2019t put this off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no other option.\u201d A thought suddenly struck him. \u201cHave you told anyone else about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank God.\u201d That, at least, was a relief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to talk to Sheriff Davis! You can\u2019t have this hanging over your head. If the information somehow came out, it could ruin our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only one who knows about it is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Sheriff Davis finds out...\u201d Her eyes pleaded with him. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember you lost the watch at Olivia Griffin\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He dismissed her concern. He\u2019d worried about it earlier, but he doubted Olivia would place any significance on his having the watch. Dave had picked it up the next day. She\u2019d probably forgotten the whole thing by now.</p><p>\u201cIt can wait,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t think Emily fully understood the pressure he was under. \u201cI\u2019m innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>He noted the slight hesitation in her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Quickly she looked away. \u201cOf course I do. But I\u2019d feel a lot more comfortable if you went to see Sheriff Davis. We could go together and talk to him. He\u2019s a reasonable man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but if we go to him now he might detain me and that can\u2019t happen. Not less than two weeks before Christmas. Don\u2019t you realize how many responsibilities I\u2019m juggling?\u201d Dave didn\u2019t need one more problem to complicate his already overloaded schedule. \u201cIt can wait for another two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it really, Dave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Emily.\u201d He sounded\u2014he felt\u2014as though he was begging. \u201cIn all the years we\u2019ve been married, have I ever given you cause to doubt my integrity?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil recently,\u201d she amended.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at it from my perspective,\u201d Emily said. \u201cA little while ago you admitted we\u2019re having financial difficulties, yet you didn\u2019t respect me enough to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve apologized. And I took a part-time job to make ends meet,\u201d he blurted out. The choir director was waiting and this conversation was putting him on edge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of sorts most of the time,\u201d she added, \u201cand I don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be, too,\u201d he snapped, \u201cif you worked as many hours as I do. I\u2019ve got people vying for my attention, tugging at me from every direction. Everyone wants something from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you loved being a pastor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. This is what God intended for me and I love my job, but there are times when the stress and the demands are more than any man should have to endure. And then factor in this second job...\u201d He raised his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cI love you, Emily, and I\u2019m asking you to trust me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cIs that so hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d listen to reason,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cReason?\u201d he echoed. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re the one who\u2019s being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in denial,\u201d she asserted.</p><p>\u201cOh, stop it with the pop-psych nonsense. Denial.\u201d He snorted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense. You think if you sit back and do nothing,\u201d she said, rushing her words, \u201cyou think if we keep our mouths shut, everything will blow over. The culprit will be uncovered and you\u2019ll be off the hook without ever having to explain yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Dave argued. \u201cWhat I want is to do my job. I want to tend my flock and deal with this ridiculous mess after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily, please bear with me. I can\u2019t talk to Sheriff Davis yet, but I will. I give you my word of honor.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door. Dave closed his eyes and exhaled noisily. \u201cYes, Angel,\u201d he called out.</p><p>His assistant opened the door, glancing apologetically toward Dave and Emily. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Dave assured her. \u201cWe were just finishing up.\u201d</p><p>Angel stepped into the office. \u201cI thought I should tell you the truck with the animal feed is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d Dave groaned. \u201cHe\u2019s supposed to deliver it to Cliff Harding\u2019s place.\u201d He would be forever grateful that the Hardings had agreed to house the animals.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the driver says he has to talk to you because the paperwork specifically states delivery\u2019s to be made to this address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mrs. Stevenson\u2019s in the sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>The choir director prided herself on her punctuality and disliked being kept waiting. \u201cPlease tell her I\u2019ll be with her in a moment,\u201d Dave said.</p><p>Angel nodded and shut the door.</p><p>Dave turned to his wife. \u201cWe can discuss this later if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point? You\u2019ve already decided.\u201d Emily snatched up the diamond earrings and dropped them back in her purse. Coming to her feet, she dashed to the door, but not before Dave saw the tears glistening in her eyes.</p><p>The problem was that Emily didn\u2019t understand what she was asking of him. It broke his heart to fight with his wife and to flout her advice. There had to be a way to give her the peace of mind she needed\u2014and stay out of jail at the same time.</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t have a chance to talk to Emily again until much later that night. It was almost ten-thirty when he finally got home. After sorting out the confusion with the feed delivery and meeting with Mrs. S., he\u2019d had to forgo supper to get to the bank on time. Following his shift, he\u2019d grabbed a muffin at Mocha Mama\u2019s. He walked silently into the house, first checking on his sons, who were both asleep. Emily didn\u2019t look up when he stepped inside her workroom.</p><p>He was weary in body and exhausted in spirit, but Dave knew he had to make this right with his wife.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d He spoke her name softly.</p><p>She sat at her sewing machine working on a quilt. The radio played Christmas music, but he doubted she was listening.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d he said, sitting on a chair next to her sewing desk. He reached out and stroked her knee.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind?\u201d she asked. She slid aside to avoid his touch. \u201cAre you willing to tell the sheriff what I found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He couldn\u2019t cope with the consequences of such an action.</p><p>\u201cThen we have nothing else to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease listen to me, Em,\u201d Dave pleaded. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking over everything you said, and you have a valid point. If someone came across this information, it could be a problem.\u201d</p><p>She gave a humorless laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with you\u2014I should tell someone.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he\u2019d entered her room, she turned to look at him. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d make an appointment with Roy McAfee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be willing to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dave rubbed his tired eyes. \u201cI trust Roy, and while he isn\u2019t an attorney, he knows the law. He can tell me my rights.\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, accepting his suggestion.</p><p>\u201cThen, after Christmas,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe two of us can go and talk to the sheriff together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered, appeased. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the perfect solution, but a workable one. As soon as Christmas was over, he\u2019d settle this somehow, once and for all.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dad, don\u2019t be such a stick in the mud!\u201d Megan stood, hands on her hips, in the driveway next to her car. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come with us.\u201d</p><p>Troy wasn\u2019t in the mood to go shopping for a Christmas tree. The last few years, he\u2019d brought Sandy on this expedition, and the four of them had driven to a nearby tree farm. Once Sandy had gone into the care facility, Troy hadn\u2019t bothered with Christmas decorations, so Megan and Craig\u2019s tree became theirs, too.</p><p>He wanted to forget about the holidays this year; his Christmas spirit was nonexistent. He had better things to do on a Friday evening than tag along with his daughter and her husband. Better things like...watching reruns of CSI, for instance. He\u2019d tried his best to get out of the excursion, but Megan wouldn\u2019t hear of it.</p><p>\u201cArtificial trees are much safer,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t lose their needles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Megan moaned, \u201cit\u2019ll be fun. We do this every year, remember? It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>And who was he to fight tradition? \u201cOh, all right,\u201d he said with ill grace.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d she cried again and clapped her hands. \u201cShow a little holiday spirit. We\u2019re going to pick out our tree and drink hot cocoa and get a free candy cane. Doesn\u2019t that make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m happy,\u201d he muttered, but he wasn\u2019t. The week had seemed interminable. Yesterday Martha Evans\u2019s two daughters had stopped by his office and made a big fuss. They wanted to know what he\u2019d done to find the culprit who\u2019d walked off with their mother\u2019s jewelry, and more importantly, their inheritance. Never mind that he considered them grasping and unpleasant, they were entitled to answers, although he had none to give. He had his suspicions but nothing concrete. He was waiting and watching, but so far the person he suspected hadn\u2019t slipped up. Not yet, anyway. And reliable as a cop\u2019s hunch might be, at least in the mystery novels Sandy used to read, it wasn\u2019t enough to justify an arrest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And all week long, he\u2019d thought about Faith. He missed her. He wished now that he\u2019d approached her with more finesse. He\u2019d been unfair to her because he\u2019d overreacted to Megan\u2019s fears.</p><p>Having lived with Sandy all those years, watching her decline little by little, had taken a toll on his psyche. He couldn\u2019t tolerate the prospect of Megan going through the same ordeal. In retrospect, he realized he\u2019d discounted the difference thirty years had made in the treatment of MS. While he wouldn\u2019t wish the disease on Megan or anyone, it wasn\u2019t the death sentence it had once been.</p><p>But Megan had been his reason, his excuse, for breaking off the relationship with Faith. His daughter needed him, he\u2019d told himself, and she did, without a doubt. Deep down, however, Troy had begun to wonder if he was afraid of finding new happiness. If he believed, maybe not even consciously, that he had no right to experience joy while his daughter was struggling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re old enough that your father doesn\u2019t need to come with you,\u201d Troy complained, trying one last time to back out of this family trip.</p> <p>Megan smiled that sweet innocent smile of hers. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But this is the first Christmas without Mom. Please, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t refuse her. \u201cAll right,\u201d he muttered again, no more graciously than before.</p><p>\u201cNext year there\u2019ll be the baby,\u201d Megan reminded him. \u201cWe\u2019ll start a new tradition with your grandchild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it involve freezing my tail off stomping through acres of trees that all look alike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad,\u201d she chided him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you this year?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just not in the mood to celebrate Christmas, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis evening will help,\u201d she promised gently.</p><p>Craig drove, and Troy sat with his son-in-law in the front seat while Megan sat in the back. Christmas songs, one after the other, blasted from the radio and they sang along. Well, Megan and Craig joined in; Troy bobbed his head now and then. He didn\u2019t much care about either Frosty or Rudolph at the moment.</p><p>When they arrived at the tree farm, it was packed. It seemed as if every family in Cedar Cove was there, which surprised Troy because this was a Friday night. Colored lights were strung around the area, brightening the trees. There was a big kettle of hot chocolate and one of warm apple cider, both of them, in his opinion, grossly overpriced.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so busy tonight?\u201d Troy wondered aloud as he ventured away from the car. They were fortunate to have secured a parking space.</p><p>\u201cRain\u2019s predicted for tomorrow,\u201d Craig told him.</p> <p>That explained it. Darkness had fallen, but the sky was clear and stars were starting to show. Any families planning to put up their Christmas trees this weekend would have to purchase them tonight.</p><p>While Craig took the saw out of his trunk, Troy glanced around. He recognized several families.</p><p>He heard Megan behind him. \u201cDad! Oh, Dad, there\u2019s someone here I want you to say hello to.\u201d</p><p>He looked back at his daughter and abruptly went still. Standing next to Megan was Faith Beckwith.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the wonderful nurse I mentioned?\u201d Megan was asking.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. All he could do was stare at Faith.</p><p>His mood instantly lifted. \u201cHello, Faith,\u201d he said. He couldn\u2019t have arranged this any better had he tried.</p><p>\u201cYou do remember her,\u201d Megan chirped. \u201cShe talked about you when we had lunch this week.\u201d</p> <p>Now that got his attention. \u201cYou and Faith had lunch? Together?\u201d He glanced from one to the other, wondering how this had come about.</p><p>Megan nodded. \u201cI had some questions about the baby blanket I\u2019m making and I asked Faith to help me.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely Troy recalled that his daughter had taken up knitting.</p><p>\u201cWhile we were at lunch, Faith said the two of you knew each other in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d Faith murmured, studying the ground, which was littered with evergreen twigs and clumps of needles. When she did happen to meet his gaze, she gave him a look that could charitably be described as unfriendly. Given how they\u2019d left things, he had no idea what that was all about.</p><p>Megan appeared oblivious to the tension between them. \u201cI meant to tell you about seeing Faith earlier,\u201d she went on to say. \u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that the two of you were friends in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hardly friends,\u201d she said, slipping her hands in her coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cAre you getting your Christmas tree here, too?\u201d Megan asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with my son and his family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI dragged my dad along, too. He could use some holiday cheer.\u201d</p><p>Faith glanced behind her. \u201cGood to see you again, Megan,\u201d she said, nodding curtly in Troy\u2019s direction, \u201cbut I should get back to my family. Have a wonderful Christmas,\u201d she added as she turned away.</p><p>Something was definitely wrong. Faith had just given him the cold shoulder and he didn\u2019t know why.</p><p>\u201cShe is so nice,\u201d Megan said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Troy agreed, watching Faith hurry away.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that the two of you know each other,\u201d Megan said again.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou should ask her out.\u201d</p><p>What? Frowning, Troy looked at his daughter. Only a few months ago, she\u2019d been adamantly opposed to his seeing other women. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA date, Dad,\u201d she said and laughed at his blank expression. \u201cFaith is a warm, lovely woman. She\u2019s helped me in so many ways, and I don\u2019t just mean with my knitting. It was Faith who gave me those statistics about MS. She\u2019s been a real encouragement with the pregnancy, too.\u201d Megan slid her arm through his. \u201cYou know, Dad, she\u2019s a widow.\u201d</p><p>He made a noncommittal response.</p><p>\u201cIf you were going to date again, I think Faith would be perfect.\u201d His daughter hesitated. \u201cCraig told me not to say anything, but...\u201d</p><p>Troy regarded his daughter. \u201cAbout Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d She raised one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s about that other woman I saw you with...I think her name\u2019s Sally.\u201d Megan pressed her lips tightly together. \u201cI was pretty upset when Craig and I ran into the two of you, but Craig told me it was none of my business. You have your own life and if you want to start dating again, it\u2019s strictly up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Megan continued, \u201cI thought Sally was kind of bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, so did I,\u201d Troy said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see her again?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNot on your life.\u201d</p><p>Megan laughed, too. \u201cGee, Dad, I see Faith over there. Why don\u2019t you go and discuss old times?\u201d</p><p>He turned and saw that Megan was right. Faith was standing with her two grandchildren among the Christmas trees. She looked wonderful. Beautiful.</p><p>\u201cBring her a cup of cocoa,\u201d his daughter suggested.</p><p>In the interest of making some progress with Faith, he was prepared to overlook the fact that the tree-farm people were gouging him. \u201cI think I will.\u201d</p><p>Megan squeezed his arm. \u201cGood luck, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Troy purchased two cups of hot chocolate and carried them to where Faith stood, with her son and his family close by.</p><p>Scott Beckwith nodded at him. \u201cHow\u2019re you doing, Sheriff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, fine.\u201d</p><p>Faith was standing stiffly beside her grandchildren and seemed to make a point of ignoring him.</p><p>\u201cI brought you some cocoa,\u201d he said and held it out to her.</p><p>Faith\u2019s hands remained buried deep inside her coat pockets. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d her youngest grandchild said eagerly.</p><p>Troy handed it to the girl, who was about six or seven. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAngela.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Bradley,\u201d the older boy announced, staring pointedly at the second cup.</p><p>Troy willingly relinquished it.</p><p>Angela smiled up at him. \u201cI have a loose tooth. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela. Bradley.\u201d Scott called his children as he strode ahead. \u201cCome help me cut down this tree.\u201d</p><p>The two kids scurried after their father, sloshing hot chocolate as they went.</p><p>Troy was grateful for these few minutes alone with Faith. \u201cMegan says you\u2019ve been a good friend to her.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and started to join her son.</p><p>Troy placed a hand on her arm, stopping her. \u201cAre you angry about something?\u201d</p><p>Her head reared back as if he\u2019d shocked her. \u201cAngry?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat could I possibly have to be angry about?\u201d</p><p>That was exactly his question. He gestured weakly and tried again. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him then, her eyes flashing with fury. \u201cYou broke off our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we forget about that, Faith? I\u2019d like to go out again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThen I suggest you contact Sally.\u201d</p><p>Troy was stunned. One blind date\u2014which had been a disaster\u2014and it seemed the entire county had heard. Bad enough that he\u2019d bumped into Megan and Craig that night, but now apparently Faith knew about it, too.</p><p>\u201cShe sounds like your type,\u201d Faith said in a withering voice.</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t,\u201d Troy told her. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>Her stance relaxed just a little, and for a moment Troy saw the pain in her eyes. \u201cI used to think you were my type, too, but I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, be fair.\u201d Troy was losing his patience. \u201cSo I went out with someone else\u2014once. You\u2019re taking this too personally.\u201d</p><p>She considered his observation, then shrugged as if it was of no concern. \u201cPerhaps I am. Let me assure you, you\u2019re welcome to date whomever you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to date you,\u201d he insisted. He didn\u2019t understand why she was making this so difficult.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m flattered but it won\u2019t work. I enjoyed our time together, but it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cI beg to differ. You\u2019re the one out there dating again. I wish you well, Troy, I really do, but I have a real problem with a man who says one thing and does another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Megan couldn\u2019t accept the thought of you dating so soon after you lost your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that only applied to me. She didn\u2019t appear to have a problem when you went out with Sally. Not that I care, mind you. As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is an integrity issue.\u201d</p><p>Troy had heard enough. \u201cYou are way out of line here, Faith. I came to you and I tried to make amends\u2014which you rejected because you were stuck in the past. What happened back then wasn\u2019t my fault, I might remind you.\u201d</p><p>Faith had the grace to blush.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to discuss integrity, then let\u2019s talk about you befriending my daughter behind my back.\u201d He had a few questions of his own. Faith wasn\u2019t blameless in all of this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMegan sought me out\u2014but not because she knew about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly didn\u2019t discourage her, though, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and why should I? She\u2019s a very sweet girl. Maybe that\u2019s why it took me a while to realize the two of you are related\u2014\u201d Faith paused long enough to shake her head. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. But I did tell her I knew you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to go into our recent relationship...but perhaps I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suggest that perhaps the best thing for us to do is agree to disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the way you want it.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip trembled slightly. \u201cWe gave it a good try. Twice. We both made mistakes. I apologize for my part and you\u2019ve already apologized for yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t we start over?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should.\u201d</p><p>That seemed so final. \u201cWe tried and it didn\u2019t work out. I don\u2019t have the heart to make another stab at this. I guess I\u2019m too old and set in my ways. I don\u2019t bounce back as quickly as I used to.\u201d</p><p>Troy had no alternative but to accept her decision. \u201cThen I\u2019d like us to part as friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree.\u201d She removed her hand from her pocket and held it out to him.</p><p>Troy frowned at it. \u201cI\u2019d be more receptive to a hug.\u201d</p> <p>Faith smiled, moving toward him.</p><p>Troy enveloped her in his arms and closed his eyes. He breathed in her familiar scent, holding her just a moment longer than he probably should have. When he dropped his arms, he stepped back.</p><p>\u201cSince we live in the same town, I hope we can be cordial to each other,\u201d Faith said, sounding like herself for the first time that evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that, too.\u201d He shuffled his feet, still a bit uneasy. \u201cAs far as Megan\u2019s concerned, I appreciate that you took her under your wing. She obviously needed someone and I\u2019m glad she chose you.\u201d</p><p>Faith\u2019s face grew red; he wondered if it was from the cold or something else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for getting so angry with you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything about you and Sally.\u201d</p><p>Troy shrugged. \u201cSally was a blind date I got roped into. She\u2019s the mother-in-law of one of my deputies. She was visiting from New York. Bart had a social obligation that particular night, and his mother-in-law was going to be alone, so he asked me if I\u2019d mind taking her to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it\u2019s neither here nor there, it was only the one date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right, though. It wasn\u2019t any of my business. I must\u2019ve sounded like a jealous shrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, Grandma, come and look at our tree,\u201d Angela called out to Faith. Her brother trailed behind her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better join my family.\u201d</p><p>Troy took another step back. \u201cAnd I should go find Megan and Craig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful we had this talk.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas, Troy,\u201d Faith said softly.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Megan and Craig had already chosen and cut down their tree by the time Troy located them.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think, Dad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Troy studied the tree. \u201cGood choice. Do you plan to decorate it this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the tree,\u201d Megan said. \u201cI was asking about Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d he murmured, unsure how to explain. \u201cShe\u2019s very nice but I don\u2019t think we have that much in common.\u201d</p><p>His daughter\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. Faith is perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it rest, honey,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThis is your father\u2019s decision, not yours.\u201d</p><p>It looked as if Megan wanted to argue but then she took her husband\u2019s advice.</p><p>Troy helped Craig tie the fresh Christmas tree to the roof of the car. As they pulled out of the parking lot, Troy caught sight of Faith. She stood apart from her family, watching him. When their eyes met, she raised her hand in a gesture of farewell.</p><p>This time it really was goodbye.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Christie asked her sister, nearly shouting into her cell phone. Her heart pounded at an alarming rate. It was vital that she speak to Teri as soon as possible. She\u2019d just finished her shift at Wal-Mart and had stopped by Teri and Bobby\u2019s house\u2014a visit that was also a convenient excuse to see James again. Since the night he\u2019d come to her apartment, she hadn\u2019t been able to stop thinking about him. Their time together had been so special\u2014at least to Christie\u2014and she needed to confirm that he felt the same way about her.</p><p>\u201c...shopping.\u201d Teri\u2019s voice faded in and out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what you were doing, I asked where you are. I need to talk to you, pronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeattle,\u201d Teri told her. \u201cBobby and I are shopping for cribs. We\u2019re driving to a mall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Christie\u2019s heart sank. \u201cI went over to your house when I got off work...I thought you\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry...disappoint you, but...\u201d Once again Teri\u2019s voice faded out.</p><p>\u201cAre you with James?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cWho? I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d Obviously she was.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Her sister must have detected the note of panic in her voice.</p><p>\u201cSomeone was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Teri shouted back.</p><p>\u201cAt the house. By the gate.\u201d</p><p>A short pause followed, and Christie didn\u2019t know if it was due to the bad connection or her sister\u2019s worry.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reporter, and he wasn\u2019t interested in talking to Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who...\u201d Christie heard some static. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wanted to talk to James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, his name isn\u2019t James Wilbur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>Her head was whirling with what she\u2019d learned. \u201cHis name is James Gardner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...interesting.\u201d Since Teri was in the car with Bobby and James, the conversation was risky, but Christie had to chance it. Teri seemed to realize intuitively that she couldn\u2019t reveal what Christie was about to tell her. Still, there was a limit to how much she could say over the phone, especially with both men in earshot.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did he tell you?\u201d Teri wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThe reporter thought I was one of the help, so I played along. I let him assume I was the housekeeper and said Bobby and you, plus James, were out of town for the next few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Teri\u2019s voice was louder now; wherever they were, cell phone reception had clearly improved.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to James. It\u2019s important, Teri. His cover is about to be blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain later. Ask Bobby. He knows everything\u2014he\u2019s known all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Teri said calmly.</p><p>Christie felt as though she might break into tears. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever wondered about James?\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s voice fell. \u201cTo be honest, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames and Bobby go way back\u2014back to when they were in their early teens.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was followed by a short silence. \u201cBobby and I are staying in a hotel downtown, so you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to James,\u201d Christie broke in. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that he know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames is driving home to Cedar Cove. He should be there by six-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me any more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too complicated.\u201d With a shaking hand, Christie brushed her hair away from her forehead. \u201cI never guessed...Not in a million years would I have guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie, you can\u2019t keep me in suspense like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you right now, so don\u2019t ask me again. Only...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight when you and Bobby are alone, you might ask him a few questions about James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I haven\u2019t already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust ask, and this time tell him the whole world\u2019s about to learn...everything.\u201d</p><p>Christie wanted to kick herself. She\u2019d intended to keep her mouth shut and here she was, practically blurting it all out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018everything\u2019?\u201d Teri demanded, and from her tone of voice, Christie knew her sister wasn\u2019t going to let this drop.</p><p>Teri was like a bloodhound tracking a scent. She was after details, and she wanted them now. Sighing heavily, Christie muttered part of what she\u2019d found out. \u201cApparently James was born in a town called Wilbur\u2014I think it\u2019s on the East Coast. That\u2019s where he got his surname.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reporter...This is going to be big, Teri. Very big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positive this person is who you think it is?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Christie didn\u2019t have a single doubt. \u201cI saw the photos. It\u2019s James, all right. He\u2019s much younger in the pictures, but there\u2019s no mistaking him.\u201d</p><p>Her sister spoke in a whisper. \u201cWe\u2019re at the hotel. Give me ten minutes and I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, exactly nine minutes later, Teri phoned. \u201cYou want to talk to James, right?\u201d she said without so much as a greeting. \u201cAlone,\u201d she added. \u201cIn a private setting where you won\u2019t be disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...of course.\u201d Christie had to let him know, as soon as possible. \u201cWhat do you mean, a private setting?\u201d Teri had something in mind.</p><p>\u201cNow listen,\u201d Teri continued, sounding authoritative. \u201cJames is driving back to Cedar Cove and I\u2019ve asked him to bring some packages into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the reporter might still be around, looking for him.\u201d Once the article hit the newsstands, it would only be a matter of time before the Seattle stations were hounding James. Then would come CNN and Fox and the other networks, the Internet...</p><p>\u201cI thought you told that reporter James was out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t have anything to worry about.\u201d The reassurance in her voice calmed Christie. \u201cNo one can get into the house, so as soon as James arrives he\u2019ll be safe. The gate\u2019s electronically wired and we have the best security system money can buy. No one\u2019s getting in there without a whole lot of trouble, so don\u2019t concern yourself with that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive. Trust me on this. The safest place for you and James is the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you there waiting for him, got it?\u201d</p> <p>It was just like Teri to start issuing orders. Except that in this case, Christie didn\u2019t object.</p><p>\u201cWhen James gets there, you\u2019ll have cooked a nice, romantic dinner, complete with soft music and lit candles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d she asked. They were in the middle of an emergency, and her sister was planning a honeymoon retreat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that reporter\u2019s about to expose, but don\u2019t hit James with it first thing. Let him relax and have a nice dinner and then tell him...gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you do with Bobby, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Her sister laughed. \u201cI try, but it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have this all figured out, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I was pretty clever about it, if I do say so myself.\u201d Teri did seem excited. Weeks earlier she\u2019d given Christie a key so she could house-sit. She and Bobby had spent a getaway weekend at the ocean, and Christie still had the key. She also had the code to the security alarm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a salmon fillet in the refrigerator and a really nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc in the wine cooler. You\u2019re welcome to them both.\u201d</p><p>Christie was overwhelmed. \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll be able to eat a single bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will.\u201d Once more her sister sounded like a general barking orders to the troops. \u201cBobby\u2019s promised to tell me everything. Now, get going. You haven\u2019t got that long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes James know anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I didn\u2019t tell him you\u2019re going to be at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to warn him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Teri countered. \u201cFor the moment, the less he knows, the better.\u201d</p><p>Her sister was probably right.</p><p>Nervous though she was, Christie showered, washed her hair and borrowed Teri\u2019s makeup, which was of a much higher quality than the bargain brands she bought for herself. Then she followed her instructions to the letter. The salmon was just about finished baking and the wine was on ice when the security alarm beeped, indicating that someone had entered the house.</p><p>Christie panicked.</p><p>Teri hadn\u2019t given her one word of advice on what to say to James. Her impulse was to rush forward and blurt out what she\u2019d learned\u2014to protect him. But as Teri said, she needed to lead up to this carefully.</p> <p>James must have sensed someone else was in the house, but when he stepped into the kitchen, he stopped cold. \u201cBobby didn\u2019t say you were here,\u201d he murmured. He didn\u2019t seem pleased to see her.</p><p>Christie remained standing in the middle of the kitchen. She fiddled nervously with the top button of her blouse, then hurriedly removed the apron.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>James looked more than a little uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cTeri told me to prepare the salmon,\u201d she explained. \u201cWould you like to have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a fairly good cook.\u201d</p><p>Still silent, he glanced at the bottle of wine, nestled in a pewter wine cooler.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer right away, she decided to take action. Focusing her attention on the salad she was making, she said, \u201cYou could open that for us.\u201d</p><p>Instead James walked out of the room and Christie was convinced he wasn\u2019t coming back. To her relief, he returned a moment later\u2014without his heavy winter coat.</p><p>\u201cI know it must be a shock finding me here at the house but let me assure you there\u2019s a perfectly logical reason.\u201d The oven timer buzzed; using two pot holders, she opened the door and took out the salmon. The kitchen was instantly filled with the scent of fresh dill and lemon.</p><p>The wild rice mixture on the stove started to boil over, and they both moved toward it, bumping shoulders. James looked at her; she looked at him. Grinning, he calmly reached over and removed the pan from the burner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>His words almost made her cry. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m here, too,\u201d she said, and to her acute embarrassment she blushed. It was harder than ever not to tell him everything.</p><p>He raised his hand to her face and slowly ran his finger from her temple down the side of her jaw to her chin. It was the most sensual thing any man had ever done to her. The only part of his body that touched her was his fingertip, yet Christie was ready to melt in his arms. She closed her eyes and struggled against her natural inclination to sway toward him. This wasn\u2019t the time. She swallowed and eased away.</p><p>When her eyes opened again, she found him studying her. She moistened her lips. \u201cAre you planning to...kiss me?\u201d</p><p>James nodded.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind...could you do it later?\u201d</p><p>He grinned again. \u201cI think I do mind.\u201d With excruciating slowness, he lowered his mouth to hers. The kisses started out soft and easy, then gained intensity.</p><p>James was the one who took control. After several minutes, he broke the contact and simply held her. His breath was ragged.</p><p>Christie leaned against him. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d had the most sensual encounter of her life standing in her sister\u2019s kitchen\u2014with all her clothes on.</p><p>\u201cJames, I...I have something very important to tell you,\u201d she said once she found her voice. Keeping this news inside suddenly became impossible.</p><p>His hands were in her hair and it seemed as if he hadn\u2019t heard her.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down.\u201d Taking James by the hand, she led him to the family room and they sat on the sofa.</p><p>Christie angled her body so that their knees touched. She reached for his hands and held them in her own. For a long moment she contemplated how to begin. Finally she told him in the simplest, most direct manner she could. \u201cI came by here earlier and there was a man at the gate looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he asked with a frown.</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to think I was the housekeeper and I didn\u2019t set him straight. It turned out to be a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me questions about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout your past...How long you\u2019d worked for Bobby, whether you ever played chess, whether you mentioned where you were from. Stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>James avoided eye contact.</p><p>\u201cI know, James. I know everything now, and it doesn\u2019t matter. None of it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened and he tried to jerk his hands free of hers but she wouldn\u2019t let him. Scrambling up on the sofa, she knelt beside him. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out how you and Bobby kept it a secret all these years.\u201d</p><p>Again James tried to get away, and this time she stopped him by sitting on his lap. \u201cJames,\u201d she whispered, pressing her hands against the sides of his face. She couldn\u2019t resist, so she kissed him.</p><p>Her kisses seemed to calm him. She could see the pulse in his neck pounding frantically. \u201cTwenty years ago, you were the chess prodigy, not Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, refusing to meet her gaze. \u201cI had a nervous breakdown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t played chess since I was thirteen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. By dint of questioning and appearing to know more than she did, she\u2019d persuaded the reporter to fill in what happened next. James and Bobby were rivals. James\u2019s parents drove him, expecting perfection, demanding that he beat Bobby each and every time. Then he\u2019d lost the biggest chess match of his career and ended up in a mental hospital.</p><p>After James was released, he never played again. At least not publicly, according to the reporter, but Christie suspected that was the case in his private life, too. As far as the chess world was concerned, James Gardner had dropped off the face of the earth. He disappeared, and despite numerous and varied efforts to locate him over the next few years, he was never seen or heard from again.</p><p>Apparently he\u2019d been forgotten. From the questions the reporter asked, she knew James\u2019s appearance had changed. He\u2019d shown her a photograph of James at thirteen. The soft features of early adolescence had hardened, become defined. His hair had darkened. He\u2019d shot up ten inches or more. He didn\u2019t look the same and yet she\u2019d recognized him. She hadn\u2019t tried to hide that recognition from the reporter; there was no point. As the man, a stringer for one of the newspaper syndicates, had said, the information was out there, hidden in articles, public records, even photographs, if anyone cared to search for it.</p><p>\u201cBobby Polgar was my only friend back then,\u201d James murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Christie straightened. \u201cI\u2019m your friend, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did this reporter find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was that difficult. He started with the kidnapping. He decided there was more to that story, so he dug up information about you and Bobby. He did the research, asked the questions and one thing led to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will it be published? His article.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>His arms circled her waist and he held her as if he intended never to let her go.</p><p>His disappearance from the chess world, the reporter had said, seemed particularly puzzling because he hadn\u2019t entirely disappeared. He remained on the fringes, since he took Bobby to all his matches. That had begun when both men were in their early twenties. It must have felt risky at first, even staying in the background, but people hadn\u2019t really noticed him.</p><p>\u201cBobby was the only one who cared,\u201d James told her. \u201cHe came to see me in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Christie had always been aware of Bobby\u2019s kindness and loyalty. When she met him, she\u2019d been envious of Teri, unable to understand why her sister should have all the luck.</p><p>She\u2019d even thought she could steal him away from Teri. Bobby, however, had quickly disabused her of that notion. He was a one-woman man, and he\u2019d made sure Christie knew that.</p><p>\u201cYou never played chess again?\u201d she asked, her head still on his shoulder. \u201cAt home? By yourself or with Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I have the mind for it, but not the heart.\u201d His hand was warm on her back. \u201cBobby has both. He has the heart of a champion, far more than I ever did.\u201d</p><p>Christie sighed. Like her sister, she barely understood the rudiments of the game and didn\u2019t have the patience or the interest to learn.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with your time?\u201d she asked. He always seemed to be busy and she wondered if he\u2019d tell her. She sensed that he didn\u2019t want anyone intruding on his life.</p><p>\u201cThis and that,\u201d he told her. \u201cI read, especially history. But mostly I work on creating computer games. That\u2019s my creative outlet. I...I don\u2019t like being in front of the public.\u201d</p><p>Christie realized that James didn\u2019t need or want much interaction with others. He seemed happy with his own company, his own thoughts and routines. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt keeps me busy when I\u2019m not driving for Bobby,\u201d he added.</p><p>Christie could have stayed exactly as she was at that moment and found contentment. Was this love? She couldn\u2019t say; Christie wasn\u2019t sure she knew what it was to be in love. Lust, passion, desire\u2014those feelings were familiar to her. But they never lasted. Every single time, what looked like a promising relationship had failed. The flames of attraction always died out, leaving nothing but bitterness and anger behind.</p><p>In the past she\u2019d been quick to jump into bed, and the fact that she hadn\u2019t slept with James, that they\u2019d only kissed on three occasions, would shock her previous lovers. They\u2019d wonder if there was something wrong with her\u2014or with James. The reality was that for the first time there was something right.</p><p>\u201cYou know my secrets, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd mine are a lot more disreputable than yours.\u201d She wished he\u2019d told her about his past earlier. She thought he might have continued to keep it to himself if the reporter hadn\u2019t shown up today. That hurt, but she tried not to dwell on it.</p> <p>James kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cDo you and Bobby ever talk about when you were young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s in the past.\u201d His chest heaved. \u201cI choose to live as I do. Bobby needs me and he was a friend when I needed one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was their ticket to wealth and fame. They never forgave me. And they never spoke to me again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, James. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents are both dead. Bobby is all the family I have. Bobby and now Teri.\u201d</p><p>Christie longed to tell him that she loved him and wanted to be his family, too.</p><p>But she knew instinctively that it was too soon. James wasn\u2019t ready for that kind of intimacy. The habits of reserve and self-protection were too ingrained. Slowly, though, very slowly, he\u2019d come to love her as much as she loved him.</p><p>She was counting on it.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p> <p>As soon as the end-of-day bell rang, Tanni Bliss hurried out to the parking lot where Shaw was waiting for her. She climbed into the passenger seat of his old blue station wagon and leaned toward him. Shaw didn\u2019t hesitate to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cHow was school?\u201d he asked as he checked his rearview mirror before pulling into the heavy flow of traffic.</p><p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d With only a week before the holiday break, no one was concentrating on schoolwork. Even the teachers seemed distracted and eager to escape.</p><p>\u201cHow was work?\u201d she asked, already knowing how much Shaw disliked his job at the coffee shop. He was grateful to his aunt and uncle, grateful to be employed but it didn\u2019t help him advance toward what he really wanted, and that was a career in art.</p><p>Living at home allowed him to put away funds for art school. He\u2019d applied for scholarships but had been turned down because of his lack of a high school diploma. His father, an attorney, had pressured him to follow in his footsteps. Shaw had rebelled, and the friction at home had become intolerable. It was because of his father and the constant battle of wills between them that Shaw had dropped out of high school just weeks before graduation. When the art school was unable to accept him, the registrar encouraged him to obtain his GED and apply again as a mature student. He was taking the test in January.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He rarely said anything more about his job or what he did there.</p><p>\u201cDid you do any work?\u201d The question didn\u2019t refer to Mocha Mama\u2019s, but his current art project.</p> <p>\u201cSome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to show me?\u201d Shaw generally didn\u2019t until he was satisfied his drawing or painting was the best he could make it.</p><p>He momentarily looked away from the traffic and grinned at her. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShaw!\u201d she said. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>His grin broadened. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>For a week or two now, he\u2019d been working on something he wouldn\u2019t even tell her about. He usually did his sketches at the coffee shop, because doing them at the house seemed to infuriate his father.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you home?\u201d Shaw asked.</p><p>Tanni had a surprise of her own. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere to, then?\u201d</p><p>Tanni studied him, anticipating his reaction. \u201cThe Harbor Street Art Gallery.\u201d</p><p>His eyes left the road as he glanced in her direction. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Holding back this particular surprise had been difficult; she\u2019d nearly told him a hundred times. \u201cI have a meeting with the new owner, Mr. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention that before, did you?\u201d In other words, Shaw would have remembered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the meeting about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d he exploded in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes, you. Or rather, your portrait work. He\u2019s got the ones of Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix and James Dean.\u201d Shaw had chosen people, public figures, who\u2019d lived\u2014and died\u2014on the edge.</p><p>\u201cTanni...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI showed my mom a few of your other portraits, too, and she took them to Mr. Jefferson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom did that for me?\u201d</p><p>Tanni nodded. \u201cMr. Jefferson met with Mom and asked for ideas about the gallery.\u201d Her mother had come back, excited about the change in ownership and the new possibilities. \u201cHe asked her how to get the community involved, and one thing she recommended was showing the work of young artists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>Tanni smiled over at him, knowing he must be curious as to what Mr. Jefferson had said about his portraits. At the same time, he was probably afraid to ask.</p><p>\u201cSo...what did he think?\u201d Shaw spoke casually as he turned onto Harbor Street.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to meet you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Shaw paled. \u201cTanni, I can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you can\u2019t?\u201d She was dismayed by his response, which was the last thing she\u2019d expected. \u201cYou\u2019re good, Shaw! You have real talent, and more than that, you have a vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go talk to him for me, all right?\u201d</p><p>Shaw was serious. She was astonished by his lack of confidence, but she would do this for him without a qualm. After all, he\u2019d helped her in ways she couldn\u2019t begin to calculate. For the first time since her father\u2019s death, she didn\u2019t feel like she wanted to die, too. Some days were better than others. She still grieved, still longed for him, but she could imagine a future now. A future without him. And that was largely thanks to Shaw. So if he needed her to do this, then she would. No questions asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me...you shouldn\u2019t have done this without letting me know.\u201d He frowned, as if her intervention displeased him, as if he thought she\u2019d been presumptuous.</p><p>His lack of appreciation hurt her. \u201cWhy not? My mom and I wanted to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTanni.\u201d Shaw whispered her name. He seemed to understand how badly he\u2019d upset her. \u201cI\u2019m not ready.... I don\u2019t have the training or the talent.... Not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do,\u201d she insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re every bit as talented as I am.\u201d It was true that he didn\u2019t have the formal training or encouragement she\u2019d been blessed to receive, but he had the desire and his work revealed passion and honesty.</p><p>Shaw found a parking spot and pulled in. He turned off the engine but kept his hands on the steering wheel, holding so tightly that his knuckles went white.</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll go in with you,\u201d Tanni suggested, thinking all he really needed was her presence and support.</p><p>Shaw shook his head. \u201cYou go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, she got out of the car.</p><p>Until they\u2019d started seeing each other, Shaw had shown his work to very few. His friends knew he liked to draw but that was about it. The only people who really understood were Anson Butler and now Tanni.</p><p>The gallery was situated on the steepest part of the street, and she was almost out of breath when she reached the side entrance. Mr. Jefferson had asked Shaw to meet him there because of the renovations still in progress.</p><p>Looking back at Shaw, she gave him a small wave and then stepped into the gallery.</p><p>\u201cMr. Jefferson?\u201d she called out, standing just inside the door. She heard the sound of hammering and the whining of an electric sander and called again, more loudly.</p><p>Will Jefferson came out, wearing a tool belt. He was tall and about the same age as her father had been when he died. Maybe older. He stared at her blankly. \u201cI\u2019m Tanni Bliss. My mom\u2019s Shirley Bliss,\u201d she told him. \u201cMom gave you a few pieces by my friend Shaw. And...and he asked me to stop by for him.\u201d She felt a little nervous, despite her unwavering faith in Shaw\u2019s talent.</p><p>Mr. Jefferson nodded, as if he\u2019d suddenly made the connection. \u201cShirley\u2019s daughter. Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands, once he\u2019d brushed the sawdust off his.</p><p>What if Will Jefferson didn\u2019t understand and appreciate her friend\u2019s talent the way she did? Tanni didn\u2019t know how she\u2019d tell Shaw. A rejection like this could set him back, which was something she hadn\u2019t considered until now.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re here to talk about the projects your mother dropped off the other day.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Mr. Jefferson invited her over to a table, where sketches were carefully arranged in folders; paintings, both framed and unframed, leaned against the wall, covered with plastic dropcloths. \u201cYour mother suggested it would be a good idea to involve young people in the gallery.\u201d</p><p>Tanni nodded again. She knew all about that.</p><p>\u201cI had Maryellen Bowman and an artist friend of mine take a look at these pieces,\u201d Mr. Jefferson said. \u201cI wanted some expert opinions.\u201d</p><p>Tanni held her breath, then released it as she asked the question that pounded in her head. \u201cWhat...what did they say?\u201d Her heart felt as if it had stopped beating.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen has an eye for what will sell in this area. She liked Shaw\u2019s work and recommended that I offer him a contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your friend\u2014the artist?\u201d she asked, her voice shaking just a bit.</p><p>\u201cHe had high praise for Shaw\u2019s work, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh praise,\u201d Tanni repeated. What beautiful words! Relief, excitement, pure happiness spread through her.</p><p>\u201cHe felt that Shaw\u2019s talent is still pretty raw, but he definitely sees potential in these drawings. I\u2019d like to have them on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese portraits reveal maturity and sensitivity. And they have a vivid sense of energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I agree,\u201d she said solemnly, trying to sound professional. She\u2019d worked hard with Shaw to focus on the kind of art that suited his vision and his skills\u2014and might also have some commercial appeal. Portraiture seemed the best choice.</p><p>\u201cIs Shaw in art school?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. Tanni had the advantage of having attended art classes and camps through the years. In turn, she\u2019d taught Shaw everything she\u2019d learned, or as much as she could in the time they\u2019d been together. If she said he was in art school, she was afraid Mr. Jefferson would discover she\u2019d lied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Jefferson nodded. \u201cI have an agreement here that I\u2019ll need Shaw to sign. Two copies, one for me, one for him. Once he agrees to my terms, which I think are fair to both of us, I\u2019ll be happy to display his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the prices?\u201d She didn\u2019t want Shaw to give his drawings away, but she didn\u2019t want them to be priced so high they wouldn\u2019t sell, either.</p><p>Mr. Jefferson named a price that felt exactly right. Apparently he\u2019d taken the advice of Maryellen Bowman, who was obviously a good judge, not only of art but of the market.</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds reasonable,\u201d she said, accepting the paperwork. \u201cI\u2019ll be back later.\u201d She fairly danced out of the gallery.</p><p>Tanni ran to the car, breathless with joy and excitement. Shaw was pacing outside, his breath steaming in the cold air. He stopped abruptly when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d he blurted out the instant she was within earshot.</p><p>\u201cYou have to sign these papers,\u201d she said and thrust them into his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He stared at her as he took the two sets of pages from her.</p> <p>Tanni broke into a wheezing laugh. \u201cThis is the agreement to sell your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes my stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She grinned widely. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not making this up, are you?\u201d Shaw studied her skeptically.</p><p>\u201cDid I make up those papers?\u201d</p><p>Shaw clutched them so tightly, the edges had started to crumple.</p> <p>\u201cRead the agreement first,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want, I can have my mother look it over. She\u2019s had contracts with this gallery before. Other galleries, too.\u201d</p><p>Shaw frowned uncertainly. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you think is best.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled. \u201cThen we\u2019ll ask my mother to read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Tanni slipped her arms around his waist and hugged him tight. \u201cAre you excited?\u201d</p><p>Shaw hugged her back, the papers still in his hand. \u201cMore than I thought possible. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d do this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to tell him that, but it was too late. She\u2019d said it.</p><p>Shaw\u2019s breathing became labored. And yet he didn\u2019t release his grasp on her.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d She was embarrassed now and wished she could take back the words.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shaw.\u201d She wanted to weep with joy. Her mother would say she was too young to be in love and maybe she was. All she knew was how she felt about Shaw. He was constantly in her thoughts. Their times together brought her happiness and peace\u2014in sharp contrast to the intense grief of losing her father.</p><p>Her improved outlook was noticeable to those around her, particularly her friends at school, but her mother, too. Since Tanni had met Shaw, everything in her life had become a little better.</p><p>He continued to hold her. \u201cI never understood why Anson would risk his freedom by calling Allison,\u201d he said close to her ear.</p><p>Tanni remembered how Anson had been unjustly accused of starting the fire that had destroyed The Lighthouse restaurant. Then he\u2019d disappeared, and no one other than Shaw knew he\u2019d enlisted in the army. The evidence was all circumstantial. No formal charges were filed against him, but Anson was considered a \u201cperson of interest,\u201d so if the police had learned of his whereabouts, he would\u2019ve been taken in for questioning. And if there wasn\u2019t a more plausible suspect by then, he could actually have faced arrest.</p><p>Even with that risk hanging over his head, Anson had phoned Allison. Not once or twice but repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cI told Anson he was an idiot,\u201d Shaw explained. \u201cHe could\u2019ve ended up in jail. You know what he said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it didn\u2019t matter, he needed to hear the sound of Allison\u2019s voice. I couldn\u2019t imagine loving someone so much I\u2019d take that kind of chance.\u201d He kissed her hair. \u201cI understand it now, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shaw...\u201d</p><p>Tanni noticed a couple of women coming down the street toward them and nudged Shaw. Reluctantly they broke away from each other.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so talented, but you don\u2019t seem to care if anyone sees your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a lot of what I draw right now is just for me.\u201d Her sketches were what had kept her sane\u2014somewhat sane, anyway\u2014after the accident. They were too private to share with anyone other than Shaw. Certainly not her mother, who\u2019d probably get hysterical if she saw some of them.</p><p>Despite his lack of training and encouragement and everything she\u2019d taken for granted, Shaw was an artist. He would succeed.</p><p>Tanni knew it as clearly and precisely as if she could look into the future. A few drawings in a small-town gallery was just the beginning.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Dave Flemming folded his hands in his lap. He sat in Roy McAfee\u2019s office, across from the one man he trusted to help him.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cI have to admit I was surprised to see you\u2019d made an appointment with me.\u201d</p><p>Dave had never, ever thought he\u2019d be in this position. He\u2019d promised Emily, though, and he kept his promises. \u201cI have a problem,\u201d Dave said. He didn\u2019t mince words; he felt the best way to clear himself of suspicion was to be as honest as possible.</p><p>He was busy, and he didn\u2019t have time to squander on speculation, worry and doubt. He wanted this resolved, preferably by Christmas Eve. If Roy could manage that, then Dave would thank him heartily.</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can help with this problem?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hope so.\u201d Dave still needed to visit a couple of ill parishioners, check with Cliff Harding about the Nativity scene animals and prepare an agenda for one of his committee meetings. The charity food baskets were being assembled that afternoon and he had to pick up some canned goods and get them to the church before the volunteers arrived at five. Then he\u2019d head over to the bank for his shift.</p><p>\u201cI take it this has to do with Martha Evans\u2019s missing jewelry?\u201d</p><p>That question told Dave the rumor mill had been churning at full speed and his name had been bandied about town in connection with the theft. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms, and his body language caused Dave a moment\u2019s chagrin. He wondered if his friend was attempting to distance himself from him and his problems.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk to an attorney?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Dave had considered this option and rejected it. \u201cDo you think I should?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cThat depends. Are you guilty of anything?\u201d</p><p>Of being foolish, perhaps. But the question stung his pride. \u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, didn\u2019t qualify his answer. He couldn\u2019t make it any plainer than that. He had absolutely nothing to do with Martha Evans\u2019s missing jewelry.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you, then?\u201d</p><p>Enlisting Roy\u2019s assistance had seemed like a logical decision. Now he wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI\u2019d like you to hear my side of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour side,\u201d Roy repeated, watching Dave, eyes narrowing slightly. \u201cIs there something you want to tell me that you wouldn\u2019t want an attorney to know?\u201d A frown drew his brows together, and he leaned even farther away. \u201cListen, Dave. Perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d Dave said, interrupting his friend, or the man he\u2019d assumed was his friend, \u201cI need advice.\u201d</p><p>If Roy went any farther back in that chair, he was liable to topple right off.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of advice?\u201d</p><p>Dave realized that the detective, along with Troy Davis and possibly Allan Harris, viewed him as a prime suspect. Painful and discouraging as it was to admit, if Dave had been given the same set of circumstances, he\u2019d probably make the same assumption.</p><p>\u201cBefore I say anything else, I\u2019d like you to return this gold watch to Martha Evans\u2019s heirs.\u201d He removed the watch from his wrist and handed it to the other man. He\u2019d had the clasp repaired, so there was no chance of losing it again.</p><p>Roy accepted the watch. \u201cYou have it because...\u201d He waited for Dave to explain.</p><p>\u201cMartha wanted me to have it. Her husband retired as an executive, and Martha insisted I take the watch.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t reveal whether or not he believed him. \u201cDo you have any proof of that?\u201d</p><p>Admitting he didn\u2019t mortified Dave. \u201cApparently not...I thought I did but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Roy frowned again. \u201cPerhaps you better start at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Dave wasn\u2019t sure where that was. \u201cMartha attended the church for as long as I\u2019ve been pastor.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded for him to continue.</p><p>\u201cShe was an encouragement to me, and a strong supporter, generous in nature. I...I thought of her as a second mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her this?\u201d Roy prodded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He could almost read the other man\u2019s reaction. \u201cBut she was special to me and to anyone who knew her. When she became ill, I visited her as often as I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often was that?\u201d Roy reached for a pen and pad, taking notes.</p><p>Dave couldn\u2019t tell if that was a good sign. \u201cAt least twice a week. She had a visiting nurse and I tried to stop by on days the nurse wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Roy arched his brows and made another notation. \u201cAny particular reason for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes...The way I figured it, someone should check up on Martha the days she was alone. Her daughters live in Seattle and they both work. I didn\u2019t have any nefarious motive, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>Roy glanced up from his notepad. \u201cI\u2019m only asking you the questions Sheriff Davis will ask.\u201d</p><p>Will ask. Roy seemed to believe it was inevitable that he\u2019d be questioned by the sheriff. Perhaps he was advising Dave to get his story straight, which made no sense because he\u2019d never changed it.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Roy urged, watching him closely.</p><p>\u201cA few days before she died, Martha asked me to get the watch.\u201d</p><p>Roy glanced up again. \u201cSo you knew where she kept her valuables?\u201d</p><p>Once again Dave felt as if he\u2019d already been tried and convicted. \u201cYes, but I\u2019d never\u2014\u201d He bit off the rest of what he\u2019d intended to say. Verbal protestations weren\u2019t going to help.</p><p>\u201cWhere did she keep the watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vegetable bin in her refrigerator.\u201d</p><p>Roy lifted one eyebrow. \u201cWith the broccoli?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And she kept some of her jewelry in an ice-cube tray in the freezer. She thought that was the last place a thief would look.\u201d</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s as obvious as hiding your door key under a flowerpot,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Dave merely nodded. \u201cThe watch would\u2019ve been damaged in the freezer so she kept it in a temperature-controlled bin,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd she wanted you to have it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe insisted I take it,\u201d Dave said, struggling not to sound defensive. He wanted to kick himself ten times over for accepting that watch. From the moment he\u2019d slipped it on his wrist, it had felt like a mistake.</p><p>It seemed that every protestation of innocence fell on deaf ears. Even his wife doubted him. Dave went on to explain that Martha had written a letter saying he was to have the watch.</p><p>\u201cYou actually saw the letter?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Martha showed it to me. Her attorney was coming by later that afternoon and she said she\u2019d give it to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>Dave hadn\u2019t followed up on that. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. I assume he didn\u2019t, because when Emily went to the attorney\u2019s office to check the file, the letter wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>That instigated another series of questions, which Dave did his best to answer. He told Roy that Emily had visited Allan Harris\u2019s office and been able to look at the file, thanks to Geoff Duncan, Allan\u2019s legal assistant. Dave stressed that Geoff\u2019s action had to remain confidential and that he\u2019d done it as a favor.</p><p>\u201cEmily was upset,\u201d Dave said. But not nearly as upset as he was when he\u2019d learned that Martha\u2019s letter had never been received.</p><p>Roy tapped his pencil against the pad. \u201cI can well imagine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought,\u201d Dave said, gazing down at the gold watch on Roy\u2019s desk, \u201cthat I was free to wear it.\u201d</p><p>Roy made another notation on his pad; Dave wished he could read upside down.</p><p>Roy looked up. \u201cYou want me to return the watch to Martha\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dave met his eyes. \u201cWith my sincere apologies for the misunderstanding. I feel sick about this.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t say anything for what seemed like hours but was probably only a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019m afraid this looks...incriminating.\u201d</p><p>Dave was all too aware of that.</p> <p>\u201cYou were probably the last person to see Martha Evans alive,\u201d Roy reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of a handful of people who knew where she hid her valuables.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed uncomfortably. \u201cThat seems to be the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were seen wearing a valuable gold watch that belonged to Martha\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>Dave nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else? Anything you haven\u2019t told me?\u201d</p><p>He might as well be speaking to the sheriff. Roy\u2019s questions and his own answers made him look\u2014and feel\u2014guilty. Only he wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cDave?\u201d</p><p>Unable to remain seated, Dave stood up and walked to the far side of the office. \u201cYes.\u201d His heart was hammering so wildly, it hurt to breathe. Turning around again, he reached into his pocket and removed the plastic bag that held the diamond earrings. He put it on the desk next to the watch.</p><p>Roy gestured at the earrings. \u201cThese were Martha\u2019s, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe so...Emily s-saw a picture of them in...in Martha\u2019s file.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the stammer out of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better explain.\u201d</p><p>Dave went on to tell him about Emily\u2019s discovery of the earrings. As hard as he tried to work out how they\u2019d gotten into his pockets, he couldn\u2019t. Roy was very quiet when Dave finished describing what he knew.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to return these to the family, as well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dave shrugged helplessly. \u201cI...don\u2019t know what to do. The thing is, I don\u2019t want them in my possession. Anyone who saw them might assume...They\u2019d believe I was guilty, and nothing I said would make a bit of difference.\u201d</p><p>Dave collapsed into the chair and covered his face with both hands. \u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d Roy asked, lowering his voice.</p><p>Dave lowered his hands. \u201cIt happened a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Roy waited, and when Dave didn\u2019t immediately speak, he said, \u201cOkay. Tell me what it is.\u201d</p><p>Dave felt his chest tighten with dread.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Roy said, not unkindly. \u201cMight as well spill it.\u201d</p><p>Dave would rather leave the past buried. But he no longer had a choice. He got to his feet and moved over to the window, turning his back on the detective. He closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDave,\u201d Roy said, \u201cit\u2019ll come out sooner or later. You can tell me or not. Up to you. But I suspect that whatever it is, you can bet Sheriff Davis will find out.\u201d</p><p>Dave agreed. It would be pointless to even try to keep this a secret. \u201cA month after my eighteenth birthday I was arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a police record?\u201d</p><p>This nightmare never seemed to end; it only got worse. \u201cI\u2019m...not sure. It was my first offense and I was given a light sentence\u2014three months of community service.\u201d He turned around. \u201cThe judge said if I kept out of trouble, my record would be wiped clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, but I can\u2019t say for sure.\u201d He obviously had a habit of making assumptions. He did his part and it seemed reasonable to take for granted that others had done theirs. All too often, it seemed, that turned out not to be true.</p><p>\u201cYou never checked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d been too humiliated, too embarrassed. As much as possible, he\u2019d wanted to put that part of his life behind him. \u201cBut I assume so because I work part-time at the bank, and they must\u2019ve done a security check when they hired me.\u201d</p><p>Roy wrote down something else. Apparently this latest revelation wasn\u2019t welcome news.</p><p>\u201cOther than my parents, no one knows about this,\u201d Dave said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cNot Emily?\u201d</p><p>Dave shook his head. \u201cI tried not to think about it.\u201d Most people had at least one thing in their lives that they wished they could do over. Some mistake or error in judgment. Some act of selfishness or stupidity.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention what the crime was,\u201d Roy reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>Dave swallowed. \u201cTheft.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, Roy stared up at him. \u201cWhat did you take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d A protest rose automatically to his lips. Dredging up these memories was painful, and he was a different person than he\u2019d been all those years ago.</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t press him to continue. Dave started to pace, and after a few minutes, felt ready to explain. \u201cI grew up a preacher\u2019s kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your father was a pastor, too?\u201d</p><p>Dave ignored the question because the answer was obvious. \u201cAs is often the case, there\u2019s a lot of pressure on a minister\u2019s family. We kids were expected to set an example, to behave perfectly so not to embarrass our parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty high standard to live up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was for me. I tried to be the son my father wanted. Still, no matter what I did, my parents found fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not all that different for a cop\u2019s kids,\u201d Roy told him.</p><p>Dave had never considered that the situation in other families might be the same, which was naive of him.</p><p>\u201cWhen I reached my teens, I gave up trying to please my father,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you rebelled.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement, to say the least. Dave had rejected all his father\u2019s values and principles. He\u2019d skipped classes, hung around with a rough crowd, started drinking underage. Because he\u2019d graduated from high school at seventeen he began his first year of college before his eighteenth birthday. That was when he connected with Tom Cummings and his friends.</p><p>Dave had never met anyone like Tom. He was a natural leader, and being part of his group had made Dave feel important, included. While it was true that Tom was a practical joker, a guy who always tested the limits, it was all in good fun. Or so Dave had thought. Until, one day, it ceased being fun.</p><p>Tom needed money. Dave couldn\u2019t remember why it was so critical that Tom have four hundred dollars. Of course none of them had that kind of money to spare. Although if he\u2019d had the funds\u2014or access to them\u2014Dave would\u2019ve blindly handed over whatever Tom demanded.</p><p>Someone came up with the idea. In the beginning Dave had been sure it was a joke. All too soon he discovered how real it was, and by then...</p><p>\u201cWhat were the charges against you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheft and aggravated assault.\u201d The words sounded foreign to him, as if they were from a different language. One he didn\u2019t speak, didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>His admission hung in the air between them, like the dust that follows an explosion.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the age of the victim?\u201d Roy finally asked.</p><p>The tightness in his throat made it almost impossible to answer. \u201cSeventy-three.\u201d</p><p>Roy set his pen aside and exhaled slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell me how bad this looks,\u201d Dave muttered.</p><p>If news of his youthful arrest went public, no one would ever believe that he hadn\u2019t stolen from Martha Evans. No one would ever believe him again, period. He\u2019d lose all credibility.</p><p>He might as well give up now. The fact that the incident had happened almost twenty years ago didn\u2019t matter. Nor did all the years he\u2019d served God and this community. People would remember only one thing about him\u2014what he\u2019d done at eighteen.</p><p>Roy was suspiciously quiet.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to advise me to turn myself in,\u201d Dave said stiffly, his back straight and his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cDid you steal Martha Evans\u2019s jewelry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut everyone will think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the truth,\u201d Roy said without emotion, \u201cand since it is the truth, I don\u2019t feel you have anything to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Dave\u2019s relief was so great that for a moment he thought he might break down.</p><p>\u201cYou believe I\u2019m telling the truth even though all the evidence seems to point directly at me?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cSheriff Davis would be the first to tell you that while circumstantial evidence can solve a crime, it can be misleading, too. The person responsible for the crime isn\u2019t always the most obvious. Everything you\u2019ve told me amounts to circumstantial evidence. You claim you didn\u2019t have anything to do with those missing jewels. I\u2019ve known you for a number of years and I\u2019ve never seen you do anything underhanded or dishonest. So...I believe you.\u201d</p><p>It felt good to have at least one person on his side. \u201cWhy should you trust me? I mean, maybe I haven\u2019t really changed. Maybe I\u2019m still a thief.\u201d He couldn\u2019t resist pushing Roy. He needed all the reassurance he could get.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Again Roy shrugged. \u201cBecause I do. First, you wouldn\u2019t wander around town flaunting that watch if you\u2019d stolen it. For another thing, I feel I\u2019m a good judge of character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLast, and probably most important,\u201d Roy said, leaning forward and scribbling a note on his pad, \u201cSheriff Davis has a fairly good idea who might be responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d</p><p>Roy met his gaze and nodded.</p><p>Dave continued to stare at him. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me who you think it might be?\u201d</p> <p>Roy grinned. Then he said, \u201cThat\u2019s not up to me. You\u2019ve asked for my advice and I\u2019ll give it to you. Go see Sheriff Davis and tell him everything you\u2019ve just told me.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Troy Davis decided this was destined to be the worst Christmas of his life. He could see it happening already. Everywhere he turned people were in good spirits. Even the crime rate was down. Folks around town had taken a kinder, gentler approach to life. Instead of lifting his own mood, however, that only irritated him. In a word, he was depressed.</p><p>The reason, and he was obliged to admit the fault was of his own making, could be attributed to a number of unpleasant factors. First and foremost, the woman he loved wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>They\u2019d parted on relatively friendly terms. But he wondered if it would\u2019ve been better if they\u2019d simply blown up at each other, if they\u2019d stopped hiding the pain and the anger. But oh, no, that wasn\u2019t Faith\u2019s way. She\u2019d wanted to end their relationship on a civilized note. For all the well-wishing between them, he told himself peevishly, you\u2019d think they\u2019d gotten engaged.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t help his mood that Dave Flemming seemed to have involved the entire town in this ridiculous Nativity reenactment. The whole cast of characters, from Mary and Joseph right down to the drummer boy, was made up of volunteers. They were displaying the tableau nightly for two weeks, until December twenty-third. People who came to see it were asked to bring a nonperishable item to feed the hungry or throw a dollar or two into a donation box. Word had spread to the surrounding communities and there were whole caravans of cars and trucks making their way to Cedar Cove. So that meant traffic snarls and chaos on the road, which required him to add a rotation of deputies to deal with it.</p><p>Troy had no idea how Dave had managed to borrow a camel for the program. From some petting zoo, maybe? But camels weren\u2019t the friendliest or most tolerant of beasts, or so he\u2019d heard. In addition, Dave had located a few head of sheep, a donkey and some cattle; all of them were required to stand in adoration for at least four hours every night. Nothing like this had ever taken place in Cedar Cove before and the event was an unqualified success. It was even more popular than the seagull calling contest, which was really saying something.</p><p>Successful as it was, though, the Nativity scene put a lot of pressure on Pastor Flemming. And things would only get worse because Troy was obliged to call him in for questioning. Martha Evans\u2019s relatives were on him like white on rice. Those two women wanted their mother\u2019s jewelry, and they weren\u2019t going to let up until Troy made an arrest. Circumstantially, everything pointed to Dave Flemming. But after all these years in police work, Troy knew he could rely on his instincts and he didn\u2019t believe for a minute that Dave was involved. Still, there were a few unanswered questions he needed to ask\u2014not that Dave was the only \u201cperson of interest\u201d here. Unfortunately the likely culprit had been cagey and Troy didn\u2019t have a legitimate reason to order a visit to the station\u2014not yet, anyway.</p><p>The phone rang and he grabbed it, grateful for the interruption. \u201cSheriff Davis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d His daughter\u2019s sweet voice instantly made him feel better. \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame to you, sweetheart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw Faith this morning.\u201d</p><p>Troy gritted his teeth. Megan didn\u2019t realize she was rubbing salt in an open wound. \u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d was the best he could manage.</p><p>\u201cShe said to tell you hello.\u201d</p><p>Troy straightened. This might be a sign. Perhaps Faith was signaling that she\u2019d be receptive to hearing from him. His mood lightened a little more. \u201cDid she now?\u201d Perhaps Faith had experienced a change of heart and was using his daughter as a messenger.</p><p>\u201cI told you she\u2019s helping me with my knitting, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you said something about it.\u201d He was afraid to reveal how desperate he was for every detail his daughter could give him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet for lunch every week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Again, he kept his voice even so as not to indicate any undue interest.</p> <p>\u201cIt is. We talk about my pregnancy and she\u2019s been really helpful. She\u2019s a lot like Mom, you know. She listens and reassures me. I like her so much.\u201d</p><p>Troy let the comment slide, eager to hear anything Faith might have said, but not so eager that he\u2019d ask his daughter outright.</p><p>\u201cI asked her why the two of you didn\u2019t get together. You used to like each other, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that was eons ago.\u201d</p><p>Megan sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what Faith said, too.\u201d</p><p>Troy knew she\u2019d never say anything openly critical of him, especially to Megan. He was astonished that the two of them had become friends without his knowing it. Who would\u2019ve guessed? Now Megan was practically begging him to date the very woman she\u2019d once feared would come between them.</p><p>\u201cShe had lots of nice things to say about you.\u201d</p><p>He resisted asking his daughter to list those things one by one.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Before he could form a reply, Megan said, \u201cSomething you don\u2019t want to tell me because Faith doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, either.\u201d</p><p>Troy exhaled. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s best to leave the past in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make things right between you and Faith.\u201d</p><p>He considered the offer and could think of nothing. \u201cNo, but thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Troy glanced up and saw Roy McAfee in the doorway. \u201cLet me call you back,\u201d he told his daughter.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a visitor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Megan sounded disappointed. \u201cI wish it was Faith.\u201d</p><p>So did Troy. If Santa was up to granting requests this year, Troy would ask for another chance with her. Unfortunately, all the evidence said there was no Santa.</p><p>\u201cBye, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye for now.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he\u2019d replaced the receiver, Roy stepped into his office. Troy motioned for him to take a seat. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d he asked. It went without saying that his friend wasn\u2019t making a social call. If Roy came to the office, it was on official business.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any new leads on the Martha Evans case?\u201d Roy began. He claimed the chair across from Troy, leaned back and ostentatiously made himself comfortable. It was an unspoken way of conveying that he had information to share.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d This was a routine they sometimes played out, dodging and feinting until the information was exchanged. Troy liked the private detective and trusted his judgment, but he was the lawman and he made sure Roy understood that.</p><p>\u201cI had a visitor yesterday,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cWas this in regard to the missing jewelry?\u201d</p><p>A regal nod from Roy.</p><p>\u201cAnyone I know?\u201d</p><p>Roy hesitated, then inclined his head again.</p><p>\u201cAs it happens, I had a visitor myself regarding this matter. On Monday as well.\u201d</p><p>McAfee lifted his eyebrows. \u201cAnyone I know?\u201d he said, echoing Troy\u2019s own question.</p><p>But Troy could be as evasive as his friend. He inclined his head, too.</p><p>\u201cMy visitor was Dave Flemming,\u201d Roy told him.</p><p>\u201cGeoff Duncan came to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he now?\u201d McAfee went on to tell him everything Dave had said, which was quite a bit.</p><p>Troy then revealed that Dave had phoned and asked to speak to him but wanted to wait until after Christmas. After that, Troy was more convinced than ever that his theory was correct.</p><p>\u201cGeoff came to tell me he was in a quandary,\u201d he said casually. \u201cApparently he\u2019s been wrestling with what to do and decided that even if he did lose his job, he couldn\u2019t keep quiet any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you about Emily Flemming\u2019s visit to the law office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he might do that.\u201d Roy stood, reached inside his pants pocket and produced the gold watch and a pair of diamond earrings.</p><p>Troy immediately recognized both as part of the Evans estate. \u201cYou got those from Dave?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cHe claims the watch was a gift from Martha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the paperwork was supposed to be in the file, only it wasn\u2019t. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Roy said. Then he added, \u201cDave says he doesn\u2019t know where the diamond earrings came from. He told me he\u2019d never laid eyes on them until his wife showed them to him. She found them in his suit jacket.\u201d</p><p>Troy said nothing.</p><p>McAfee studied him closely. \u201cI believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d The sheriff relaxed in his chair and leaned back. \u201cWant to tell me what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Sheriff\u2014if you\u2019re willing to share your thoughts, too.\u201d</p><p>Troy chuckled. \u201cI have a feeling we\u2019ve reached the same conclusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were a betting man, I\u2019d lay odds on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCards on the table, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCards on the table,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>Rachel carried a box of clothes into the living room and stacked it on top of the others. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d allowed Bruce to talk her into an early wedding at this time of year. Christmas!</p><p>It was insane.</p><p>It was wonderful.</p><p>She was eager to wake up in the morning with the man she loved by her side. She\u2019d given notice on her small rental house but had until New Year\u2019s Eve to move everything out.</p><p>Jolene burst back into the house. \u201cAnything else?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTake the box on top. It isn\u2019t heavy.\u201d Rachel bent to rearrange the dishes in one carton.</p><p>\u201cOkay, got it.\u201d She grabbed it and headed outside to Bruce\u2019s truck.</p><p>Bruce, who was entering the house as Jolene went out, held the door for his daughter.</p><p>Rachel straightened and rubbed the small of her back. She was astonished by the amount of stuff she\u2019d managed to accumulate during her seven years in this rental. Most of the furniture was second-hand and she intended to donate it to charity, but that still left a lot to pack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cMaybe we should all take a break.\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head, despite the fact that she\u2019d started work at eight that morning and been on her feet nine hours before rushing home to pack.</p><p>Walking over to her, Bruce drew her into the circle of his arms. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor loving me and Jolene. For agreeing to marry me now and not making me wait until February.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Bruce, I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you we should have our wedding over the holidays?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled and ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cI can see you\u2019re going to be the kind of husband who says \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas I right, or was I right?\u201d he asked, leaning back enough to look her in the eyes, then kiss the tip of her nose.</p><p>The screen door slammed shut and Jolene bounded into the house. She came to an abrupt halt, sighing loudly. \u201cAre you two going to get all kissy-face again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Bruce said.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to leave?\u201d It might have sounded like a joke but Rachel knew it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She reluctantly broke away. Jolene wasn\u2019t comfortable with even the lightest of kisses between her father and Rachel. Bruce didn\u2019t seem to notice, but Rachel certainly had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Jolene announced.</p><p>Bruce glanced at his watch. \u201cWell, no wonder! It\u2019s after eight.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d started loading Bruce\u2019s truck as soon as Rachel got off work at six. She\u2019d packed as much as she could the night before, but the salon was extra-busy so close to the holidays. Trying to adjust her schedule, pack and move in with Bruce and Jolene, get ready for Christmas and her wedding, all within a few days, plus get the rental house clean, was too much\u2014and yet Rachel wouldn\u2019t have changed a thing.</p> <p>\u201cLet me drive this load to the house,\u201d Bruce suggested next. \u201cOn the way back I\u2019ll pick up something for dinner. What would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChicken!\u201d Jolene shouted.</p><p>Bruce looked at Rachel. \u201cChicken sounds good to me, too,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShould I come with you or stay with Rachel?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cI could use some more help packing up my bedroom,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bye, Dad.\u201d Jolene hugged Bruce, then started to gather up empty cartons.</p> <p>\u201cDo I get a kiss goodbye?\u201d Bruce asked, his eyes sparkling with mischief.</p><p>Remembering Jolene\u2019s response to the last kiss, Rachel said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Bruce pouted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going to be stingy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be sensible. We both have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything we can do together?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d she murmured, glancing over her shoulder to confirm that Jolene had left the room. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to spend the rest of the night cuddled up on that sofa with you, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, kissed her cheek, then sauntered out, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDad gone already?\u201d Jolene asked, dragging a cardboard box into the living room.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but he won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Jolene set down the box and threw herself on the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>Jolene shrugged. \u201cYou marrying my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy about it, though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The lack of enthusiasm caught Rachel unawares. Dropping the tablecloth she was folding, she sat beside Jolene. \u201cMaybe we should talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Jolene hung her head. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried things will change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will,\u201d she said, then added, \u201cThey already have.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had to admit she was right. Everything had changed\u2014between her and Bruce, and between her and Jolene, too. Rachel was grateful for the girl\u2019s honesty.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dad will probably have a baby,\u201d Jolene muttered next.</p><p>Rachel and Bruce had discussed that very subject more than once. Because she was thirty-three, Rachel wanted to get pregnant within the first year. Bruce was in full agreement.</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted a brother or sister,\u201d Rachel commented.</p><p>\u201cI do...sort of,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cI used to think I did, but now that it might really happen, I know everyone will pay attention to the baby and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not you,\u201d Rachel finished for her. She placed her arm around Jolene\u2019s shoulders and brought her close. From the time Jolene was six, Rachel had been a constant in her life. She knew this child, loved her\u2014couldn\u2019t imagine loving her more than she already did.</p><p>Jolene shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cYour father loves you, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby or no baby, that isn\u2019t going to change.\u201d</p><p>The girl sighed, staring down at her hands.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to change with me, either,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>After a short pause, Jolene asked, \u201cWill I have to call you Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to call me?\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked at her uncertainly. \u201cI think of you as Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call me Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be my mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene, call me whatever makes you the most comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I had a mom,\u201d she cried suddenly, startling Rachel.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did, and Stephanie will always be with you and part of you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene\u2019s face was anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget her and I\u2019m afraid I will.\u201d</p><p>The anguish in her voice was heartbreaking, and Rachel knew she had to respond carefully.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jolene, you aren\u2019t going to forget her. I can promise you that. Remember, I lost my mother, too.\u201d</p><p>When her own mother died, Rachel had gone to live with her aunt\u2014her mother\u2019s older sister. Her father, unlike Bruce, didn\u2019t want a youngster underfoot. He was a busy man with a job that often took him out of town. He\u2019d died of a heart attack when she was in her early twenties. She first came to live with her aunt at the age of ten and was supposed to stay in Cedar Cove just until school was over. Her father had intended to make other arrangements, which in retrospect probably meant a boarding school.</p><p>Her aunt was a levelheaded woman, strict and orderly, but not without affection. She\u2019d never married. After the school year she\u2019d suggested Rachel continue living with her. Her father was only too willing to agree.</p><p>\u201cWhen you and Dad get married, will I have to take down my mother\u2019s picture?\u201d Jolene asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Jolene kept it on the dresser in her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI need it to remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d Rachel smoothed the hair away from Jolene\u2019s brow. \u201cThis has all come at you pretty quickly, hasn\u2019t it? Your dad and me getting married, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I thought you were marrying Nate and moving away, and then all of a sudden Dad tells me he loves you and now you two are getting married. That was supposed to happen on Valentine\u2019s Day and now it\u2019s Christmas and you\u2019re moving in with us.\u201d</p><p>Hearing it from Jolene\u2019s perspective, it did seem rushed. \u201cWould you rather we waited until February?\u201d Rachel asked. If that was the case she\u2019d delay the wedding.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t give you time to adjust to the idea,\u201d Rachel murmured, feeling she\u2019d failed Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI want you to marry my dad. And I want you to move in with us....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Rachel acknowledged the girl\u2019s indecision. \u201cI understand you\u2019re feeling confused,\u201d she said. \u201cThings really have changed too fast for you, haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jolene agreed, and Rachel sensed her relief.</p><p>How foolish she and Bruce had been. Without meaning to, they\u2019d excluded his daughter. They\u2019d been so focused on their own emotions, Jolene had taken second place.</p><p>\u201cShall we think about this for a minute? What would you like to see happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be my friend again.\u201d</p><p>Rachel hadn\u2019t considered it that way. \u201cI\u2019ll always be your friend, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be. Except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what?\u201d Rachel pressed.</p><p>\u201cExcept...I don\u2019t like it when you and Dad kiss and stuff. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not even in the room, but I am and I see everything. It\u2019s embarrassing. None of my friends\u2019 parents kiss like that.\u201d</p><p>Rachel figured the newness of the attraction between her and Bruce would wear off in time. But in the meanwhile, Jolene\u2019s discomfort had to be taken into account. Rachel\u2019s heart sank as she thought about this. It was all more complicated than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>Rachel spent the next fifteen or twenty minutes listening to Jolene, encouraging her to express her concerns, trying to reassure her. When the front door opened and Bruce strolled in carrying a large white bag containing their dinner, he seemed to sense that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked at Jolene, whose eyes seemed to plead with her not to say anything.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Jolene squeezed her hand in thanks.</p><p>\u201cAnyone hungry?\u201d Bruce asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Rachel announced with feigned cheerfulness.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Jolene chimed in.</p><p>Bruce brought the takeout meal to the kitchen. The moment he\u2019d left the living room, Rachel turned to Jolene again. \u201cLet me talk to your father,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d Rachel told her. \u201cLeave everything to me.\u201d</p><p>Jolene folded her arms, her expression downcast. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Bruce stood in the doorway.</p><p>Rachel glanced at Jolene and then at Bruce. \u201cOur lives are changing so quickly that Jolene\u2019s having a hard time keeping up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>Rachel had hoped he\u2019d understand. \u201cI\u2019m thinking she\u2019s probably right, and we may have let this whole marriage thing get ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stepped into the room. \u201cWhat are you saying? Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m a guy. You\u2019re going to have to spell it out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Rachel said, reaching for Jolene\u2019s hand, \u201cmaybe we should wait until Valentine\u2019s Day. That was the original plan and now we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelay the wedding?\u201d he broke in. \u201cNo way!\u201d Bruce shook his head vigorously. \u201cI want us married, and the sooner the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Jolene to consider,\u201d Rachel reminded him.</p><p>Bruce regarded his daughter for a moment and then knelt down in front of her. \u201cAre you upset about Rachel and me getting married?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Jolene refused to meet his gaze. \u201cA little,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do! A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>The girl shrugged, as if unable to voice her feelings.</p><p>\u201cI love Rachel,\u201d Bruce told her gently. \u201cAnd I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Rachel was proud of him for being so sensitive to his daughter. Jolene needed to know that she was still as important to Bruce as ever. She and Bruce shared an unusually close bond because it had been just the two of them for more than six years; Rachel\u2019s constant presence in their lives would disrupt that, change it. And at twelve, a girl needed her father\u2019s approval, his pride in her. Rachel was very conscious of not having received that and she refused to let the same thing happen to Jolene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone rang in the distance. Unwilling to answer it and risk breaking the mood, Rachel let the answering machine pick up.</p><p>\u201cMs. Pendergast, this is Cedar Cove Realty,\u201d a man\u2019s voice said. \u201cCould you return this call at your earliest convenience? We have a renter for the house and need the exact date you plan to vacate.\u201d</p><p>Jolene stared at Rachel, eyes wide. \u201cThe house has already been rented?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it,\u201d Bruce responded, looking far more pleased than he should.</p> <p>\u201cIf Rachel doesn\u2019t marry you now, she won\u2019t have anyplace to live.\u201d Jolene\u2019s voice was horrified.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true\u2014\u201d Rachel started to say, before Bruce cut her off.</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d Rachel wanted to jab him in the ribs and would have if he\u2019d been sitting beside her instead of Jolene. \u201cI can stay with friends.\u201d She could bunk down in Teri\u2019s huge house for a couple of months. It would be an imposition, but Teri was the kind of friend who wouldn\u2019t have any objections\u2014who\u2019d insist on it, for that matter.</p><p>\u201cThen...you and Rachel should get married this week,\u201d Jolene said after a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI say we wait,\u201d Rachel returned decisively. She needed to let her soon-to-be stepdaughter know that she heard her concerns and took them seriously.</p><p>Bruce glared at her. \u201cI want to marry you now. You want Rachel with us, too, right, Jolene?\u201d</p><p>Jolene met Rachel\u2019s eyes. After a long pause she slowly nodded. \u201cRight, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Olivia was gradually regaining her strength. She sat in the sunny kitchen and soaked in the warmth as she sipped a cup of green tea.</p><p>Justine was coming by later and Grace had just left. As little as two days ago she would\u2019ve taken a nap but Olivia didn\u2019t feel she needed one now. That was encouraging. She really was recovering from the surgery and the infection. Her chemotherapy would start soon after the holidays, as originally scheduled. She\u2019d joked that it was a late Christmas gift\u2014the gift that kept on giving\u2014and to her surprise Jack had looked at her with somber eyes. \u201cYes, Olivia, it is. It\u2019s giving me you. Your life, your health\u2014to me that\u2019s the greatest gift.\u201d He usually joked and bantered his way through everything, so his emotional statement had moved her deeply.</p> <p>She heard the sound of a car pulling into the driveway and immediately recognized it as Ben\u2019s. Ever the gentlemen, he parked, climbed out and came around to open her mother\u2019s door.</p><p>Charlotte seemed to sense that they were being watched and glanced up at the kitchen window. Seeing Olivia, she smiled and waved.</p><p>Olivia waved back. She stood up and went to the back door.</p><p>\u201cWe have company,\u201d she called out to Jack who was walking on the treadmill. He\u2019d made a habit of exercising ever since his heart attack. Olivia enjoyed finding small ways to reward him for his diligence.</p><p>\u201cWho...is...it?\u201d Jack called back from the master bedroom, panting between each word.</p><p>\u201cMom and Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me...five...minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her mother and stepfather approached, and Olivia swung open the door. Charlotte carried a white wicker basket with a sprig of holly and a bright red bow attached.</p> <p>Olivia bent to kiss her mother\u2019s cheek and then Ben\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Olivia, you look wonderful! There\u2019s color in your cheeks and you\u2019re looking much more like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling better, Mom. Come and sit with me. Want some green tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely.\u201d Charlotte set the basket on the table. \u201cI\u2019ll get the tea. You and Ben take a load off your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia protested, \u201cI can do it.\u201d Her mother refused to listen, and Olivia realized that ever since her diagnosis, Charlotte needed to wait on her. It was one of the few ways she could feel any sense of control\u2014by taking care of her daughter. That typically involved food.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the basket?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cDinner for you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>Everyone had been so kind and thoughtful. Grace had brought over a taco casserole the night before. She\u2019d made it from scratch, using her homemade salsa and lots of cheese in hopes of tempting Olivia to eat. The fact was, Olivia had lost ten pounds in the last two months. Those were pounds she could ill afford to lose. Her clothes hung on her.</p><p>Jack, on the other hand, still struggled with his weight and all these delicious things around the house tormented him. He\u2019d had two helpings of Grace\u2019s casserole while Olivia had barely managed a few bites. They\u2019d frozen the leftovers.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Olivia asked as she removed the layer of foil covering the basket.</p><p>\u201cSoup,\u201d Charlotte answered. \u201cChicken noodle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, that\u2019s perfect!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fresh-baked bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny Christmas cookies or candy?\u201d Jack wanted to know, stepping into the kitchen. He\u2019d draped a towel around his neck and his face was red.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s Christmas.\u201d He poked around inside the basket and triumphantly brought out a plate of decorated sugar cookies.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite!\u201d he cried delightedly. \u201cSugar cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery kind of cookie\u2019s his favorite,\u201d Olivia told Ben under her breath.</p><p>Ben chuckled and whispered back, \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel. Anything Charlotte bakes is instantly my favorite.\u201d He smiled at Olivia\u2019s mother as she puttered around the kitchen, making a fresh pot of green tea.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Charlotte,\u201d Jack said. He peeled back the plastic wrap and grabbed a cookie. On his way out of the kitchen, he kissed his mother-in-law\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Once the three of them were sitting around the table, Olivia asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s new with you?\u201d</p><p>Ben glanced at Charlotte. \u201cWe leave for our cruise in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gasped. \u201cAlready?\u201d With so much else happening, she\u2019d completely forgotten about the cruise.</p><p>Charlotte placed her hands on the table. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure we should leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only are you going on that cruise, I absolutely demand that you have the time of your lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Charlotte frowned. \u201cYou might need me. You\u2019ll be starting your treatment soon and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Jack,\u201d she broke in.</p><p>Her mother sighed expressively. \u201cJack is a man. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love him dearly, but no matter how much he loves you, he\u2019s not your mother. And when you\u2019re sick, that\u2019s who you need,\u201d she said.</p><p>That Charlotte and Ben would even consider not going at this late date nearly brought Olivia to tears. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fine, Mom. Before you know it, this will all be behind me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia clung to that belief. This was the longest stretch of time she\u2019d spent away from the courthouse since she\u2019d become a judge. She\u2019d had no choice in the matter but she missed her work and her colleagues.</p><p>Her mother still seemed worried. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel right about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, Mom, and you have to promise me you\u2019ll enjoy every minute.\u201d</p><p>Before Charlotte could argue anymore, Jack walked back into the kitchen and reached for another cookie. A bell-shaped one this time, with white frosting. He hesitated almost as if he expected Olivia to slap his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to stop me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cConsider that cookie your reward for working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy only reward?\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows and nodded.</p><p>Jack shook his head morosely and set the sugar cookie back on the plate. \u201cIn that case one cookie will do.\u201d He took the chair next to Olivia.</p><p>Olivia did her best to suppress a smile, but didn\u2019t succeed. With some effort she returned her attention to her mother. \u201cJust think about lazing away your days in the Caribbean sunshine.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte reached across the table and entwined her fingers with Ben\u2019s. \u201cBeing in the sunshine over Christmas does sound wonderful,\u201d she said in a wistful voice.</p><p>\u201cThe warmth will do our aging bones good,\u201d Ben told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know...but the thought of leaving Olivia bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Jack protested, \u201cwhat am I? Chopped liver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a man.\u201d Olivia repeated what her mother had said, her mouth twitching.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never complained about that before,\u201d Jack muttered.</p><p>Looking benignly at her mother, Olivia kicked him under the table.</p><p>Jack, being Jack, doubled over and grabbed his ankle, grimacing as if she\u2019d injured him.</p><p>\u201cWill you cut it out?\u201d she said when he popped back up.</p><p>Ben laughed. \u201cI think we can rest assured that Olivia is well on the road to recovery. Jack, now, might need intensive therapy for that ankle.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cA car\u2019s coming for us first thing in the morning,\u201d Ben told them. \u201cOur flight for Fort Lauderdale takes off at eight and the cruise starts on December eighteenth. We\u2019ll be back home a week later on Christmas Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeven days never seemed so long,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>\u201cMom, a week in paradise and you\u2019re complaining?\u201d</p><p>The lines between her mother\u2019s eyes relaxed and Charlotte smiled. \u201cI sound like a silly old woman, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. \u201cGo. Your daughter\u2019s in my capable hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat does it!\u201d Charlotte burst out. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d</p><p>Ben laughed, and Charlotte\u2019s laughter joined his.</p><p>\u201cI was just teasing,\u201d she told them.</p><p>\u201cWill has a key to the house,\u201d Ben went on to say. \u201cHe said he\u2019d check in every couple of days. And Justine will be coming by, as well, to look after Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing Christmas Day?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of dinner,\u201d Jack announced proudly.</p><p>This seemed to impress her mother and stepfather, and Olivia felt obliged to explain. \u201cHe\u2019s ordering in a meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just any meal,\u201d Jack insisted. \u201cOur dinner\u2019s being catered by D.D.\u2019s on the Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Charlotte said, clasping her hands. \u201cHow romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly what I want for you and Ben,\u201d Olivia told her mother. \u201cI want you to fall in love all over again.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s fingers tightened around Charlotte\u2019s. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a cruise for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t, either,\u201d Olivia whispered, smiling at Jack.</p><p>Her mother and Ben stayed only a few minutes longer.</p><p>By the time they left, both seemed reassured and eager for their trip, promising to come back refreshed.</p><p>The sound of the car had yet to fade when Jack turned to her. \u201cI believe you owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reward, remember?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, honestly, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, honestly.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed and held open her arms.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Tanni asked, standing at the edge of the highway some distance outside town. Cars streaked past her, kicking up rain water, splashing the backs of her pant legs.</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something.\u201d Shaw had parked his car and already started walking into the woods. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she demanded a second time. Shaw had been acting so strange and secretive and that wasn\u2019t like him.</p><p>\u201cBack here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the woods?\u201d She looked down at her new boots and sighed. The dense forest floor would be muddy and wet. If these got ruined, her mother wasn\u2019t likely to buy her another pair.</p> <p>Instead of arguing with her, Shaw rushed back and grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy all the secrecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know why once you get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis better be good,\u201d she muttered. Her feet made squishing sounds in the damp earth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only ever told one other person about this.\u201d</p><p>In other words, whatever this was, the fact that he was showing it to her was a sign of his trust. Her boots sank deeper into the mud but she refused to look at them. If Shaw was willing to share something he considered important, she didn\u2019t care how far she had to walk into the woods or how many pairs of boots she had to ruin.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the way back here?\u201d she asked when they\u2019d gone about a hundred feet. Tree limbs hung low, admitting very little light. Despite the darkness and the lack of a clear path, he seemed to know exactly where he was going.</p><p>\u201cNot much farther,\u201d he assured her, his hand still clutching hers.</p><p>\u201cShaw!\u201d she cried, grabbing his arm with her other hand when she nearly slipped on a fallen branch covered with moss.</p><p>He held her about the waist and kept her from falling. \u201cBe careful,\u201d he said.</p><p>They continued at a slower pace. Tanni glanced over her shoulder and discovered that the road was completely out of sight. She couldn\u2019t even guess where he was leading her. Perhaps there was an abandoned cabin nearby or a\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tanni looked around and didn\u2019t see anything unusual or different. Thinking she might have missed something, she turned in a complete circle. \u201cWe\u2019re where?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI found this years ago when I was a kid,\u201d Shaw explained. He started to drag a heavy branch away. He removed three such branches, which he\u2019d apparently arranged to hide the opening of a cave.</p> <p>He stood back and grinned, making a sweeping motion with his arms. \u201cTa da!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lived in this area nearly her entire life and she\u2019d never heard anything about caves. Her brother, Nick, would\u2019ve loved exploring here. He\u2019d never mentioned it, either. \u201cDoes anyone else know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cbecause it\u2019s state land. As far as I can tell, no one had been inside for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find it?\u201d</p><p>Shaw stared down at his feet. \u201cWhen I was eight, I joined Cub Scouts. We were on a hike down here near Lighthouse Point and I got separated from the rest of the pack. Pretty soon I was lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t have a good sense of direction.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIn other words, I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Nothing wrong with my sense of direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. It\u2019d started to rain and I went inside and waited until I heard someone call my name. Then I ran out and met up with the others. I never told any of them, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She didn\u2019t understand his reason for keeping it a secret. This was an exciting discovery, and if she\u2019d been the one to come across it she would\u2019ve shared it with the world.</p><p>\u201cThe other kids were teasing me about getting lost and it made me mad so I didn\u2019t tell them what I\u2019d found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you told one other person....\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe night Anson ran away, I brought him here,\u201d he began. \u201cIt took me a while to locate it again, but eventually I did. Anson stayed in the cave for two days until I could find a way to get him out of Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did that for him,\u201d she breathed. Shaw would\u2019ve been in real trouble if anyone had caught him with Anson. She knew Shaw had bought him a bus ticket in Seattle, then driven him there.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend, the best I ever had. Until you.\u201d</p><p>His words nearly brought her to tears. Tanni had never had a friend like that, a friend who\u2019d take risks for her. In her universe, friendship had meant exchanging insignificant secrets and chattering about boys.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only hiding place I could think of. He promised he\u2019d never tell anyone about it and he hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even Allison Cox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what he told Allison, but I can guarantee you he didn\u2019t mention the cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...you\u2019re showing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...I came back here myself a little while ago.\u201d He reached for her hand and led her inside, warning her to duck at the entrance.</p><p>Within seconds, they were plunged into darkness. Shaw took out a small flashlight attached to his keychain and turned it on. The cave\u2019s ceiling was maybe ten feet high and they could stand up easily. Tanni saw that he\u2019d cut arched slots into the hard clay. A large candle was positioned in each. He lit the first candle and the cave was dimly illuminated. Then he moved along the walls, lighting other candles. Each one added more light. The candles burned steadily, and she noticed the melted wax that had dripped down the sides, which told her someone had spent hours inside this cave.</p><p>\u201cAnson made these candle holders,\u201d Shaw explained. \u201cTwo days is a long time when you don\u2019t have anything to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe darkness must\u2019ve freaked him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He asked for candles and I got them for him. It was his idea to set them in the walls of the cave.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cKind of primitive, but I got him a couple of flashlights, too.\u201d</p><p>She also saw a plastic-covered sleeping bag and a portable camp chair, obviously \u201cfurniture\u201d he\u2019d brought in for Anson.</p><p>\u201cYou said you came here recently. Why?\u201d</p><p>Shaw took her hand again. \u201cMy dad and I got into it last weekend. He wants me to go to law school. He says he\u2019s worked his whole life to build up his firm so he could pass it on to me. If I want to piddle around drawing faces, that\u2019s a nice hobby, but it\u2019s no career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Shaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve argued before but this was the worst. He...he kicked me out of the house. He said either I go to college or I\u2019m not welcome to live in his house.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time he\u2019d mentioned the fight. Earlier in the week she\u2019d realized something was bothering him, but when she\u2019d asked, he\u2019d brushed her questions aside and assured her nothing was wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo you came here?\u201d</p><p>Shaw nodded. \u201cI spent one night here and about froze to death.\u201d</p><p>Tanni covered her mouth with her hand.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning I called my mom and she said she\u2019d talked to my father and I should come home. I did and I...I told my dad I\u2019m taking my GED. That seemed to appease him for now. He gave me until the first of the year to make a decision about college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can spend Christmas with me if you want,\u201d Tanni said. Her mother had already agreed.</p><p>\u201cI...might. Let me see how things go at home, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Tanni hated knowing he\u2019d been alone in this cave for even one night.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, Shaw said, \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep much when I was here.\u201d</p><p>Tanni shivered. \u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind it during the day\u2014maybe because I knew it was still light outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used my sleeping bag\u2014\u201d he pointed to it \u201c\u2014and I tried to start a fire near the entrance. I couldn\u2019t, though, because the wood was too damp. After a while, I got cold and bored, so I decided to explore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt night?\u201d Not that there was much difference between day and night inside the cave.</p><p>\u201cIt was closer to morning. I had my flashlight and I found that this cave leads into another one and then another one. That\u2019s when I saw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw what?\u201d She had to admit her curiosity was piqued.</p><p>His hand closed more tightly around hers. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He led her a few steps and stopped. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d She wasn\u2019t the type to faint because she saw a spider or even a bat. She figured his big find was something along those lines, since she knew bat colonies lived in caves.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her and his lips were cold against hers.</p><p>When he broke away, he said, \u201cSometimes...\u201d But he let the rest drop.</p><p>\u201cSometimes what, Shaw?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now,\u201d she urged, wrapping her arms around him.</p><p>He exhaled, closing his eyes and pressing his forehead against hers. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m drawing, I think about the two of us working together. Both of us artists...\u201d</p><p>The image blossomed in Tanni\u2019s mind. At first being inside the cave had felt a bit frightening. It didn\u2019t when Shaw kissed her. \u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she said warmly.</p><p>He kissed her again.</p><p>This time Tanni broke it off. \u201cYou were going to show me something, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I remember.\u201d He was breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cFirst tell me\u2014is it good or bad?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cBad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad,\u201d she repeated. \u201cHow bad? In what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d He paused. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone. But I called Anson and he said I couldn\u2019t ignore it. I decided he\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Tanni was beginning to feel anxious; his tension was definitely communicating itself to her. Why was he being so mysterious?</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d she said, with no idea what to expect.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else here, is there?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before he answered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a flashlight out of a heavy plastic bag in the corner. Then he took her hand, fingers tight around hers, and led her deeper into the cave\u2019s interior. The light bounced against the sides, creating eerie shadows that seemed to loom over them.</p><p>As they moved forward, her feet made splashing sounds, and she began to tremble. If it was from the cold or from anxiety, she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>They ducked around a corner and into a smaller cave, and Tanni stopped.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you doing?\u201d Shaw asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. How much farther is it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot very far.\u201d</p><p>A sense of foreboding filled her. Her heart started to race and despite the cold, sweat broke out across her forehead. They crept forward and suddenly Shaw came to a halt.</p><p>Then she saw it. For an instant she assumed it was a dead animal. Mere seconds later, she realized she was standing next to a human skeleton\u2014probably that of a man. He sat propped up against the side of the cave, a baseball cap on his head. It had slipped to a jaunty angle, which looked grotesque\u2014there was no other word\u2014and she could see clumps of hair that clung to the skull. His clothes were in shreds and he wore a pair of tennis shoes.</p><p>She gasped and turned to Shaw.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWe have to tell the sheriff,\u201d she said, trying to quell the hysteria that wanted to rise.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long he\u2019s been here\u2014he was a human being, Shaw. He died in here alone and...afraid.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure how she knew that but she did. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to call the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. But I almost don\u2019t want to disturb him, you know?\u201d</p> <p>Frankly she didn\u2019t. This man had not died peacefully, and he deserved some kind of justice, a decent burial, some acknowledgment. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cLet\u2019s go. My cell\u2019s in the car.\u201d</p><p>An hour and a half later the road by the forest was lined with law enforcement vehicles, their red lights flashing. Tanni counted four different cars. The deputies had hauled out several large lights and carried them to the cave once Shaw had shown them the way.</p><p>Shaw and Tanni sat in Sheriff Davis\u2019s vehicle, holding hands. After a few minutes, the sheriff opened the door. He\u2019d spoken to Shaw while a deputy questioned Tanni; apparently their stories aligned because he\u2019d allowed them to stay together.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known about the body?\u201d Sheriff Davis directed his question to Shaw.</p><p>\u201cThree days,\u201d Shaw said. It was the same answer he\u2019d given earlier.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you again\u2014you didn\u2019t move the remains? You didn\u2019t touch anything?\u201d</p> <p>Shaw said he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Sheriff Davis wrote that down on his pad.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Shaw asked as two uniformed deputies carried out a body bag and brought it to the waiting ambulance.</p><p>The sheriff shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Tanni exchanged a look with Shaw. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019ve identified the body and can\u2019t tell us?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr that you don\u2019t know, period?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t know, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your missing persons file?\u201d Tanni suggested. Surely there was some explanation.</p><p>The sheriff closed his pad and placed it inside his shirt pocket. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out what we need to know soon enough,\u201d he informed them. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an unsolved murder in this town since I became sheriff, and this one\u2019s not going to be the first.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty-Four</p><p>Christie knew something was wrong the instant she heard her sister\u2019s voice mail. She stood in the store lunchroom, her cell phone pressed against her ear to block out the other employees\u2019 chatter.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d taken her break, Teri had left her three messages, each one more cheerful-sounding than the last. Something was definitely up. Christie wasn\u2019t that easily fooled.</p><p>\u201cCan you stop by after work this evening?\u201d Teri asked when Christie finally returned her call.</p><p>Christie exhaled slowly. \u201cThe article\u2019s out, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything when you get here.\u201d Christie suspected all these frantic calls had to do with James and that reporter, but maybe not.</p><p>\u201cThe pregnancy?\u201d she asked next, almost afraid to finish the thought.</p><p>\u201cThe babies are fine,\u201d Teri assured her. \u201cAll three. In fact, they\u2019re currently in the middle of a soccer match.\u201d</p><p>Despite her concerns, Christie smiled. \u201cWhatever it is, you can\u2019t tell me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just get here as soon as you\u2019re off work, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>This was making her nervous. She was already a little depressed that she wouldn\u2019t be seeing James until Christmas. He\u2019d phoned and left a message on her cell Tuesday afternoon, explaining that he\u2019d be out of town for at least a week. That was just as well, since the article would hit the stands any day. Christie had tried to find out when, but the reporter either hadn\u2019t known or wouldn\u2019t tell her.</p><p>James hadn\u2019t given her much information or even told her where he was going, only that he\u2019d get in touch. But Christie had listened to his message several times, closing her eyes and savoring the sound of his voice.</p><p>Their Saturday night had been magical. After a perfect dinner, they\u2019d sat in front of the fireplace, her head on his shoulder, his arm around her. It\u2019d been so...so beautiful. So intimate. She\u2019d never experienced this kind of closeness with a man. She had a list of ex-lovers, a fairly long one, but none of them had made her feel like this.</p><p>Everything was different with James.</p><p>He could have made love to her ten times over and she would\u2019ve let him. He wanted her. She felt it with every cell of her body, and she wanted him, too. And they would make love soon; she was sure of it. But their relationship was more than that. It was deeper. Truer. It wasn\u2019t just about her body or what she could do for him. He loved her. They loved each other.</p><p>In every previous relationship, Christie had felt insecure. Every time she was away from her lover of the moment, she\u2019d wonder if he was with some other woman. Would he come back? And when\u2014if\u2014he did, she\u2019d wonder if he still wanted her. Or was he thinking of someone else when they made love?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like that with James. Although he\u2019d left town, she wasn\u2019t worried that he\u2019d stray or that he\u2019d abandon her. He\u2019d be back soon and they\u2019d spend the holidays together. Maybe he\u2019d help her deliver gift baskets on Christmas Eve. She\u2019d already checked with the Salvation Army in downtown Seattle and arranged to serve meals to the homeless on Christmas Day. James would join her and afterward they\u2019d have their own Christmas dinner at her place. She looked forward to cooking it herself. All week she\u2019d occupied pleasant hours studying cookbooks and considering her menu. Christie was more domestic than anyone realized\u2014even Teri.</p><p>As she drove through Cedar Cove to her sister\u2019s, Christie examined the decorations and the multicolored lights with new eyes. She usually felt sad over the holidays, but not this year. She hadn\u2019t been so excited about Christmas since early childhood. Of course back then it had always ended in tears.</p><p>Christie hoped that whatever was troubling Teri didn\u2019t have anything to do with the pregnancy. Despite Teri\u2019s reassurances, she couldn\u2019t help worrying. Triplets! Teri always seemed to do things in a big way.</p><p>By the time Christie drove through the gate and into the yard, her sister was standing at the front door, waiting for her. Christie parked and hurried to the house.</p><p>Teri\u2019s somber face frightened her. She reached for Christie\u2019s hand and pulled her inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe article\u2019s out. You were right about that,\u201d she murmured, drawing her into the family room.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bobby?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the library. He\u2019s dealing with the phone calls. It seems as if every reporter in the world wants to talk to James. And since they can\u2019t reach him, they\u2019ll settle for Bobby.\u201d Her lips thinned in obvious disapproval. Clearly she felt that James should be fielding his own questions instead of leaving it all to Bobby.</p><p>Christie understood Teri\u2019s reaction, her desire to protect Bobby, but she didn\u2019t think it was entirely fair. James couldn\u2019t stay here now that a reporter had tracked him down, now that everyone knew who he was. Then it hit her. \u201cSomething\u2019s happened to him, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d No wonder her sister hadn\u2019t been willing to tell her over the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s been in an accident?\u201d Her heart slammed against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cChristie...\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cHow badly is he hurt? Tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames wasn\u2019t in an accident,\u201d Teri said calmly.</p><p>Relief flooded through her and she sank into the nearest chair. \u201cThank God.\u201d On the heels of her relief came another realization. If he wasn\u2019t hurt, then something else was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI made coffee,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>Standing, Christie followed her into the kitchen. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d</p><p>Teri exhaled noisily. \u201cHe resigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he resigned? Resigned from what?\u201d</p><p>Teri met her gaze. \u201cHis job, Christie. James is no longer employed by Bobby.\u201d</p><p>It took her a moment to grasp Teri\u2019s words. As she stared at her sister, Teri poured a mug of coffee and handed it to her.</p><p>Christie accepted it automatically. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t want to drive Bobby around anymore. That\u2019s not the end of the world, is it?\u201d Okay, fine, the word was out that James had once been a chess prodigy, the same as Bobby. Big deal. It would be news for a couple of days, and then interest would fade and life would go back to normal. And if James decided he was finished with working for Bobby, it shouldn\u2019t be held against him.</p><p>Teri continued to watch her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from him, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d Christie hadn\u2019t worried about it, though\u2014until now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say the last time you spoke?\u201d</p><p>Christie reviewed his brief voice mail. \u201cBasically he told me he was going away for a little while.\u201d He hadn\u2019t said exactly when he planned to return. The assumption that he\u2019d be back by Christmas was hers, and hers alone. She took the first sip of coffee and realized her sister had made it extra-strong. The bitter taste jolted her.</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s devastated,\u201d Teri told her. \u201cWhat James did is a stab in the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit extreme?\u201d Christie\u2019s hackles went up.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Teri said in a sharp voice. \u201cBobby\u2019s been his friend all these years and then James turns tail and runs, and Bobby\u2019s stuck dealing with all the reporters. He doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>Christie hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.</p><p>\u201cTo quit like that, too,\u201d Teri muttered angrily.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even speak to Bobby. He wrote a letter, in which he said his resignation was effective immediately. Then he walked away without a word to either of us. We don\u2019t even know where he is. Bobby\u2019s been worried sick. He\u2019s afraid James might\u2019ve had another breakdown, but I doubt it. His actions are too calculated, too planned.\u201d</p><p>Christie straightened. Her inclination was to defend James\u2014but her sister had a point. It occurred to her that James had purposely phoned when he knew she\u2019d be at work. He hadn\u2019t wanted to talk to her\u2014and now... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames will be back,\u201d she said. The alternative was impossible. Unbearable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Teri murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d Christie asked, finding it hard to hold on to her temper. James was hiding somewhere, until everything was quiet again. She refused to believe he\u2019d simply walk out, just disappear from their lives. He wasn\u2019t like that. Other men were. Not James. He loved her. He loved Bobby and Teri, too. They were his family. He\u2019d said as much.</p><p>Not only that, she\u2019d bared her soul to him. She\u2019d told him things she\u2019d never told another human being. He\u2019d shared a little of his own life, too. He\u2019d told her about the trauma in his childhood, the pressure he\u2019d endured from his parents and chess coach. The breakdown that had ended his career. Again and again he\u2019d told her of his deep gratitude to Bobby.</p> <p>\u201cJames would never leave Bobby,\u201d Christie declared.</p><p>Even if he could walk away from her, he wouldn\u2019t forsake his dearest friend. James was intensely loyal to both Bobby and Teri.</p><p>\u201cI used to think that, too,\u201d Teri admitted hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be back,\u201d Christie said again. \u201cHe might need a few days or weeks to sort everything out, but in the end he\u2019ll realize this is his home and we\u2019re his family.\u201d She included herself, unable to accept that he\u2019d turn away from her like so many other men had. He wouldn\u2019t. He just wouldn\u2019t. Not after everything she\u2019d told him. Because James wouldn\u2019t intentionally hurt her that way.</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe he\u2019ll be back?\u201d Christie challenged.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, this might come as a shock, but I think I should tell you. James and I are in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Teri said without any enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief, Christie, I\u2019ve known it for weeks, even before the kidnapping.\u201d</p> <p>That was interesting, because Christie hadn\u2019t been aware of her own feelings until recently.</p><p>\u201cIt was so obvious,\u201d Teri went on.</p><p>Christie put her coffee on the counter. She wasn\u2019t really in the mood for it, anyway. When she turned back, she saw that Bobby had come into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bobby,\u201d she said, greeting him in a cheerful voice.</p><p>He blinked at her as if he couldn\u2019t quite place who she was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christie,\u201d she said, bringing her hand to her throat. \u201cTeri\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d He seemed puzzled that she\u2019d felt the need to identify herself.</p><p>\u201cJames will be back,\u201d she said once more, trying to inspire confidence in Teri and Bobby. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he resigned. That seems a bit drastic, but I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe meant it,\u201d Bobby said dispassionately.</p><p>\u201cThis must be a knee-jerk reaction. It might even be a joke and he\u2019ll be home by morning.\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine that, but felt she had to suggest it.</p><p>Bobby immediately discounted the possibility. \u201cJames doesn\u2019t know how to joke,\u201d he said. \u201cJames is like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Christie couldn\u2019t figure out quite what to say to that. \u201cWhere would he go?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>Bobby shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve wondered the same thing,\u201d Teri told her. \u201cBobby\u2019s known him practically his entire life and James has never done anything like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so sure he won\u2019t be back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Neither Teri nor Bobby seemed inclined to answer.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d she cried with a sense of triumph. \u201cYou\u2019re not sure at all. I think we\u2019re overreacting here. James loves us. Give him a day or two, and once this has blown over, he\u2019ll be back in his apartment as if nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>Bobby stared at her. \u201cHe took everything with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat...what do you mean, everything?\u201d</p><p>Bobby and her sister exchanged a look.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken all his personal stuff\u2014his computer, clothes, books,\u201d her sister explained. \u201cHe\u2019s gone, Christie, and we\u2019re guessing he\u2019ll never show his face in Cedar Cove again.\u201d</p><p>Gone. For good. Took everything. Won\u2019t be back.</p><p>Bobby knew James better than anyone, and if he thought James had left for good, he was probably right.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do something like that?\u201d Christie managed to croak out.</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Men never stayed in her life. She\u2019d told herself he was different. Special. She\u2019d trusted him, and at the first sign of trouble James had fled.</p><p>Gazing up at the ceiling Christie blinked back tears. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d she asked sarcastically, \u201cthat I have this ability to fall for all the wrong men?\u201d At least this one hadn\u2019t beaten or robbed her or cheated with another woman. Nor had he drunk her out of house and home.</p><p>Oh, no, James \u201cWilbur\u201d Gardner was special, all right. He hadn\u2019t done any of those things; instead, he\u2019d broken her heart more thoroughly, more completely, than any other man ever had. An all-consuming pain rippled through her.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas to you, too,\u201d she said and surged to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Teri murmured. \u201cWe didn\u2019t...I didn\u2019t want to ruin your Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d she said flippantly. \u201cIn fact, the holidays are just getting started. Come to think of it, I\u2019ve got a lot of celebrating to do.\u201d On a mission now, she grabbed her purse and headed for the front door. If she hurried, she\u2019d make it to The Pink Poodle before the end of happy hour.</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>This was exactly what Dave Flemming had feared. Sheriff Davis had asked him to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d stop by his office for questioning, claiming this matter couldn\u2019t wait until after Christmas. He\u2019d emphasized the word voluntarily, as if to suggest that if Dave didn\u2019t come of his own accord, he\u2019d be obliged to send a deputy to escort him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to go, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Emily asked, standing next to him in the kitchen.</p><p>Dave still held the telephone receiver in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a choice.\u201d</p><p>His wife regarded him with wide, worried eyes. \u201cMaybe we should have an attorney present.\u201d</p><p>Instinct told Dave that he should. \u201cAttorneys cost money. We can\u2019t afford one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to have one,\u201d Emily insisted. \u201cIf there\u2019s any possibility that Sheriff Davis will arrest you, then...\u201d She stopped abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t steal anything from Martha Evans,\u201d he said. He knew Emily believed him, but he couldn\u2019t resist defending himself. \u201cThe truth will set everything right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever watch crime shows?\u201d His wife flared. \u201cThe police don\u2019t care if you\u2019re innocent. They just want a conviction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d That might be true in the land of television, but it wasn\u2019t the case in Cedar Cove. Sheriff Davis was an honorable man who cared far more about justice than his conviction record.</p><p>\u201cI could sell something.\u201d Emily twisted her wedding band around her ring finger. \u201cI could go to a pawnshop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to even discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Roy McAfee?\u201d Emily suggested next, sounding panicky. \u201cSince we\u2019re already paying him, maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered to pay him but he wouldn\u2019t accept.\u201d</p><p>Emily wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. \u201cDave, listen to reason, would you? If you go to jail\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d He sounded confident but he had little to base that on. Just his own innocence and Roy McAfee\u2019s apparent belief that he hadn\u2019t stolen from Martha Evans\u2019s estate. Roy had mentioned another suspect but that was days ago, so Dave assumed nothing had come of it. If the sheriff did decide to arrest him, then and only then would he have Emily hire an attorney.</p><p>His wife closed her eyes. \u201cI wish you watched Law &amp; Order more often. Then you\u2019d know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time for television. \u201cYou\u2019re overreacting. If I was in New York City, yes, I\u2019d pay for legal representation, but this is Cedar Cover and the sheriff is a friend.\u201d</p><p>Emily considered that for a moment, then said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid Sheriff Davis won\u2019t be your friend once he looks at the accumulated evidence.\u201d</p><p>Dave sighed. From the outside, it looked as if he was indeed the guilty party. He couldn\u2019t even explain most of the so-called evidence stacked against him. He didn\u2019t have any idea how those diamond earrings had found their way into his suit pocket.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t explain why the letter he\u2019d seen with his own eyes had never made it into Martha\u2019s last will and testament.</p><p>He decided to take Emily\u2019s advice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Roy,\u201d Dave said. He trusted Sheriff Davis, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have someone on his side. Dave hated the thought of having to defend himself. He was an honest man. But no one was above suspicion. Including a pastor.</p><p>Emily folded her hands prayerfully. \u201cThank God you\u2019re willing to have Roy there.\u201d</p><p>Dave tried to be optimistic. However, if he was arrested and charged, Emily would never be able to manage financially. Within a few weeks they\u2019d be hopelessly behind on their bills. The house would go into foreclosure, and his wife and sons would have to move in with her parents. What a mess all their lives would be.</p><p>Dave couldn\u2019t allow his mind to wander down such dangerous paths. Still, it remained a possibility. He could very well be arrested.</p><p>He turned to the phone again and dialed Roy\u2019s number. Emily watched him closely. A minute later he hung up.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d his wife asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Corrie. She said Roy\u2019s already down at the sheriff\u2019s office and it would be a good idea if we left now.\u201d</p><p>Her face pale, Emily nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly uncertain, Dave wrung his hands. \u201cI think I\u2019d prefer to wait,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWait?\u201d Emily exploded. \u201cFor what? To be arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to put this off until after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave, be realistic,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWe can\u2019t have this hanging over our heads through the holidays. You don\u2019t believe putting this off, even for an hour, is going to help, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the Christmas Eve services at church?\u201d Would Sheriff Davis let him out of jail to conduct a religious service? It didn\u2019t make sense, no matter how many promises he made to come back at midnight.</p><p>\u201cRoy\u2019s with the sheriff. He\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>His wife held the private investigator in high regard. Dave knew that Roy would do what he could, but wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of the law. If Sheriff Davis felt he had no choice but to make an arrest, nothing Roy said was going to change his mind.</p><p>Then again, his wife had a point. The weight of all this had nearly buried him; he wasn\u2019t sleeping well, his appetite was gone and his nerves were stretched to the breaking point. He had to be willing to trust that God would see him through, regardless of the outcome. This was without a doubt the biggest leap of faith he\u2019d made since accepting his call to the ministry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he whispered, inhaling a deep, fortifying breath.</p><p>Neither of them spoke on the drive downtown. It seemed that everything had already been said. They were about to confront whatever needed to be confronted. Together.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Dave and Emily walked hand in hand into the sheriff\u2019s office. Phones rang, uniformed men and women scurried about, and there was an atmosphere that was both controlled and frenetic.</p><p>Dave introduced himself to the receptionist, who apparently recognized him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Sheriff Davis you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>His wife\u2019s hand tightened around Dave\u2019s. \u201cGeoff Duncan\u2019s here, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>They both knew why. He was there to explain that the letter Emily had asked to see wasn\u2019t in the file the way Dave had claimed it would be.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up for either of the counseling sessions I scheduled,\u201d Dave whispered back. The second cancellation had been a blessing in disguise. The stable for the live Nativity had to be rebuilt after the donkey had kicked the side wall and the entire structure collapsed.</p> <p>Dave and several volunteers had spent a couple of hours repairing it. Later that afternoon, he\u2019d been on the phone for a solid hour seeking a replacement donkey\u2014one with a gentler nature. He couldn\u2019t have made the counseling session even if Geoff and his fianc\u00e9e had shown up.</p><p>Allan Harris arrived, looking harried and impatient. He frowned at Dave, then moved across the waiting area to his legal assistant. \u201cDo you know what this is about?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Geoff seemed to be ignoring them and under the circumstances Dave couldn\u2019t complain.</p><p>\u201cYou were called here, too?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Allan set his briefcase down and methodically removed his leather gloves, one finger at a time. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve got appointments I\u2019ve had to reschedule. And without Geoff to answer the phone, I had to close the office.\u201d</p><p>Dave was about to mention that this wasn\u2019t exactly convenient for him, either. He chose to keep the comment to himself and felt certain God would reward him.</p> <p>Just as Allan seemed on the verge of saying something else, Sheriff Davis came out of his office. Roy McAfee was with him. The private detective\u2019s eyes went directly to Dave and Emily. He nodded once in recognition. Dave tried to read his look and couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like Allan, Dave, Emily and Geoff to step into my office,\u201d the sheriff said.</p><p>Chairs had been set up in advance, and they all took their places. Allan carefully laid his long tailored coat over his knees.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bit unconventional,\u201d the attorney muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I suspect it is,\u201d Sheriff Davis agreed. \u201cHowever, I think my reasons will become quite clear.\u201d He glanced around the room. \u201cDave, would you mind if I asked you a few questions in front of the others?\u201d</p><p>Dave turned to Roy, who gave him an almost imperceptible nod. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Sheriff Davis claimed his own seat. The only one left standing was Roy McAfee.</p><p>\u201cDave, you were a friend of Martha Evans, am I correct?\u201d</p> <p>He answered forthrightly. \u201cMartha was part of our church family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d the sheriff murmured.</p><p>The attorney looked pointedly at his watch as if to say he didn\u2019t have time for this. Geoff Duncan, in the chair farthest from Dave and Emily, also seemed eager to get this over with. Dave felt the same way, but for his family\u2019s sake\u2014and his own\u2014he needed this settled.</p><p>\u201cIn the last days of her life you stopped by as often as two and three times a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to realize that Martha was well into her eighties, but her mind was as sharp as the proverbial tack. Her body had started to fail but she wanted to stay in her home, which is why her family arranged for the visiting nurse.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis inclined his head. \u201cYou say she gave you the gold watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019d written a letter to that effect. I saw it myself. She told me her attorney would be coming by later in the day and that she\u2019d hand it to him.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff turned to Allan Harris. \u201cDid you make a habit of visiting Martha Evans\u2019s home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Allan met the sheriff\u2019s gaze squarely. \u201cShe lived close to the courthouse and it certainly wasn\u2019t a problem. I\u2019d known Martha for years. She was a good friend of my mother\u2019s. I was happy to do her a small favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever send your legal assistant to her home instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust once,\u201d Geoff inserted. \u201cHe asked me to drop some papers off on my way home from work one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d The sheriff looked searchingly at the attorney.</p><p>Allan Harris concurred. \u201cThat\u2019s true. It was just the one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember exactly when that was?\u201d</p><p>Allan Harris reached for his briefcase. \u201cI can tell you in a moment. It was the same day as the deposition for...\u201d He let the rest fade as he checked the calendar on his BlackBerry. \u201cI have it here. That would be September sixth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sixth,\u201d Sheriff Davis repeated and wrote down the date. Then he glanced at Dave. \u201cDo you recall when you discovered Martha\u2019s body?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t something Dave was likely to forget. \u201cTwo days later,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe eighth.\u201d The sheriff nodded. \u201cAnd she gave you the watch on which day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sixth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, it was two days before her death. Is that correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she had the letter at that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same day Mr. Harris sent his assistant to Martha\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>Geoff Duncan was on his feet. \u201cNow, listen, if you\u2019re suggesting I had anything to do with this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I\u2019m more than suggesting,\u201d Sheriff Davis said without missing a beat. \u201cI\u2019ve subpoenaed your bank statement.\u201d He opened a file and handed the sheet to Geoff Duncan. \u201cI also have the statement of a Seattle pawnshop owner who\u2019s willing to testify that you pawned several diamond rings.\u201d</p><p>The room crackled with electrifying silence.</p><p>\u201cGeoff Duncan?\u201d Emily whispered, her eyes wide as she looked at Dave.</p><p>He squeezed her hand. He would never have suspected the younger man. It hadn\u2019t so much as occurred to him.</p><p>Geoff fell back into his chair and stared into the distance with a dazed expression. \u201cI...I needed the money.\u201d</p><p>Dave briefly closed his eyes and recalled the conversation with Geoff a few weeks ago when he\u2019d proudly told him about his fianc\u00e9e. Lori Bellamy was from one of the most prominent families in the area, and apparently Geoff felt obliged to keep her in the style to which she was accustomed\u2014even though he couldn\u2019t afford to do it.</p><p>\u201cGeoff.\u201d Allan Harris said the other man\u2019s name in a hushed voice. He must\u2019ve been feeling shock, incredulity and sadness, Dave thought. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Geoff refused to answer. \u201cI\u2019m not saying another word until I speak with an attorney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an attorney,\u201d Harris reminded him caustically.</p><p>\u201cI want a criminal attorney, not one who specializes in probate.\u201d The other man\u2019s eyes sparked with indignation.</p><p>\u201cThen by all means, find one.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis opened his office door, and a deputy walked in. While handcuffing Geoff Duncan, he recited his rights.</p><p>\u201cI know my rights,\u201d Geoff snapped. \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>The deputy didn\u2019t listen and led him out of the office.</p><p>Dave sat there in stunned disbelief. \u201cMartha gave him the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he destroyed it,\u201d Roy McAfee said, speaking for the first time.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know where she kept her jewelry?\u201d</p><p>Roy answered this. \u201cAs I told Dave, the freezer\u2019s not exactly an original place to hide your valuables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe probably took them that very day,\u201d Allan said. \u201cMartha\u2019s hearing was bad and she wouldn\u2019t have heard him open the freezer door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why frame me?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>\u201cYou made a convenient target,\u201d Roy said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he put the earrings in my suit coat?\u201d Dave asked with a frown. \u201cOh\u2014wait. I left my jacket at Martha\u2019s that day.\u201d</p><p>It had completely slipped his mind until now. The day had been warm and he\u2019d taken off his coat, then returned the same afternoon\u2014obviously after Geoff\u2019s visit\u2014to pick it up. He\u2019d hung it on the back of his office door, where it stayed...until Emily took it home.</p><p>\u201cGeoff guessed, and rightly so, that you knew where she kept her jewelry. You had the gold watch and it was easy enough to destroy the letter and plant evidence on you.\u201d</p><p>Dave felt foolish. He hadn\u2019t even noticed that there was anything in the pockets; he\u2019d carried it to the office and hung it up.</p><p>\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d Allan Harris asked the sheriff.</p><p>Troy grinned. \u201cActually it was a simple matter of putting two and two together. Once I got hold of the pawnshop receipt and had Geoff\u2019s name, I was able to subpoena his bank records. There was no other way to explain those hefty deposits.\u201d He gestured at the private investigator. \u201cRoy helped me out\u2014he has contacts in the Seattle area who were able to steer me toward local pawnshops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis gives me too much credit,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe got lucky. Once we had a photo of Duncan and pictures of the missing jewelry, it was just a matter of doing a little legwork. So the sheriff sent a deputy to a few of the higher-end pawnshops\u2014and everything fell into place.\u201d</p><p>Dave Flemming owed the sheriff and Roy a debt of gratitude. He knew they\u2019d say they were only doing their jobs, but they could have taken the evidence at face value. He would be eternally glad they hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre we free to go?\u201d Emily asked.</p><p>Sheriff Davis nodded. \u201cOne question first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do with the gold watch?\u201d</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cReturn it to her family. Can we go now?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re taking up space in my office, Pastor Flemming. It seems to me you\u2019ve got a Christmas program to prepare. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>Dave looked from one man to the other. \u201cI do. And...and,\u201d he stammered, \u201cthank you. Thank you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Emily chimed in.</p><p>Dave and Emily left the police station and practically ran to their car. Dave unlocked the doors and once they\u2019d scrambled inside they hugged each other fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s over,\u201d he told Emily.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I ever doubted you.

He smiled as he saw them hug and kiss. He was glad that, with a little help from his friend Roy McAfee, he\u2019d been able to arrest the man responsible for the theft\u2014and, in the process, clear Dave Flemming\u2019s name. So far his department had been able to track down all the missing jewelry except for a couple of pieces.</p><p>Troy had already contacted Martha\u2019s two daughters with the news and the recovered jewelry would be turned over to them. Although Troy believed that Martha had sincerely wanted Dave to have the watch, the pastor had insisted on returning it. He had nothing to prove to Martha\u2019s children that their mother had given it to him, and Dave wasn\u2019t comfortable with even the slightest doubt. Troy admired that.</p> <p>Turning away from the window, he pinched the bridge of his nose. At least that case was satisfactorily resolved. The body discovered in the cave two days ago had yet to be identified, though. All he knew was that the skeletal remains appeared to be those of a male teenager, and that was an educated guess on the pathologist\u2019s part. An autopsy would be conducted in the new year. It was hardly a priority, as the doctor had rather acerbically pointed out. Troy suspected the boy was a runaway.</p><p>This case had the potential to stretch the limits of his department. County records didn\u2019t show anyone missing during the time period the pathologist had indicated. But someone must have seen him, talked to him, known him. A cold case was always difficult, but no matter how long it took, Troy was determined to find out who this young man was and what had led him to that cave.</p><p>If solving a twenty-year-old mystery wasn\u2019t enough, it also happened to be Christmas.</p><p>Christmas without Faith.</p><p>Three hours later, Sheriff Davis left the office. His day was finally over and he was going home. 92 Pacific Boulevard was a lonely place these days. Maybe he\u2019d put up the Christmas wreath Megan had bought him and try to imagine what his evening would be like if he was spending it with Faith.</p>  </body></html>"]
