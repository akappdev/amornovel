The tech crouched down to inspect the victim\u2019s tight, tanned backside, and the green-handled object still extruding from it. \u201cAnd a... weed-whacker up his ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cattle prod.\u201d Detective Samantha Brown, Rafael\u2019s partner, joined them. \u201cKnown on the streets as a \u2018joy stick.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The tech grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m thinking he didn\u2019t get much joy out of it, Detective.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCarjackers slip the tip through a window crack when the driver stops at a traffic light, zap, stunned driver,\u201d she said, tapping the appropriate spot on her windbreaker. \u201cYou can buy them off the internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo carjacker would leave the prod behind.\u201d Evan Tenderson, the assistant medical examiner, came to stand next to the body. \u201cProd... behind... get it?\u201d He stopped chuckling when he caught Rafael\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, Suarez? Didn\u2019t Castro let you make puns back in Cuba?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder is not amusing,\u201d Rafael said, \u201cand I am not Cuban.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, you Hispanicos all look alike to me.\u201d Put out by the lack of response to his joke, Tenderson lit a cigarette and pointed one of his loafers at the victim. \u201cGet these mitts covered, Brad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cattle prod,\u201d the tech muttered as he bagged the victim\u2019s hands. \u201cWhat happened to the good old days, when people just killed each other with guns and knives?\u201d</p> <p>Rafael didn\u2019t answer. In his good old days, people killed each other with crossbows, swords and battle axes.</p><p>Something about the color of the victim\u2019s upper back didn\u2019t seem right, and Rafael bent down to take a closer look. What had appeared to be random tan lines was a series of long, healed welts running from just below the neck to the small of the spine.</p><p>\u201cWho called it in?\u201d Samantha was asking Tenderson.</p><p>The assistant ME\u2019s top lip curled over the end of his cigarette. \u201cDo I look like a receptionist to you, Brown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came in as an anonymous tip, traced to a pay phone down the street,\u201d the tech said as he clipped thin plastic bags over the victim\u2019s hands. \u201cThe dispatcher said the caller sounded like a Latino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that narrows it down to, what, eighty-five percent of the population?\u201d Tenderson gave Rafael a smile filled with malice and tobacco-stained teeth. \u201cGood luck finding the perp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, shut up, Tenderson,\u201d Samantha said, sounding bored.</p><p>\u201cThese are lash marks,\u201d Rafael told her, indicated the fresh scarring. \u201cThis man has been repeatedly restrained and whipped some time in the recent past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetective Suarez.\u201d One of the uniformed officers who had been performing a sweep of the grounds around the crime scene walked up and handed Rafael a large evidence bag containing something made of spiked leather and heavy silver chains. \u201cWe found this draped on that statue over there.\u201d He indicated the life-size figure of the Virgin Mary, which paired with a matching statue of St. Theresa stood guard in oval shell niches near the convent\u2019s walls. \u201cSomeone smashed the flood light or we would have spotted it right away. Looks like leather bar stuff, or maybe a Halloween costume. No blood stains that I could see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019d know how to look, Dipshit.\u201d Tenderson grabbed his case and headed for the statue.</p><p>\u201cHalloween isn\u2019t until tomorrow night.\u201d Samantha eyed the bag. \u201cIs there a full-head zippered mask in there?\u201d When the patrol officer nodded, she turned to the body. \u201cLash marks, sexual torture and fetish wear. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s a sub.\u201d She caught Rafael\u2019s blank look. \u201cA submissive, into bondage, beatings and other assorted masochistic kinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAroused by torture.\u201d Rafael felt pity for the dead man. \u201cPerhaps he was with a lover, and things went too far this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t explain why the body was dumped here, though.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cNo drag marks, no wheel ruts, and it\u2019s at least three hundred yards to the nearest parking spot. He looks like he\u2019s about one seventy-five, one eighty, right? That\u2019s a lot of dead body to haul around.\u201d</p><p>Rafael waited until the patrolman had walked away before asking, \u201cDid you touch him yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo point.\u201d Samantha possessed a psychic ability to see the recent past of the newly-dead through their blood. Although her life had changed dramatically three months ago, she could still use that last, human gift. \u201cThe body has been completely drained.\u201d</p><p>Rafael and Samantha worked Homicide\u2019s graveyard shift for a specific reason. Their colleagues on the force thought it was because they were both single and had no families to go home to. No one suspected the partners were both nocturnal, blood-dependent immortals known as Darkyn.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Rafael asked her.</p><p>\u201cKinky sex and a bloodless body dumped in front of a Catholic convent.\u201d Samantha switched off her PDA. \u201cSomeone from our little vampire club having a good time, maybe?\u201d</p><p>Rafael heard the doubt behind the sarcasm. He had not been human for seven hundred years, but only a few months had passed since Samantha had become Kyn. She had yet to adjust to the enormous changes it had caused in her life, including discovering the fact that the man she loved had been a Kyn assassin for centuries. Some nights Samantha was more accepting of her situation than others.</p><p>Tonight might not be one of those nights.</p><p>\u201cThere is no scent trace, and no Kyn could drain a body and walk away from it. We would have found his attacker lying next to him, in thrall from drinking so much blood.\u201d Rafael glanced up at the high walls of the cloister only twenty feet away. \u201cIt does seem as if the body was left here for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn front of the convent, or on our beat?\u201d Samantha waved over the techs waiting to remove the body. \u201cHas my boyfriend made some new enemies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say.\u201d Rafael met her gaze. \u201cSamantha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He doesn\u2019t kill humans. Or anyone. We hope. Unless they shoot me. Christ, ever since I died my life has gotten so complicated.\u201d She buttoned the front of her jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s go talk to the ladies.\u201d</p><p>The man and woman were coming to the door.</p><p>Of course they were, Dani thought as she watched them approach through the peephole. A dead body had been found in front of the sanctuary. They would come to the door, and ring the bell, and ask for someone in charge. They would have questions.</p><p>Questions for which they would want answers.</p><p>The sound of the bell made the women gathered around her turn en masse to stare at Dani.</p><p>\u201cI will see to them,\u201d she said, covering her hair with a long black veil that effectively shadowed her features. \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p><p>Before she had succumbed to advanced breast cancer, Sister Marguerite Aretino had given Dani her heavy ring of keys, along with strict instructions. All doors and windows were to be kept locked, and no outsiders were ever to be allowed inside the walls of the sanctuary. Boundaries had to be preserved, and the women of the sanctuary protected at all costs.</p><p>Guard them with your life, Marguerite had whispered, clutching Dani\u2019s hand as tightly as she had her rosary. God demands this of you now, Daniela, as penance for your sins.</p><p>Her sins. What were they? she wondered. Being born to her mother? Being a female child? Or being made by the Father to absolve \u2013 to pay \u2013 for the sins of others?</p><p>She had asked the old woman once, before Marguerite had brought her to America. What I have done, what you wish me to do \u2013 when will it be enough? When may I be free of this duty?</p><p>The slap to her face had hurt, but not as much as Marguerite\u2019s answer: You dare question the will of God? Without his mercy you would still be in the jungle, living like a savage. Or worse.</p><p>Dani unlocked the double entry doors and stepped out before the man and woman on the other side could enter. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Sister. I\u2019m Detective Suarez, Fort Lauderdale Homicide.\u201d He gestured to the woman. \u201cThis is my partner, Detective Brown. We\u2019d like to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><p>Dani stared up at Detective Suarez, who seemed excessively tall and broad-chested for an American policeman. Her ear told her he was no American, however. His accent, like his neatly trimmed black mustache and beard, brought back memories of the men who came from Europe to visit the exiles in Argentina. They, too, came out of the night, so many silent, walking shadows, with blue glints in their hair and death in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cSister?\u201d</p><p>He wanted her to speak. She was staring at him like an awe-struck child instead of hiding her features. Had Marguerite lived, she would have beaten Dani until she couldn\u2019t rise from her pallet for three days.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She spoke to the woman, who smelled deliciously of coffee. \u201cWhat questions?\u201d</p><p>Detective Brown took out an electronic device that served as some sort of note pad. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with: what\u2019s your name and what do you do here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Sister Marguerite.\u201d Dani slipped her hands into the ends of her sleeves. \u201cI am in charge.\u201d</p><p>Suarez took a step closer, almost looming over her. \u201cYou seem rather young to be running a convent, Sister.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s earthy scent faded beneath the warm, sweet perfume of orange blossoms. Dani held her breath, and felt sweat prickling her scalp. What should she say, what should she say? Marguerite had insisted her English be perfect, but she had never permitted her much opportunity to speak with anyone. The Father hadn\u2019t cared.</p><p>Say something polite. \u201cThank you.\u201d She switched her gaze to where two men in dark overalls were carefully lifting the dead man\u2019s thin, tortured body. The body shifted, and the street light illuminated a narrow back striped by a terrible flogging. At this distance, she could see the pattern that the scars formed.</p><p>Dani\u2019s last, bright flicker of hope winked out and turned to dull gray ash. He\u2019s found me again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suarez touched her sleeve, tugging her attention back to him. Eyes of darkness, a face filled with smooth angles and strength in hiding. For a moment she thought she recognized a quieter version of her own shock. Had he, too, read the name that had been beaten into the poor man\u2019s back? Did he know what it meant?</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting any visitors tonight, Sister?\u201d His voice reached into her, coaxing. \u201cRelatives, delivery people?\u201d</p><p>Aunts, uncles, UPS, madman?</p> <p>Daniela ignored the haven being offered by the detective\u2019s compelling eyes and voice. He did not know. He could never understand. Dani knew what had to come next. She would not look at the dead man. There was nothing she could do to help that one now. She would keep calm.</p><p>She would go as soon as she got rid of them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dani said, before he repeated his question. \u201cNo one comes here. No one leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that the nuns here never leave the property?\u201d Detective Brown seemed skeptical. \u201cWhat about doctor appointments, jury duty, or vacations?\u201d</p><p>They thought they were nuns. It was a logical assumption, as the sanctuary had once been a working convent. Marguerite had never left the church, not in her heart. Dani knew she was being foolish, intriguing them with the truth, but there were no more lies left in her.</p> <p>The scent of orange blossoms embraced her. \u201cSister?\u201d</p><p>Daniela pressed back against the doors. \u201cWe do not leave. I have no information for you. Good evening.\u201d She turned, but her head buzzed and her hands didn\u2019t want to work.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, Sister,\u201d Detective Brown said. \u201cI\u2019ll need to interview the other nuns to see if they have any information as to what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not possible,\u201d Daniela told the door. What would Marguerite tell them? \u201cI can assure you that no one saw or heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll confirm that personally,\u201d Detective Brown said, \u201cif you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Detective. No one here will talk to you or anyone else.\u201d She faced them. \u201cIt is a violation for any of us to speak to you. We have all taken a vow of silence.\u201d</p> <p>Two</p><p>\u201cShe knows something,\u201d Samantha said as she climbed in behind the wheel of their unmarked unit. \u201cWe should have called in for a search warrant. Cap could have gotten one for us.\u201d</p><p>Captain Ernesto Garcia, Chief of Homicide, played the part of their superior within the Fort Lauderdale Police Department. In reality, he served as Rafael\u2019s tresora, his human servant. That he could issue orders as well as accept them made him an unusual ally.</p><p>Rafael had considered obtaining a warrant as well, but the sanctity of the convent had touched him on a level far deeper and older than his current obligations. He had been a Templar priest long before he had joined the police force. His beliefs had changed in the centuries since he had left the church, but his respect for those who devoted their lives to God had not. \u201cFinding a dead man near a convent does not constitute probable cause to search it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But still, that nun.\u201d Because Samantha\u2019s instincts often proved correct, she had a difficult time letting go of a suspicion. \u201cShe saw something, heard something, maybe. I don\u2019t know. Did you see how she was shaking when she ran back inside and bolted the door? With the way we were perfuming the air, she should have talked more openly to us, too.\u201d</p><p>Rafael nodded. Meeting Sister Marguerite had also disturbed him on several levels, including a very personal one which he never allowed to interfere with his duty. \u201cSome humans do not respond to l\u2019attrait.\u201d The individual, sweet scent produced by Kyn bodies acted like a drug on humans, rendering them amenable to almost any suggestion. It also caused a certain amount of sexual arousal, which helped to make feeding on humans easier. \u201cOr perhaps I did not shed enough scent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I felt like I was standing in an orange grove. You totally cancelled me out.\u201d Samantha turned a corner and coasted to a stop at a red light. \u201cShe looked like she was going to faint when you touched her. It was right after she saw the body for the first time. What was that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShock and horror, I would think.\u201d Lust had made him notice other things about the young sister, things he had no business even contemplating in such a fashion. \u201cShe is a nun, and has been sheltered from such things. Her world is made up of purity, prayer and silence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but it had something to do with you, too.\u201d</p><p>Rafael recalled the taut face, and how she had tried to keep it averted so that he would not look at her. The excessive modesty of a bride promised only to Christ. \u201cI am cursed by God. I expect her reaction was a natural one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCursed my ass,\u201d Samantha said. \u201cYou\u2019re a homicide detective.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re a cursed, inhuman homicide detective. Does that mean I am now, too?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the murder and worry about God and curses another night.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, in the small, cramped room that served as FLPD\u2019s Homicide Department, Samantha hung up the phone and rested her head against her fist. \u201cGod, I hate that man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should feed on him. It might make him more willing to cooperate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather lick blood out of a used ashtray.\u201d She sat back. \u201cAfter giving me a lot of unnecessary grief, Smokestack performed the autopsy on our victim. Cause of death was exsanguination. He found five puncture wounds: two on the wrists, one on the temple, one on the back and one on the left side of the abdomen.\u201d</p><p>Rafael recalled a mental image of the victim\u2019s body. \u201cI saw no such wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a reason we didn\u2019t, and it\u2019s a creepy one: the killer packed some shit in the wounds and then covered them with stage makeup so they wouldn\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>He went still. \u201cWhat sort of \u2018shit?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlower petals.\u201d</p><p>Either kill me or take me as I am, because I'll be damned if I ever change...</p><p>He has been poisoned. Richard, still human, newly-crowned, crumpling the letters and tossing them into the fireplace. He will not last the month. You will go to France and see to the arrangements. And this time, Rafael, be sure that he stays in the ground.</p><p>That summer in France, with so many bodies rotting where they had fallen. Heavily-laden carriages jolting as their drivers whipped the horses into straining and pulling their occupants and the baggage out of Paris as fast as they could go. The ugly granite walls of the asylum, streaked by black streams from the countless chamber pots emptied from the ward windows. The smell of fresh-burned wood ash on the wind\u2014</p><p>He who believeth in me will never die.</p><p>Samantha cleared her throat and lowered her voice. \u201cMind telling me why you look like I just kicked you in the cajones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Rafael had watched as the body had been carried out of the asylum, loaded onto a cart and driven to the village cemetery. There he had observed the funeral, and stayed behind to watch the grave for weeks. Nothing had disturbed it. No one had crawled out of it. It is not Donatien. \u201cOur shift ended thirty minutes ago,\u201d he said, rising from his chair. \u201cWe must clock out.\u201d</p><p>To keep up appearances, Rafael and Samantha drove their own cars to work and home, but they both lived in the penthouse apartments above the very popular night club, Infusion. The club served as a magnet for the local goth crowd, as a business front for the Jardin Noir, and the headquarters of its suzerain, the Darkyn high lord\u2019s former chief assassin, Lucan.</p><p>Rafael reached the club first and went immediately to his master\u2019s downstairs office. Lucan, who had an unexpected flair for creating wealth, had taken over managing most of the jardin\u2019s business affairs. During the day, his tresora, Herbert Burke, did the rest. Rafael suspected it was his master\u2019s way of allowing him to continue working beside Samantha for the police, although Lucan would never admit it.</p><p>The suzerain sat behind his desk, idly paging through his computerized ledgers, and sipping from a glass of bloodwine. As fair as Rafael was dark, Lucan had the face of a film star and the frame of a stunt man, and used them both without a moment of conscience. Finely-fitted black gloves encased large hands, which when bared could kill any living thing they touched.</p><p>\u201cWe are paying too much for the kegs of ale,\u201d Lucan said to Rafael without looking up. \u201cI should like to find a new beverage supplier before this one bankrupts me. Why are you late?\u201d</p><p>Rafael tried to think of alternate suppliers, but all he could summon was the image of an undisturbed grave. \u201cA human was murdered and left in front of a convent tonight. There are indications that perhaps one of the Kyn were involved.\u201d</p><p>Lucan stopped tapping the keyboard and turned his head. \u201cWhich Kyn, precisely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say for certain. The victim had been tortured and drained.\u201d He saw his master\u2019s gray eyes turn to chrome. \u201cThe wounds were found to be packed with flower petals, and covered with greasepaint.\u201d</p><p>Lucan reacted to this by not reacting at all. \u201cThen Donatien still breathes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rafael insisted. \u201cRichard sent me to France. I saw him die of copper poisoning. After, I sat watch for a month over his grave. He did not rise again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonatien was, unlike you, a patient soul, and in fact he did somehow survive his second burial. Richard had me hunt him in nineteen thirty-nine, but he used the Nazis to elude me. When he never resurfaced, Richard decided the war had killed him.\u201d Lucan raised one blond eyebrow. \u201cYou still do not believe me. Very well, this victim you found, was he violated?\u201d</p><p>Rafael nodded. \u201cSodomized with an electrical device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Brethren rarely violate, but when they do, they do not leave such work to be discovered. Donatien enjoyed putting his cruelties on display, and he always signed his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lash marks.\u201d Rafael could see the pattern of them now. \u201cThey spelled out his name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you told Samantha anything about him?\u201d When Rafael shook his head, Lucan\u2019s expression relaxed. \u201cSay nothing to her. Send word to the rest of the jardin. Donatien is to be tracked but not confronted. I will see to him personally. Now, tell me about this convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a few miles from here. The Sisters of the Annunciata. Their Mother Superior is named Sister Marguerite.\u201d Rafael would not imagine her in Donatien\u2019s hands. \u201cShe seemed very young to be in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen likely she is not. God, nuns, even in this enlightened age. What a waste of perfectly good females.\u201d Lucan switched over screens and began typing. He read through the search results and clicked on a news item. \u201cIt seems that the convent is owned by a Daniel A. Nieves, and is no longer a convent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the Mother Superior\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014Died six months ago,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cMarguerite Aretino, aged eighty-seven, Sister of the Annunciata and the last member of her order. She owned the property and the convent outright, but refused to deed it to the church after her death. Much ado was made about it at the time by the Miami Archbishop.\u201d Lucan kept reading. \u201cIt seems she left it to Mr. Nieves, who converted it into a private nursing home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonatien would never be interested in such a place. He despised the sick and elderly; being locked in the asylum drove him mad. Only youth and beauty drew him to...\u201d Rafael\u2019s gut clenched. \u201cThe one pretending to be Marguerite. It must be her he seeks. She is lovely, and no more than twenty.\u201d</p><p>Lucan nodded. \u201cHe never could resist a pretty young face.\u201d</p><p>He would not touch hers. \u201cI must return to convent before dawn arrives. Your sygkenis will also need protection, my lord.\u201d Rafael didn\u2019t have to remind his master that Samantha was still vulnerable to Kyn talent, or what Donatien could do to her, given the chance.</p> <p>\u201cI can take care of myself, thank you very much.\u201d Samantha said as she walked in and went to stand behind Lucan. \u201cSo, my man, why are you playing on the internet instead of waiting upstairs for me?\u201d</p><p>Rafael glanced at the screen, but his master had managed to clear the information from it.</p><p>\u201cBecause the price of ale annoys me and you, madam, are very, very tardy.\u201d Lucan turned around and pulled Samantha down onto his lap. \u201cThat is why Rafael believes you need protection. When bruised, my ego knows no bounds.\u201d</p><p>Rafael saw that his presence was no longer required, and went to the door.</p><p>\u201cYour ego makes Kevlar look like Kleenex.\u201d Samantha began peeling off one of Lucan\u2019s black silk gloves. Unlike the rest of the Kyn, she didn\u2019t fear the destructive power of her lover\u2019s hands. \u201cRafael, we need to get in some extra hours on this case. See you at noon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be a little late.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cSleep well, Samantha.\u201d</p> <p>You can\u2019t leave us, Bridget wrote on the blackboard. The police will return tomorrow. They will have search warrants. They will wish to question us.</p><p>Dani kept packing. \u201cYou have nothing to hide. Show them everything. I told them you are living under a vow of silence. At worst, they will think you a bunch of religious hysterics.\u201d</p><p>You promised our Mother that you would protect us from the outside world.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t protect you if I\u2019m the one being hunted. And I am.\u201d She slammed the suitcase shut and turned to face the older woman. \u201cIt will be the way it was in South America; that was why Marguerite brought me here. Now that he knows where I am, he will kill every one of you to get to me. But if I go, he will follow me.\u201d</p><p>Bridget sighed and turned to the board. You could tell the police about it. They may help you.</p><p>Dani shook her head. \u201cEnough have died.\u201d She picked up the suitcase and took the keys to Marguerite\u2019s car from her desk. \u201cTell the police as much of the truth as you can. The man \u2013 Suarez \u2013 he seemed kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am kind,\u201d a familiar male voice said from outside the doorway. \u201cBut I will have all of the truth, Sister.\u201d</p><p>Dani dropped the suitcase and went for the open window, but almost as soon as she moved large hands seized her and spun her around.</p> <p>\u201cI regret that I cannot allow you to leave.\u201d Detective Suarez put one arm around her and caught her fist before it connected with his jaw. \u201cOr that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to trespass on our property or assault me.\u201d Dani felt the strength beneath the care with which he held her, and didn\u2019t struggle. What else would Marguerite say? \u201cRelease me and leave at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He took out a pair of steel handcuffs and snapped one end over her wrist. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d he asked as he reached for her free hand.</p><p>\u201cSister Marguerite Aretino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister Marguerite is dead,\u201d Suarez told her. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>Bridget fell to her knees in front of the door, blocking in with her bulk. She closed her eyes, extending her hands and letting her head fall back.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dani lunged against the detective's hold. \u201cLet go of me. Bridget, for the love of God, no.\u201d</p><p>Two quarter-size wounds appeared in the woman's wrists, and blood began to pulse from them.</p><p>Suarez took in a sharp breath. \u201cDios m\u00edo.\u201d His arms fell away, and at last Dani was free.</p><p>She caught Bridget before she toppled over and turned to glare at Suarez. \u201cGet the first aid kit. In the desk there.\u201d Gently she lowered the heavyset woman to the rug, and yanked up her sleeves.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she use to cut her wrists so fast?\u201d he asked as he brought the white plastic box to her.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She grabbed a roll of bandages from the kit and began wrapping the wounds. \u201cHere,\u201d she said when she had one bandage in place, and handed him the wrist. \u201cApply direct pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will take her to the emergency room,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will require a doctor's attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA doctor can't do anything for her.\u201d She finished wrapping the other wound and firmly pressed her fingers over it. The cuff Suarez had snapped on her dangled from her wrist as she met the detective's gold-shot gaze. \u201cNo one can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't be foolish. At the very least she will need stitches.\u201d</p><p>Dani closed her eyes. She had not used it since leaving South America, so it was much stronger now.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she heard Suarez demand.</p><p>\u201cPraying.\u201d</p><p>Suarez believed her, and gave her the time she needed to finish. As soon as it was done, she unwrapped the bandages and wiped away the blood to make sure the wound had disappeared.</p><p>Suarez did the same thing, and muttered something under his breath. \u201cThis is impossible. She cut herself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she did not.\u201d Dani gently wiped a tear from the unconscious woman\u2019s cheek. \u201cThe wounds come as God wills. Sometimes, when Bridget is afraid, I think she can make them appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are speaking nonsense,\u201d he said as he checked both wrists closely. \u201cNo wounds appear just like that, without explanation or cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a cause, Detective, although I cannot explain it.\u201d She looked down at the unmarked wrists. \u201cDo you know what the stigmata is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know of the myth,\u201d Suarez said. \u201cStigmata are injuries that zealots inflict on themselves to imitate the wounds Christ received before he was crucified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be an ex-Catholic.\u201d Dani pressed her hand to Bridget\u2019s brow, and saw a drop of blood fall from her sleeve. If he saw... \u201cShe is feverish. I should give her some water. Please hold her up for me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Suarez had his arms filled with Bridget, Dani stood and looked down at him. For a moment she wondered what it would be like to be held in his arms, to be protected by such a man. Then she ran across the room.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sunlight filled up her eyes, erasing the open window and everything around her. The stucco wall came next, slamming into her face. Dani fell back and the light became a warm, lovely pool of gold. As she sank into it, she wondered how Suarez had made the sun rise two hours early, and if he would be the next one to die.</p><p>Three</p><p>Donatien strolled up A1A, enjoying the attention his magenta velvet suit and lacy white cravat drew from passing tourists. Such formal attire did not actually suit this time or locale, which even on this October night dripped with heat and humidity, but his immortal body had not produced much in the way of body fluids since his second rising.</p><p>The Spaniard would have to bleed for him.</p><p>His two favorite accessories, a beautiful redheaded girl on his right arm, and a handsome brunette boy on his left, walked on rhythm with his movements. Both said and looked at nothing. He felt it a pity that they had become so well-trained in so short a time. Nothing on this earth that amused him lasted very long.</p><p>That would have to change before existence bored him to death.</p><p>Donatien did not resent his present circumstances. He had been quite happy to leave the Middle East, where he had lived since Hitler\u2019s fall from grace. As amusing as the descendents of the Saracens could be, the decades of carte blanche had gone too quickly. When the Americans came, the place had become a hotbed of night bombings and CNN exclusives. So he moved on. He had always wanted to go to South America to look up an old friend from the war they should have won. Unhappily Le Chevillard had been stupid enough to get himself drowned, but he had left behind some very amusing play things \u2013 and Crist\u00e1l, his pearl among the swine.</p><p>At first Donatien had not believed what he had read in the old journals. Le Chevillard had been a madman, and his ramblings (while vastly entertaining) could hardly be called reliable. Donatien had consoled himself for a time by playing with the savages, all of whom proved to be vigorous and in remarkably good health. Then he had seen it for himself, first in the scars of horrendous wounds on the bodies of his playthings, then by listening closely to the babbled tales of miracles.</p><p>The Hand of God had not saved them. A girl had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had tried to protect Crist\u00e1l by denying she existed, denials that Donatien had quickly reduced to pleas and sobs. The girl had been clever, too, hiding away at night and resisting his lures. The entire matter had wasted a great deal of Donatien\u2019s valuable time, during which someone had summoned that Catholic cunt, Sister Marguerite, to spirit away his Crist\u00e1l.</p><p>The years of searching did not sting as much as the nun who had deceived him. She had sworn he would never touch Crist\u00e1l or her, and had settled the matter by setting fire to the convent where he had found them. Fool that he was, he truly believed the old bitch and his pearl had been consumed in the flames.</p><p>Reading of Marguerite Aretino\u2019s actual death years brought tears of hope and joy to Donatien\u2019s eyes, or would have, had his tear ducts still functioned. Further inquiries confirmed that she had not, in fact, killed herself or Crist\u00e1l. She had faked everything in order to escape to America. Learning from an old Kyn ally that the Spaniard lived in south Florida as well, serving as seneschal to the newly-appointed suzerain, had been Fate\u2019s dessert course.</p><p>Arranging for the Spaniard to meet Crist\u00e1l had been a simple matter. Doubtless in the short time they were together, Donatien\u2019s old love and his new would become fast friends. Donatien preferred his toys to have feelings for each other, at least for as long as they could feel something. It brought out displays of heroism and sacrifice that he always found touching.</p> <p>The Spaniard had honor, and Daniela compassion. It was a match made in hell.</p><p>Donatien did congratulate himself for maintaining around-the-clock surveillance on the convent. Such a terribly modern thing to do. Waiting for her to emerge had been boring, but he had been there to see her being carried out in the arms of Richard\u2019s former emissary, the angel of light with the hellfire eyes.</p><p>Now he would have them both. His angelic demon and his demonic angel.</p><p>\u201cID\u2019s,\u2019 the large, fat man dressed as an evil clown at the entrance to the fetish club said as they stopped before him.</p><p>Donatien patted non-existent pockets. \u201cDear me. I do believe that I left mine at home.\u201d He urged his accessories forward. \u201cOf course, my friends will vouch for me.\u201d</p> <p>The bouncer gave his companions a cursory glance. \u201cWe don't admit perverts or their underage friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately I am a libertine, not a pervert,\u201d Donatien said. \u201cMy companions are much older and wiser than they were a week ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, moron, I\u2019m not\u2014\" the bouncer reached out to grab the front of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cMind your bowels, young man,\u201d Donatien said, placing one hand on the bouncer\u2019s frilled sleeve. \u201cOne never knows when their contents are about to exit in a decidedly explosive manner.\u201d</p><p>The bouncer's hand dropped to clutch at his abdomen. A low, wrenching groan crawled through his clenched teeth as he doubled over.</p><p>\u201cWe'll see ourselves in, thank you.\u201d Donatien guided his accessories to the door.</p> <p>The gruesome atmosphere and dangerous-looking members of Club Dominion never failed to cheer up Donatien, who led his accessories to the best table in the house. The occupants, clad as they were in various rigs of leather and chains, rose from their seats as soon as they spotted him. Donatien felt pleased at the automatic deference, and graced them with an approving smile, and a round of intense migraines.</p><p>Now to find the last pawn.</p><p>The assistant manager of the club, a fellow named Butcher, whose body had been pierced as often as the Virgin Queen Elizabeth's maidenhead, appeared with two waitresses and a staff dominatrix. All were dressed in ghastly costumes and makeup.</p><p>\u201cYour Excellency,\u201d Butcher said, and bowed. \u201cYou\u2019re early tonight. We are honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are likely missing a doorman, however,\u201d Donatien advised him. \u201cBring my young friends mineral water.\u201d</p><p>Butcher dispatched one waitress with a snap of his black-nailed fingers, and sent the other staff members off to supervise a flogging exhibition. \u201cYour Excellency, may I ask if you have seen the club\u2019s owner, Erik? He was the young man who left with you last week, and no one has heard from him since that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErik decided to move on to a better place,\u201d Donatien said. \u201cHe did sign over this establishment to me before he left. Would you care to run it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am honored.\u201d Butcher hid his surprise by bowing deeply. \u201cI will not disappoint you, Your Excellency.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one ever does in the end, dear boy.\u201d He scanned the surrounding tables. \u201cNow bring me a blonde. Something young, nubile, and as untouched as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Your Excellency wish a blonde girl or boy?\u201d Butcher asked.</p><p>\u201cI never discriminate,\u201d Donatien said, quite truthfully. \u201cEither will do.\u201d</p><p>The band onstage played something as unpleasant and ungainly as the dancing being performed on the floor in front of them. Donatien didn\u2019t mind the ugliness of the music or motion. One had to be born with elegance; it could not be taught, bought or otherwise acquired. Seeing humans behave like the pitiful apes that they were merely reinforced his notions of evolution.</p><p>The waitress delivered drinks for his accessories and a young blonde female dressed in a too-tight merry widow and leather skirt. She had applied fake blood and adhesive scars to much of her exposed skin. Beneath the cheap cosmetics he could smell a trace of fresh blood, likely from some self-inflicted nonsense hidden under her clothes. The ennui in her eyes beckoned to him like dying candle flames.</p><p>\u201cThis is Tragedy,\u201d the waitress said.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Do sit down, dearest,\u201d Donatien said, indicating the chair across from him.</p><p>The girl moved with all the grace of a sack of root vegetables, and immediately propped her elbows on the table. \u201cMy name is Tragedy.\u201d She had a dreadful overbite, and ears that had been pierced in the most unlikely spots. Cheap, weighty jack-o-lantern earrings were pulling her earlobes into taffy, but her hair appeared to be natural, and under her heavy makeup lay somewhat dewy skin. \u201cYou\u2019re very pretty.\u201d She made it sound like a criminal offense.</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cI am Donatien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about you. They say you\u2019re a big shot new master around here.\u201d She fiddled with her spiked vinyl bracelets, miming boredom. \u201cWhenever you come to the club, they say other girls have cat fights just to talk to you. I guess \u2018cause you\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBigshot, yes, new, no, cat fights, I cannot say. And please, do think of another word with which to describe me. I know you can, dear Tragedy, because you are not like other girls, are you?\u201d She had the voice of a fishwife and the manners of a gutter cleaner, but he smelled no chemicals or alcohol on her breath, and along with the hair and the skin that was all that mattered to him.</p><p>Tragedy preened. \u201cI\u2019m not like anyone you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Youth, freshness, clean blood, functioning nerves, and misplaced pride and arrogance. What more perfect clay could be found? \u201cTell me why you come here, to such a terrible place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something to do.\u201d Her shoulders moved out and back into her slouch. \u201cI\u2019m free, white and twenty-one. I bottom and top. No cutting or bathroom games.\u201d Her glance flicked with studied indifference to his redhead. \u201cI do girls sometimes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted his toy instead of him. She, who had called him pretty. For that, he would make her beg him to kill her long before the night\u2019s games concluded.</p><p>\u201cIf I permitted you to play with my sweet little strawberry shortcake,\u201d Donatien asked, stroking his hand over his redhead\u2019s shoulder, \u201cwhat would you do to her for my amusement?\u201d</p><p>Interest finally enlivened the dull eyes. \u201cBiting, licking, twisting, spanking. I\u2019ll use vibrators, whips and clamps, whatever you like.\u201d</p><p>Dear God, would humans ever abandon these pedestrian desires? Where was the imagination in this century? They could land space craft on Mars, but in matters erotic, they were still as infantile as the Saracens and the Nazis. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>The blonde\u2019s bottom lip protruded. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>It amused him how the humans of this era wished everything spelled out for them in advance. One had to almost hire an attorney and strike a contract to arrange a proper liaison. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>Tragedy did not. \u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t require you to like me.\u201d Donatien rested his hand on his boy\u2019s shoulder, noting the slight jerk his touch produced. \u201cI asked you to give me your hand.\u201d</p><p>His brunette struck without warning, clamping onto the blonde\u2019s forearm and dragging it across the table. The girl opened her mouth to shout, only to find herself being kissed by his redhead.</p><p>Donatien folded his hand around Tragedy\u2019s as his redhead broke off the kiss and inserted her slim hand down the front of the merry widow to fondle the groaning girl. \u201cShow me your pleasure, mademoiselle.\u201d</p><p>Chilled air enveloped the table as Tragedy's mouth went slack. Her eyelids drooped over dilated pupils. A ghostly copy of her own face, much younger and decorated with small cuts and artful bruising, masked her features for a moment before it faded.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Donatien prompted.</p><p>\u201cCaroline,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cThe babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather she was a redhead. How terribly apt, that you named yourself for what she made of you.\u201d Donatien released her hand. It was near dawn, and he had so much more to accomplish before the night\u2019s work was finished. \u201cYou will do.\u201d</p><p>Her lids lifted a fraction. \u201cYou'll mean, you\u2019ll let me hurt her? You\u2019ll watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret that she is probably beyond your limited abilities to inflict suffering, Tragedy. Fortunately, I am willing to serve as your tutor.\u201d Donatien gestured to Butcher, who had been hovering within fawning range. \u201cWe will need to use the former owner\u2019s private playroom for a time. While I am occupied, lock the doors and don\u2019t permit anyone to leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The club\u2019s new manager looked confused. \u201cWe close at five a.m., Your Excellency.\u201d</p><p>Donatien smiled. \u201cNot tonight, dear boy.\u201d</p><p>Lucan resisted the weariness that dawn had draped over him and listened to Samantha breathe. Accustomed as she was to working all night and sleeping through the day, even as she had during her human life, she still fell asleep quickly and rarely stirred.</p> <p>He propped himself up on one elbow to stare down at her. His long, tall goddess had a magnificent body, and used it to give him an outrageous amount of pleasure, but her face equally fascinated him. The first time he had seen Samantha, he had been dumbfounded by the striking resemblance she bore to his long-dead love, Frances. It had taken time for him to see past the face and come to know Samantha for who she was, and by then he had forgotten the ghosts of his past.</p><p>Frances had been a lovely, feminine woman, all soft curves and gentle colors as befitted a female of her time. Samantha\u2019s toned, disciplined body sang of the beauty and self-control of a modern-day female warrior. Lucan had yearned after Frances from afar like a lovesick boy, never acknowledging her indifference to him. He had been shattered by Samantha\u2019s selfless love for him, and had done his best to destroy it \u2013 only to discover its strength and resilience.</p><p>That Samantha had survived their courtship was a miracle; near the end of it she had been shot by a determined stalker. Ending that vermin\u2019s life had been one of the few joys Lucan had ever derived from his own lethal gift. Then he had done something even worse to save the woman he loved.</p><p>Alexandra Keller, the only person to survive the transition from human to Kyn in six hundred years, had been furious when Lucan had used her blood to save Samantha. It should have poisoned her, but the terrible gamble had paid off, and miraculously Samantha had become, like Alexandra, an immortal.</p><p>That such a brave and selfless woman would choose to spend that eternity with someone like him... that was the true miracle.</p> <p>\u201cAre you done inspecting me?\u201d Samantha asked, her eyes still closed. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pull a double shift on this case, and I\u2019d like to get some sleep before noon.\u201d</p><p>A miracle that often turned and slapped at him when he least expected it. \u201cAllow me my harmless diversions, love.\u201d He ran a fingertip over the curve of her chin. \u201cThey keep me out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the one being ogled while you sleep.\u201d She turned her face away. \u201cIs it really that much fun to watch me snore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t snore.\u201d Lucan sifted his fingers through her dark chocolate hair, admiring the way the silky strands clung to his skin. Only with Samantha did he dare leave off his gloves. \u201cYou do, on occasion, drool a bit.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned, and hazel-green eyes glared at him. \u201cI never drool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I show you the wet patches on your pillow tonight?\u201d He grinned as she pushed him over onto his back and straddled him. \u201cWell, perhaps not.\u201d</p> <p>Lucan ran his hands down her arms, watching the reaction on her face as his talent played along the nerves beneath her skin. Samantha\u2019s transition had been, like Alex\u2019s, unusual. Kyn talent still affected her, and she was slower to heal. Although an unusual psychic ability from her human life \u2013 the power to read the past through the blood of its victims \u2013 remained intact, she had yet to show her true Kyn talent. She also had an annoying habit of routinely placing herself into harm\u2019s way.</p><p>He could not allow her to do so with Donatien in his territory.</p><p>She nudged his ribcage with her knees. \u201cHello. Aren\u2019t you tired yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you.\u201d Since they both slept naked, he only had to lift her hips to work his cock into her. She made a soft sound as she surrounded him in damp, tight heat. \u201cNever with you.\u201d</p><p>Lucan sat up, holding her in place with his arms, so that they were face-to-face and he moved deeper inside her. Her hips jerked as the soft heat of her melted around him, clasping and caressing him at the same time. He had taken countless women over the course of his long life, and not one of them had felt this good, this right. No one could make him feel this safe.</p><p>If he lost her, it would be the end of him.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Samantha brought his hands to her breasts, covering them with her own, her eyes darker now. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d He flipped her onto her back, keeping himself lodged high inside her as he urged her long, strong legs up and up. When the back of her calves pressed against his shoulders, he withdrew almost to the point of disengaging their bodies, and then teased her a little with the head of his cock. When she tried to counterthrust and force him back inside her, he spread his hand over the faint curve of her lower belly and pinned her.</p> <p>Samantha\u2019s body began to shake. \u201cNot fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove rarely is,\u201d Lucan agreed, and kissed her, sliding his tongue between her lips as he pushed slowly back inside her body.</p><p>Making love with Samantha was something he preferred to do with a decided amount of leisure, but he sensed the quivering of her muscles was not solely due to passion. He took her quickly to a hot, hard climax, and then drew her back down, stroking into her gently until they came together. She whispered his name as she drifted off, her body going limp with satisfaction.</p><p>When Lucan felt sure that she truly slept, he eased out of their bed, dressed and went down to his office.</p><p>Herbert Burke, Lucan\u2019s tresora, sat at the desk sorting through the night\u2019s sales slips. He looked up as Lucan entered. \u201cMaster, is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d Lucan closed the door. \u201cWhere is Rafael?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called from Miami about thirty minutes ago,\u201d Burke said, retrieving his note pad to read from it. \u201cHe said to tell you that he has the young lady from the convent, and will bring her to you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have had trouble with her.\u201d Lucan paced for a moment. \u201cContact Cyprien and make him aware that the Marquis is alive and hunting in America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Marquis.\u201d Burke paled under his new tan. \u201cSurely not, Master. The historic accounts, they all say that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the books say, and they are wrong.\u201d Lucan saw a crack divide one of the lenses in Burke\u2019s spectacles, and put a tight leash on his temper. \u201cForgive me. My concern is for Samantha. Kyn talent still affects her. If he came here, if he touched her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would not dare.\u201d Dark color flagged the smaller man\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe must see to it that he does not.\u201d Lucan went to his wall safe and took out a small aluminum case. He handed it to Burke. \u201cWhile Samantha is sleeping, replace all of the ammunition in her weapons with these rounds.\u201d He selected a .44 Magnum from the safe and carefully loaded it. Copper bullets wouldn\u2019t kill the Marquis, but they might slow him down. He put the gun back in the safe. \u201cCancel the Halloween events, close the club until further notice, and put everyone on patrol. If they see the Marquis, they are only to call in his location. No one is to confront him or go within his sight. Make that very clear to the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will advise them immediately.\u201d Burke removed his cracked glasses and replaced them with a spare pair he always carried. \u201cMaster, you should not go hunting by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work better alone, Herbert.\u201d He checked the cartridges for the tranquilizer pistol Alexandra Keller had left behind for him. He had no idea if the drug she had invented to sedate the Kyn would work on Donatien, but he would take it as well. \u201cWake me before sunset. I will track him from the convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster.\u201d Worry etched Burke\u2019s mild features. He glanced at his hands. \u201cCan you stop him?\u201d</p><p>Lucan had promised his sygkenis he would never again use his talent to harm anyone. He had no more stomach for the work, either. But Donatien had been a walking plague for too long, and it was past time to bury him. \u201cI will try, Herbert. I will try.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>Rafael often found his double life a tribulation. Being both cop and seneschal, human protector and Kyn servant meant that his duties ate up nearly every moment of his waking hours. Now in addition to solving a murder and catching a madman, he had to protect a young nun who had tried to jump through a third story window to escape him.</p><p>Some days, Lucan would say, it does not pay to rise from one\u2019s silk sheets.</p><p>For months after Michael Cyprien, the seigneur over all the American jardins, had sent Lucan to serve as suzerain over south Florida, Rafael had contemplated leaving America and returning to Spain. The jardin should have been his, not Lucan\u2019s. He had taken care of the Kyn in the southernmost part of the country for decades. It was neither just nor appropriate that an outsider be given rule over them all.</p><p>As lofty and unfriendly as Lucan could be, no master proved a mystery to his seneschal, and over time Rafael had come to know the man behind the fa\u00e7ade. As Richard\u2019s former chief assassin, Lucan had been a victim of his talent, which had made him one of the most deadly Kyn alive. It had also scarred his soul in terrible ways. He had come to America to escape his past and begin a new life, and for all his posing and sarcasm, Lucan had proven to be a fair and worthy master. He slipped into the role of suzerain with indecent ease, and made an excellent, if somewhat unorthodox, leader. Lucan\u2019s power naturally commanded respect, but he had gone to great lengths to establish a true suzerainty, one that was improving life for the Kyn of the Jardin Noir.</p><p>Rafael felt little surprise over those who had been quick to forget him and pledge their loyalties to Lucan. He had never inspired them the way Lucan did, and if that occasionally made him feel bitter, he had learned to accept that as well.</p><p>\u201cWould you please turn off the light now?\u201d a small voice called from his bed. \u201cI won't try to run again.\u201d</p><p>Rafael drew the curtains and secured the bedroom door before allowing the light created by his talent to fade. It should have felt strange to have her here \u2013 he never brought women to the apartment \u2013 but he liked seeing her under his sheets. So much so that he kept ten feet between him and the bed. \u201cWhy did you run from me? If you had gone through that window, you might have broken your neck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl sat up and rubbed the side of her face. \u201cI was afraid. I thought you might belong to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo whom? Donatien?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cYou do know him.\u201d Her gaze swept the room, pausing only on the windows and the door. Finding her boundaries, Rafael realized, and seeking avenues of escape.</p> <p>\u201cI did, once.\u201d How had someone so young and unworldly come to know such a creature? \u201cHe killed the man and left him in front of the convent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know what he can do, then you must help me.\u201d She pushed the covers away and discovered she was handcuffed. \u201cRemove these and call a taxi from me. I can go directly to the airport. There is an open ticket waiting for me there.\u201d She held out her wrists. \"Please. He will sleep for the most of the day.\"</p><p>Rafael saw two, barely-healed wounds on her wrists. Was she, like Bridget and the other women, a stigmatic? \u201cYou must stay here until we can catch him. You are quite safe with me.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, a raw, tight sound. \u201cThen you do not know Donatien at all, Detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael.\u201d The wildness in her eyes made him forget about keeping his distance, and he went to stand at the side of the bed. Dried lavender perfumed her habit and veil, but beneath it he caught the soft, delicate scent of her skin. He had not yet fed, and felt the ache of hunger and something darker in his fangs. \u201cTell me your real name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDani. Daniela Nieves.\u201d</p><p>Daniela Nieves, Daniel A. Nieves. It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence. \u201cEither you are named for your father, or you own The Sisters of the Annunciata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the owner in name only.\u201d She twisted her wrists. \u201cI don\u2019t like these things. They hurt.\u201d Her expression turned puzzled. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m going to attack you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop fighting them.\u201d He put his hand over the short chain between her wrists. Being alone with her and having her completely at his mercy brought temptation, so unexpected and ravenous that he nearly tugged her into his arms. But he would not feed on a nun, nor would he seduce one. \u201cI will remove the handcuffs as soon as you tell me how you have become involved with Donatien. The truth,\u201d he added when she began to reply. \u201cNot another pretty story you think I will believe.\u201d</p><p>She tucked her chin in and scooted into a sitting position. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>He borrowed one of Samantha\u2019s favorite phrases. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore I came to America, I lived in Argentina.\u201d Daniela pulled her knees up and hugged them with her cuffed arms. \u201cDonatien came to our village one night, looking for young and lovely ones. Women and men; he wanted them all. He kept coming back for more.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cYou have seen him with people \u2013 you know how he is, how he looks, how he makes them feel?\u201d He nodded. \u201cThey went to him like ants to wild honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed these people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. They never came back.\u201d Daniela\u2019s head drooped, and she began speaking in Spanish. \u201cSome tried to run away, but he would find them and bring them back. There were screams and laughter in the night. The air always smelled of dead fires. He came and he came until the young and lovely ones were gone, and then he took the others. Until I was the only one left.\u201d</p><p>Rafael wondered what Daniela\u2019s native language was. Her Spanish was flawless, but it was the language of the school room, not that of a native speaker. \u201cHow were you able to resist him?\u201d</p><p>She avoided his gaze now. \u201cI stayed in the jungle at night, in places he didn\u2019t know. Then Sister Marguerite came during the day, while he was sleeping. She found me and took me away to a convent in Rio. She said I would be safe there, and for a long time I was, but then he came again. When the Mother Superior would not let him in, he began taking people from the streets.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cHe hurt them in terrible ways first. Then he killed them and left their bodies outside the convent. Like the man last night.\u201d</p><p>Rafael took her hands in his. \u201cBut you escaped him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister Marguerite moved me to another place, but he found me again. He climbed over the walls at night and walked about the place, looking for me, calling my name.\u201d She twisted her hands together, so tightly that all of her tendons strained. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t go to him, he killed all the nuns and left a message written in their blood on the wall. He said I could never escape him.\u201d</p><p>The way she spoke of what happened bothered him as much as her Spanish \u2013 again, the stuff of the school room. Daniela\u2019s speech patterns were more like a child\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s why Sister Marguerite brought you to America.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter she made him think that we were both dead, yes. But he is here now, and he knows. I must go away before he kills any more people.\u201d She held out her wrists. \u201cWill you take them off now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment.\u201d Rafael slipped off the veil covering her long hair. It spilled around her face in soft, dark waves. \u201cWhen did you take your vows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year.\u201d She swallowed and looked away again.</p><p>Rafael leaned closer. \u201cWhat was the name of your village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was \u2013 it had no name. It was only the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis convent where you took your vows, what was it called?\u201d When she groped for an answer, he asked, \u201cThe name of the one that burned down? What was it? And the name of your order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are gone.\u201d She almost stuttered the words. \u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never taken vows.\u201d A fierce and completely unexpected satisfaction filled him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a nun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, I was... I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey shave your head when you pledge yourself to Christ,\u201d he said, grabbing a fistful of her hair, dragging it around in front of her eyes. \u201cNow tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know,\u201d she shouted, and then hunched her shoulders and tried to curl away from him. \u201cThey never told me. I was from the compound. I was not like them. They would not speak to me.\u201d She twisted, yanking her hair from his grasp.</p><p>He held onto her arms. \u201cWhat compound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was in the jungle, near the village. It was why Donatien came to Argentina. To see it. To touch the Father\u2019s things, and to look through the photos and read his journals. He took pleasure in them, laughed over them as if they were amusing. I watched him through the windows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Daniela.\u201d When she wouldn\u2019t, Rafael lifted her chin and used his thumbs to wipe away the incessant tears. \u201cI can help you, but I have to know the truth.\u201d</p><p>She went rigid. \u201cMarguerite made me promise. She said if anyone knew, if anyone saw, that they would lock me away and never let me go.\u201d</p><p>Rafael was glad the old nun was dead. \u201cI will not. I will not permit anyone to do that to you.\u201d</p><p>All the fight went out of her. \u201cIt won\u2019t make any difference. He has found me. But I will show you.\u201d Dull-eyed now, she looked across the room. \u201cThat fern there, the brown one. Would you bring it to me, please?\u201d</p><p>Rafael reluctantly released her, and went over to the hanging plant that, like every other thing he had attempted to grow in the apartment, had died. Brittle brown leaves showered his arms as he took it down and carried it to the bed. \u201cThis is a lost cause, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d Slowly, almost painfully, she brought her cuffed hands to the dead thing. \u201cThe Father ran so many tests on me, but he could never find out how, or make another like me again. It angered him.\u201d She plunged her hands into the dry, scratchy snarl of leaves.</p><p>Rafael felt it first. A warmth that, given the efficiency of his apartment's air conditioning, should not have spread as it did. But within a few seconds it created a pool around the bed, causing beads of sweat to gather in his temples and streak down his back.</p><p>Daniela closed her eyes and seemed to shrink in on herself, as if squeezed by the growing heat.</p><p>The vibrations came next. Rafael had felt something similar whenever his master lost his temper or used his talent. Lucan often caused any glass in close proximity to shatter whenever that happened. Yet these waves did not have the same, destructive feel to them. They seemed to dance around him, unseen creatures of the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat... \u201c Rafael glanced down at the fern, which began rustling around the girl's hands. The dead leaves slowly straightened out of their lifeless curls, and their color paled to yellow.</p><p>Daniela opened her eyes, which had turned a ghostly blue. \u201cIt was almost gone,\u201d she whispered, a note of censure in her soft voice. \u201cI cannot bring them back when they are gone. There has to be a little left.\u201d</p><p>Rafael hardly heard her. The fern\u2019s yellow leaves had begun to glow with something that was not light or heat but part of both. The base of each leaf turned a dark green that quickly devoured the yellow as it spread to each tip. Daniela\u2019s eyes closed a second time, and the entire plant shook, its stalks stabbing up into the air and spreading like eager fingers. At last she took her hands from the pot, and sagged back against the pillows.</p><p>The heat pressing around them vanished as if it had never been.</p><p>Rafael carefully picked up the plant and turned it around in his hands. It was as fresh and full of life as the day he had brought it home. He looked over it at the huddled form in his bed. \u201cHow long have you been able to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I was born.\u201d Her exhausted voice matched the color of her skin. She lifted her hands. \u201cDo you have bandages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a price for what I do.\u201d She extended her arms, showing him bloody fingers and palms, swollen wrists and bruised forearms.</p><p>With a curse he pulled a small key from his pocket and released the cuffs around her wrists, sitting down and gently examining her wounds. \u201cDoes this happen every time?\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cSometimes it is not so bad. Sometimes it is worse.\u201d A bitter curl twisted her mouth. \u201cBut now you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stared at her. \u201cIt is not only plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it for animals and people. Anything that has some life left in it. That is why Donatien wants me. For the ones he hurts.\u201d She stared at the fern. \u201cBecause I can keep them alive.\u201d</p><p>Samantha started her shift on Halloween by stopping at the Chief of Homicide's office. \u201cI\u2019ve got some updates on the convent murder.\u201d</p> <p>Ernesto Garcia closed the file he was reading. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>She took out her PDA and punched up her notes. \u201cVictim identified as Erik Bergen, age thirty-two, single, lives alone, no kids. Currently owns a fetish place called Club Dominion. No significant other, no family other than an elderly father in Brooklyn. NYPD will handle the notification.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominion\u2019s that one across from the Ambassador\u2019s Towers?\u201d When she nodded, he said, \u201cI thought that was a private B.Y.O.B. club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBergen got a liquor license and opened it to the public about a year ago,\u201d she said. \u201cClientele\u2019s been busted a few times since for indecent exposure, public sex during vice sweeps, but no working girls or anything else to blow air up the Mayor\u2019s tasteful skirt. It\u2019s a place to dress out and hookup. How long are we going to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d He glanced up and saw her expression. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Suarez, he won\u2019t be in. Kyn business.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Kyn now, but I guess I don\u2019t count.\u201d Sam sat down and took a pocket recorder from her jacket. \u201cThis is voice-activated. For those times when you guys decide that Sam can\u2019t handle that all-important, hush-hush Kyn business.\u201d</p><p>She switched on the tape, which played a conversation first between Lucan and Rafael, and then between Lucan and Herbert Burke. When it was finished, she switched it off.</p><p>\u201cI like the parts where everyone decides what\u2019s good for me, and that no one is to speak to me about a guy who appears to be the prime suspect in my fucking murder case,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Garcia picked up the recorder and regarded it the same way he might a dead rat. \u201cSomehow I doubt the suzerain will appreciate the fact that you\u2019ve bugged his office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will deal with the suzerain later, I assure you.\u201d Her temper, which had been simmering since she\u2019d listened to the tape, flared. \u201cNow can we stop dancing around this and you give me some answers? Or do I go start roughing up some vampires, starting with my partner?\u201d</p><p>His expression shuttered. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you anything more than what is on that tape.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Rafael\u2019s tresora, of course you can.\u201d She waited for him to reply. \u201cI am a decent cop, you know. I can just go looking for them. Guy likes to cruise fetish clubs, right? We don\u2019t have that many around here, and I\u2019m in the mood to go beat the hell out of someone anyway.\u201d</p><p>Garcia hissed in a breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t. Samantha, there are some things about the Kyn that you\u2019re better off not knowing. Donatien \u2013 the Marquis \u2013 is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they are talking about the same person. Thought so.\u201d She enjoyed his wince over the slip. \u201cThis Donatien may be Kyn, but he killed Erik Bergen, which makes it my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonatien is not Kyn.\u201d He rubbed a hand over his shaved scalp. \u201cYou remember Faryl, the changeling who tried to kill Lucan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnake-man, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cI cut off his tail. Made him kind of unforgettable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaryl was what happens to a Kyn when they live only on animal blood,\u201d Garcia told her. \u201cThere have been Kyn who went the other way, who refused to curtail their hunger. They not only kill humans, they toy with them. Like cats with mice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was how he began, and he was among the worst of us. Then something happened.\u201d Garcia seemed to be choosing his words with great care. \u201cIt should have killed him, but instead it made him more powerful, more dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you give me all the facts, Cap.\u201d</p><p>Ernesto rose to his feet and went to the one window he had in his office, which overlooked the department parking lot. \u201cIf I do, Lucan will have my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it if you don\u2019t, and you have to work with me every day,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cHim you can dodge.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and went to his filing cabinet, taking out a folder and handing it to her. \u201cThat is what current information we have. It\u2019s not much. Rumors, a few unconfirmed sightings, unsolved murder sprees in the Middle East and Germany.\u201d</p><p>She opened the folder and made an exasperated sound. \u201cIt\u2019s written in French, which I don\u2019t speak or read.\u201d She pulled out a sketch of a man so beautiful he made Brad Pitt look like a troll. \u201cThis is the monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is Donatien Alphonse Fran\u00e7ois,\u201d Garcia told her. \u201cBetter known as Le Marquis de Sade.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>Dani dreamed of the one place in the world where she had never felt afraid: the jungle beyond the compound. On warm, moonlit nights, when the Father's men had gone into the village to drink and chase women, she had slipped under the fence and into that cool, green darkness.</p><p>The Father had told her that it was impossible for her to remember her mother (she died birthing you, Crist\u00e1l, he would always say, hating her with his eyes) but Dani felt her presence in every shadow, heard her whisper in every movement through the leaves. Mama had belonged to the jungle, had been buried by the Father somewhere in it, and so she had become a part of Dani\u2019s rare night wanderings.</p><p>Tonight she felt her mother as if from a distance, but that hint of tender love was all she needed. She raced through the brush, chasing it not in desperation but in a playful, teasing fashion that made her mother's ghost laugh.</p><p>Until the dark man stepped out into the moonlight, blocking her path.</p><p>Daniela. He held out his hand, tiny golden lights filling the palm. Don\u2019t run away from me.</p><p>She stayed. She had never like men very much \u2013 the Father often hurt her, and the guards despised and feared her \u2013 but the dark man felt different. He smelled wonderful, too, not at all like the sour odor that clung to everyone at the compound. She went to him, and when she reached for his hand, he tossed up the lights, showering her with their cool, tickling sparkles.</p><p>\u201cRafael.\u201d She remembered his name from the other place. His name became poetry on her tongue, and she savored it twice more. \u201cRafael, Rafael. How did you find me?\u201d</p><p>We are sharing a dream, he told her, clasping her wrists with his hands. Is this your home?</p><p>Dani had never thought of the jungle as anything but freedom. It did not belong to her, and the Father would never permit her to live in it. Home was the compound, where everyone feared the Father and what he did in the white-washed rooms. She did not want to think about that, not here. Here she came to be, to run, to forget.</p><p>\u201cI wish it were,\u201d she told him.</p><p>I had a place like this, once, a long time ago. A flock of green parrots fluttered around them, and he drew her closer, holding her to his side. Can you show me the compound?</p><p>Somewhere in the shadows, a jaguar growled.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d When Rafael nodded, she sighed and guided him down the old path to the clearing where the Father had made the compound. The rusting, barbed wire fence sagged in places, some parts of it cut out and missing. A few ghosts scrounged around the burned and gutted buildings, the old ones who still thought they were alive, and could pick through the debris for scrap to sell in city.</p><p>Someone burned it to the ground?</p><p>\u201cThe Father did before he left the country.\u201d She stared at the place where she had been so miserable. \u201cMen came from Europe \u2013 not his men, but others that were angry with him \u2013 so he set fire to the top part.\u201d She took him to one of the lower level entrances, pushing aside the tool shed that concealed it. \u201cThe soldiers came and took things and burned it, and I had to go live in the village. They never did find the bottom part.\u201d</p><p>Dani hated going below, but knew Rafael should see it all. The sensors that still worked turned on the Father\u2019s lights as they walked down the stairs and into the center corridor. Ghosts in wrinkled white coats shuffled past them. They wrote on blank clipboards with empty pens. Seeing the spirits made Dani\u2019s arms throb.</p><p>Rafael ignored the spirits and looked through some of the dusty windows. This is a hospital.</p><p>\u201cThe Father called it that, but he never fixed anyone. He broke them and made me do it.\u201d She surreptitiously checked the sleeves of her smock to see if she was bleeding again. \u201cI didn\u2019t like him. He pretended to be happy and kind, but underneath he was like Donatien. He didn\u2019t really care about the tests he said he had to do, or the soldiers he was going to make to take back to his land. He simply liked doing the breaking.\u201d</p><p>Rafael stopped in front of one of the many framed pictures the Father had left behind, and wiped the dust from the glass over it. What was his name?</p><p>\u201cHe never told us. We were made to call him \u2018Doctor\u2019 or \u2018Father.\u2019\u201d She saw a portrait of the Father as a handsome young man and turned away. \u201cCan we go back to the jungle now?\u201d</p><p>In a moment. Rafael looked at some of the other pictures and then saw the birthing room, where the spirit of a village woman floated above the table, shrieking without sound as she struggled to deliver a baby that would never take a breath. Was he your father? Was his name Nieves?</p><p>\u201cNo. Daniela Nieves is not my name. Marguerite made it up for me, for my papers. The Father called me \u2018Crist\u00e1l\u2019, or this.\u201d She pulled up the sleeve of her smock and showed him the numbers on her left arm.</p><p>Six-one-two-seven. He ran his fingertips over the faded mark. What do they mean?</p><p>\u201cHe never told me, but I think they are when I was born.\u201d</p><p>No one calls a child by a number.</p><p>She looked at the writhing ghost woman. \u201cThe Father did.\u201d She pulled at his arm. \u201cCan we leave now? Everything here is cold and dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafael followed her out of the lower level, although he kept glancing back over his shoulder, as if still not quite believing what she had shown him. Is this place why the villagers would not speak to you?</p><p>Dani thought of the years she had spent in the village. \u201cThey were afraid of me. I could walk through the jungle, and nothing would hurt me. I never got sick. When they were sick or hurt, I was the only one who could help them. They needed me, and they took care of me, but they resented me.\u201d She almost ran back into the jungle.</p><p>Rafael caught up with her, turning her to him. I was wrong to make you show me that place. I\u2019m sorry, Daniela.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not all bad. I could always go into the jungle. My mother is here. So is life.\u201d Dani felt a cold, icy touch along the length of her spine, and on impulse she hugged him. The pain it caused in her arms was worth seeing the startled pleasure in his eyes. \u201cNow you are, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not what you think I am. He moved as if to set her away, and then brought one of his hands to her face. Compelled to touch, as she was. You are so young and innocent. I must leave you alone.</p><p>Joy deepened into feelings Dani had never experienced, even when the Father had tried to force her to feel such things. He had wanted to breed her like a cow, to see if her children would be as she was, only to discover that she could not make children. Rafael didn\u2019t care that she had numbers for a name. He saw her as she saw the jungle, and that was a dream she had never expected to come true.</p><p>He was the one, the meaning, the reason to go on.</p><p>She brought her arms up and encircled his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Instead of bending down, he lifted her up to his mouth. Dani felt her feet dangling for an instant, and then his lips touched hers. She could taste his breath blending with hers, felt the silken abrasion of his mustache and beard against her face. Before she was ready, he lifted his mouth and began to lower her to the ground.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid of her. He feared what he might do to her. What his hunger might do to her. It was so ridiculous that she almost laughed.</p><p>Dani wrapped her legs around his waist and clutched at his shoulders. \u201cThat was a terrible kiss. Here.\u201d She used her hand to draw his mouth again to hers. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, making a new angle, and teased his lips with the tip of her tongue. He tasted of sunlight and shadow, and in that moment before he took her kiss and made it his, Dani knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough, it could never be enough, and that was why he was the one, the meaning, and the reason.</p><p>Dani could feel the cold touch of death again, but pushed it away. This is my mate, my love, and I have been waiting for him for so long that I hardly know what to do.</p><p>The floor of the jungle became a silken twist of sheets and clothes, and the kiss he gave her came with the weight of his body on hers. For a long, luxurious interval Dani moved against the searching caress of his hands, content to drift along on a haze of not-quite-waking need. She felt something sharp against the edge of her tongue, tasted blood, and heard him groan.</p> <p>The dream ebbed, casting them both back into the now.</p><p>Lucan felt his sygkenis before he smelled her, something he could do only when one of them was angry. Since the wine glass in his hand remained whole, he assumed the temper about to explode was hers.</p><p>\u201cIf you punch me,\u201d he told her before she came into sight, \u201cyour hand will hurt longer than my nose. What is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong? What could be wrong? My life is all hearts and flowers, Lord and Master Lucan.\u201d She came around the side of the white leather couch and stood before him. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a great job of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I have... made you happy?\u201d He contemplated his bloodwine to avoid looking into her furious eyes. \u201cApparently not. May God have mercy on my soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I\u2019m done with you, pal. Let\u2019s start with \u2018Say nothing to Samantha,\u2019\u201d she said with a very accurate imitation of his native English accent. \u201cOr how about, \u2018While Samantha is sleeping, replace all of the ammunition in her weapons.\u2019\u201d</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cI\u2019ve soundproofed every inch of this building, so I know you weren\u2019t listening at the keyhole.\u201d Then it occurred to him. \u201cYou bugged my office. You bitch. How could you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re replacing my ammo and lying to me, you bastard, so what\u2019s the difference?\u201d She shook her head and went to the closet he had surrendered when she had moved in with him. \u201cI know we still have trust issues,\u201d she said as she began sorting through cartridge boxes. \u201cI\u2019m a cop, you\u2019re a retired assassin, goes with the territory. But you know, you\u2019re the one who made me Kyn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he seized on that. \u201cI did. And I saved your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed me before Dwyer\u2019s bullet could,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cBut what you did brought me back, so I forgive you. I like living better than dying. Even with the fangs, the lousy diet, you being grandmaster vampire and all your other medieval shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzerain.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the closet door shut. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been patient as well,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cYou are still working for the police, are you not? As is my seneschal, I might add. You wish to come and go as you please, and so you do. You put yourself in danger each night to protect humans, while I wait for you to come home to me.\u201d He turned his face away from her. \u201cAnd wonder if you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you worried? You\u2019re gorgeous. You\u2019re great in bed. I\u2019m not going anywhere. You\u2019re a good man, you son of a bitch, and as much as I\u2019d like to, I can\u2019t punch you in the nose. I love you.\u201d Something dark and hurt shimmered in her eyes. \u201cI love you so much, Lucan.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet and went to her. \u201cDo you think I feel anything less for you? My God, woman. I would die for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She buried her face against his chest.</p><p>He held her close. \u201cI only want to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you lie to me, and do things behind my back?\u201d She jerked out of his arms. \u201cNo, my man. We have to settle this. Now. I\u2019m tired of you sneaking out of bed. I don\u2019t want to bug your office. I\u2019m your lover, your life companion, whatever the sygkenis thing means, right?\u201d When he nodded, she held out her hands. \u201cThen respect me enough to tell me the truth. Keep me in the loop. Especially when a monster like Donatien comes to town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well. I will keep you informed, as long as you follow my orders,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe are Kyn, Samantha, and I am your liege lord as well your lover. I will not command you often, but when I do, you will obey me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going out to hunt Donatien tonight, and I\u2019m going alone.\u201d Before she could say anything, he shook his head. \u201cHe is too dangerous. I don\u2019t want to kill anyone, but I am the only one powerful enough to do it. Whatever happens, I\u2019ll return at dawn.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI think you should stop by Rafael\u2019s apartment before you go back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he is.\u201d Lucan bent down to kiss her. \u201cBut you should perhaps check on the nun.\u201d</p><p>Dani opened her eyes to find herself naked and in a very unfamiliar place, pinned as she was under Detective Suarez\u2019s body. He held her wrists over her head with one hand, and was using the other to knead her left breast. His damp mouth lifted from hers, and on it she saw a smear of blood and the glitter of white, sharp teeth.</p><p>The air around them felt frosty against her face, but his body kept her warm.</p><p>\u201cDaniela.\u201d He murmured her name as he propped himself on one elbow and looked down at her through drowsy, confused eyes. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the chest flattening her breasts. \u201cI think we\u2019re having sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry.\u201d And he was. \u201cI only meant to rest beside you for an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d As he tried to roll away, she wrapped a leg around the back of his. \u201cDon\u2019t pull away from me.\u201d She felt his erection against her belly, and although this was only the fourth time she had seen this man in her life, that was fine with her. As for what had happened, it was too soon to speak of dreams of love. For now, desire would have to do. \u201cDo you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot do this.\u201d Finally, fully awake, Rafael seemed slightly horrified by their present positions. \u201cYou are hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She showed him her arms, wrists and hands, which had almost entirely healed while she slept. \u201cThe after-effects never last very long. Thank heaven.\u201d She tried to kiss him, but he turned his face away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me, then say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not that.\u201d He struggled with the words. \u201cDaniela, I am too old, and you are too young. You do not know what I am.\u201d</p><p>Trust a man to put such emphasis on ages and confessions.</p><p>\u201cI know you.\u201d She moved under him, impatient and so aroused she thought she\u2019d tear out her hair if he didn\u2019t take her. None of this made much sense, but it didn\u2019t concern her, either. They could find reasons and exchange their secrets later. \u201cDo you want me?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes sparkled with the same lights he had held in the dream. \u201cI have wanted you from the moment I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d She arched her neck so she could brush her mouth across his. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must tell you this first.\u201d When she did, he opened his mouth, showing her two long, sharp teeth that had not been there before. \u201cI am not human. I am a vrykolakas, an immortal being, and I live on human blood. We are called the Darkyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Marguerite told me about your kind. Donatien is one of you.\u201d Perhaps it should have frightened her, but instead it made the world right again. In all things, there had to be a balance. \u201cYou and the others are not like him, are you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe do not kill. We protect.\u201d He brushed a lock of hair back from her face. \u201cAnd if you do not push me away in the next ten seconds, I fear that I am going to make love to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d She smiled up at him. He cared enough now to make sure that she understood before this last, irrevocable choice was made. If she survived this \u2013 if he could help her \u2013 he had earned whatever he asked of her. \u201cBut could you make that five seconds, please?\u201d</p><p>Rafael waited all of three before his mouth came down over hers, and he gave her a kiss so deep and perfect Dani never wanted it to end. But then his head lifted, and his hands began mapping her, shaping the curves of her flesh to his gentle demands. He only stopped when she stroked his back, and only then to wrap her wrists with a soft length of cord, which he then tied to the headboard.</p><p>Dani glanced up, frustrated and amused. \u201cYou do like binding me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRestraining you,\u201d he murmured, kissing the hard peak of one breast and then the other. He frowned at her tied hands as if seeing them for the first time, and then his face cleared. \u201cIf you touch me again, I will not be responsible for what happens.\u201d</p><p>Rafael's sharp teeth flashed as he spoke, and she sensed they hurt as much as the hard shaft nestled between her thighs. She put her mouth on his, not giving him a chance to refuse as she edged the tips with the soft inside of her lower lip. With a groan he bit down, shuddering as he drank from her mouth, pressing the head of his penis against her and then into her, until Dani arched up, needed her aching emptiness to be filled. It became a wild, reckless thing inside her, making her test her bonds and meet the hard thrust of his body with her own.</p><p>From there it quickened, the dance and glide of flesh with the dark and needy fusion of their mouths. Rafael took a little of her blood and then soothed the two small wounds with his tongue, even as his hands fastened to the sides of her thighs and held her open for the deep, steady stroke of his cock. When he nuzzled her throat, Dani expected to feel him bite again, but his mouth glanced across the sweep of her shoulder and then found her ear, where he whispered something in a language she didn\u2019t understand and yet felt as surely as the pleasure streaming through her.</p><p>Dani wanted to touch him, to sink her fingernails into his back and urge him to stop holding back and to take her as she wanted him to, as he wished to. The words poured out of her in her own language, one he must have understood because he stiffened over her, his muscles locking for a long moment as he lay buried inside her body. Dani jerked under him, and that and her words were all it took to destroy his control.</p><p>\u201cYou want more?\u201d he rasped, driving into her with the full force of the passion she had released. \u201cTake all of it. All of me, Daniela.\u201d</p> <p>Dani drew him down until his cheek pressed to her temple, and sank her own blunt teeth into the side of his strong neck. She kissed the marks she left, panting against them as her spine bowed and her orgasm flooded through her, wrenching a low cry from her that went on and on until Rafael covered her mouth with his own and gathered her up into his arms, holding her as he followed.</p><p>A thousand years later, Rafael lifted his head and stared down at her as if he didn\u2019t recognize her. \u201cWhat have we done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a dream. We were dreaming.\u201d Her hands shook as she held onto him, all of the old doubts chased away by new ones. \u201cWeren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>The sun crossed from morning to afternoon skies before Rafael woke. Daniela lay in his arms, so deeply asleep that she did not stir when he extracted himself from the warm softness of their embrace. A wedge of sunshine from a gap in the curtains played over her, displaying everything he remembered from the night: the pale golden skin, high firm breasts, and silky hair that poured from her scalp over the pillows in dark streams, fringed the faint shadows of her eyelids, and cupped her mound in a tangle of delicate curls.</p><p>Rafael knew it hadn\u2019t been a dream. He could still feel her moving under him. He could still taste her on his lips.</p> <p>After he secured her, he pulled on his trousers and went to wash and think of how and why he had done this to her. He had been drawn to her from the moment he first saw her, stepping out into the moonlight. He had also recognized her youth, and heard the tremors of fear in her voice. He did not seduce innocent, frightened human females; when he wanted sex he sought out a mature, experienced woman who understood mutual pleasure and spent one night with her. Anything more than that was not possible.</p><p>He had not been Daniela\u2019s first, that much was a comfort. She had enough knowledge of a man\u2019s needs not to be frightened of them, as a virgin would be. That and her body had welcomed his completely, with no discomfort or awkwardness. Still, there had been moments when he had felt her react to his love-making as if she had never experienced the like. Perhaps her other lovers had been inept.</p><p>There will be no other lovers. Rafael swept his hair back from his face with an impatient hand. She will have me.</p><p>Was he seriously thinking about taking a human as his lover? As Lucan had once planned to do with Samantha? Or was it because Donatien pursued her, Donatien wanted her?</p><p>I\u2019m not what you think I am.</p><p>It had taken years for Rafael to accept what he had done in Richard\u2019s name. He should have known that something was wrong from the moment the high lord had given him that case of rare, exquisite cognac mixed with blood as a gift to the Marquis. To help ease his pain in his last days, Richard had said. Never mentioning that it had been aged in old copper vats.</p><p>Donatien must have known. Rafael had brought a bottle to the asylum each time he called on the Marquis in his private suite. He could still see him sipping the lethal blood brandy, smiling with pleasure. The fine particles of copper would have burned his insides as he swallowed, would have made his gut feel as if it were on fire. Yet the Marquis had said nothing, drinking one bottle after another each night. The same nights he had tried to seduce Rafael.</p><p>He could still feel the touch of Donatien\u2019s hands, as gentle and curious as a young girl\u2019s. Give yourself to me, my night angel, and I will take you to places that you have never been.</p> <p>Rafael had never desired men, but nothing on this earth had been as beautiful or seductive as Donatien.</p><p>\u201cI hate to ask a stupid question,\u201d his partner said from where she stood in the doorway, \u201cbut why is there a naked nun handcuffed to your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not a nun. Please be quiet, Samantha. She is sleeping.\u201d Rafael shrugged into a shirt as he walked out of the bathroom, went to close the bedroom door, and moved on to his weapons cabinet. \u201cThe handcuffs are merely a precaution. I don\u2019t want her to run away again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapping victims have a way of doing that. We call it escaping their captor.\u201d Samantha propped her arm across the cabinet, prevented him from opening it. \u201cUncuff her, Rafael. Lie to her. Tell her you had too much to drink, and that it was all a terrible mistake. Then give her cab fare and send her back to the convent. And pray she\u2019s into forgiveness in a big way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot send her back.\u201d He glanced at the bedroom, wondering if their voices would disturb her. After what they had shared in and out of the dream, when she woke she might feel disoriented, even frightened. His own guilt had been gnawing steadily at him. What had she done to him? \u201cDaniela is different. She is like us.\u201d</p><p>Her expression turned skeptical. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that she\u2019s a vampire nun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s human, but she was... it is complicated.\u201d He was not even sure what Daniela was, only that she could heal with a touch, and that Donatien would stop at nothing to have her. Of that much he was certain. \u201cShe is in grave danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you aren\u2019t?\u201d She opened her jacket and tapped the butt of her pistol. \u201cGuess who replaced all my ammunition with copper rounds last night? Want to play target and let me find out how well they work?\u201d</p><p>Rafael knew she wouldn\u2019t shoot him, but thought it prudent to dispel some of her anger all the same. \u201cSamantha, I have to protect her. The man who is hunting her is the same one who killed the man at the convent. He is\u2013\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a man, and not particularly sane. He was Kyn, but got himself tossed in the nuthouse after he slaughtered a few too many humans, where he went genuinely nuts and poisoned himself by eating copper, and then rose a second time. No one knows what he\u2019s capable of, but he scares the shit out of everyone, even Lucan.\u201d She nodded at his startled look. \u201cYep. I know all about the Marquis now, Rafael.\u201d</p><p>Despite Lucan\u2019s orders, someone had told Samantha about Donatien. There wouldn\u2019t be a window left intact in the city. \u201cI regret that you were not told about him,\u201d he said, playing diplomat, \u201cbut it changes nothing. Daniela must stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Samantha breathed in as if to shout, and then wrinkled her nose. \u201cWhat is that smell? God, it\u2019s getting on my nerves more than you are.\u201d She paced around the room. \u201cHave you started smoking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rafael\u2019s head was still filled with Dani, whose scent still painted his skin. \u201cI am rarely here. Likely it is exhaust fumes from the street outside the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose the windows, then, because it\u2019s really\u2014\u201d Samantha came to an abrupt stop and squatted, touching a spot on the burgundy carpet. \u201cThere\u2019s blood here.\u201d She flushed as a vision came over her. \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me you fed on her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not thinking clearly.\u201d Obviously. \u201cI promise you, I did not harm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. It\u2019ll all be in her blood, and really, the last thing I want to watch in my head is pornography starring you and the nun. Jesus, I\u2019m going to hell just for saying that.\u201d She stood and strode into the kitchen, but stopped short of the sink. \u201cRafael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, she is not a nun.\u201d He holstered his gun and took out the spare he carried along with a box of copper rounds. \u201cI never intended for it to happen. It simply did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael, this isn\u2019t hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been the dream. I think she took me back to where she lived, in Argentina.\u201d He was almost sure of it. \u201cWe went to an underground compound \u2013 some sort of medical research facility\u2013\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRafael,\u201d Samantha said, very patiently, \u201cI\u2019d love to hear about your dreams all day, but this blood on my hand isn\u2019t Daniela\u2019s. I think it belongs to the decapitated head sitting in your sink.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t believe her, not until he saw it for himself. It was indeed a human head, that of a young woman with blonde hair. Garish jack-o-lantern earrings dangled from her lobes while her clouded eyes stared up at him, wide and terrified. Her mouth formed an unnatural, ghastly smile. The head had been placed so neatly in his sink that its fluids dripped directly into the open drain.</p><p>\u201cTrick-or-treat,\u201d Samantha muttered.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone must have broken in and put it here while I slept,\u201d he said. The decapitation, he saw from the condition of the neck stump, had been performed precisely and cleanly, with a perfectly level blade. \u201cCan you tell where she was killed?\u201d</p><p>Samantha placed her hand, scarred in the center palm from the bullet of a hired killer, into the small amount of blood rimming the drain. Her pupils narrowed to splinters of black, and a flush rose from her neck to race up her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cHanging blade, torture room,\u201d Samantha said in a distant monotone. \u201cDarkness. Walking down a narrow hallway. Darkness, wait, she keeps zoning out. Redhead in a maroon dress. Ugly pierced guy grinning. Darkness. Table, brown haired man. Hand on her hand and... oh, my God.\" Her face white now, she snatched her hand out of the sink and scrubbed at it with a towel. \u201cIs that what he does? He makes them feel those things? Relive them? Want them? What?\u201d</p><p>Rafael thought of Daniela and how completely she had given herself to him. \u201cWhat did you smell before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was this girl?\u201d she countered. \u201cWhy did he kill her and bring her head to your apartment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am trying to find out,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cWhat did you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething gross, like an overflowing ashtray. Or Evan Tenderson. But I repeat myself.\u201d Her mobile phone beeped, and it seemed to calm her as she answered it. \u201cBrown.\u201d She listened.</p><p>Rafael quickly searched the apartment, but found nothing and no one hiding in it. He went back to Samantha.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she said as she ended one call and made another.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad news.\u201d Into the phone, she said, \u201cBurke? It\u2019s Sam. I need you to send some guys over here to Rafael\u2019s place. To move the kidnapped nun I\u2019m not supposed to know about to a safer place so the nutcase zombie vampire you\u2019re not supposed to tell me about doesn\u2019t kill her. There\u2019s also a decapitated head in the sink. I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d She switched off the phone. \u201cPack it up. We\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t wish to leave Daniela in the care of others. \u201cSamantha\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonatien hung the other part of this girl in front of Club Dominion. He left a note addressed to you. He wrote it in blood on the torso.\u201d She tossed her keys to him. \u201cI\u2019ll wait with her until the men get here. You get down to the club before Tenderson does, read the message, and then get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>Dani woke up to the smell of hot coffee, and found Detective Brown unlocking the handcuffs binding her wrists to Rafael\u2019s head board. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying not to think of ways to off my partner.\u201d She tossed the cuffs aside and checked Daniela\u2019s arms, which were still somewhat bruised, and chafed her wrists. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about this, Ms. Nieves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dani. Don\u2019t be upset, Detective, please. I\u2019m not.\u201d She smiled a little, thinking of the night she\u2019d shared with Rafael. \u201cI guess I should tell you that I\u2019m not really a nun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael mentioned it a couple dozen times. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not relieved.\u201d Green eyes crinkled with a genuine smile. \u201cCall me Sam.\u201d</p><p>She looked over Samantha's shoulder. \"Where is Rafael?\"</p><p>\u201cI kicked him out to go do some work.\u201d Samantha began gathering Dani\u2019s clothes, which were scattered all around the bed. \u201cI need you to get dressed. We're going to move you to a safer place, keep you there until we can catch this guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDonatien is coming for me,\u201d Dani told her bluntly. \u201cI\u2019m the one he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he can\u2019t have you.\u201d She straightened and sniffed the air. \u201cDo you smoke?\u201d</p><p>Dani could smell it, too. She had smelled it before, in the village, in the compound, in the jungle. The dead fires.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him. He\u2019s here.\u201d She jolted out of the bed, grabbed her clothes from Sam and began dressing frantically.</p><p>\u201cEasy, honey,\u201d Sam said. \u201cRafael searched the apartment before he left; there\u2019s no one here.\u201d</p><p>Dani shoved her feet into her shoes and then heard something moving in the ceiling. \u201cYou have to hide,\u201d she whispered, dragging Sam toward the closet. \u201cDon\u2019t make any sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste of time,\u201d Sam said, staring up.</p><p>Cold air poured into the room as a beautiful man dressed in sky-blue velvet lowered himself into the room from a gap in the ceiling panels. The ageless face had not changed, nor had the perfect proportions of his long, lean body. From the pristine suede of his shoes to the gentle waves of his caramel-colored hair, he might have been a living work of art.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dani shoved Samantha behind her. \u201cMy \u2013 my lord, it is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt long last, we meet again, my pearl.\u201d His lovely tenor seemed to make the air quiver. \u201cI must say, you have not made my pursuit a leisurely one.\u201d He eyed Samantha with interest. \u201cDo introduce me to this delicious-looking Amazon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the woman who\u2019s about to kick your ass,\u201d Sam replied, drawing her weapon.</p><p>Donatien produced a smile so heart-breaking that Dani gasped. \u201cBeautiful, spirited, and armed. Delightful.\u201d</p><p>Dani reached out to him. \u201cShe is nothing, no one. I will come with you, my lord, and do whatever you want. Only leave her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Dani,\u201d Sam snapped, aiming for Donatien\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cOf course you will, my pearl. That was never in doubt.\u201d He approached Samantha, ignoring her warnings and smiling until she fired three times. \u201cNow, dearest, someone should have told you about my fondness for copper.\u201d He reached into his jacket and pulled out the flattened rounds, one by one, as if they had come from a pocket instead of the wall of his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve acquired something of a tolerance for it since the last time I died, so shooting me will only make holes in my jacket.\u201d He caught Samantha in mid-lunge and lifted her by the throat with one hand, pressing his other to her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dani begged. \u201cNot to her.\u201d</p><p>Donatien ignored her to whisper against Samantha\u2019s ear. \u201cSuch painful old wounds, Detective. And you, allergic to morphine. How you must have suffered.\u201d</p><p>Samantha uttered a sharp cry, doubling over when he released her. She groaned, clutching herself as she fell to her knees.</p><p>\u201cA newly-made Kyn, still vulnerable to talent. You would be Lucan\u2019s sygkenis, Samantha Brown.\u201d Donatien gave the top of the detective's head a fond pat before he addressed Dani. \u201cYou need not look so frightened, child. You know how much regard I have for you. Why, I wouldn't harm a single hair on your sweet head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me, but leave her, I beg you.\u201d Dani went to kneel before him, knowing he enjoyed that, hoping it would appease him. \u201cI am the one you came for, my lord. Take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd leave behind a prize like the suzerain\u2019s sygkenis? She will serve as our passport to anywhere.\u201d Donatien grabbed Samantha by a fistful of her hair and dragged her to her feet. \"Did you enjoy the Spaniard last night, my pearl?\u201d he asked Dani. \u201cI thought he might remind you of old times.\u201d</p><p>Something cold and dreadful settled over Dani. \u201cYou came here last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to supervise your satisfaction, dearest.\u201d As Samantha groaned, he glanced at the bed. \u201cIt was not as imaginative as it should have been, given my contribution, but something kept undoing my best efforts to inspire you.\u201d He shoved Samantha at Dani. \u201cYour gift, I presume. It does spoil so many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not make Rafael desire me.\u201d She placed her hand on Samantha\u2019s abdomen, but felt no physical wounds inside. \u201cYou could not. He is like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite right. What I made you do, my pearl, was feel his natural desire for you so acutely that you had no choice but to fuck him. I\u2019m sure he was quite overcome by your passion.\u201d The scent of dead fires choked the air as his eyes lost their focus. \u201cIt was why they killed me, you know, my pet. Pure, petty jealousy. I was beauty incarnate, and then I was beauty immortal. They knew no human or Kyn could resist me.\u201d He smiled and lowered his voice to a murmur. \u201cNow I will have both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafael resisted,\u201d Dani guessed. \u201cDidn\u2019t he? That\u2019s why you want him. Because he rejected you.\u201d</p><p>Donatien slapped her. \u201cNo one refuses me.\u201d</p><p>Samantha clutched at Dani, jerking as if being tugged by a string.</p><p>\u201cYou see? It is so simple to stir desire, even where there was none.\u201d He gestured toward Samantha, whose body shook. She put stiff arms around Dani and kissed her with cold, unmoving lips.</p><p>Dani hugged the other woman, looking into her horrified eyes. \u201cI know,\u201d she whispered against Sam\u2019s lifeless mouth. \u201cIt is him, not you. Don't fight him, he will only hurt you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, dearest, you\u2019re interfering with my pleasure again,\u201d Donatien told Dani. \u201cI do wish we had time for more than a mere kiss \u2013 I wager her mouth would look very fetching pressed between your legs \u2013 but the plane to Buenos Aires leaves in few hours.\u201d He clapped his hands together, and a brown-haired man and redheaded woman came into the room. \u201cEscort our new friends downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking us?\u201d Dani demanded, struggling against the man\u2019s tight hold. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do have to perform a penance before we return to Argentina, my pearl,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere better than in a convent?\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>Lucan was not the best tracker among the Kyn \u2013 Gabriel Seran had long held that distinction \u2013 but after spending most of his lengthy existence hunting his own kind, he could pick up any Kyn scent with little effort. Discovering that Donatien no longer shed scent proved no impediment, as the Marquis never traveled alone. It only took a few moments for Lucan to find the acrid, sour trail of two humans teetering on the brink of rapture. How like the Marquis to drain his companions to the point of near-death, and then leave them there, imprisoned by the pain and terror induced by his talent, too weak from blood loss to do anything but serve and endure.</p> <p>Bastard.</p><p>Tracking the human female and male Donatien had recently enslaved led Lucan directly across the city, to the cluster of hotels and clubs catering to the needs of the young, moneyed and bored. The trail ended at Club Dominion, and there, standing beneath it and holding court among a dozen human patrons waiting to enter the club was his seneschal, Rafael.</p><p>A faint halo of golden light surrounded Rafael \u2013 light, Lucan knew, that would be completely blinding to any human eye \u2013 as well as the sweet, pervasive scent of orange blossoms.</p><p>The humans weren\u2019t waiting to enter the club. Rafael had shed a massive amount of scent, using l\u2019attrait to bespell them. As he drew closer, Lucan saw the reason why he had also drawn on his talent to blind the humans. Someone had barred the open doors of the club by hanging the decapitated body of a female in front of it.</p><p>Lucan joined his seneschal in front of the gruesome display. \u201cA gift from Donatien?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA message. He left her head in my apartment.\u201d Rafael stared at the dead girl\u2019s torso. Her blouse had been neatly cut off from the bottom of her breasts to the top of her mound. An elegant hand had written on it in blood:</p><p>If you truly wish to see the light, Rafael, you must bleed for the sins of the world. Annuciata \u2013 I will begin killing them at midnight.</p><p>\u201cThis has to end.\u201d Lucan turned and concentrated, and the scent of jasmine grew thick. \u201cGo home,\u201d he told the waiting humans. \u201cDo not return here again.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the crowd shuffled off to their cars.</p><p>Rafael took out a dagger, cut the rope tied under the dead woman\u2019s breasts, and carried the body into the club.</p><p>Lucan followed, and saw several patrons were all sitting quietly at their tables, staring at the band on stage. The musicians stood bound by spiked chains to their instruments, garish spot lights illuminating their blank faces.</p> <p>The thick odor of fresh blood drew him to the nearest table. The two girls sitting at it were motionless, their eyes unblinking. They were alive, their pulses regular, but their hands had been nailed to the top of the table. At the next table, a young man and his date were tied to their chairs with razor wire.</p><p>Lucan looked at his seneschal. \u201cHe\u2019s been at all of them.\u201d</p><p>Rafael placed the body in the stock room before he came out and bolted the doors. Lucan worked quickly with him to free the humans from the various, ghastly methods Donatien had used to restrain them, and coax them back to semi-consciousness. Women and men began to huddle together and weep.</p><p>\u201cI will go with you to the convent,\u201d Lucan said once they had freed the last of the patrons, and suggested through l\u2019attrait that they forget what had happened while they sought out medical treatment for their wounds. \u201cWhere is Samantha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stayed behind at the apartment with Daniela. Burke sent men to help escort her to a safer location.\u201d His mobile phone rang, and he answered it. \u201cSuarez.\u201d With a frown, he switched it to speaker. \u201cSamantha? Say that again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, we\u2019re okay,\u201d Samantha said, her voice filled with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m taking Dani back to the convent. Can you meet me there? There\u2019s been a ten twenty-two, and I could use a hand with it.\u201d</p><p>His seneschal froze. \u201cI\u2019ll be there shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, thanks. See you.\u201d The line clicked off.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lucan demanded.</p><p>\u201cSamantha was warning me,\u201d Rafael said. \u201c\u2018Ten twenty-two\u2019 is radio code for \u2018disregard the last assignment.\u2019 It\u2019s a trap.\u201d</p><p>Light bulbs and glasses all around the club began exploding.</p><p>\u201cHe took her,\u201d Lucan said, hearing nothing but the roar of blood in his head. \u201cGod damn it, he has her.\u201d He started for the door, only to be brought up short by a hard hand on his arm. He stared at Rafael in amazement. \u201cYou dare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d his seneschal said flatly. \u201cWe will summon the men and have them surround the convent. I will go in alone.\u201d</p><p>Lucan stared at him. \u201cIf you expect me to wait outside and do nothing while you have a polite t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with that lunatic, think again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no plans to negotiate with Donatien, my lord,\u201d Rafael said. \u201cIt will be a simple, even exchange. Me for Samantha, Daniela and the rest of the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Lucan snarled. \u201cAm I to simply walk away and leave you to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d his seneschal said, \u201cI will finish this.\u201d</p><p>Dani held on to Samantha as Donatien escorted them inside the silent walls of the Annuciata. The women of the convent were nowhere to be seen, and the fear he had already killed them clutched at her throat, making it hard to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI think what I admire most about that cunt Marguerite was her ingenuity,\u201d Donatien said as he brought them into the convent\u2019s main work room, where the nuns had once spent years sort and mending donations of used clothing for the poor. Neat, ominous rows of garden tools, cooking utensils and every knife from the kitchen covered the table top. \u201cYou had no religion when she took you from the village, did you?\u201d</p><p>Dani shook her head. The Father had had nothing but contempt for the church.</p><p>\u201cShe gave you a cause, my pearl, one well-suited to your particular abilities. How like a Catholic to teach you to worship an imaginary God while you cared for the victims of that faith.\u201d Donatien sat down in what had been the Mother Superior\u2019s chair at the head of the table and indicated the others to his right and left. \u201cDo be seated, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me now, my lord,\u201d Dani said as she lowered herself in the chair to his left. \u201cI will serve you willingly. I swear it. But if we do not leave this country quickly, your enemies will seek revenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only hope, my pearl.\u201d Donatien nodded to the redheaded woman, who opened the door to the adjoining storage room. In a single line, the women of the convent shuffled into the room. Each went to stand against the wall, their faces as empty as their eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you harm them,\u201d she promised, \u201cI will never serve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not flatter myself to think I can hold your loyalty, whatever may be my wishes in the matter. I must therefore resort to more drastic measures.\u201d He picked up a boning knife. \u201cIf you attempt to leave me again, I will forego my usual pleasures and begin killing every human I touch. Like so.\u201d Donatien placed a hand on the redhead's arm. She uttered a short, almost grateful cry, and blood poured from her mouth, nose and ears.</p><p>Dani ran to her, but by the time her body crumpled to the floor, she was dead. She held the woman's lifeless body in her arms and looked up at the smiling monster. \u201cI will stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see? We understand each other at last. Excellent.\u201d He took out a golden pocket watch and consulted it. \u201cMidnight has arrived, but I fear your lover has not. We must start the entertainment without him.\u201d He made a languid gesture.</p><p>Bridget came forward, moving as if in a daze. She began mechanically rolling up the sleeves of her robe.</p><p>\u201cThis one cuts herself, did you know that?\u201d Donatien asked in a conversational tone. \u201cVery cleverly, in fact, with small bits of razor blades concealed in the ends of her fingernails. She almost had me convinced, and I am not an easy man to deceive. Poor Crist\u00e1l. All this time, you have been wasting your talents on a pathetic self-mutilator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew she could hurt herself,\u201d Dani said, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cIt is not her fault. She is sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity you could not repair her mind as well as you have her little cuts.\u201d Donatien tossed the boning knife to Bridget, who caught and held it in a white-knuckled fist. \u201cThe wrists first, I think, dearest. You\u2019ll last longer that way.\u201d</p><p>Dani saw Bridget drag the blade across her arm and bolted out of her chair. Before she could reach the woman, Donatien caught her by her hair and dragged her back, holding her at his side.</p><p>\u201cShe loves the pain,\u201d he whispered against Dani\u2019s cheek. \u201cIt makes her feel alive inside. It even arouses her. Look at her eyes. See how bright they are? By the time she makes the third cut, she\u2019ll orgasm for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d a cold voice said from behind them. \u201cI have come, as you commanded.\u201d</p><p>Donatien turned to smile at Rafael. \u201cMy old friend, the emissary of cognac.\u201d He released Dani\u2019s hair. \u201cHow delighted I am to see you after so many years.\u201d</p><p>Dani took advantage of the distraction to go to Bridget and tear the knife out of her grip. She clamped her hand over the woman\u2019s bleeding wrist, pouring herself into the wound as quickly as she could.</p><p>\u201cI come with an offer of trade for safe passage,\u201d Rafael said.</p><p>Donatien\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cNow I am intrigued.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy master Lucan has agreed to end my service to him,\u201d Rafael said to Donatien. \u201cRelease the women, and I will make my oath to you now. I will take you to any destination you wish, establish your household and, if you desire, gather a jardin to serve you. I swear this on my honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be my seneschal? What a provocative idea.\u201d Donatien glanced at Samantha. \u201cAlas, I have become quickly enamored of my fierce Amazon. Perhaps I will send her back to him someday, but I cannot surrender my new jewel now.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWhat else do you offer, emissary?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rafael opened his jacket, revealing a vest covered with wired sticks of dynamite. He held out his hand to display a remote device, a button on which his thumb had pressed down. \u201cRelease Samantha and the other women now, or I will detonate the explosives. There are enough strapped to me to obliterate everyone in this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear boy, I am impressed.\u201d Donatien leaned against the table, striking a beautiful pose. \u201cYou are, of course, bluffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy master\u2019s order were explicit,\u201d Rafael told him. \u201cSamantha is his sygkenis. If he can not have her, no one will.\u201d</p> <p>Donatien chuckled. \u201cThat sounds more like the Lucan I remember. But what of your little lover, Emissary? Are you ready to sacrifice her on the altar of honor as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the one responsible for poisoning you,\u201d Rafael replied. \u201cI am Kyn, and not easily killed. You can spend eternity taking out your vengeance on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dani walked slowly toward Rafael. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Her wrist throbbed, and she felt her flesh parting and blood welling.</p><p>\u201cListen to your sweetheart, Rafael,\u201d Donatien said. \u201cDo as I wish, and you and I can spend eternity playing with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniela.\u201d Rafael met her gaze for a long, sorrowful instant.</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered as she reached out and took Donatien\u2019s cold hand in hers.</p><p>\u201cMy pearl, don\u2019t be afraid. He is all... talk and...\u201d a frown marred his perfect features as he tried to take his hand from hers and discovered that he couldn\u2019t break her hold. \u201cCrist\u00e1l? What are you doing, child?\u201d</p><p>Dani took his other hand in hers, and looked into his puzzled eyes. \u201cWhat I was made to do.\u201d She closed her eyes.</p><p>He felt her then, and struggled, jerking at her hands. \u201cNo. You are gifted, pet, but this is too ambitious. You cannot.\u201d</p><p>From a distance Dani heard Rafael call her name in a terrible voice, and felt his hands wrench at hers. But even with his vampire strength, he could not break the connection between her and the monster.</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off me,\u201d Donatien ordered in a thick, ugly voice. \u201cStop this. Stop this immediately, I command you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Dani opened her eyes. Donatien\u2019s face began to wither, his cheeks contracting, his lovely mouth thinning, his eyes sinking back into his head. His flawless skin grew mottled as capillaries burst and formed an ugly red web around his nose and across his cheeks. His teeth, bared now, darkened from flawless white to a stained, chipped yellow. Clumps of his caramel hair began to drift to the floor as patches of bare scalp sprouted on his head. Beneath his clothing, muscles thinned and shrank, and bones creaked and snapped.</p><p>Tiny dots appeared all over him; particles of copper being pushed out of the pores of his skin. They rained on the floor, reddish-orange dust.</p><p>Dani had never held on so long, but she did not let go until she felt the last of the copper and the strength leave Donatien\u2019s body. Then she stepped back away from the stooped, skeletal thing he had become.</p><p>\u201cAshes to ashes,\u201d Donatien croaked in an impossibly ancient voice. \u201cDust to dust. My pearl, you have... undone me.\u201d</p><p>His body collapsed in on itself, a house of forgotten cards. The body she had healed was too old and fragile to sustain itself now. He had cheated the grave too long, and Death came to grind him under its heel. In less time than it took for Rafael to disconnect the explosives strapped to his body, what had been Le Marquis de Sade lay in a crumpled pile of velvet, bone and ash.</p><p>Dani knew she didn\u2019t have much time left; what she had taken into herself would soon take over her. \u201cRafael.\u201d She smiled as he came to her and took her face between his hands. \u201cIt was not him last night. It was you, and it was me. Only us. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniela.\u201d He kissed her and held her against him, and shouted for someone. \u201cTell me what to do. What will happen to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must go now.\u201d She had already slipped the knife from his belt. One small push, and it slid between her ribs and into her heart as gently as a lover\u2019s sigh. \u201cBe happy.\u201d</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cI remember doing this,\u201d Lucan said as he watched Rafael tuck the sheets around Daniela's motionless body. \u201cI was about to give up when she finally came back to me.\u201d</p><p>Rafael sat down beside the bed and rubbed his eyes. \u201cWith all due respect, my lord? Go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy friend, I will give you as much time as you need with her,\u201d Lucan said. \u201cBut she absorbed the whole of Donatien into herself. I do not think Christ himself could have shouldered such a burden.\u201d</p><p>The door closed, and Rafael was alone again with her. Alone and waiting, as he had for three weeks. She had healed from what had been a mortal wound, but she had not transitioned to Kyn as Samantha had. Still human, Daniela would drink and swallow soft foods, and her natural body functions continued, but she remained locked in what seemed an endless sleep. He had tried entering her dreams, as he had on the night they had spent together, but her mind never again opened to him.</p><p>Soon he would have to make a decision, Rafael knew that. He could not spend eternity waiting for Daniela to wake up. The women of the convent had offered to care for her. Perhaps it was meant to be.</p><p>Samantha paid the next visit. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo change.\u201d His voice sounded like stones grating together.</p><p>\u201cI finished running the background check on her,\u201d Samantha said as she came to the bed. \u201cNo birth records, no missing person reports, nothing. As far as Argentina is concerned, she doesn\u2019t exist. I did better with the dream about the compound, though.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cIt was real?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI had a guy I know over at University of Miami get in touch with an archeologist working down there. He went looking in the area you described and he found the compound and the hidden entrance under the shed. You\u2019re never going to guess who \u2018the Father\u2019 was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoseph Mengele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw photos of him on the wall, in the dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that spoils my big surprise. Seems after Mengele fled Europe to avoid prosecution for war crimes, he set up this place and spent years conducting experiments on the locals. According to the records they found, he took in mostly poor pregnant women. He was trying to genetically alter their unborn children. Only one baby survived. A little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrist\u00e1l. Patient six-one-two-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her.\u201d Samantha took Daniela's hand in hers. \u201cThere are some weird bits we can\u2019t explain. Like the fact that Crist\u00e1l\u2019s records indicate she was born on February seventh, nineteen sixty-one.\u201d She gazed down at the young, unlined face. \u201cYou know, if this is her, she looks pretty damn good for a forty-five year old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. The records must belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe remembers Mengele, and he died in nineteen seventy-nine, Rafael. That alone would put her in her mid-to-late thirties.\u201d Samantha looked thoughtful. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll leave you two alone. You might try the Sleeping Beauty cure. It\u2019s how Lucan brought me back to the land of the living.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t concentrate enough to decipher her meaning. \u201cSleeping Beauty cure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her you love her and kiss her, you dumb ass.\u201d Samantha grinned at him and left.</p><p>Rafael moved to sit next to Daniela on the bed. \u201cIs that all it would take? To tell you that I love you? I hardly know you.\u201d He bent close, and breathed in the scent of her skin. \u201cBut if you will come back to me, Daniela, I will love you. I know that in my heart now. We only need time together.\u201d</p><p>She did not stir.</p><p>\u201cDaniela, please. I cannot love a dream. I need you.\u201d He lifted her up into his arms. \u201cCome back to me now. Give me some hope.\u201d He put his mouth to hers, and kissed her, and felt the pulse of her heart under his lips.</p><p>Rafael held her for a long time, willing her to wake, but she remained in her dream world. He made her comfortable, turning her on her side so that bed sores wouldn\u2019t form on her back, and went to stand at the window to watch another sunrise alone.</p><p>He had responsibilities to Lucan, and to the humans he protected as a cop. He couldn\u2019t ignore them forever. If he put her in the care of the women of the convent, he could still visit her every day. He wouldn\u2019t give up on her. She had saved him from an eternity of suffering. He would never abandon her.</p><p>His face felt wet. It couldn\u2019t be. He had not wept in six hundred years.</p><p>\u201cRafael.\u201d A soft hand slipped into his, and Daniela was there, standing beside him, alive, awake, a dream come true.</p><p>He had to touch her to be sure. \u201cSleeping Beauty.\u201d He caressed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed I was hiding in the jungle. Someone wanted to catch me, but he couldn\u2019t, and then I think he finally went away.\u201d She yawned, as if she had done nothing more than wake from a long nap. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now,\u201d he said, and pulled her into his arms. </p> </body></html>"]
