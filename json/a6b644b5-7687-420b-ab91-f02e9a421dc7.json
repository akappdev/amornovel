It turns out, Olivia is very competitive. Jackson had bet her a hundred dollars she couldn\u2019t land a hit on me. Determined to prove him wrong, she dons a pair of gloves and climbs into the boxing ring with me. Her gorgeous green eyes flare at me from underneath her thick, dark eyelashes and she smiles playfully before pouncing at me. Swiftly, I step out of the way and tap her shoulder. She whips around to face me and her dark hair follows suit, whirling around her sexily before gliding across the top of her breasts. I drag my gaze from her chest to her face. Olivia\u2019s playful expression is now pinched in frustration. She actually thought this would be easy...Jackson and Darryl laugh on the sidelines, pissing her off even more.</p> <p>\u201cYou underestimate me.\u201d I chuckle at her, bringing back her smile.</p><p>God, I love making her smile.</p><p>She pounces at me again and I sidestep, like last time and I keep my fists up even though I don\u2019t intend to use them on her.</p><p>\u201cAre you running from me, Seth?\u201d she teases, trying to get a reaction out of me. \u201cAre you scared I\u2019ll hurt you?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stop the laugh that rumbles through my chest. \u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d</p> <p>She arches an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified you\u2019ll hurt yourself in an attempt to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shakes her head, narrowing her eyes. She lunges forward, sending a very nice jab to my mid-section, but I flick my hips backward and her fist doesn\u2019t connect. She has me on the back foot now and she smiles as she springs forward. I hear Jackson swear under his breath, but I\u2019m not sweating it. He isn\u2019t going to lose a cent to Olivia and if she\u2019s not careful, she\u2019s going to get me in full force the second we\u2019re out of this ring. I wrap my arms around hers, pinning them to her side and I smile down at her as her tiny body struggles against me.</p><p>I feel my cock twitch and I try to calm myself by keeping my eyes on her face and not on the voluptuous mounds that press firmly against my chest. I don\u2019t know how she does it, but when I\u2019m around her it\u2019s like I\u2019m an out of control teenager who\u2019s never had sex with a girl before.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair.\u201d She growls, dropping her head against my chest and relaxing her body.</p><p>Jackson pulls on the thick ropes of the ring, whooping and cheering as I bury my nose in her hair and kiss her head.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe next time,\u201d I tell her, letting her go.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She steps back and holds her gloves out to me. \u201cCan you help me out of these?\u201d</p><p>Those seven words stir something wild inside of me\u2014and I have no idea why. I narrow it down to the fact it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had sex, thanks to Darryl and his rules. I don\u2019t think I can take another minute without putting my hands on her...or in her.</p><p>I glide my tongue across my bottom lip to moistening it, and Olivia watches closely. The sudden pink hue in her cheeks doesn\u2019t pass me by and I know she wants me as bad as I want her. I tug at the tape on my hands and un-wrap them with ease as Jackson and Darryl leave the boxing section and enter the training room, ready to start the rest of my training session. I\u2019m not going in there just yet. I\u2019m taking my girl to the shower and I\u2019m going to take care of her. I look at O, and her eyes lock onto mine as I pull on her gloves, freeing her hands. She catches her bottom lip between her teeth and inches closer, looking up at me through dark lashes. She\u2019s all but begging me to take her.</p><p>I tug her hand and pull her over to the edge of the ring. I stretch open the ropes, allowing her to slip through with ease and I follow closely behind her.</p><p>\u201cSeth? Where are you going?\u201d Darryl calls after me and I smile at him over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d</p><p>He swears under his breath. \u201cI put rules in place to help you, not me.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia glances over her shoulder at me and I nod for her to keep walking.</p><p>Despite Darryl\u2019s protest, I follow her to the female shower room. Inside, we enter a stall and lock it behind us. When we\u2019re alone in the gym, we shower in the open, but when there are other people around we shower in the stalls\u2014even if it\u2019s only Jackson and Darryl outside. I like that most about Olivia. She respects herself and me. The girls I\u2019m normally around were usually quick to flash their tits to anyone that walked by, but not my Olivia.</p><p>She\u2019s first to shed her clothing and I watch closely as she pulls her sports bra over her head, exposing her hard, pink nipples. It takes all of my strength to remain leaning against the wall and not to descend hungrily upon her, taking her hard, alluring peaks in my mouth. My gaze drops from her breasts to her hips as her fingers curl around her tiny, black shorts. I watch as she drags them down her long legs. My stare flits over her body, unsure what to focus on first. I enjoy all of it\u2014every pore, every hair follicle and freckle. It\u2019s mine.</p><p>She reaches for the cold tap and turns on the shower. Her entire body tenses as she stands directly under the cool stream.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re having a cold shower?\u201d I ask, unable to hold the snicker.</p><p>She shudders, letting the cold streams run down her body and making my blood burn.</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, how else am I going to make it through the day?\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps erupt over the surface of her skin, forcing her nipples to pebble. Ready to join her, I roughly tug my pants down and immediately I see her eyes drop to my length. I\u2019m so hard it aches all over, but I don\u2019t attempt to hide it from her. Her eyes flick to mine as she reaches for the shower handle and nudges it, making it that extra degree colder.</p><p>It\u2019s pointless for me to have a shower now, when I get out I\u2019ll have to start my other half of training, but I want to please her\u2014to satisfy her\u2014before she leaves here today. I saunter over to her and even over the roar of the shower I hear her breath catch in her throat. She trembles ever so slightly as I reach around her, inching the shower hotter and hotter, until steam begins to fill the stall around us. I want her hot and flustered. I want her to beg me to fuck her and to make her come. I lean in close, pressing every inch of my body against hers until her back is pressed firmly against the cold concrete. I lower my mouth to her neck, licking her slowly.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Seth,\u201d she moans in my ear.</p><p>Fucking hell.</p><p>I pull back to look her in the eyes and rest my forehead against hers. Water streams over our heads, trailing down our skin and flowing off the sharp edges of our faces. Her green irises burn at me from underneath her dark lashes and they\u2019re begging me to devour her as her hands glide up the ridges of my arms and over my shoulders before stopping around my neck. Slowly, she moves her mouth toward mine and when her supple, pink lips press against me, I lose it. I need to have her and no rules are going to stop me. I force my tongue between her lips and she willingly opens her mouth. She roughly rakes her fingers through my hair, urging me harder against her and I slide my hands down the curve of her hips, gripping her bare ass. She moans into my mouth as she hitches a delicious thigh around my hip. My cock presses eagerly against her warm, slick slit and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to stop now.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she gasps against my lips, flexing her hips toward me. \u201cPlease, just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d I ask her, smiling. \u201cYou want to feel me inside you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathes, catching my lip between her teeth. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I reach down and position myself right where I want to be and I enter her slowly, knowing that if I go too fast this will all be over before it even begins. She feels so good\u2014beyond good\u2014and a low, guttural moan releases itself from my throat. I feel the walls of her soft pussy squeeze the very tip of my cock and it pulses in response. It\u2019s been too long since I\u2019ve indulged in her.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d A familiar deep voice echoes around the room and Olivia releases my lip as her body goes rigid.</p><p>I shut my eyes briefly, begging God\u2014or whoever the fuck was listening\u2014to make Darryl go away.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an MMAC promoter here. He wants to talk to the owner and the manager of the gym about advertising.\u201d Darryl calls over the roar of the shower and Olivia bites her bottom lip against a giggle as a pink hue flashes across her cheeks. \u201cSo both of you animals need to put some clothes on and get out here.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy exhale I reach around her, turning the hot tap off and submerging us both in cold water. The water connects with my flesh and Olivia and I jump, pressing ourselves harder against each other as the water washes our heated session down the drain, taking my erection with it. Well, it was fun while it lasted. A wide smile spreads over Olivia\u2019s lips and her hands shoot up to cover it as giggles erupt from her. I guess we\u2019re going to have to wait.</p><p>We emerge from the shower room, our fingers tightly laced together and when we enter the main room, Darryl gives us a quick once over with a small shake of his head. Olivia\u2019s fingers tighten around mine and I glance down at her. She looks up at me briefly, flashing me an uneasy, embarrassed smile. In response, I give her my best \u2018we didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2019 smile and she nods ever so slightly. Fuck Darryl for making her feel so uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cSeth Marc?\u201d</p><p>My gaze falls onto the tall guy in the suit who called my name. He quickly moves toward us, giving Olivia an overt twice over that makes me clench my jaw. He reminds me of Mason\u2014blue eyes, golden hair, and clearly interested in my girl. The man extends his hand to me and I reluctantly pull away from Olivia to shake it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mike Sullivan. It\u2019s nice to finally meet you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019s finished with me, he moves on to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Miss James.\u201d He greets her, pulling her hand into his and giving it a long, slow shake.</p><p>My eyes flick onto Darryl, who\u2019s regarding me with clear warning in his eyes and I frown at him. He needs to relax. I\u2019m not going to hurt this guy for shaking Olivia\u2019s hand, but if he looks at her like that again I can\u2019t make any guarantees.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you,\u201d he says, dropping her hand. \u201cI wanted to talk to you both about your advertising campaign. Now, I know this gym is Seth Marc\u2019s official gym, but the MMAC wants the whole world to know that. Outside in the truck I have one billboard, two banners, six life-sized cut outs, and hundreds of flyers. All I need from you two is a signature and we\u2019ll start setting it all up today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Seth needs big pictures of himself everywhere.\u201d Jackson snickers, strolling over from the training room.</p><p>Beside me, Olivia laughs once. \u201cJackson\u2019s right,\u201d she says, lacing her fingers with mine again. \u201cSeth\u2019s ego is high enough.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as everyone chuckles at my expense. I don\u2019t have a high ego. I\u2019m just confident. I know what I want and how to get it, that\u2019s all. Sue me. Mike hands Olivia a clipboard and a pen and she signs it. I do the same, and Mike exits the gym to tell the guys to bring in the stuff.</p><p>Olivia turns to me. \u201cI have to go help Mom with a few things around the house, but I\u2019ll see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>She seems almost disappointed and I smile. She hates leaving me for entire nights at a time, but we made the decision to not sleep at each other\u2019s houses...fucking Darryl.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>She glances sideways at Darryl and then back at me before reaching up and planting a soft kiss on my cheek. My eyes narrow as she turns away. What the fuck was that? If I\u2019m not seeing her until tomorrow there\u2019s no way she\u2019s getting away with a pussy kiss like that one. If I\u2019m going to stay away, I need a kiss that will keep me sated. I snatch at her, my fingers wrapping around her tiny elbow, and I force her back to me. She doesn\u2019t have time to react before I slam my mouth against hers. Instantly, she melts against me, running her hands around my neck and into the base of my hair. I lick her lip and with a small smile, she opens her mouth to me. Blood rushes to my head as her tongue slides against mine, massaging me with confidence, like no one is watching. Keeping in mind that people are in fact watching, I pull away with the smallest nip to her bottom lip and lean into her ear.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me later, call me.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slide down my neck and across my chest before gliding up and down my arms. Her touch electrifies me...the things I would do right now if no one was watching.</p><p>\u201cI always need you,\u201d she replies, her voice barely a whisper. \u201cBut we\u2019re doing this for Darryl.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my cheek and turns away from me. I place my hands on my hips and unashamedly watch her back, her ass, and her legs as she walks away. She\u2019s mine...and I can\u2019t even have her.</p><p>Mike comes back through the door as Olivia exits and he glances over his shoulder at her ass for a second too long. I\u2019ve never been jealous before, but there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the possessive anger twisting deep in my chest is exactly that. I step forward, but Darryl\u2019s voice stops me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cSeth, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mike approaches me, oblivious to my aggressive stance and I clench my jaw. There\u2019s a small smile on his lips and I want to smash it through his skull. I imagine smacking him around a little bit, until he\u2019s crying and begging me to leave him alone. And then I\u2019ll hit him some more.</p><p>\u201cDo you like to box, Mike?\u201d I ask, my fingers flexing involuntarily at my sides.</p><p>Beside me, I hear Jackson chuckle and swear under his breath.</p><p>Mike glances awkwardly around the gym and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbles up and down as he swallows hard. \u201cUh, sure. When I have time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My lips twitch as he gives me the exact answer I want. \u201cDo you want to spar with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d Darryl warns me again, but I pretend I don\u2019t hear him. There\u2019s no harm in a little friendly sparring, right?</p><p>Mike checks his watch. \u201cUh, I guess we have a little time.\u201d</p> <p>I pivot on my heel and saunter over to the ring, trying my hardest not to appear too eager to box this fucking guy into the ground.</p><p>\u201cSeth, you have a full half of training to get through and you\u2019ve already sparred today,\u201d Darryl says, following closely behind me.</p><p>I ignore him again. He isn\u2019t going to talk me out of this. I\u2019ll only hit him twice\u2014once for giving Olivia a creepy twice over right in front of me and once for shamelessly looking at her ass, again right in front of me.</p><p>Mike sheds his jacket and Jackson helps him into a pair of gloves. I grab my own gloves and slip them on as Darryl leans into me.</p><p>\u201cSeth, you\u2019re wasting energy. Who cares if he looked at your girl, she\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he says, his voice hushed so Mike doesn\u2019t hear.</p> <p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I reply. \u201cBut if someone is going to look at my girl while I\u2019m holding her hand and he can clearly see she\u2019s mine, then there are consequences.\u201d To me, disrespect doesn\u2019t come any clearer than that.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear yourself? You sound crazy.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. Sometimes I wonder if Darryl knows me at all. \u201cI am crazy, Darryl. Now, you either let me smack this guy or I\u2019m going home to Olivia to break your rule six times in a row.\u201d</p><p>His thick, dark eyebrows rise to his hairline. \u201cSix times? Really, Seth?\u201d Darryl pinches his thin nose. \u201cYou\u2019re a piece of work, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it.\u201d I smile, sliding into the ring.</p><p>\u201cTwo hits. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>I nod and he hands me my head gear, but I don\u2019t take it. This guy won\u2019t get a hit on me.</p><p>\u201cWear your gear,\u201d Darryl demands, but I shake my head.</p><p>I shrug him off. \u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>He swears under his breath, dropping the head gear and mouth guard before storming away. Poor Darryl, he\u2019s always putting up with my shit. I bring my attention to the ring and watch as Jackson holds open the ropes while Mike climbs in. He has his full gear on and I smile because he\u2019s definitely going to need it. I put my fists up and he follows suit. I\u2019ve never seen a more unintimidating opponent in my life.</p><p>I take my steps slow, inching closer to him and analyzing his face. His blue eyes are narrowed in on me, determined to get at least one hit. Abruptly, I launch forward, catching him off-guard and slamming my gloved fist into his stomach. Air flies from his lungs and he hunches over with a loud grunt. I step back, giving him time to catch his breath. His face turns red as he struggles to refill his lungs and I smile. I actually fucking smile at his pain. Jackson is on the sideline laughing his ass off and slapping the ring with the palms of his hands. Jackson loves this because he\u2019d do the exact same thing for Selena\u2014hell\u2014Jackson would have punched Mike\u2019s teeth through his head if his eyes lingered on his girl\u2019s face for a second too long. He\u2019s protective\u2014borderline controlling\u2014and that\u2019s not just in general, but when it comes to sex as well. I\u2019ve seen his bedroom, the weird straps and chains and whips...it scares the shit out of me. I\u2019m all for taking control in the bedroom and getting what I want, but Jackson...he needs it. If he isn\u2019t in control he can\u2019t handle it and he can\u2019t finish.</p><p>Mike straightens his posture and brings his fists back up to his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming...\u201d He groans.</p><p>That was the point. I smile, lurching forward again. I swing my fist and it connects with the side of his face. With a grunt, his head is tossed to the side and he falls flat on his ass. Well... that was quicker than I expected. I pull my gloves off and toss them across the ring. Despite my disgust with Mike, I extend my hand and help him to his feet. I\u2019m not a total asshole. He cringes, shaking his head and clasping his stomach.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is the reason why I\u2019m on the promoting side of the MMAC,\u201d he jokes with a nervous chuckle.</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d I drop his hand and turn from him. For a second, I wish he was a fighter. Then I could go against him and punish him to my full potential. He\u2019s lucky I hit him with my full-pad gloves on.</p><p>I slip from the ring, letting Mike gather his broken pride in peace. Then he needed to get back to work so he can finish quickly and get the hell out of my gym. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll go so easy on him next time.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Olivia</p><p>(T-minus six days until Las Vegas)</p><p>I tap my fingers along my arm, waiting for my alarm to go off. I\u2019ve been up for a while, and if I\u2019m being honest, I don\u2019t think I had much sleep last night. Since the gym with Seth (more specifically, the shower room), my brain and my body have been conspiring against me. My brain refuses to dish out any rational thoughts or responses and the only thing I\u2019ve managed to think about is Seth\u2019s hard body and hard...everything else. As for my body, I can\u2019t keep still. It constantly has me moving and squirming, working with the less-than-wholesome thoughts my brain comes up with. My alarm blares its annoying beep and I roll over and slapping the stop button.</p><p>Can girls get blue balls? I roll my eyes at myself, there I go again. In a huff, I sit up and push the blanket down my legs. I rake my fingers through my hair and then over my face. Seth told me to call him if I need him (and boy, do I need him) but I can\u2019t, for Darryl\u2019s sake. Darryl wants one last shot at training Seth his way before the MMAC officials start dictating the way he trains Seth. I don\u2019t want to be the one to take that away from him. Besides, it\u2019s only three more weeks until his fight and then Seth and I can do whatever the hell we want to each other. Oh, the endless possibilities. Vividly in my mind, I run my tongue up his chest, feeling all of his muscles tremble beneath my mouth. A soft knock taps on my bedroom door, startling me from my thoughts. I shake my head. I barely made it two seconds before I started thinking about him again. I slide from my bed and stretch my hands up to the ceiling, arching my back like a cat.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d I yawn, dropping my arms and pulling my tiny shirt down.</p><p>It does nothing to really cover my belly button and if I lift my arms any higher, I\u2019m sure the bottoms of my breasts will pop out. Mom\u2019s face peers around the edge of my door and she smiles warmly at me. \u201cI made breakfast.\u201d</p><p>As she finishes her sentence, the delightful smell of butter and fresh toast filters into my nostrils, making my stomach grumble. I smile back at her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Mom is slowly coming back to herself. After the unexpected death of my father eight weeks ago, things got pretty hectic with Mom. With every passing day she began to break\u2014just a chip at a time\u2014until she emotionally broke down. For her, I moved back in. The thought of her alone in the family home with all of the photos and memories of her dead husband crushed me. It isn\u2019t all selfless; moving back in also helped Seth keep his hands off me, although there\u2019s been more than one occasion where he\u2019s forced himself on me with my mother in the next room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make my bed and be right out.\u201d</p><p>With a swift nod, she closes the door. I pull my hair over one shoulder and tap my index finger on my bare hip as I glance around the room. Maybe today is the day I take all of my things out of their boxes. All of my big items, like my fridge, bed, and couches are currently sitting in a storage shed somewhere, but everything else is packed in boxes and stacked in this room. There\u2019s no space for anything and I have no idea where to start. I exhale and shrug my shoulders. I\u2019ll deal with the boxes tomorrow, I think for the fifth consecutive day in a row.</p><p>I stroll from my room, enjoying the feel of the cool tiles on the base of my warm feet as I enter the dining room and drop into a chair. Mom definitely went overboard this morning\u2014fruit salad, yogurt, toast with melted butter, pancakes, and various cereals.</p><p>\u201cExpecting company?\u201d I ask, reaching for a bowl.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I figured we could take our time and chat, you know, like we used to when you were younger.\u201d</p><p>Although I have things to do, I scoop fruit salad into my bowl anyway. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>A wide smile curls her lips and she pulls two pieces of buttered toast onto her plate.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are things with the gym?\u201d</p><p>I almost flinch. Mom never talks about the gym, in fact, whenever Seth and I discuss it, she leaves the room.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say cautiously. \u201cThey\u2019re putting Seth\u2019s billboards up today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are things with him?\u201d</p><p>I put a piece of fresh, juicy apple in my mouth. \u201cGreat. He\u2019s training for his first pro fight in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>As I finish my sentence, there\u2019s a knock at the front door and Mom rises to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s the delivery man with the new set of curtains I ordered online. They were meant to be here two days ago.\u201d</p><p>She disappears around the corner and I hear the front door open. The deep voice that rumbles through the house and sticks to me like humid air on a hot summer\u2019s night is definitely not the voice of a delivery man, but the voice of the man that has kept me sexually frustrated for the past few weeks. Mom comes back into the kitchen and sure enough, Seth is trailing behind her. I abruptly close my lips around a slice of mango to stop from gasping out loud. He still has that affect on me...Seth has one of those faces that make your heart stutter and stop before picking up speed at an erratic pace. His gaze falls onto me and then drops to my tiny shirt. He flicks the thin toothpick over his bottom lip before they curl into a lopsided smirk and I subtly cross my arms over my chest as my nipples harden. Suddenly, I feel very exposed in my short top and tiny satin shorts.</p><p>\u201cLook who has joined us for breakfast,\u201d Mom deadpans.</p><p>She\u2019s never happy with Seth\u2019s random appearances, even when he brings her flowers on Saturdays.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her,\u201d I tell him, laughing. \u201cShe\u2019s just upset you\u2019re not a pair of curtains.\u201d</p><p>Seth chuckles as he lowers himself into the seat next to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, Seth?\u201d Mom asks. \u201cI\u2019ve made more than enough food.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes scan the table and I know he\u2019s fighting the urge to respond with an obvious, smart ass comment. Instead of antagonizing my mom this early in the morning, Seth removes his toothpick and says. \u201cA little more fruit wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>I slide my bowl over to Seth and grab another one, filling it with fruit for myself. The kettle clicks in the kitchen and Mom turns her back to us to prepare a coffee. The moment her back is turned, I feel Seth\u2019s rough hand on my inner thigh sliding higher and higher until the very tips of his fingers brush against my warm center. White-hot arousal surges through me and I almost choke on my mango. Mom glances over her shoulder, but Seth doesn\u2019t remove his hand as he brings a glass of water to his mouth and I hear him quietly chuckle into his glass.</p><p>\u201cChew your fruit, Olivia,\u201d she tells me, turning back to her coffee.</p><p>Seth\u2019s finger curls around the hem of my shorts and stops abruptly when he realizes I\u2019m not wearing underwear. He lowers his glass.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>The boxes in my room have blocked my underwear drawer and I used my last pair of available clean ones yesterday. Truth be told, when I decided to skip on underwear last night after my shower, I wasn\u2019t expecting Seth to show up at breakfast and try to stroke me while my mother\u2019s back is turned. I glance sideways at Seth and he\u2019s staring at me, his eyes thinned into lusty slits. His tongue flicks out to moisten his bottom lip and I find myself staring at it, watching it closely. If I could just feel that tongue between my legs for five minutes\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat are your plans today?\u201d he asks me, his eyes flaring.</p><p>I look at his eyes. Fuck. I wasn\u2019t planning on seeing Seth until late this afternoon so I made plans to go down to Mason\u2019s office to pick up my last paycheck from months ago.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d I drop my sight to my bowl and shovel fruit into my mouth. Seth grows weary as I chew and swallow, buying myself more time. \u201cI was planning on going down to Mason\u2019s office and picking up a few of my things.\u201d I tell him like it\u2019s no big deal.</p><p>Seth frowns, taking his hand away from me and I feel strangely bare without his fingers there. \u201cA few of your things?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, hoping it doesn\u2019t betray the anxious feeling I have inside. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve been ignoring him for the last eight weeks, just like you wanted me to, but I need my last paycheck and there\u2019s a photo of Dad I had on my desk that I would like back.\u201d</p><p>Mom glances over her shoulder at us, eavesdropping. I really don\u2019t want to have this conversation around her. I know how Seth feels about Mason. We\u2019ve had this discussion a million times before, and according to him, he isn\u2019t worried I\u2019ll sleep with Mason, he\u2019s worried Mason will sleep with me\u2014like that makes any sense. I slide my chair back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get dressed, Mom, and then I\u2019ll come back and have some more food.\u201d</p><p>I slip past Seth, and as I stroll up the hallway, I hear his chair screech against the floor. I squeeze my eyes shut briefly. Here we go. I enter my room and Seth follows closely behind, shutting the door behind him. I walk straight over to my drawers and pull out a pair of jeans and a t-shirt while he pushes my boxes aside and searches in the mess of fabrics for a pair of underwear and a bra.</p><p>I wait patiently as he pushes past all of my lacy pretties and eventually throws me a black, cotton pair of underwear. I try not to smile at the fact that he chose the least revealing pair of underwear that I own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fucking Seth.</p><p>He leans against the wall, his leg bent at the knee and watches as I clip my bra around my stomach and pull my shirt off over my head. I quickly pull the bra up and slip my arms under the straps, adjusting it so it sits comfortably.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come with you?\u201d he asks.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Seth, you don\u2019t need to come with me. Darryl will be pissed if you\u2019re late for training.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms. \u201cAnd if Mason wants you to go back and work for him?\u201d</p><p>I slip my shorts down, ignoring the way Seth\u2019s eyes rake me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him no thank you, I already have a job and it allows me to stare at a certain sweaty, sexy man that I\u2019m particularly fond of all day.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitch and he pushes off the wall, sauntering closer to me. I feel my insides ripple with every step and my entire body tightens. I just want him to touch me, for Christ\u2019s sake! Is that so hard?! \u201cThat does sound like a good job.\u201d He smiles, sliding his hands onto the nape of my neck.</p> <p>\u201cThe best,\u201d I say, pressing my lips to his.</p><p>He groans, sliding a hand down my neck, down my navel and into my underwear. My breath hitches as his rough fingers press against my warmth and instantly, my new underwear is soaked. He pulls back, his eyes smoldering at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the odds of your mother walking in while I take care of you?\u201d My, my, there is a God after all.</p><p>There\u2019s a soft rap of knuckles on the door and Seth exhales, removing his hand and stepping back. Calm down girls, false alarm. There isn\u2019t a God.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I also made smoothies.\u201d Mom\u2019s voice calls through the wood. Smoothies? Now? I choke on a laugh as I pull a new shirt over my head. \u201cThanks, Mom!\u201d</p><p>God, she can be so awkward sometimes. I push my legs into my jeans, pull them up and button them. I reach for a hair tie off of my dresser and pull my hair up into a messy bun as I step past Seth and stroll from the room. Seth follows me, a little too closely for me to think straight and when we sit back in our seats, he leans across and kisses my cheek. I don\u2019t want to smile, but I can\u2019t help it and I end up grinning from ear to ear like the freaking Cheshire cat. Mom regards us curiously from across the table. \u201cSo I take it you two are still going okay?\u201d</p> <p>Seth laughs, slinging an arm over my shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look too down, Mrs. James. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Mom sips at her coffee, narrowing her eyes at him over the rim of her cup. Mom plays all \u2018cranky\u2019 and \u2018hard-to-please\u2019 when it comes to Seth, but deep down she loves him. She has to...because Dad did.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I sigh, after twenty minutes of silent eating. \u201cI have to go down to Mason\u2019s office and pick up a few things. When I come back, we can work on the garden, if you want.\u201d</p><p>Mom nods eagerly and a smile curls at her lips. \u201cThat would be wonderful. I bought these pink petunias and they\u2019ll look gorgeous in the front garden.\u201d</p><p>Dad always wanted to put pink petunias in the front garden, but Mom hated the thought of the pink clashing with her yellows. Now that he\u2019s gone, she wants to put the pink in the front...maybe it\u2019s to honor his memory, or maybe it\u2019s because she feels guilty. Either way, I\u2019m glad the thought of putting them in the front garden makes her happy. I push out from my chair and Seth follows suit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your car.\u201d He tells me\u2014not offers.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I slip into a pair of sandals by the door and pull my car keys off the hook. Seth holds the door open for me and I step out onto the patio. The morning air is refreshing and the golden, low-lying sun warms my skin while the cool breeze skims across it.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, you know. I could go down for you after training.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once at Seth wracking his brain to come up with anything to stop me from going down there. \u201cYeah, I can see that ending well.\u201d</p><p>His fingers lace with mine and we walk hand in hand down the crunchy, pebble path. Tension radiates off of him in waves\u2014I can see it in the way he walks and feel it in the extra-tight grip he has on my hand.</p><p>\u201cLook, Seth, I know how you feel about Mason, but you need to relax. I\u2019m going to be there five minutes tops.\u201d</p><p>His eyes search mine and after a couple long seconds, he drags in a deep inhale, expelling it from his nose. \u201cFine, but call me when you\u2019re done. Maybe we can grab lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Darryl and training?\u201d</p><p>Darryl has Seth training three times a day on most days now. It leaves little time for us to spend time together\u2014that\u2019s probably all part of Darryl\u2019s sick plan, too.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I\u2019ll sort it out.\u201d</p><p>I reach up and plant a quick kiss on his lips. Before I pull away, his fingers unexpectedly dig into the small of my back and he pulls me hard against him. His mouth drops to my neck and he pulls the skin between his full lips, sucking hard and eliciting an unintentional moan from me. The skin begins to sting and then it hits me, and I pull away abruptly. Seth releases me with an amused quirk of his lips and I take a few steps back.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I gasp, clenching my neck.</p><p>He runs his tongue over his bottom lip, like I\u2019m the most delicious thing he has ever tasted. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I mock him, making him smile at me. It\u2019s one of those \u2018I\u2019ll do whatever the fuck I want and you can\u2019t do a damn thing about\u2019 kind of smiles. It\u2019s the kind of smile that penetrates fabric and licks you right where your thighs meet, and it\u2019s because of that smile I can\u2019t be mad at him for wanting to leave his mark right where Mason will see it.</p><p>\u201cYou are such an animal,\u201d I protest, unsure how to react to him and his blatant possessiveness.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I glare at him, but it\u2019s a confused glare that battles against a smile. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a compliment.\u201d</p><p>He flicks an eyebrow. \u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>I whirl around on my heel, push through the side gate and onto the driveway. Seth leans against the small, white gate and watches me as I get in my car, clip in my seatbelt, and start her up. Before I put it in reverse and leave, I wind down my window. \u201cAre you going to the gym now?\u201d I ask out of curiosity.</p><p>If I need anything from him later, it\u2019ll be easier for me if I know where he is.</p><p>He smiles, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cI will in a little bit. I thought I\u2019d hang around here and annoy your Mom for a little while longer.</p><p>I roll my eyes and shake my head. \u201cSee you.\u201d</p><p>I back down the driveway and he waves once before I turn the corner and zoom away.</p><p>It feels weird driving to Mason\u2019s office. It has been such a long time since I\u2019ve been anywhere near it. I purposely avoid it for fear of running into him. We ended things on bad terms...and considering I\u2019m still doing the things that caused us to fight in the first place I don\u2019t think this is going to be easy. I pull up out front, happy there\u2019s a parking space available. I check my neck in the rear-view mirror and I sigh in relief when I see the love bite fading. I take a few moments to group my thoughts. I don\u2019t know why I feel so nervous\u2014then again, maybe it\u2019s not nerves...maybe it\u2019s guilt. I feel guilty because I was such a shit employee. I was a great employee before a certain someone came along. I arrived at work at the right times and never skipped days...then I met Seth and he turned my world upside down. I let him consume me, I let him take over every aspect of my life and I loved it. I love the way he makes me feel...taking a chance with him was worth more to me than working a nine to five job.</p><p>I let my head fall back against the headrest and take two deep breaths. Might as well get this over and done with. I unclip my belt and climb out of the car. Ten minutes, I tell myself. Ten minutes and then I\u2019m out of there.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Mason\u2019s voice rings through my ears and I turn abruptly, almost falling against my car. I\u2019m so not prepared for this.</p><p>He\u2019s about to enter his office with a small coffee in his hand and I wave sheepishly at him. I force my legs one in front of the other and manage to walk around my car and step onto the sidewalk. I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t hoping he\u2019d be out and I\u2019d only have to deal with his receptionist...shit happens, I guess.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mason...I came to grab a few of my things,\u201d I say, nervously fingering the hem of my shirt.</p><p>He looks nice in his light grey suit with a bright blue tie, tied right to the top button. He smiles and I think it\u2019s both genuine and forced, if that\u2019s even possible. \u201cSure, come on in.\u201d</p><p>My sandals slap the concrete as I follow him into his office. My gaze drags over the familiar surroundings before settling on my old desk. An uncomfortable twinge of nostalgia rolls through me and I ball my hands into anxious fists. Maybe I do miss working here...</p><p>\u201cFae, this is Olivia. She\u2019s your predecessor,\u201d Mason informs her with a playful smile.</p><p>I look at the tiny girl behind the desk. Fae is a suitable name for her appearance. She\u2019s tiny, with golden hair and a small, pointy nose\u2014like Tinkerbell. She glances up at me through her short bangs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I tell her, rubbing my moist palms on my jeans. \u201cIf you\u2019re showing up on time\u2014or at all\u2014then you\u2019re already doing better than me.\u201d</p><p>She curls a stray hair over one ear sheepishly and chuckles, clearly nervous about my sudden arrival.</p><p>\u201cAny patients?\u201d Mason asks her and Fae shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cNot for another half hour.\u201d</p><p>Mason signals for me to follow him into his office and I smile at Fae before slipping into the room and closing the door behind me. Without looking at Mason, I drop into the seat across from his desk. Thankfully, he sits in his chair behind the table and not on the edge of his desk, like he used to.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asks, not making eye contact and I wonder if he actually cares.</p><p>I entwine my fingers, not relaxed enough to lean back against the chair. \u201cGood, I\u2019ve been good. How about you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m doing all right.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence fills the room and I watch him until he finally lifts his azure eyes from his desk to my face. \u201cHow\u2019s your mom?\u201d</p><p>I cringe inwardly at the stilted conversation unfolding between us, but I power through it, hoping it ends up where I get my stuff and leave.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing better now that I\u2019ve moved back in with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>He leans back in his chair, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to hear about your father...when I read it in the newspaper, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, it was a shock...but we\u2019re dealing with it.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cAnd Seth? Are you two still\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Seth and I are still very much...together.\u201d</p><p>Mason shakes his head slightly and I frown. Why\u2019d he think I came here? To beg for my job back? To tell him I was wrong and I should\u2019ve chosen him over Seth?</p><p>\u201cI only came to collect my things, Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s it? No apology? Nothing? You\u2019ve been avoiding my calls for the last eight weeks, but I get the feeling that has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>I exhale. He\u2019s right. Mason didn\u2019t do anything to me. I was the one who wronged him. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve been busy managing the gym and you know how Seth is, especially with you...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth is but an over-confident playboy, Olivia. I\u2019m not scared of him. He can\u2019t tell you who you can and who you can\u2019t talk to. I may have been your boss, but I was also you\u2019re friend\u2014I am your friend.\u201d</p><p>I pull my bottom lip between my teeth. Mason can\u2019t be my friend. I can\u2019t exactly see us going for coffee or going shopping together\u2014at least not without jeopardizing my relationship with Seth. Mason also has\u2014had\u2014romantically feelings towards me, making any kind of relationship with him unattainable. I had to close this chapter of my life. In order to move forward with Seth, Mason and my old life has to go.</p><p>\u201cMason, I\u2019m sorry I chose Seth over my job and I\u2019m sorry I abandoned you and this practice, but so far that decision has led me to where I am now...and I like where I am.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment flashes across his features and it frustrates me. Why can\u2019t he ever make things easy for me? What more does he want me to say?</p><p>\u201cI hate seeing you do this to yourself,\u201d he admits, sending sharp arrows of frustration right into the pit of my stomach. \u201cYour relationship with Seth is a ticking time bomb. You know it, I know it\u2014everyone knows it. You\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>I scoff, \u201cI\u2019m wasting my time with Seth? No. I\u2019m wasting my time here with you. Every millisecond I\u2019m with him is time well spent. He makes me happy, Mason, the happiest anyone has ever made me. Doesn\u2019t that matter to you? You claim to be my friend yet you only take your own happiness into consideration, not mine. I know exactly what kind of person Seth is. I know what he\u2019s done and how he is, but that doesn\u2019t make me love him any less.\u201d</p><p>Mason pinches the bridge of his nose briefly before pushing up from his chair. He turns and opens the cupboard above his head. Reaching inside, he pulls out a small green box and shuts the door. Before handing it to me, he taps his fingers on the side of it, like he wants to say something else. Deciding against it, his brows furrow and he slides the box across his desk. \u201cThere are your things. The picture of your dad, a few of your receipts, your paycheck and a lip gloss.\u201d</p><p>I grab the box and pull myself to my feet. I take one step towards the door and Mason\u2019s voice stops me in my tracks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you to tell me that I\u2019m right, and you will, eventually.\u201d</p><p>I snap my head to look him dead in the eyes. His eyes are light, almost apologetic and I glare at him. \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>I storm the last few steps toward the door and pull it open. Without a glance in Fae\u2019s direction, I march from the office and out into the street. I dodge around an old woman pushing a shopping cart and unlock my car before dropping into the driver\u2019s seat and slamming the door.</p> <p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d I shout, slapping the steering wheel with the palm of my hand.</p><p>How am I supposed to have a positive outlook on my relationship when everyone else is so damn negative? All I want is for someone to be happy for me\u2014like Dad was or Selena is. I can\u2019t give everyone what they want. I can\u2019t make everyone happy so what the fuck am I meant to do? How can I be happy when people refuse to let me? I drag a slow inhale through my nose and expel it at the same speed. I pull my phone from my pocket and decide to skip a phone call to Seth. If he finds out Mason upset me, he\u2019ll probably come down here and do God knows what, so I send him a text instead.</p><p>TO: SETH. TIME: 8:00 A.M.</p><p>Done. On my way home to help Mom.</p><p>I\u2019ll call you later.</p> <p>Love you.</p><p>xx</p><p>I drop my phone into a cup holder and put my keys in the ignition. As I pull away from my old workplace, I can\u2019t help but feel a little relief under the huge pile of worry and guilt. I\u2019ve officially closed the \u2018Mason\u2019 chapter of my life...it\u2019s finished. Never will I ever have to see his judging eyes or hear his unwanted comments. Closing that chapter in my life was surprisingly easy...maybe it\u2019s because I know every new chapter I start from here on out will bring new opportunities, new memories, and new endings, and hopefully, all of them will feature Seth.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Seth</p><p>FROM: OLIVIA. TIME: 8:00 A.M.</p> <p>Done. On my way home to help Mom.</p><p>I\u2019ll call you later.</p><p>Love you.</p><p>xx</p><p>\u201cFucking Mason,\u201d I growl, slipping my phone into the back pocket of my jeans.</p><p>I lean against my car and keep my eyes trained on the darkened concrete at my feet as Jackson saunters up beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks, leaning against the car beside me.</p><p>\u201cMason,\u201d I tell him, refusing to bring my eyes to his face.</p> <p>Although Olivia never hinted that Mason has upset her in her text message, I know he did. Mason had a habit of running his mouth where it wasn\u2019t wanted. Jackson stiffens beside me. \u201cWhat\u2019d he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I cringe. Jesus-fucking-Christ. I sound like an idiot. I pull my keys from my pocket and push off of the car. I should go see her\u2014fuck it, I\u2019ll go see him. Jackson snags my arm, his grip hard and strong.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d He snickers, reading my mind. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s done anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to, Mason\u2019s a dick.\u201d</p><p>Jackson releases me and his eyes thin as he laughs to himself. \u201cLook at you all smitten and protective. I never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes as he crosses his jean-clad legs over each other and flicks his eyebrows suggestively at me. \u201cIt seems you\u2019re no longer looking to lease, my friend, you\u2019re looking to buy.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms over my chest, forgetting I want to get in my car and drive to Mason\u2019s. \u201cSo what if I am?\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t told Jackson about my plans to ask Olivia to marry me...or that I\u2019ve already bought her a ring. I\u2019ll tell him eventually, when I know when I\u2019m going to ask her. I can\u2019t risk him telling Selena, she can\u2019t keep her mouth shut even if you pay her to. Jackson flashes his palms at me. \u201cNo disrespect, man. I just never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, things change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother pointing out that he and Selena also seem to be getting pretty serious. My guess is, he either hasn\u2019t shown her what he\u2019s really like or she\u2019s just as damaged as he is. I don\u2019t blame Jackson for being the way he is. After the childhood and teenage years he\u2019s had I\u2019m surprised he has stuck with Selena for so long. His first real relationship was fucking unhealthy. Poor kid was only sixteen and the woman\u2014twenty-three. She was into some dark shit sexually and he ate it all up, thinking that was how things worked. If he puts Selena through any of the shit he had to go through, I can\u2019t see their relationship stretching past the three month line. I\u2019ve fought the urge to ask him if he\u2019s shown Selena any of his...toys, but prying into Jackson\u2019s sex life is something I prefer to avoid.</p><p>\u201cLet it go, bro,\u201d Jackson says, interrupting my train of thought. He takes my brooding over his past as thoughts of Olivia and Mason. \u201cCall her, make her feel better and forget the rest.\u201d</p><p>I frown. Am I seriously getting relationship advice from Jackson? The same guy who has had as many serious relationships as me? How the fuck did that happen? I guess it isn\u2019t too farfetched. He\u2019s been coaching me on women since high school and now that I think about it...maybe that\u2019s a bad idea considering his relationships all consist of one night stands and consensual, sexual abuse. The thought of tying Olivia up and giving it to her arouses me, but I\u2019d never do it with half of the shit Jackson uses.</p><p>\u201cCall her and then get dressed. Training begins in ten.\u201d</p><p>With a slap on the back, he strolls away from me and I retrieve my phone from my pocket, dialing Olivia\u2019s number immediately.</p><p>It rings for a while before she answers. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>Her voice is happy and high, but I hear the way it falls flat on the last syllable.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d I clear my throat, trying to find the right question to ask without looking like I\u2019m demanding information from her. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Nailed it.</p><p>She sighs, pausing for a few seconds. \u201cIt started off okay...but you know Mason and how he feels about you.\u201d</p><p>The thought makes me smile. \u201cThat I do. Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes.\u201d She laughs nervously. \u201cOnwards and upwards, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I stuff my free hand into the front pocket of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cI just got home and Mom is all dressed up and ready to garden, so I have to go, but I\u2019ll see you later? We\u2019ll go out for lunch?\u201d</p><p>I smile, happy she isn\u2019t going to blow me off on account of Mason. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, see you then.\u201d</p><p>She hangs up, leaving me smiling at my own reflection in the gym windows. I can\u2019t wait for lunch. I can\u2019t wait to see her milky skin and plump, pink lips. Seeing her is what I look forward to most in my day. Most people look forward to their favorite TV shows or their favorite meals, not me. I look forward to the same time every morning when I step through the gym doors and I know I\u2019ll see her. I look forward to seeing her cute wave and wide smile when she sees me, scanning the room for her. I love her, and it\u2019s the sweetest feeling in the world. I slip my phone into my pocket, open the back door to my car, and pull out my gym bag. Training is going to drag on because I\u2019m desperate for lunchtime to roll around. I want to see her...I need to see her.</p><p>I open my eyes and glance sleepily around my room. In between tossing and turning, I didn\u2019t get much sleep. Last night\u2014and almost every other night\u2014I was plagued with images of Olivia that deterred me from sleep. Much to my brain\u2019s delight, tonight in my dreams, she was naked, desperate and begging for me. After I left her house yesterday, I couldn\u2019t shake the look of her in that tiny fucking shirt and tiny shorts\u2014not to mention the fact that she wasn\u2019t wearing underwear. There I go, torturing myself again.</p><p>I groan, throwing off my blankets. I haven\u2019t felt this wound up since the night she wanted me to take her on her couch and I refused. I swing my legs over the edge of the bed and push myself onto my feet, running my hands over my face. I stroll toward the bathroom because the only thing that is going to help the \u2018tenting\u2019 issue I\u2019m currently having in my pants is a cold shower.</p><p>I drop my pants and open the shower door. I turn on the cold tap, stepping well out of the way of the cold stream. As the cold water crashes against the floor tiles and splashes onto my skin, I decide a little bit of warmth wouldn\u2019t hurt...or at least I thought it wouldn\u2019t. The warmer the water became, the harder I got, and the harder I got, the tighter I wound.</p><p>I reach for the body wash and squeeze a large amount into my hand. I ignore my cock that so eagerly juts out in front of me and begin lathering soap over every inch of my body, purposely leaving my length for last. When I have no choice but to wash it, I curl my hand around the shaft, washing as quickly as I can without causing myself too much grief. I almost got away with it too, until my index finger slides over the over-sensitive head, sending an overwhelming bolt of arousal through me. Without a second thought, I grab the tip of my cock and squeeze it firmly. A heavy, pleasured sigh leaves my lips and I feel my eyes become half lidded. I start out slowly, almost at a teasing pace and rest my free hand heavily against the glass.</p><p>\u201cFuck...\u201d I groan, my voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t tease myself and I know very well that if I go any faster there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to stop. Images of Olivia trickle into my mind as my hands run up and down my dick, picking up speed. Almost immediately I edge myself to the brink of orgasm, but before I fall over, I tear my hand away, squeezing my eyes shut as my balls threaten to explode. I can\u2019t break Darryl\u2019s rule...and if I\u2019m going to break it, I\u2019m not going to waste it alone, masturbating in my shower. Not when I have Olivia, who wants me as desperately as I want her. Familiar, immoral thoughts of Olivia filter through my mind at the thought of her name. I think about yesterday and how badly she wanted me in the shower room and how close I came to filling her completely. My hand twitches towards my cock, but before it makes contact, I bite the bullet and slap the hot tap, drenching myself in cold water. I grit my teeth against the freezing temperature, and when I\u2019m certain my boner won\u2019t come back, I shut the water off and step out of the shower. I reach for a towel and quickly run it over my body before wrapping it low on my hips.</p><p>My skin is still damp as I march through my room and throw on a white tank top and slip into a pair of shorts, tossing my towel to the side. I glance over my shoulder at the clock on my wall. Fuck. How long was I in there?</p><p>I\u2019m running late and I don\u2019t think I can handle the five minute planks as a punishment today. Darryl makes me do them whenever I\u2019m late and I don\u2019t care who you are, they fucking hurt. I slip into a pair of ankle socks and tear from the room.</p><p>I stroll through my kitchen, swinging by the fridge and claiming a yogurt from inside. As I pass the bench, I reach across and grab a granola and nut bar from the fruit basket. I hate training on an empty stomach. I tear the lid off the yogurt tub and drink it, pouring the sour Greek yogurt down my throat. The nutritionist the MMAC assigned to me would have a fit if she knew how little food I\u2019m consuming this morning and the fact that I\u2019ve yet to take one of their protein shakes.</p><p>As I reach the front door, I slip into my shoes, step outside, and lock my door behind me.</p><p>The drive to the gym passes by quickly and I pull awkwardly into a space. I\u2019m sure my wheels are over one side of the line, but I don\u2019t bother rectifying it\u2014not while I\u2019m busy staring at the giant billboard of me bolted to the top of the gym. It\u2019s much bigger that I expected...</p><p>This is real.</p><p>This is happening.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I exhale and close my eyes. I\u2019m a pro MMAC fighter with huge billboards of myself spread all over America...I deserve it. I fought my ass off to make this happen, so why does this whole sport suddenly feel so new to me? I open my eyes and look up at the billboard. I\u2019ve never been the kind of person who loves themselves, despite what other people might say about me\u2014and looking at my picture\u2014topless with my fists up, all taped and dirty, makes me cringe. I never want to do a photo shoot again. I\u2019ve never felt more feminine in my life than I did that day. One shoot is more than enough. They better re-use that same photo for the rest of my career.</p><p>I slip from the car and shut the door, pressing the buttons on my keys to lock it. I saunter toward the gym, still tired, even after my shower. I hate skipping breakfast. I need meat, I need eggs, and I need a million other things just to keep me running all day. Going off the way I feel now, I\u2019ll be lucky to make it to brunch.</p><p>As I approach the door, I notice three men in brightly colored overalls installing our new security system and cameras. Olivia fought me a little on the cameras. She insisted they were unnecessary\u2014and they were\u2014until the grocery store down the road was broken into.</p><p>I reach out to push the gym door open, but a buzzing in my pocket forces me to withdraw my hand and retrieve my cellphone from my pocket. Jackson\u2019s name flashes across the screen and I contemplate answering it. He\u2019s undoubtedly going to chew my ass off because I\u2019m running a little late. I hit answer and bring it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey, man.\u201d Jackson clears his throat, ignoring my greeting. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make it to the gym today. Selena and I got into it this morning because I almost punched her father in the mouth.\u201d</p><p>A laugh rumbles through my chest. \u201cYou almost punched her father?\u201d</p><p>He growls. \u201cYou should meet the fucking guy. He\u2019s a fucking dickbag and he treats her like shit. No wonder she has so many issues.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t comment. I\u2019ve never really spent time alone with Selena. I don\u2019t know if she has any deep seated issues\u2014hell, I don\u2019t even know what her favorite color is. I do, however, know she likes to dress pretty and drink hard.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, bro, you still prepared for me to move in today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d Shit. I forgot I asked Jackson to move in three weeks ago. I\u2019ve been so busy it slipped my mind.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I lie, pretending I didn\u2019t forget. \u201cAll set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I\u2019m gonna go find Selena. She\u2019s run off and isn\u2019t answering her phone. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up and I slip my phone back into my pocket. I have no idea how Jackson and Selena are going to work if he already wants to smash her father. On second thought, I can\u2019t believe Jackson even agreed to meet her father. Maybe he\u2019s becoming just as whipped as I apparently am. My thoughts fall to Rick, Olivia\u2019s dad. He liked me, but it wasn\u2019t like that in the beginning. Although he played all happy in front of Olivia, when she left he\u2019d turn his sights on me, demanding I keep my eyes on her face and not...everywhere else. Once I told Rick I wasn\u2019t going to hurt her and he grew to believe me, things were fine. He was the only one I talked to about marrying Olivia...I\u2019d never been so scared or anxious in my life, but I got his blessing and that\u2019s all that matters.</p><p>I push through the doors and into the gym. The strange smell I usually notice first is masked by frangipani\u2014or lavender\u2014some kind of girly scent. Olivia has been trying to \u2018freshen\u2019 the gym for weeks now and this smell is definitely not working for me. I scan the room. In the far corner by the boxing ring, Darryl is taking a phone call\u2014one he doesn\u2019t seem too pleased with, and my sparring partners are stretching on the mat beside him. They have it easy today. I don\u2019t think I have it in me to knock anyone out. I glance around the rest of the gym\u2014two chubby men stroll lazily on the treadmills and a woman is going hard out on the elliptical. I frown, confused why Olivia isn\u2019t here. I want to see her before I train...I feel stupid just thinking that, we aren\u2019t inseparable...I just...I don\u2019t know. I guess that\u2019s what it\u2019s like being in love. You need to see that person everyday\u2014every second. If you don\u2019t, you feel kind of empty...kind of incomplete.</p><p>Jesus-fucking-christ. Listen to me! I sound like a pussy...but it\u2019s true. I feel incomplete...or at least I do until my gaze settles on a pair of bare thighs flowing endlessly out of tiny, black shorts as she bends over a rowing machine. It\u2019s her and I\u2019m willing to bet my entire pro season earnings on it. I\u2019ve seen her from this glorious angle too many times to not be certain.</p> <p>Suddenly pleased with how my morning is turning out, I draw nearer, my eyes zeroing in on the small gap between her thighs. Over and over I have to remind myself that we\u2019re in public. My fingers twitch, desperate to act of their own accord and slip between her legs. Instead, I rest my hand on the small of her back. Her skin is soft and warm under my palm and I feel her body go rigid as she slowly turns her head. When she makes eye contact with me, her green orbs brighten and she straightens herself before throwing her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou scared me!\u201d She says, squeezing me against her.</p><p>I wrap my arms around her waist and she pulls away, but I don\u2019t let her go. \u201cDid you see the billboard?\u201d</p><p>I feel my face pull together. \u201cI did...they don\u2019t have any smaller ones?\u201d</p><p>She half frowns, half smiles. \u201cI\u2019m sure they do, but I ordered the biggest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips curl into a mocking smirk. \u201cAre you embarrassed, Mr. Marc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look embarrassed? Sorry, I was going for humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to be embarrassed about.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI think it's sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think your shorts are sexy and I deem them inappropriate for the workplace.\u201d She rolls her eyes and the palms of my hands find their way down her back, stopping on her firm ass. \u201cYour ass is a hazard.\u201d</p><p>She giggles at my lame line, catching her plump bottom lip between her teeth as her hands grip my hands, dragging them up to rest on her hips. \u201cThere are times and places for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d I lower my mouth to her ear and I feel her tense against me. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it in a gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, people are watching.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitch upwards at the sound of her breathless voice. \u201cLet them.\u201d</p> <p>I pull back, sliding my hands up the contour of her perfect body, before slipping them to either side of her neck. Her eyes are heavy, her plump lips parted to let through a slow, controlled breath and it exposes her teeth slightly, so flawless and white.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>A husky male voice draws my attention to the door and I watch cautiously as a tall, lean, and over-excited guy struts towards us. I feel Olivia\u2019s gaze drag from my face to his and she takes a step back. I drop my hands to my sides and watch curiously as he pulls Olivia into a hug. It isn\u2019t a seedy hug\u2014it resembles the kind of hug a brother would give a sister, but the gleam in his eye is unsettling.</p><p>\u201cBrad, this is my boyfriend, Seth. Seth, this is Brad. He\u2019s a friend of my brother\u2019s,\u201d she says after they rattle off a very brief catch up and condolences for Rick.</p><p>Brad flicks his fingers through the front of his copper hair before extending the same hand to me. I glance at it briefly before putting my hand in his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the guy on the billboard out front?\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to cringe, taking my hand back. I should be proud of it, not ashamed. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, bro, that\u2019s admirable. How hard you hit?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cGet in the ring and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Brad laughs nervously and O steps beside me, resting a hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pass, thanks. Maybe next time,\u201d Brad says.</p><p>I analyze his face as he turns his attention to Olivia, flicking it awkwardly to me a few times\u2014thick, bushy eyebrows, a slender nose and bright yellow-green eyes...his catlike features unnerve me.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m scouting for a new gym and I thought I\u2019d pop in here and give it a go. I like the environment and the people.\u201d He flicks his eyebrows at Olivia. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll stick around.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms and Olivia leans into me, laughing like he said something funny. I didn\u2019t hear anything remotely funny come from his thin lips. Am I missing some kind of personal joke?</p><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll show you the gym.\u201d Olivia hooks her elbow around Brad\u2019s and glances at me over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon,\u201d she says, her voice broken with a giggle. \u201cYou\u2019re late and Darryl is pissed.\u201d</p><p>I watch as she walks with Brad around the gym, laughing and blushing as she points out equipment and doors. Every now and then, their eyes flit to me before returning to their conversation. It\u2019s bothering me more than it should. I\u2019ve never felt jealousy before I became interested in Olivia. I don\u2019t do jealousy. I\u2019m a detached, hit it and quit it kind of guy\u2014or at least I used to be. I don\u2019t like the way jealousy affects me. I hate the anger it stirs\u2014I hate the fact that it makes me want to throw Olivia on the floor and take her in front of everyone just to make a statement. I exhale. I sound like a fucking psycho...and I am when it comes to her.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Darryl shouts, drawing my attention. He slips his phone into his pocket. \u201cYou\u2019re late. Shirt off, gloves on, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I stroll over to the boxing ring and pull my shirt over my head. I keep my head down and focus on wrapping my hands correctly instead of obsessively watching Olivia and Brad waltz around the gym.</p><p>Darryl brings my gloves and head gear. I take my gloves, but ignore the other item in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the amateurs anymore, Seth, you have to wear your gear. You can\u2019t afford to get hurt in training. Not to mention you have interviews and press conferences coming up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the head gear. He\u2019s not going to touch me.\u201d</p><p>Darryl drops the head gear with a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re too damn cocky for your own good.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the smile that tugs at my lips. I like Darryl, mostly because he reminds me of my father. Okay, that comparison isn\u2019t accurate. There\u2019s a big difference between Dad and Darryl. Darryl tells me how proud he is of me on a regular basis. Dad, however, has only said it twice. Once when I was six and I went to the dentist\u2019s for the first time and the second time on his death bed\u2014\u2018I\u2019m proud of your determination, but I\u2019m not proud of your choices.\u2019 Fair call, I\u2019ve made some pretty shitty choices. Before Mom went off the tracks, I drank way too much, partied way too hard, and I slept with way too many girls. I have no reasons for it. Growing up, my home life was perfect, well, almost perfect. Maddi, my sister, was the \u2018golden child.\u2019 My parents bent over backwards for her. Maddi had always wanted to be a lawyer like Mom and my parents (being huge on success) nurtured her as much as they could. When they asked me what I wanted to be, my answer was always different. One week it was a race car driver. The next, a cage fighter. Hell, I even think I told them I wanted to be a mob boss at one point. My point is, I was never treated equally to my sister. When I told Dad about my plans to be a professional MMA fighter, he was hesitant until I went off in a long speech about discipline and determination. When he saw how serious and passionate I was, he agreed to be a part of it. He studied long and hard on the art of MMA and ended up knowing more than me, teaching me things I didn\u2019t know. Quickly, Dad and I grew close and it was like the last seventeen years of our tense relationship didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>I loved it. I loved seeing him smile at me, his eyes gleaming with pride. Sadly, our easy relationship was short-lived. Being a surgeon and having to deal with death regularly, my Dad attended habitual therapy sessions. One night, he invited me to go with him. He wanted me to see what he had to deal with, how determined and passionate he was about his job, considering he never spoke about work outside of his therapy sessions.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too stressful,\u201d he\u2019d always say when I asked.</p><p>The office was nearing close time...and Dad and I were sitting in the waiting room. There was no receptionist, apparently typical for that time of night, so he sent me to find Mason. I strolled around the practice before I entered his office. I don\u2019t regret a lot of things in my life because at the time I\u2019ve done them, it was exactly what I wanted, but I do regret the events that followed. The events that followed me entering Mason\u2019s office destroyed any relationship I\u2019d built with my father. I don\u2019t blame Mason\u2019s wife\u2014even though she should have been a little more respectful of her marriage\u2014I only blame myself. I was young, horny, and stupid. So fucking stupid.</p><p>My lungs burn as air is forced from them and I hunch over, blowing air from my cheeks. What the fuck? I straighten myself and my spar partner, Dave, locks eyes with me. He seems almost scared that he touched me. Fuck knows why, he\u2019s at least three times the size of me.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d I groan, running my hands over my face.</p><p>I need to wake up.</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d Darryl orders from the sidelines. \u201cKeep your hands up.\u201d</p><p>I bring my fists up and loosen my posture. He isn\u2019t going to get another hit on me. That I guarantee.</p><p>\u201cHello stranger,\u201d she purrs, stepping closer. \u201cLooking for Dr. Peterson?\u201d</p><p>My eyes rake the woman before me in a tight, red dress and the highest pair of heels I\u2019ve ever seen. If there was a picture beside trophy wife on urbandictionary.com, it\u2019d be a picture of her. She drags her long, blonde hair over one shoulder, her hips swaying as she saunters toward me. There\u2019s a curve on the corner of her lips\u2014a confident curve\u2014like she knows what\u2019s going to happen before I even open my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMason is out right now\u2014and he skipped on dinner with his wife again.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t talk to her, only watch as she pouts sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cSo you can imagine how pissed off and...\u201d her gaze drags down the length of my body before returning to my face. I barely acknowledge my cock twitching in my pants. \u201cUnsatisfied I am.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as her hands press against my chest and glide downward until her finger curls around the hem of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cAlthough young, you look like you can satisfy me...\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrow quirks, silently asking me for my name.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She smiles the kind of smile that should have sent me running. She smiles a wide, wolfish and hungry smile that tugs at my nerves...among many other things.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d she says in a husky whisper, bringing her mouth closer to mine. I smell the alcohol on her breath and I know I should leave...but I don\u2019t. She sucks my bottom lip between hers and I keep my eyes open, locked on her espresso black irises as she pops the button on my jeans. \u201cThat\u2019s a sexy name.\u201d</p><p>My nerves skyrocket at the thought of Dad walking through the door any second now and I grab her small wrists in my hands. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her over-plucked brow cocks. \u201cDon\u2019t?\u201d Her eyes flare. \u201cYou say it, but I know you don\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>She kisses my chin, before slowly dropping to her knees. I look down at her as she glances up at me through hooded eyes and releases me from my jeans.</p><p>\u201cDo you like to feel good, Seth? Because I\u2019m going to make you feel real good and then you\u2019re going to return the favor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know I shouldn\u2019t do it. I know it\u2019s wrong and beyond fucked up, but I\u2019m too hard to walk away. I figure, if I do this quickly and then get back to Dad\u2014no harm done.</p><p>Her lips wrap around me, coating my bare skin in slick, wet saliva. A groan slips from my throat and her fingers dig into my legs as she takes me all the way to the back of her throat. I grit my teeth against a shiver threatening to overcome me and grab a fistful of her soft hair, forcing her to move faster and harder. She moans, almost sending me over the edge, but I\u2019m not done. Not until I make her feel as good as she\u2019s making me feel. All rational thoughts fly out the window the moment her warm tongue wraps around the tip and a dark hunger is released inside of me. I force the woman roughly to her feet. She drags an index finger along her bottom lip and I grip her hips as she wraps her arms around my neck. I push her backwards, passing the couches and going straight to Mason\u2019s desk. As she slides onto the table, I pull back and reach for the wallet in my back pocket. While she tugs her pathetic excuse for underwear down her legs, I find a condom and slip the wallet back into my pocket. I waste no time in ripping the foil and rolling it on. Within seconds I\u2019m between her thighs and pushing my way inside her. No thoughts fill my mind\u2014nothing that will bring me back to my senses, anyway. I avoid kissing her mouth in respect of her marriage\u2014I almost cringe.</p><p>How fucking thoughtful of me.</p> <p>I\u2019m relieved she doesn\u2019t mind me avoiding her lips. She isn\u2019t looking for romance or passion...a quick fuck to get back at her husband is all she wants. Mason\u2019s wife falls back, lying flat on his desk, her eyes closed. I tighten my grip on her hips, pulling her into me with every thrust.</p><p>\u201cOh fuck, yes,\u201d she moans and I feel her tighten around me.</p><p>I sink my teeth into my bottom lip, trying to hold back my own groans of pleasure as she wraps her legs around my hips, squeezing me closer to her. I feel my release gaining momentum and getting nearer as she digs her fingers into the wood, turning them white.</p><p>\u201cFaster, shit,\u201d she cries and her legs begin to spasm.</p><p>Her fast breathing turn into gasps for air and her walls clamp down on me. The pressure on my cock sends me over the edge and I lean over her, my own hands turning white and bloodless under the pressure as my knees threaten to buckle. I feel myself pulse inside of her as I release and I grit my teeth against moaning out loud.</p> <p>Fucking hell.</p><p>I take a few slow, deep breaths and draw myself to full height. Almost immediately, I feel a regretful sickness creep through my stomach and cling to all of my vital organs. What have I done?</p><p>I slip off the condom and drop it into the bin. Raking my fingers through my hair, Mason\u2019s wife bends down for her underwear and I follow suit, buttoning my own jeans. As luck would have it, before I get the button done, the door opens and I freeze.</p><p>\u201cHoney, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Holy shit. Fuck.</p><p>Mason\u2019s words are cut off as he takes in the scene before him. His wife finishes adjusting her red thong and pulls down her dress, covering the red marks my fingers made when I squeezed her flesh.</p> <p>\u201cSeth?\u201d There\u2019s no mistaking the complete disgust in Dad\u2019s voice and I flinch. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on,\u201d the woman says as she grabs her handbag. \u201cSeth here was showing me a good time\u2014a great time. This is the last time you neglect me, Mason. I want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>She reaches into her bag and retrieves a packet of cigarettes. She plucks one out, puts it between her lips and ignites it with a tacky diamante lighter. With a sultry wink in my direction, she says. \u201cThanks, handsome.\u201d And then she pushes past Dad and her husband\u2014ex-husband. Mason starts toward me, hate as clear as day in the blue depths of his eyes and I\u2019m not going to fight him. I\u2019m going to let him punch me in the face. Fuck knows I deserve it, but before he reaches me, Dad dives between us. \u201cGo after your wife, Mason. I\u2019ll deal with Seth.\u201d</p><p>I frown, knowing that whatever mental shit Dad dishes out will be a million times worse than what Mason could ever do to me physically.</p><p>Mason whips around on his heel and storms from his office, shouting after his wife.</p><p>\u201cDad, it\u2019s not my\u2014\u201d</p><p>My words are cut off by a harsh slap to my cheek and it tosses my head to the side. I feel my nostrils flare and I clench my jaw against the urge to hit him back as I slowly turn to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d I almost growl at him.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault? Did she tie you down and force you to put your dick in her?\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s your fault just as much as it is hers.\u201d He pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201cI thought you changed, Seth, but you\u2019re still the same disgraceful embarrassment you were months ago and I\u2019m finished with you.\u201d</p><p>The look on Dad\u2019s face\u2014the look of pure resentment and disappointment seeps through my pores, flows through my bloodstream and penetrates my heart. The last few months I\u2019ve worked so hard to make him proud...only to destroy it.</p><p>Pain flashes across my mouth as my lip is crushed against my teeth and it splits.</p><p>Shit. I zoned out again.</p><p>\u201cSeth! What the fuck are you doing?\u201d Darryl\u2019s voice pierces me and I lick my lip.</p><p>Blood. I fucking hate the taste of blood. I lunge forward, slamming my gloved hand into Dave\u2019s stomach. He hunches over and I grab his head, driving my knee into his face. With a grunt, he falls onto his hands and knees. As soon as I\u2019m done, Darryl launches himself into the ring, clutching his stopwatch to stop it from swinging around his neck. I press my glove against my lip and look at it. There isn\u2019t too much blood, thank God, which means there isn\u2019t too much damage...I hope.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake? You\u2019re as disoriented as a kidnapped prostitute on heroin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d I tell him, rolling my head from side to side. \u201cI just didn\u2019t get much sleep last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands on his hips. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>Choosing to avoid the flashback of me disappointing my father, I say. \u201cBecause I\u2019m wound too tightly, Darryl. I can\u2019t go months without sex. I\u2019m not in the amateur league anymore. My fights aren\u2019t a week or two apart... they\u2019re months apart and I can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, Darryl laughs. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep because you\u2019re horny? You\u2019re letting your sparring partners get through your guard because you want to fuck your girlfriend?\u201d He pinches the bridge of his nose (a typical Darryl reaction) and exhales. \u201cIf having sex is going to keep you on the top of your game and alert, then fine, do it. But if you come back tomorrow and you don\u2019t give me two hundred percent, I\u2019m going to kick your ass myself, got it?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. Darryl\u2019s good at what he does and definitely knows his way around a cage, but he could never beat me.</p><p>\u201cGo it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He turns from me to face the other sparrers. \u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>As my next sparrer prepares his gloves, I scan the gym for Olivia. I spot her leaning against a training room door. Her long, slender fingers reach up and tighten her ponytail and she flicks it over one shoulder.</p><p>She\u2019s perfect.</p><p>I think back to my recent flashback and grit my teeth as a pang of guilt crushes my stomach. The fact Olivia willing touches what too many other girls have touched makes me sick. I should be special for her...like she is special for me. If I could go back and do everything again, I\u2019d have waited for her because no one makes me feel as good as she does. Olivia doesn\u2019t make me feel dirty, like I did when I was with other girls. When we have sex, she doesn\u2019t make me feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong and that\u2019s what drew me to her. She makes me feel good, she makes me feel like a better person\u2014the person I should have been for my father. I watch her laugh and playfully slap Brad on the arm, and even from here I can see the pink flush that burns at her cheeks. Brad grabs her shoulders and pulls her into him before his eyes flick to me.</p><p>Oh hell no.</p><p>I tear my gloves off and drop them to the floor as my new sparrer steps in. I stalk across the ring and the floor shakes with every step I take.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Put your gloves back on,\u201d Darryl demands.</p><p>\u201cMore important things to do,\u201d I tell him, not breaking my visual on Brad and Olivia.</p><p>\u201cMore important things\u2014Seth...\u201d</p><p>I ignore him as I slip between the ropes and onto the stable gym floor. Brad retracts his arms from Olivia and an uncomfortable cringe creeps over his face. When she turns to see me coming for her, she shakes her head at me, like I\u2019m seconds away from overreacting.</p><p>\u201cSeth, what are you\u2014ah!\u201d I grab her hips and lift her, throwing her over my shoulder. \u201cPut me down\u2014Brad, give me a second. Seth, stop.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t stop. I keep carrying her until we\u2019re in her office. I storm across the room and drop her into her office chair, gripping the arms of it so it doesn\u2019t roll away.</p><p>\u201cFeel better now?\u201d She laughs and I feel my eyebrows draw together. Is this funny?</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t coming here, O. Tell him we\u2019re full,\u201d I demand in a tone so dark she can\u2019t possibly mistake it for a question.</p><p>Her soft hands glide up my arms, softening my frustrated edge. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>I stare into her beautiful green eyes, unwavering. \u201cI trust you\u2014it\u2019s everybody else I don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d She sighs, running a hand over her face, defeated. \u201cBrad is gay. He isn\u2019t into me, he\u2019s into you.\u201d</p><p>I frown and her hands rise to her mouth as her body vibrates with laughter. Gay? No...I\u2019ve seen and met plenty of gay guys. They were all the same\u2014confident, over the top, and feminine. Brad has a husky voice, he doesn\u2019t walk funny, and I didn\u2019t see him purse his lips once. I drop to my knees, keeping my hands on the armrests.</p><p>\u201cYou look shocked.\u201d Her chest hiccups with a remaining giggle.</p><p>\u201cI am. He doesn\u2019t look gay...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he doesn\u2019t look gay? Gays aren\u2019t all the same.\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m certain they are. I\u2019ve seen so many and all their personalities have been as indistinguishable as the last.</p><p>I put my hands on my hips and sink to the floor before her. \u201cNow I feel like a dick...\u201d</p><p>Olivia slides closer and slips her hands around my neck. Her green eyes flare at me from underneath her dark lashes and the corners of her lips jerk. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing he\u2019s into dicks, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to laugh, but my lips pull wider anyway and my chest rumbles. I slip my hands underneath her, pulling her off the chair and onto my lap. She molds perfectly to me and my body is anything but immune to her covered breasts that press against my chest.</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you to come up with that one?\u201d I ask, lowering my mouth to hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting to say it since the moment Brad walked in and you looked like you wanted to kill him.\u201d</p><p>O\u2019s tongue flicks out and brushes the cut on my bottom lip. She cringes, her eyes glossing over with sympathy. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>My hands snake underneath her tight tank top and up the warm skin of her back as her own fingers brush the back of my neck before slipping into my hair. She rolls her hips forward, sliding further onto me and my breathing deepens. My whole body tightens and clenches as she urges her mouth on mine, pressing slightly on my cut as she dips her tongue inside, eliciting a moan from me.</p><p>\u201cDarryl gave me the green light...\u201d I tell her, pulling back and resting my forehead against hers. \u201cTell me to stop or I\u2019m going to take you right now.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids drop minutely and she leans in close, her lips grazing my earlobe. \u201cWhatever you do,\u201d she breathes, \u201cdon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>I tear my hands from her shirt and bury them in her hair, roughly tugging her backwards. She gasps and our eyes connect. My blood burns as her irises flare, sending my body buzzing before she crushes her mouth to mine. I drop an arm and wrap it around her waist, urging her onto her back. In one fluid movement, she hitches a thigh round my hip as I pin her body against the wooden floor and press myself right between her thighs. She groans and flexes her hips into mine. The movement is almost enough to have me coming in my pants. I pull her shirt up and tug her bra down so her voluptuous mounds flow over the useless cups. I suck a hard nipple into my mouth and she lifts her hips. I curl my fingers around the hem of her shorts and she sucks in a sharp breath. I can feel the heat radiating from her and I want to be in her\u2014deep in her\u2014until I lose sense of where I am, until I can\u2019t think straight.</p><p>Knock. Knock.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d I groan with a mouth full of breast.</p><p>I release her and she groans, disappointed. I look up at her face. Her eyes are closed, trying to compose herself. She swallows hard before opening her eyes blinking at me. How hard is it to have five goddamn seconds to myself?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I call out, unable to mask my frustration.</p><p>\u201cWhen I said you can have sex, I didn\u2019t mean now,\u201d Darryl shouts, his voice vibrating through the wood and killing the heat between Olivia\u2019s legs. \u201cGet out here. You still have a full training session to get through, not to mention the five minute planks for being late.\u201d</p><p>With a defeated sigh, Olivia shifts underneath me and conceals her pink nipples behind her white bra. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d I call, pushing myself off of her.</p><p>I pull on the hem of her shirt, covering her firm stomach. Now I finally have the green light, I want to spend every waking minute with her. Not only having sex, but reconnecting in other ways, and knowing I can reach out and touch her without having to worry if I work myself up would be nice. I\u2019ve decided she isn\u2019t staying with her mom tonight, no way. I want her with me, in my house and in my bed. All alone.</p><p>FUCK!</p> <p>Jackson is moving in today...meaning the chance of isolation and freedom to make Olivia as loud as I want her to be is slim to none\u2014Jesus\u2014and I haven\u2019t even told Olivia he\u2019s moving in.</p><p>I sigh and sit up. I rake my fingers through my hair, making a mental note to get a haircut. \u201cI should probably mention Jackson is moving in.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen and she pushes herself up on her elbows. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday, and I was thinking we could have a barbeque\u2014just you, me, Selena and Jackson,\u201d I lied. I wasn\u2019t thinking that. I just created a reason to have her agree to coming over tonight before her mom has a chance to rope her into dinner.</p><p>Olivia sits up and tightens her ponytail, smiling slightly. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbove the waist I\u2019m okay, why?\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitch. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like your style. I expected you to suggest an orgy before a double date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirstly, I don\u2019t have a style and it\u2019s not a double date. It\u2019s a couple of friends hanging out and eating a shit ton of food...\u201d I hook my finger under the hem of her shorts and tug her toward me. Her hands fly up and press against my chest to stop herself from slamming into my body. I smile as I picture her naked, digging her fingernails into my bare skin. \u201cTo increase stamina for a sleepless night,\u201d I finish.</p><p>She takes a step back and I remove my finger from her shorts as she runs a hand over her face. \u201cShit, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The balloon of indecent excitement in my chest deflates. \u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I promised Mom we\u2019d Skype with Chase tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to dinner at six and then you can Skype with Chase afterwards.\u201d</p><p>She ponders for a little while, pulling the corner of her lip between her teeth. \u201cFine, do you need me to get anything? What are we eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get anything, I have lots of steak.\u201d</p><p>Olivia blinks at me a few times before reaching for her blue backpack that sits on the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll go pick up some Selena-friendly food. She only eats lamb, chicken, or meats that have been processed enough times they actually count as a chemical.\u201d She rolls her eyes and mimics Selena\u2019s voice. \u201cThe bigger the animal, the bigger the bloat.\u201d</p><p>Whatever the hell that means. A few more knocks sound on the door and I walk towards it before pulling it open.</p><p>\u201cWe were only talking,\u201d Olivia states, shifting her weight and folding her arms.</p> <p>Darryl\u2019s eyes zero in on her leg and I follow his line of sight. I smile widely when I spot one half of her shorts pushed up her thigh.</p><p>\u201cApparently,\u201d he deadpans.</p><p>Olivia glances down and abruptly flattens her shorts.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, I have the MMAC breathing down my neck. They\u2019re not happy with your times and they\u2019re extremely close to replacing me with some juiced up gorilla who knows more about supplements than techniques.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders in an attempt to come off unbothered, but inside, I feel sorry for Darryl. I\u2019ve fucked him around a lot since I met Olivia. When Darryl and I first started working, I\u2019d hired him only to piss off my dad\u2014but we grew close and now I wouldn\u2019t dream of replacing him. Without hesitation, he gave up his life in Seattle and uprooted his wife and three children to move to Portland with me. He believed in me\u2014believes in me\u2014and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do or where\u2019d I\u2019d be without him.</p><p>Olivia strolls past, planting a quick kiss on my cheek. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>We watch as she rounds the corner and disappears down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry her,\u201d I say aloud without thought or warning.</p><p>Darryl\u2019s lips curl into a wide, proud smile and it illumines his dark features. \u201cGood, you\u2019d be stupid not to.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head in subtle agreement and lean against the door frame. Darryl analyzes me for a second before speaking. \u201cYou know, the \u2018no sex\u2019 rule isn\u2019t only to help your performance levels, but to also help your relationship.\u201d</p><p>I frown, confused.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, everyone knows what kind of guy you were. With this rule in place, it gives you time to explore other aspects of your relationship. Love isn\u2019t only expressed through words or sex. It\u2019s communicated through actions\u2014selfless actions\u2014as easy as listening to her talk about her day or washing her hair. Love isn\u2019t about staying together and having sex. It\u2019s about staying together and growing together, for a lifetime.\u201d Darryl chuckles. \u201cThat probably went in one ear and out the other, though, right?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. It\u2019s advice like that that is going to help me throughout this relationship. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll hold on to that piece of advice.\u201d</p><p>He rubs the back of his neck and averts his gaze, happy, but uncomfortable. Neither of us is used to conversations like this. \u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ve got training to do.\u201d</p><p>Before he turns, I stop him.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, crossing my arms. \u201c...for putting up with all of my bullshit. I know I\u2019m hard to handle and I know I can be a dick, so thanks for dealing with it better than Dad did.\u201d</p><p>Darryl\u2019s features hardened. \u201cWith all due respect, your dad was an idiot. You were just a boy\u2014one that made bad decisions\u2014but a boy, nonetheless. If he spent more time showing you instead of telling you, maybe things would have been different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>I had a love/hate relationship with Dad\u2014predominately hate, but he was still my father\u2014something I don\u2019t think he could handle at any stage in my life. Olivia, however, knew exactly what kind of person I was when we met, God knows I told her a million times, but she still wanted me. I like being around her, she soothes me. Being in the amateur tournament was stressful, beyond stressful. Before every fight, Dad\u2019s words would ring through my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhen have you succeeded at anything in life? Ever? You\u2019re dedicated, sure, but you\u2019re also stupid. You always get your own way and this...fighting thing is no different. I\u2019ll watch your fights, but only to see you ruin it for yourself. You always do.\u201d</p><p>Every time I fought in the amateur comp, it was a \u2018win or die\u2019 situation. It was win or prove my father right and I refuse to admit that I\u2019m the loser he believed I was. There isn\u2019t a submission in the world that can force me to tap out. If you get me in a hold, you better be prepared to snap a bone or kill me because I will not surrender. Call me stubborn, I know I am. Call me competitive or spoiled, I\u2019m those things too, but what I am not, is weak. I\u2019ll never give up on anything that I want and now that I\u2019m pro, the stakes are higher\u2014the fights, meaner. There\u2019s a lot more stress on my mind and my body than ever before, but I\u2019m ready.</p><p>I think.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I pull up outside the small grocery store by the gym and I sit in my car for a few long seconds because I have no idea what Seth has in his fridge...doubling up would be pointless. With a heavy sigh, I open the door, drag myself from the seat and slam the door behind me. I\u2019m happy being here by myself. The last time I went to a grocery store with Seth and his nutritionist, Mina, I swear I was going to have a mental breakdown. The looks I received from her every time I suggested something not \u2018organic\u2019 were ridiculous. It seems a fighter\u2019s diet is extremely strict. Did you know there are different kinds of carbs and fats? I didn\u2019t. Thankfully, Selena doesn\u2019t care if something is organic or grown purely from chemicals. She\u2019s not one to care what she puts into her body and yet, her body remains perfect.</p><p>My thoughts of healthy foods and perfect bodies distract me until I\u2019m standing outside the store\u2019s Deli section.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-nine.\u201d The woman\u2019s high voice commands my attention and I glance down at the number in my hand.</p><p>Oh, that\u2019s me. I step forward, hand her the ticket, and order a few chicken drumsticks and a rack of lamb ribs. Everything is coated in a thick layer of smoky barbeque sauce and it makes my mouth water. My mouth isn\u2019t the only thing lacking in moisture...I\u2019m still not able to shake the way Seth\u2019s hot mouth felt when it enveloped my nipple...his tongue glides with perfect pressure over my hard peak, sending an abundance of electrified tingles between my legs...</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>My eyes shoot open. I\u2019m still in the store, standing right by the freezer section with a small basket filled with items...items I don\u2019t remember grabbing because I was too caught up in the way Seth handled me. And when he pulled my hair so firmly, oh my Go\u2014</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d the familiar voice said again.</p><p>I whip around on my heel and immediately meet Blade\u2019s boyish face and bright eyes. A thick, uncomfortable feeling twists my stomach and I\u2019m almost positive that it\u2019s hate. I think I\u2019m angry just looking at him...</p><p>\u201cBlade?\u201d</p><p>He adjusts his black t-shirt and steps forward, pulling me and the basket I jam between our bodies into him.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d he asks when he releases me.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Blade since my father\u2019s funeral. He was so uncharacteristically cool about Seth and I being in love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, thanks. How are you?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t really care how he is, not like I did before I met Seth. I only ask out of courtesy and because I don\u2019t want to cause a scene.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d His eyes drink me in, eyeing my small, black shorts closely. \u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>I shift my basket, dropping it subtly to hide my bare legs. Blade has seen me naked too many times for me to feel insecure in front of him, but I don\u2019t want him to look at me like that anymore. I\u2019m not his. There\u2019s only one set of eyes I want skimming over my flesh and they\u2019re brown with beautiful rivers of golden honey, not blue.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Seth? Still treating you well?\u201d</p><p>I can hear the hope in his voice and it makes me feel off. How dare he?</p><p>\u201cLike a princess,\u201d I reply, forcing a fake smile just to get at him.</p><p>Blade inches closer and I step back until the skin of my shoulders presses against the fridge\u2019s cold glass.</p><p>He lowers his voice, smiling uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you a lot lately...I miss you.\u201d</p><p>He presses a hand against the glass beside my head and if I push any harder on the fridge, I\u2019ll go through it.</p><p>\u201cBlade, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything, I just want to talk.\u201d His sentence finishes with a small exhale and I pick up the scent of...vodka\u2014or something close to it.</p><p>\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d He doesn\u2019t look drunk. His eyes are alert and his skin free of a clammy sweat.</p><p>\u201cI had a little bit, but I\u2019m not drunk.\u201d</p><p>I step away. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d He slides in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk, Olly.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. I hate that nickname. \u201cWe have nothing to talk about. As far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019re strangers.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows raise and he steps back, running his hand over his face. I don\u2019t have to ask to know that I\u2019ve pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cStrangers? We were together for six years, we were each other\u2019s first, and we\u2019ve met each other\u2019s families, but now we\u2019re strangers? What the fuck happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me\u2014it never was me. It was you. You did this to yourself, and newsflash\u2014I\u2019ve moved on. I love someone else. If you see me walking around, don\u2019t talk to me. We\u2019re strangers now\u2014not because of me, and it\u2019s not even because of Seth. It\u2019s because of you.\u201d</p><p>I push past him, but before I storm away, I turn to him. \u201cIn light of it all, though, I guess I do have to thank you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he barks out, his head snapping in my direction.</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, I never would have been given the chance to meet Seth...so thank you.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his baby blues at me and the fear they used to provoke in me ceases to exist. I\u2019ve beaten him and he no longer affects me. My system is immune to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so very welcome,\u201d he deadpans, almost growling.</p><p>I turn again and march toward the checkout without double checking the contents in my basket. He shouldn\u2019t be so mad. He knows how the saying goes, \u2018treat her right, or someone else will,\u2019 and that is exactly what happened.</p><p>I leave the food in the car and step into the gym. Finally, I can breathe easier. I hadn\u2019t expected to see Blade again...but now that I have, I can say the feelings I had are completely gone. Non-existent. I\u2019m glad I ran into Blade, actually. I feel it finally closed the \u2018Blade\u2019 chapter of my life. First Mason, now Blade. I\u2019m erasing them from my life only to make more room for Seth.</p><p>I pull my phone from my pocket and glance at the time. I was at the store for a little over an hour. The gym is still relatively clean and quiet, so I stroll toward the training room, hoping to replace Blade\u2019s face, that hovers at the front of my mind, with Seth\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I push through the door and my gaze immediately zeroes onto Seth\u2019s form. He\u2019s face down on the floor, holding himself up on his elbows and the tips of his feet\u2014boarding? Fencing? No...planking! Yes, that\u2019s what it\u2019s called. Planking. I tried it once and barely made eight seconds.</p><p>I stroll over to Darryl, who\u2019s sitting comfortably in a chair next to Seth. He glances up at me and smiles, exposing his white teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his time?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cEleven minutes so far, four more to go.\u201d</p><p>Darryl crosses his legs and places the stopwatch on his grey, sweatpant-clad thigh. I step closer to Seth, watching his muscles tremble as he fights to keep himself up. I hear his breathing come out in controlled breaths and he keeps his head down, ignoring my presence. Normally, I\u2019m okay with Seth focusing more on the training session than me, but after seeing Blade, I want to touch Seth. I want to talk to him and laugh with him\u2014I want to do anything to rid the memory of my ex-boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cSwitch to high plank,\u201d Darryl commands, and with a small exhale, Seth pushes himself off of his elbows and onto the palms of his hands, holding himself higher off the ground. Seth keeps his head straight, not looking at anything but the far wall. I circle him until I stand in front of him, blocking his eye contact with the wall. He glances up at my face and his lips curl into a heart-stopping smile. The urge to be close to him overwhelms me and I sit down before sliding myself directly underneath his large body</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d I hear Darryl sigh under his breath, but I ignore him, focused only on the brown irises that glow lovingly at me.</p><p>Seth watches my face as I trail the tips of my fingertips over the rock hard muscles in his arms. The hard masses coated in a thin, arousing layer of sweat tremble and my eyes flick from his arms to his face.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, when I pictured you underneath me for the first time in weeks, this isn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind,\u201d he says, his voice strained.</p><p>I hear Darryl\u2019s chair scratch a few times on the floor as he moves away from us, giving us the privacy we desperately need. I laugh, turning my head to look away from him. He lowers himself and plants a kiss on my cheek, sending warm butterflies through my stomach. I bite my bottom lip against more giggles as his lips playfully travel my jaw and onto my neck.</p><p>\u201cSeth, high planks,\u201d Darryl commands and Seth exhales, straightening his arms.</p><p>I turn my head to look at him. Even during training sessions he looks amazing. His skin doesn\u2019t turn pink like mine does when I\u2019m overworked, his shines and the golden rivers in his eyes turn a beautiful sun gold. He\u2019s so perfect I want kick him or squeeze him until he pops. Not out of hate, but out of love\u2014pure, endless, exciting love.</p><p>\u201cThree more minutes and we\u2019ll go to my place to help Jackson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Selena be there, too?\u201d It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen her. She\u2019s been taking introduction classes in everything because it turns out being a police officer wasn\u2019t for her. On her first day in class, she got to watch them fire guns and she discovered she doesn\u2019t like loud noises. I mentally roll my eyes every time I think about it. On the plus side, since she\u2019s been with Jackson, her drinking and smoking habits have been cut in half. Nothing makes you feel like more of an alcoholic than when Selena declines a drink from you. I don\u2019t know how he did it. I\u2019ve tried to get Selena to cut down on drinking since high school, but she\u2019s very stubborn. After a while, I gave up. She\u2019s her own person and although I wouldn\u2019t want her doing anything to hurt herself, I\u2019m not her mother. She can do whatever she wants and all I can do is offer some sound advice from the sideline.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d Seth answers. \u201cIf Jackson finds her and they make up, then probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Finds her? What happened and why hasn\u2019t she called me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably too pissed off to talk to anyone.\u201d</p><p>No, that can\u2019t be it. Selena has always called me when something in her life hasn\u2019t gone her way. She\u2019s called me crying because she kicked her toe. She\u2019s called me crying because her Nan died and she\u2019s called me crying because her driver\u2019s license photo makes her \u2018look like a man.\u2019 My point is she always calls me. I pull my phone from my pocket and dial Selena\u2019s number, bringing it to my ear. After four rings, she answers.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I frown, she seems fine. I keep my eyes on Seth\u2019s chest, but I\u2019m oblivious to the rock hard body hovering above me.</p><p>\u201cSel, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighs. \u201cI am now...I\u2019ve had a very long morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVent to me, it\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson met Dad.\u201d</p><p>My brows furrow. \u201cAnd what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how Dad is and how much he expects from me. Jackson couldn\u2019t handle it, accusing my Dad of being a controlling asshole.\u201d Selena laughs once. \u201cWhich is hilarious coming from him.\u201d</p><p>Now I\u2019m confused. Jackson is controlling? There\u2019s so much Selena has obviously neglected to tell me...and it kind of hurts. As for her dad, he\u2019s a strict man, but I\u2019ve never really seen him try and control Selena. Then again, she refuses to say much about her dad and he\u2019s hardly home. I\u2019ve seen him easily only twenty times since I\u2019ve known Selena. He can\u2019t be too bad if she still lives there and refuses to move out. I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t give her advice about a problem she\u2019s never shared with me.</p><p>\u201cWill you be at Seth\u2019s today? Jackson is moving and we were hoping to have a barbeque?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, we can talk then. I miss you...\u201d</p><p>Selena chuckles. \u201cWe saw each other two weeks ago, but if it makes you feel better, I miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cSee you later, dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you!\u201d</p><p>I hang up and slip my phone back into my pocket.</p><p>\u201cIs she coming?\u201d Seth asks.</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>His full lips curl. \u201cDid she tell you Jackson almost punched her dad?\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyebrows rise into my hair line. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Jackson, her dad is an asshole. Jackson isn\u2019t one to lose control easily, so her dad must\u2019ve said something really messed up to have pissed him off.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows drag together. I\u2019ve never seen Jackson as the aggressive type\u2014at least, not like Seth. Seth can switch his moods at the drop of a hat and the gleam of hate he gets in his eyes whenever someone\u2019s gaze lingers too long in my direction is unnerving...as well as thrilling.</p><p>\u201cI never expected Jackson to do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unpredictable, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime!\u201d Darryl calls from a distance.</p><p>I hear his chair creak and then the glass door open and close, leaving Seth and I alone. Seth\u2019s eyes flick between my eyes and my mouth in a way that makes my heart flutter and my stomach clench. He lowers himself, bending his arms at the elbows.</p><p>\u201cI have food in the car,\u201d I mutter as his lips graze mine, knowing if I let him kiss me I wouldn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014stop there.</p><p>I smile as he moves across my face and kisses the top of my head. \u201cThen we should go.\u201d</p><p>Houses whip past me as I glance over my forearm and out the window. I don\u2019t pay attention to any of them, or at least I don\u2019t until the familiar houses on Seth\u2019s streets whirls into view. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been to Seth\u2019s house and the thought of being so close to him with a bed nearby is exciting. Seth demanded we take his car and leave mine at the gym. Regardless of my protesting, I did what he wanted. You know, the usual.</p><p>As we pull into Seth\u2019s driveway, I spot a huge moving truck at the front.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here already?\u201d I\u2019m pouting. I thought Seth and I could have some alone time before anyone else showed up. Do you know how frustrating it is to have someone like Seth around you all the time but you can\u2019t touch them? All I want to do is to touch him\u2014hell, I even want to lick him, but I can\u2019t\u2014not yesterday, not today, and probably not tomorrow, either.</p><p>\u201cLooks like it.\u201d Seth glances sideways at me and chuckles under his breath. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we have forever to do other things.\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyes widen a fraction as an unflinching Seth scans the driveway in front of us. Does he even know what he said?</p><p>Forever.</p><p>He wants to be with me forever... I love Seth and I can\u2019t really picture my life without him, and he loves me too, God knows he says it enough, but I didn\u2019t know he\u2019s actually thinking about forever...is he even capable of forever?</p><p>Seth shuts the engine off and slips from the car. He\u2019s at my side before I get my door open and flashes me a confident, yet slightly tired smile. That\u2019s what I like most about Seth. He\u2019s a gentleman\u2014well, almost. He\u2019s the kind of gentleman that opens doors for you and then slaps you firmly on the ass as you pass by, all with an unapologetic smile plastered on his face.</p><p>I slide from the car and he closes the door behind me. Seth\u2019s fingers entwine with mine and he pulls me alongside him all the way to the front door. He turns the handle and we enter the house. Boxes litter the hallway and fill the living room. I stop walking when I hear a giggle come from behind a tall tower of cardboard.</p><p>\u201cI got here early, bro.\u201d Jackson\u2019s voice calls out. \u201cI moved all of the boxes by myself...and, uh, you might want to give us a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I angle my head to peer around a box, but I can\u2019t locate their exact position. When I hear a quiet moan, I snap upright. Oh. They need a few minutes because they\u2019re doing that.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool. I\u2019m going to have a shower, anyway.\u201d With a shrug of his shoulders, Seth pulls me into the kitchen, up the stairs, and into his room. I feel better once inside. The last thing I want is to see Selena\u2019s or Jackson\u2019s junk. Don\u2019t they have any shame? First my couch and now this...my God. I would never have sex anywhere there\u2019d be a chance I\u2019d get caught. No way in hell.</p><p>\u201cSo you have that to look forward to now,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Seth strolls into the bathroom and I follow. I lean against the wooden beam of the door when I get to it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new. Jackson and I have lived together before...the shit I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Seth shakes his head before he pulls his white tank top over it. My gaze flicks over his hard chest, following the sharp flow of muscles down to his \u2018V\u2019 shape. I wait for his hands to curl around his shorts and pull them down, but when they don\u2019t, I glance back to his face.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you seen?\u201d I ask, pretending I wasn\u2019t just ogling the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cSelena hasn\u2019t said anything?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really starting to wonder who her best friend is here. Why does Seth know everything and I\u2019m learning things second hand through him? I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cJackson is a very...difficult person to please.\u201d I frown and Seth continues. \u201cSexually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s into certain things. Public sex, being in control, toys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe calls them toys, I call them weapons of torture.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face scrunch up. \u201cAnd Selena...she likes that sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>I watch as Seth opens the shower door and flicks on the water. When he steps back, his fingers curl around his shorts and he pushes them down his legs. My eyes flick over him, taking in every line, every shape and every shade. To be so perfect should be illegal and the punishment? Fifty tongue lashings to every perfect mound of muscle...what the hell is wrong with me? Reluctantly, I drag my eyes back to his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t asked\u2014personally, I don\u2019t really care about their sex life. I am, however, extremely interested in ours.\u201d His lips twitch. \u201cAre you joining me or are you just going to keep pretending you\u2019re not eye-fucking the shit out of me?\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops and an offended gust of air falls out. \u201cI\u2019m not eye-fucking you, I\u2019m admiring your physique. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes and steps closer. I unintentionally hold my breath as his index finger hooks onto the collar of my tank top and he pulls me into the bathroom, shutting and locking the door behind me. I swallow hard as his rough hands slide under my shirt and up the contour of my body. I lift my hands to help him get the shirt off as the room quickly fills with steam.</p><p>His rough hands skim across the skin along my waist and hook onto my bra. \u201cThe look but don\u2019t touch rule doesn\u2019t apply to us anymore.\u201d He smiles.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>I feel my bra loosen and my chest become heavier as my breasts support themselves. I pull my bra down my arms and drop it onto the floor as Seth\u2019s fingers snake into my hair to release my locks from their tie. When he\u2019s done, I slide my shorts down the length of my legs and step out of them. I look at Seth and his eyes darken. A hot flush rolls through me, igniting a fire underneath my skin. It pulsates and flares, burning relentlessly and refusing to settle. I don\u2019t want it to stop and there\u2019s only one thing that can stop the fire tearing through me and it\u2019s right in front of me.</p><p>Seth opens the shower door for me and I slip inside, immediately immersing myself in the hot stream. I step out of the way when Seth enters so he can have some water. I watch as he angles his head down, letting the streams crash into his head and shoulders and flowing down the length of his glorious body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I have some soap?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I grab the bottle of body wash that sits on the top shelf and extend it to him. He doesn\u2019t take it.</p><p>\u201cPut some in your hands.\u201d</p> <p>Doing as he says, I squeeze a large amount into my hand and put the bottle back. Seth steps out of the water, his eyes still closed as small droplets run across his eyelids. Without another word, I reach out to him, coating his chest in a thin layer of soap. I can\u2019t hear his heavy breathing under the crashing flow of water, but I can see his parted lips, and under my hands his chest moves in a slow, deep rhythm. I massage his large, wide chest with my finger tips before flattening my palm and moving lower towards his alluringly stomach. I catch the inside corner of my bottom lip between my teeth as I trace the shallow grooves between each muscle and my body grows warmer every second my skin lingers on his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed your hands...\u201d he mutters as he slumps into himself, completely relaxing under my touch.</p><p>My hands continue to roam him, trailing between bumps of muscle and up his long arms. I\u2019m not sure how long I wash him for...minutes.</p><p>Hours.</p><p>Days.</p> <p>Who knows. What I do know though, is that I feel completely at peace here with him.</p><p>Droplets of water slide over his mouth and glisten like crystals as they reflect the light. The drops pool together, continuing their journey down his chin, and meander over his throat, past his collarbones...I need to put my mouth on those collarbones.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Olivia...\u201d The way he speaks sends vibrations through my bloodstream and directly between my legs. I look at his face\u2014he\u2019s watching me closely. \u201cDid you touch yourself when you couldn\u2019t have me?\u201d</p><p>I never let my eyesight waver from his and I wait patiently for him to smile\u2014or do anything to tell me he\u2019s joking. Nothing happens. His eyes remain on mine, waiting for an honest answer. I ignore his large friend pointing at me and focus solely on his face.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Or at least I tried to. I never got very far because I wanted him to touch me. I tried to picture my hands as his, but they just weren\u2019t thick enough...or rough enough. His lips curl slightly and he steps forward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re naughty.\u201d He chuckles darkly. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p> <p>I swallow hard. \u201cShow you what?\u201d I ask, playing dumb.</p><p>I know exactly what he wants me to show him, I\u2019m just buying myself more time to make up mind.</p><p>\u201cShow me how you touch yourself when you\u2019re thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>I step back and my bare ass cheeks press against the glass. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Touching myself is something I\u2019ve only done in private time and sharing that with someone else seems...odd. He inches closer and snatches my wrist. I gasp as he pushes my own hand between my thighs and moves my fingers slowly against my soft flesh, under his guidance. Almost instantly, I notice an increase in my breathing and my arousal meter tips over the edge.</p><p>Seth brings his mouth closer to mine and his warm breath collides with my face.</p><p>\u201cI want you to do it,\u201d I tell him as I slip my hand from his, making his hard fingers press firmly against my clit.</p><p>It\u2019s exactly what I want\u2014rough and thick. The mere thought of his fingers touching me causes my breath to hitch and my knees to almost buckle. I press the palms of my hands against the glass, keeping my eyes on Seth\u2019s. He leans in close, and I flex my hips against his hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to rub you,\u201d he states. \u201cBut I am going to taste you.\u201d</p><p>His tongue flicks out and runs across the base of my ear lobe before tracing sensually along my jaw. My blood burns as my skin erupts with goosebumps. I roll my head to the side, giving him more flesh to lick as he lowers himself, nipping and sucking at my skin. His strong arm surrounds my waist as his mouth travels over my collarbone, down my chest, and over one of my nipples. I try to dig my fingers into the glass, but end up balling my fists instead as my heads falls back. My chest is heavy, filled with steam, but it\u2019s not the only reason I\u2019m breathing so deeply.</p><p>I rake my teeth over my bottom lip as his hand glides smoothly between my legs, circling slowly. Keeping my hips still is impossible, but I manage to roll it to a slow, almost non-existent pace. I\u2019ve wanted him to touch me for so long and now that it\u2019s happening, I don\u2019t want it to end\u2014not yet. I close my eyes while his mouth brushes over my belly button, across my hip and down to my thigh. A light moan slips from my lips as his hand curls around my knee and he hitches it over his shoulder. I open my eyes and glance down. He\u2019s staring hotly up at me, his eyes halved into lusty slits. Seth opens his mouth and my eyes grow heavier as he sensually slides his tongue directly over my center.</p><p>\u201cOhhh...\u201d I moan, letting my head fall back against the glass. \u201cSeth...\u201d</p><p>The coarse feeling of his facial hair tickles me everywhere, forcing the sensation to build up quickly. My fingers slide across my own hips and into his hair, urging him harder onto me. His teeth move to my clit, biting and nipping. I pull his hair a little too roughly, causing him to moan and I feel it vibrate over every inch of my excited body. Sliding one hand from his hair, I guide it between my thighs and I feel the edge of his lips pressed eagerly against my smooth skin. He moves his mouth slightly, allowing me to feel his tongue dart in and out of me.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit...\u201d I moan.</p><p>My legs start to shake as my orgasm builds rapidly, and as it\u2019s about to tip over the edge, Seth slips out from underneath my leg and grabs my hand, forcing both of our fingers onto my clit. He presses his whole body against mine, forcing my back hard against the glass. His mouth slams against mine, absorbing all of my panting as our fingers quickly rub my sensitive flesh, sending shockwaves of pleasure through me. I jolt forward, moans sounding deep in my chest as I taste my own excitement on Seth\u2019s tongue. His mouth doesn\u2019t let up until my legs quiver uncontrollably and my moans have subsided to deep slow breaths. He sucks my bottom lip between his and slides his hands up my side and around to my backside, pulling me hard against him.</p><p>\u201cYou will rub yourself for me next time.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen Seth so demanding sexually before and it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m ready to go again. I nod my head, pressing my mouth to his and tasting myself for the second time.</p><p>He pulls away and plants a soft kiss on my nose. \u201cLet\u2019s get out and help Jackson unpack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. What about you?\u201d I gesture to his obvious arousal and he smiles, stepping away from me and underneath the flow of the shower before turning the hot water off. His muscles tense as the cooler water runs over his body, taking his erection with it.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have sex?\u201d I ask, confused and disappointed.</p><p>I want to have sex with him. Now.</p><p>\u201cI want to have sex, but not in the shower and not when people are downstairs. When I take you again, I want you to be free to be as loud as you want, and trust me, when that time comes, you will be loud.\u201d</p><p>He turns the shower off and I follow him. As we step out onto the bath mat, he hands me a towel and I run it over my body, drying every droplet and wrapping it around my chest.</p><p>I lean against the shower and watch Seth towel off. He runs the cloth up his arm and over his black tattoo\u2014a tattoo I still have no idea what it represents, but it sure is beautiful. It isn\u2019t tribal, that I know for sure, but the swirls and patterns would have you believe it is. The closer I look, the more the patterns look sharp and angry, but as they pass over the shoulder, the curves become more subtle and peaceful. My gaze drops to the one running across his hip. \u2018If you can make it through the night, there\u2019s a brighter day.\u2019</p><p>I remember the first time I saw it. It was the very first time I saw Seth fight and win. \u201cWhen did you get that one?\u201d I ask out of nowhere.</p><p>Seth glances down and then goes back to running the towel through his hair. \u201cWhen I was sixteen.\u201d</p><p>I gape at him. \u201cSixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I went through a bit of a dark period...\u201d He chuckles. \u201cAnd I thought I was cool.\u201d</p><p>I shift my weight onto my other leg. \u201cDo you regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019d never get a tattoo I\u2019d end up regretting. They all mean something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them? Even that?\u201d I ask, nodding my head toward his shoulder.</p><p>He glances at his shoulder. \u201cEspecially that.\u201d</p><p>I arch a brow and he sighs as he wraps the towel low on his hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably going to think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tattooed on your skin so it obviously means a lot to you and I won\u2019t think something that means so much is stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started my shoulder tattoo when I was seventeen.\u201d He points to his upper bicep and I make no comment on the absurdity of an underage teenager getting a tattoo. \u201cOne day Dad and I got into a huge fight about responsibility\u2014or lack thereof. I got pissed off and being the spiteful asshole that I am, I went and got a tattoo. In the beginning it didn\u2019t really mean anything, just a bunch of angry lines...I would sit in the chair not saying a word and the guy would tattoo anything on me, going purely off my silence.\u201d His finger follows the tattoo up to his shoulder. \u201cOver time, we started talking and I began opening up to him about my father and how he wasn\u2019t impressed with any decision I ever made, even if it was a good one. The tattoo guy\u2014Declan\u2014was fucking brilliant. He helped me through a lot of things.\u201d</p><p>My gaze follows Seth\u2019s finger as he traces his tattoo and then I see it. On his bicep is a bird...just sitting there with its wings at its sides\u2014you can\u2019t see it clearly, it\u2019s made up of shapes and swirls, not concrete lines. As the tattoo progresses, there\u2019s another bird that stretches over his shoulder and onto his chest, wings spread and full of confidence. Now that I see them, I can\u2019t unsee them. They\u2019re as clear as day and I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t see it before.</p><p>\u201cWhen my Dad died, I had the tattoo completed.\u201d His finger strokes the confident bird. \u201cIt might be a shit thing to say, but I think I\u2019m a happier person because of it.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a tight smile and drops his hands to adjust his towel.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t notice the birds before...\u201d I say, changing the subject. I know how Seth doesn\u2019t like to linger on topics about his Dad for too long\u2014not without getting pissed off, anyway.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point. I know they\u2019re there and what they mean, but to everyone else, I\u2019m just another douchebag with a tribal tattoo. Just the way I like it.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, sauntering closer. \u201cYou have a lot of hidden secrets, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperiences, yes. Secrets, no.\u201d</p><p>His arms surround me and the crisp clean scent of his skin filters in through my nostrils. I press my tongue against the roof of my mouth to avoid licking him.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon. Let\u2019s help Jackson and then eat.\u201d</p><p>A single, burning hot tear rolls down my cheek and I swipe it away, blinking rapidly. Why does it hurt so damn much?</p><p>\u201cStupid onions.\u201d I sniffle, dicing the last portion.</p><p>When I\u2019m done, I drop the knife and dab my eyes with my tank top. I quickly scoop up the onions and drop them in with the rest of the salad before tossing it all together. I grab the bowl, a pair of tongs, and a small bottle of French dressing before strolling out the back door and onto Seth\u2019s back porch. It\u2019s a low and spacious concrete deck surrounded by small, sweet smelling bushes and long concrete columns. His backyard is large, filled with tiny fruit trees and huge terracotta pots. Up on the hill at the back is a big pool house with a large swimming pool to match.</p><p>Helping Jackson with his boxes took hours, but he\u2019s almost set up now. I came across a few boxes he refused to let me open for sake of my own \u2018innocence\u2019 which both Seth and Selena found hilarious. Of course, that led to Jackson and Seth bringing up the strip club and how I reacted when Vivian, the stripper, grinded on me and sucked my lip into her mouth. Selena protested the fact I\u2019d never gone to a strip club with her, but I think I convinced her that I legitimately had no idea we were even going. Thankfully, nobody mentioned the incident with Don and I think all those involved appreciated it.</p><p>I look around the backyard. The low lying sun coats everything in a golden light that makes my stomach flutter. Sometimes, it\u2019s the simple things that are breathtaking. Seth is truly living the life here and I feel bad that he has to leave his palace to visit me in Mom and Dad\u2019s house. I place the salad in the middle of the table and drop into the seat across from Selena. Apparently, Seth has to sit at the head of his table, just like my dad did at ours. It feels really nice...like I\u2019m home. Jackson ignores the salad and dives straight into his steak, making a big spectacle of it.</p><p>\u201cMan, these steaks are killer!\u201d</p><p>Selena frowns at him with a small smile on the corner of her lips. I haven\u2019t really spoken to her yet. We haven\u2019t had time alone, but looking at her this afternoon, I\u2019d say she is one hundred percent happy with Jackson and he seems happy with her. I try to picture him pissed off and controlling, but I can\u2019t. He\u2019s too laid back and young to be so...difficult. The only strange thing about them is that they still claim they\u2019re just friends when I thought they were planning on dating after Seth\u2019s amateur tournament.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, it\u2019s legitimately the best thing you\u2019ve ever eaten.\u201d Jackson groans, sucking his finger.</p><p>I grip my glass of red wine and bring it to my lips, taking a sip. Seth\u2019s chesty chuckle draws everyone\u2019s attention and he leans back in his chair, completely relaxed as he drags an index finger across his bottom lip. His dark eyes flick to me and his mouth curls into a cocky, unapologetic smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d he says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wine catches in my throat and I choke, spluttering like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, you two!\u201d Selena groans. \u201cWe\u2019re eating dinner.\u201d</p><p>Jackson laughs, throwing his head back and exposing a mouth full of food. I feel my cheeks burn. I\u2019m glad someone is finding it so hilarious. Seth raises his glass of water to me before taking a mouthful and I scowl at him, but he doesn\u2019t care. He says and does whatever he wants. There\u2019s no censoring him...and maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m so into him. He\u2019s unpredictable\u2014exciting. My scowl quickly melts into a grin and I bite my lip as I scoop salad onto my plate and mix it with my grilled chicken. I can\u2019t be mad about that, I suppose. It was a compliment, a naughty compliment I\u2019d rather he not repeat, but one nonetheless.</p> <p>\u201cRelax, Selena.\u201d Seth laughs, sitting forward in his seat. \u201cMy words have nothing on what you and Jackson were doing on the living room floor when we got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but after the shower you and Olivia took, I\u2019d say we\u2019re even,\u201d Jackson chimes in with a flick of his eyebrows.</p><p>Great. They heard it. I sit my glass down and scoop salad into my mouth, doing anything to prevent myself from being dragged into the conversation. Selena giggles, beaming widely at me and suddenly I\u2019m trying hard not to smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d I ask her through chewed food. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>She flashes me her palms, biting back a smile. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>After that, dinner conversation flowed from naughty to naughtier. All of them are talking about things they\u2019ve seen in movies or strip clubs\u2014not all of them appealing or sexy, either. Here\u2019s an interesting fact I learned, Jackson\u2019s favorite sex position is \u2018doggy style.\u2019 It turns out he\u2019s really into ass slapping and hair pulling. Selena giggles the whole time, agreeing with everything he said. Seth, however, refused to state his favorite, claiming he\u2019s easily pleased and they all work just fine. I refused to add any personal preferences to the conversation. Selena knows almost everything about me and I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t spill any of my likes and dislikes over the dinner table.</p><p>When Selena and Jackson turn to each other for a quick make out session, Seth leans closer to me. \u201cThey\u2019ve been drinking since early this afternoon, just go with it.\u201d</p><p>Drinking since this afternoon? There\u2019s the Selena I know and lov\u2014am used to. I stab the last piece of chicken with my fork and put it into my mouth before dropping the fork back to my plate and pushing it aside. My stomach is heavy and I contemplate cutting my shorts to make more room for my food baby.</p><p>As soon as I finish, Seth and Jackson rise from the table and gather the plates, leaving Selena and I alone. She jumps from her chair and gestures for me to follow her into the backyard. I slide from my chair and follow her. It isn\u2019t until I follow her past the pool house, into the pool yard and she pulls a cigarette from her bra that I realize she\u2019s come all the way out here to have a cigarette.</p><p>She lights her cigarette and inhales deeply. She expels the smoke with a relaxed sigh and looks at me. I feel my brow arched and accusing.</p><p>\u201cJackson doesn\u2019t like it when I smoke,\u201d she says with a small smile.</p> <p>\u201cSo you hide from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hide...okay, yeah, I hide. He\u2019s difficult to deal with and I\u2019d rather not frustrate him.\u201d</p><p>Am I the only who doesn\u2019t know who Jackson is?</p><p>\u201cDid he almost punch your dad?\u201d I ask out of nowhere.</p><p>She shakes her head, almost disappointedly. \u201cYeah...it was fucked up. He doesn\u2019t understand how Dad is. You know how he is, he\u2019s an asshole, he\u2019s strict and he expects a lot from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019ve never really cared what he wanted you to do or become.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, swaying slightly. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s sinking in now. I\u2019m turning twenty-fucking-four and I still act like I\u2019m seventeen. I want to grow up now and I think I\u2019m ready, but I don\u2019t know what I want. I don\u2019t know if I want to live with Dad anymore. I want to travel. I\u2019m not sure if I want to be with Jackson in the long run...I just don\u2019t know.\u201d She rattles off her sentences in a random order, but I manage to keep up. Having a conversation with Selena about growing up is something I never thought I\u2019d share with her. Until recently, she was completely happy with her carefree life. What\u2019s changed?</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you want to be with Jackson?\u201d</p> <p>She drags an inhale through her cigarette, making the red ember at the end burn brightly. \u201cI really like him.\u201d She exhales. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t a long term kind of guy...and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the only one he\u2019s had sex with in the past few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? He cheated on yo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cheating, O. We\u2019re not together and at the time it happened, I was there too, but it felt different.\u201d</p><p>I cringe. Of course she was referring to a threesome. I bite my tongue and ask her what she means by different. I don\u2019t want to hear the dirty details of their sex life, but I am her best friend and she needs to get things off her chest, which means I have to step up to the plate.</p><p>\u201cNormally, when I do those kinds of things I\u2019m okay with it...but the other week, when it happened I felt...almost disgusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it the other girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the other girl was perfect, practically a ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was the problem?\u201d</p><p>Selena shrugs. \u201cI think I was jealous... I didn\u2019t want to share him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww!\u201d I squeal, balling my hands into fists like an excited child. \u201cYou like him! Like, like-like him.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head again, like she\u2019s not happy about it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to like him...\u201d</p><p>She runs her hand over her face and I step closer to her, no longer caring about the cigarette smoke that engulfs me. \u201cWhy not? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s too...\u201d I hear her voice shake and she clears his throat. \u201cHe\u2019s difficult, O.I can\u2019t even begin to explain it to you. You won\u2019t make sense of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>She blows air out of her cheeks. \u201cHe\u2019s very demanding, always needing things done a certain way and with sex, he needs hard and fast, pain and pleasure, all of that shit. He\u2019s damaged\u2014so fucking damaged, and I know I shouldn\u2019t bother with him, but I can\u2019t walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not happy, then leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy, I\u2019m beyond happy with him, but he\u2019s not the kind of guy you\u2019re meant to fall for. He\u2019s the one you fuck once or twice and then move on. He isn\u2019t the one you settle down with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if he isn\u2019t? You should at least try to communicate your feelings with him.\u201d</p><p>Selena laughs once. \u201cYou\u2019re really cute, but Jackson isn\u2019t Seth. He isn\u2019t all badass with the boys and then cute and cuddly behind closed doors with his girl. Jackson is hard through and through and I wouldn\u2019t bring anything deep and meaningful up with him. I don\u2019t want to scare him away.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to tell her to take the plunge, but a swinging gate cuts me off. Selena drops her cigarette and stamps it out as she flicks her hair around her shoulders. From her back pocket she pulls a small bottle of mint mouth spray and sprays it on her tongue. I watch her, curiously as she runs her tongue over her teeth and shifts her weight onto her other leg like we\u2019re just standing here contemplating getting into the pool.</p><p>\u201cI was going to suggest we watch a movie, but skinny dipping sounds much more fun,\u201d Jackson announces, pulling his tight shirt over his head and exposing his rippling stomach. Selena giggles, pulling off her own shirt. She\u2019s looking a little softer these days, more curvy. It\u2019s amazing what a few extra pounds can do to your sex appeal. Her body is banging and Jackson appreciates it, too. Even in the faint glow of the pool light I can see his eyes greedily drinking in her features as she slips her little black skirt down her legs.</p><p>\u201cKeep the underwear on,\u201d I beg as Jackson\u2019s fingers curl around Selena\u2019s underwear and he tugs her closer to him. \u201cFor my sake.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, glowing lights inside rocks surrounding the edge of the pool flick on and I no longer have to rely on the dim light at the bottom of the pool as my main source of light. I glance around the yard, taking in all of the features I missed in the dark. The pool is a standard, jelly bean shape surrounded with dark rocks, giving off the perfect \u2018lagoon\u2019 effect. My gaze follows the pool from the pool house steps, across the water, over the spa and onto a gorgeous, wide sunbed underneath a beautiful, dark rock-like canopy.</p><p>Jackson and Selena stroll hand in hand over to the steps and lower themselves into the water. They laugh and talk and whisper while I sit down on the edge, dipping my feet into the cool water.</p><p>\u201cYou managed to get them to keep their clothes on. Well done.\u201d Seth chuckles, sitting down next to me and dipping his legs into the pool.</p><p>Selena giggles as Jackson pulls her into him. I look over just in time to see his tongue flick out and lick her bottom lip.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cI get the feeling it isn\u2019t going to last too long.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s ankle hooks around mine and I glance down at our legs. I like Seth in shorts. I like seeing the definition in his claves\u2014so thick and perfectly shaped.</p><p>I look back to Selena and Jackson. To me, they\u2019re the perfect couple. Both beautiful, both fun and carefree...I watch as Jackson\u2019s mouth sinks over Selena\u2019s throat and she gasps, wincing...and both unashamed of taking on an audience. I didn\u2019t think anything of it until Selena\u2019s black underwear floats by Seth and I.</p><p>\u201cTime to go.\u201d I groan, pulling my feet from the water.</p><p>With a lazy laugh, Seth rises and follows. He walks closely behind me as I flee from the pool yard and return to the barbeque area. I grab my phone off the table and check the time. Quarter past seven.</p><p>\u201cI should probably go now...\u201d I tell him with a small pout.</p><p>I want to stay with him, to finally sleep in his arms again, but I can\u2019t. Not tonight. With a small nod, Seth goes inside and retrieves his car keys off the bench. I follow him through the house, stepping over empty boxes and scrunched newspapers, before finally exiting out the front door. As we walk up the path, Seth threads his fingers through mine. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile up at him. Like I needed and invitation. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>We approach his white Range Rover and he opens my door for me. \u201cAlways the gentleman,\u201d I say, slipping past him and sliding into my seat.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough and through.\u201d</p><p>His lips curve into his trademark smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to change that.\u201d</p><p>He closes my door and circles the car, climbing in behind the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to change that?\u201d I ask him out of curiosity. Being a gentleman is a good thing.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit me, I\u2019m anything but gentle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. You\u2019re very gentle...\u201d I think about my words. \u201c...when you want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t tell anyone. I punch faces for a living, remember.\u201d He smiles at me as he starts the car. \u201cBeing gentle doesn\u2019t do much to help my intimidation factor.\u201d</p><p>He reverses out of the driveway and I watch his face. The small, happy twitch in his lips sends my heart fluttering. To think I make him so happy with my mere presence.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Olivia.</p><p>The girl who refused to leave a shitty long term relationship with her cheating boyfriend, the girl whose sexual experience dwindles at two, the girl who ignored her work responsibilities the moment someone attractive was interested in her, and the girl who\u2019s too plain when put up against Seth\u2019s looks and out-going personality. Strangely, he sees me as his equal... like I\u2019m just as intense and attractive as he is.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me what your favorite sex position is, by the way,\u201d he says, moistening his bottom lip with his tongue.</p><p>\u201cI like them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them? You don\u2019t have a specific favorite?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but I sure as shit wasn\u2019t going to share it Selena and Jackson.\u201d</p><p>I fold my arms. \u201cOkay, so what is it?\u201d</p><p>He glances sideways at me and then back to the road. \u201cYou wanna know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really wanna know?\u201d</p><p>I slap my palms onto my legs, impatient with his torture. \u201cSeth, come on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you, it\u2019s missionary.\u201d</p><p>A laugh forces its way up my throat and I cover my face with my hands. \u201cMissionary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, missionary.\u201d He seems almost offended. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my hair behind one ear and pull my hands away from my face. \u201cNothing is wrong with it. I just assumed you\u2019d have a favorite that\u2019s a little more...dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I like the others just as much, but with you missionary is my favorite. I like being close to you.\u201d</p><p>My chest stops hiccupping with giggles as an almost shy expression crosses Seth\u2019s features.</p><p>\u201cI like being close to your lips...I like to feel your breath on my face or in my ear and I like it when your hands glide over my arms and shoulders.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me again, biting back a smile. \u201cAnyway, that\u2019s my reasoning. What\u2019s your favorite?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips as I contemplate telling him or not. I don\u2019t want to because my position isn\u2019t the same as his and there\u2019s no way I can come up with a reason as sweet as that. Truth is, the position I like the best is purely for animalistic reasons. I like having Seth underneath me and between my legs. I like taking control of him for a change. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll of the above.\u201d</p><p>He laughs once and slaps the steering wheel. \u201cI knew you weren\u2019t going to tell me, I\u2019m such a sucker! I guess we\u2019re going to have to do them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them?\u201d I squeeze my thighs tighter at the thought.</p> <p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll decide which one drives you crazy the most.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cOf course you\u2019d turn this into a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yes, and it just might be my favorite challenge yet.\u201d</p><p>The car rolls to a stop in front of my house and I linger in my seat a little longer before I unclip my belt. I hate leaving Seth and I hate sleeping without him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about your car. I\u2019ll pick it up for you tomorrow morning and bring it back before you start work.\u201d</p> <p>I smile, remembering that my work is managing my father\u2019s old gym with my current professional fighter boyfriend. My life was so different a few months ago...who would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d be here now.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I can catch a bus to the gym or walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. Your car will be here waiting for you when you\u2019re ready to leave.\u201d</p><p>I nod, not wanting to upset Mr. Bossyboots. I lean across the center console and kiss him on his lips. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He kisses me back. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Tell your brother I said hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I grab my backpack off the floor between my feet and exit the car. Before I close the door, I turn to Seth and say, \u201cIt\u2019s sitting on you, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>He arches an eyebrow. \u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>I casually sling my backpack over my shoulder. \u201cMy favorite position...it\u2019s sitting on you.\u201d</p><p>His lips part as I close the door and step onto the sidewalk. Without looking back, I open the gate, walk up the path, and enter the house. My body buzzes at the thought of sexually frustrating him, and if that isn\u2019t going to keep him up tonight, then I don\u2019t know what will.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Seth</p><p>Holy fucking hell. I have half a mind to turn my car around, kick her door down and force her to ride me...I can\u2019t imagine her mother or her brother appreciating that very much, though. I smile to myself. What a sexy little minx. She did it on purpose, too; undoubtedly because I chose not to have sex in the shower tonight which, by the way, was a fucking hard decision, especially after I already had her taste on my tongue. I didn\u2019t avoid having sex with her purely because I wanted to rock her world without demeaning her in front of Jackson and Selena who, let\u2019s face it, love to torment her every chance they get. I also didn\u2019t have sex with her because I wanted to show her that I\u2019m more than happy taking care of her without wanting anything in return...girl\u2019s love that shit, right?</p><p>\u201cI like being close to your lips...I like to feel your breath on my face or in my ear and I like it when your hands glide over my arms and shoulders.\u201d</p><p>To think the whole time I was thinking romantically, Olivia\u2019s train of thought was the complete opposite of mine\u2014naughty. I never intended to say that to her. It just flowed so easily from me, without thought and it wasn\u2019t the first time today I\u2019d said something I never intended to. I told her this afternoon that we\u2019d have forever to do other things. What the hell was I thinking? Olivia and I haven\u2019t really spoken about the future. I\u2019m certain I want to marry her and be with her forever, but I know she doesn\u2019t expect that from me and I don\u2019t want to come off too strong. Will I ever have the balls to ask her what she wants? Will I ever have the balls to ask her to marry me? I\u2019ve come close to asking a million times, but I pussy out at the last minute. It\u2019s not like me. I\u2019m very upfront. I say what I want and ignore the consequences, but I can\u2019t fuck this up. It needs to be perfect. It needs to be everything she\u2019s ever wanted. When I said \u2018forever,\u2019 I felt her eyes on me\u2014analyzing me. I wanted to look at her, to read her expression, but I didn\u2019t for sake of being scared to see her displeased. I felt the disbelief in her posture. It was an uncertain hunch, like she was unsure if I\u2019m for real or not.</p> <p>I am.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been more certain of anything in my life. I need Olivia. I need her to wear the ring I give her, carry my last name, and live in the house I buy for us and our family, if we have one. I haven\u2019t asked her yet because I\u2019m scared. What if she says no? What if this relationship is only fun\u2014temporary? I can\u2019t handle that. I can\u2019t take no for an answer and I won\u2019t. To be without her isn\u2019t an option. I run my hand over my face. There I go sounding like a fucking serial killer again. I can\u2019t help it, though. In my mind it\u2019s her or nothing.</p><p>I open my door with caution, unsure of what I\u2019m walking into. Knowing Jackson, he\u2019d start in the pool and finish somewhere between the kitchen and the front door, doing God knows what. I slip inside and close the door behind me. The house is quiet. There are no moans\u2014or screams\u2014it\u2019s silent, as if everyone is in bed. With a sigh of relief, I kick off my shoes and pinch the bridge of my nose, hoping to fend off some of my tiredness until I get into bed.</p><p>\u201cHey man, you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>I stop in my tracks, slowly turning my head toward my living room. Jackson is sitting on the couch shirtless, but with pants on\u2014thank fuck\u2014and a cold beer in his hand. I scan the living room, looking for Selena. I wait a few seconds before I respond, expecting her to pop out from somewhere. She doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Jackson says, sipping on his beer.</p><p>I notice the way his jaw clenches and on Jackson, that\u2019s never a good sign. I wasn\u2019t gone longer than an hour, but I guess that\u2019s plenty of time for them to fuck and fight.</p><p>I stroll into the living room and drop into the armchair, crossing my legs at the ankles. I never ask Jackson what happened. Usually, I wait until he finds the right words.</p><p>\u201cI think I fucked up...\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, not yet.</p><p>\u201cShe called me again.\u201d</p><p>My chest tightens and I sit forward in my chair. \u201cAmelia?\u201d</p><p>He nods, taking another large sip at his beer. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t called me in months, not since I moved to Portland...I wasn\u2019t expecting her to call me ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told Selena to check my phone, thinking it was you, and she asked me who Amelia was.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell her, Seth. I don\u2019t ever want her knowing who Amelia is...what she did\u2014what I did.\u201d</p><p>I nod. Amelia was Jackson\u2019s first love. The woman who literally chewed him up and spat him back out. She\u2019s a real piece of work\u2014a sadistic, controlling whore who loves nothing more than to fuck with people\u2019s minds. Feelings, love and sex...to her it\u2019s one big game.</p><p>\u201cAlways playing games,\u201d I scoff, crossing my arms.</p><p>\u201cYou should have seen Selena\u2019s face...\u201d Jackson rakes a hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cShe went to bed straight after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t gone up yet?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes flicking to his mobile phone. Motherfucker. He\u2019s waiting for Amelia to call back. Fuck no! She\u2019ll never talk to him again, not if I have anything to do with it. I launch myself out of my armchair, grab Jackson\u2019s phone and throw it, sending it crashing against my wall and falling into bits and pieces on the carpet.</p><p>\u201cFuck that shit, Jacks. What are you doing sitting down here and waiting for her to call you back? Don\u2019t you remember what state you were in the last time you let her sink her claws into you?\u201d</p><p>I do. I remember it clearly. He was fucked up on everything, drugs and alcohol\u2014he was borderlining a trip to the mental hospital, that\u2019s how fucked up he was. No way am I going to let him go through that shit again.</p><p>Jackson barely bats an eyelid as I tower over him.</p><p>\u201cPut the goddamn beer down and get your ass upstairs before you do anymore damage.\u201d</p><p>Jackson may not admit it\u2014ever\u2014(and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m admitting it) but Selena is good for him. She\u2019s a lot like him in a way and can certainly take a lot of his shit. I thought Jackson was moving on from Amelia, the grown-ass woman who ruined his teenage years.</p><p>Obviously not.</p><p>I can\u2019t say what happened between them exactly because I don\u2019t know. Jackson refuses to tell anyone the full story.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t look her in the face, I can\u2019t explain what just happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t, but don\u2019t sit down here leaving her alone all night upstairs with her own thoughts. You know how girls are, they over-think things.\u201d</p><p>He drops his head.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I demand, my voice coming out a lot more aggressive than I really feel. He hesitates before dragging his green gaze to mine. \u201cWhen you first met Selena I told you to stay away because I didn\u2019t want your fucked up issues to ruin my chances with Olivia and somehow, I get the feeling you not going upstairs right now will do just that. You might be having fun and Selena might not mean much to you, but Olivia means the world to me and I won\u2019t let you fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>He grits his teeth before raking the top row across his bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena means a lot to me...\u201d</p><p>I feel my face straighten out in surprise. There isn\u2019t much that can surprise me anymore, I\u2019ve seen it all...but this I didn\u2019t see coming. \u201cThen prove it.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Jackson rises to his feet and slams back the rest of his beer. He hands the empty bottle to me and I take it.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGladly.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t move until he disappears through the kitchen. When he\u2019s gone, I stroll from the living room into the kitchen. I drop the empty beer bottle into the bin and flick out the lights before sauntering up the stairs in the darkness. When I reach the top, I hear quiet murmurs of conversation coming from their room. I hope he tells her and I hope she takes it well\u2014whatever \u2018it\u2019 is, and if he doesn\u2019t tell her, I hope one day he\u2019ll reveal his story, if not to me, then at least to someone he loves.</p><p>(T-minus five days until Vegas)</p><p>\u201cRoll into him, get away from his legs!\u201d Darryl orders and I follow, rolling my hips and getting out of Jackson\u2019s submission. I push off of him, my chest burning heavily. Coming mainly from boxing, my ground work isn\u2019t too great and it takes a lot out of me once I\u2019m down. My main goal in any fight is to keep standing, be quick, and never give my back to the opponent. I get that once you\u2019re on the ground it\u2019s difficult to defend yourself when they\u2019re on top and punching you in the face, but the last thing you should do is roll over and give them your back. Rear naked chokes fucking suck and will have you tapping out like a bitch within seconds. Unfortunately for me, my first opponent is world wrestling champion, Junior Moset, known for his killer ground game and hardcore submissions.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Darryl exhales, putting his stopwatch down and stepping onto the mat.</p><p>We turned one of the training rooms into a private room for me, complete with my very own cage and training mats. The MMAC had issues with the way I trained and would prefer me to follow some of their methods\u2014mats, ropes, gloves\u2014everything.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll show you how to prevent a rear naked choke,\u201d he says, sitting on the mat. He nods his head to Jackson and he slides in behind Darryl. \u201cMost rear naked chokes will come in from behind.\u201d</p><p>He shifts backwards and Jackson wraps his legs around Darryl\u2019s waist, attempting to hold him across the chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is for your opponent to connect his hands, because it won\u2019t take long for him to wrap that arm around your neck. As one hand comes over the shoulder and the other underneath the opposite arm, push your shoulders up and keep your chin down. Then, grab the upper and clamp down on the second so he has no mobility. When you\u2019ve done that, drive to the underhook side and put the back of your head on the floor.\u201d</p><p>I watch as Darryl plays it out with Jackson.</p><p>\u201cAs that happens, let go of his arm and wriggle until your shoulders and hips are firmly on the ground. As you get out\u2014and any good grappler will do this\u2014your opponent is going to try and roll on top. When he does,\u201d Darryl slides out from underneath his opponent, establishing a half guard. \u201cGo either half guard or full guard, keep him away with your legs, and work on getting yourself back to your feet.\u201d</p><p>Darryl jumps to his feet. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>I drop into a seated position on the mat as Jackson wraps his legs around my waist. As his hands come around to choke me from behind, I grab his arm, clamp down, and drive myself to the side. I follow Darryl\u2019s orders step by step until I\u2019m on my back and keeping my opponent away with my feet.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Darryl cheers. \u201cA few more techniques and hopefully we can perfect your ground work before the fight.\u201d</p><p>I climb to my feet and Darryl slaps me on the back as Jackson hands me a bottle of water. He smiles at me\u2014a genuine smile\u2014and I assume he and Selena made up last night. They were gone before I got up this morning. I stroll over to the windows and hit the button so I can see out into the gym. We\u2019re doing pretty well today\u2014especially for this early in the morning. Classes are cranking, we have boxers, runners, cyclists, and rowers all doing their thing. It\u2019s good to see Rick\u2019s gym thriving without him. He\u2019d be very proud if he was here with us now. The elevated, happy feeling I\u2019ve got in the pit of my stomach drops the moment I see him step through the door. My stare rakes over his bald head and seedy face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I swear, dropping my water bottle to the ground and tearing my door open.</p><p>I hear Jackson and Darryl curse and call my name, but I don\u2019t stop. No way in hell can I ignore that piece of shit walking around my gym.</p><p>\u201cDon!\u201d I shout, drawing the attention of a few gym goers.</p> <p>Him and his two boys turn slightly and they all smirk at me. I clench my fists. I can take them all, right now.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, Mr. Professional Fighter. Long time no see.\u201d I grit my teeth together at the sound of Don\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cSeth, don\u2019t do it,\u201d Jackson tells me. \u201cLet someone else deal with him.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him. Don is my problem, not anyone else\u2019s. He\u2019s heading for the stairs to the office, too and there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019ll let him within ten feet of Olivia. I march right up to him, slipping in between him and the stairs. My entire body is clenched and ready to go. Don looks the same\u2014bald head and an angular face with a jaw made of glass. I know because I almost shattered it the last time we fought. I came close to breaking his arm, too.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d come down and check out the gym set up of Portland\u2019s favorite fighter.\u201d His smile widens. \u201cThat\u2019s a mighty cute billboard you\u2019ve got outside, too.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson laughs. \u201cMighty cute? Jesus Christ.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019s amused expression doesn\u2019t falter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Don?\u201d Darryl chimes in, but I don\u2019t take my eyes off of the bald asshole in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI want to speak to the manager. My friends and I are looking for a new place to train.\u201d He turns to his friends. \u201cWhat was her name? Pretty face, big, green eyes and a killer rack...\u201d He snaps back to me with a click of his fingers. \u201cOlivia, yeah, that\u2019s it. She\u2019s the manager, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>I start forward, but Jackson slips in front of me, barely pressing his hands against my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked too hard, Seth,\u201d Darryl adds.</p> <p>Don straightens his grey t-shirt and smiles wryly. \u201cIsn\u2019t that nice?\u201d</p><p>He attempts to step around me, but my arms shoot out and I shove him backwards. With a growl he launches forward, but Darryl grabs him, forcing him a few steps back and into his friends. Jackson\u2019s heels are digging into the ground, his shoulders pressing against me as he fights to keep me back from Don.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I hear her voice before I see her green eyes peer up at me from around my waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Jackson steps away, knowing I\u2019d never bowl Olivia over to get to Don. I glance down at her and there\u2019s a worried expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the girl I wanted to see.\u201d Don chuckles, licking his lips.</p><p>Darryl steps back, but keeps his position between Don and I. Olivia\u2019s face falls and her eyebrows draw together. Slowly, she turns around and when she sees him, her shoulders square. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He steps closer and Darryl doesn\u2019t budge. \u201cI\u2019ve come to scout a new gym. Some welcoming committee you have here. Do you treat all potential customers like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d</p> <p>I step closer to her, pressing my front against her back and planting my hand on her hip for support.</p><p>Don nods slowly, clearly pissed off. What did he expect? Does he seriously think we\u2019ll open our doors to him?</p><p>\u201cI see how it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, Don,\u201d Darryl demands, his fingers flexing at his sides.</p><p>Don runs his hand over his bald head. \u201cFine.\u201d He looks Olivia dead in the eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you when your dogs aren\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>I step around Olivia, my chest rumbling with anger. I don\u2019t know what happened next. There\u2019s a whole lot of shouting and people grabbing at me, and all I see is Don\u2019s face through a red haze. There are too many hands on me to count and I know more people have come to prevent me from smashing Don into a million pieces. Don is torn from the gym and I storm across the floor, ignoring all of the scared stares. I head straight for my training room, hearing smaller footsteps slap the floor behind me. He pisses me off and I fucking hate that I know I deserve all of it. Everything he\u2019s doing to me and Olivia is my fault. I can\u2019t even remember his girlfriend\u2019s name...that\u2019s what\u2019s really messed up. I always blamed her for what happened. I\u2019d always tell myself the she was the one that was unfaithful, not me\u2014which is true, in a way. I mean, I sure as shit I didn\u2019t force her to have sex with me. I can assure you she decided that on her own. I feel shit about it now, because I can\u2019t help but wonder if the girl I took from Don was his Olivia. What if she was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, but she turned out to be unfaithful? I\u2019m not going to call her a whore or a slut because, well, what does that say about me? It wasn\u2019t her fault, not entirely.</p><p>Anyway, screw that. Don has done way too much shit for me to feel sorry for him now though, and every time I see his face, I can\u2019t help but think of his intentions with Olivia. I\u2019d die before I\u2019d let his unnerving gaze rest upon her naked perfection\u2014and the fucking nerve of him showing up here to talk to her!</p><p>I grab a fifty kilo boxing bag off the floor and throw it, desperately needing something to take off the edge. I want to fight and I want to fight right now. I pace the room, not once looking at Olivia, who steps away from the door and makes her way slowly over to me.</p><p>I feel her tension rolling off of her in waves and when I finally lift my eyes to her face, I can see she\u2019s trying desperately to hide it. My heart beats rapidly in my chest, sending adrenaline and anger through my veins. There\u2019s an ache there too, an ache that\u2019s trying desperately to cut off air to my lungs. I breathe quick and deep through my nose to prevent myself from really going off.</p><p>\u201cI was so close to throwing it all away,\u201d I tell her. \u201cOne hit is all it would\u2019ve taken and I was willing to do it.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWhy does he get to me so easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon is irritating...he makes everyone want to kick him, it\u2019s just who he is.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help the twitch that pulls at my lips. \u201cI thought that if I beat him, he\u2019d go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a cockroach. He isn\u2019t ever going away,\u201d Darryl says, scratching the top of his dark hair. I didn\u2019t notice him come in behind Olivia. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably be right behind you for the rest of your life and you need to deal with it\u2014not with your fists, but with your brain.\u201d</p><p>Jackson casually slings his arm around a dummy and says, \u201cYou have what he wants and he isn\u2019t going to stop until he\u2019s higher than you\u2014problem is, he\u2019ll never be higher than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugs, her long dark hair sprawling further across her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s simple. Ignore him and walk away. A person like Don doesn\u2019t like to be ignored. He craves the thrill of attention. Don't give it to him.\u201d</p><p>The ache in my chest dulls, lessening my anger as well. I don't think I\u2019ve had so much support in my life. It feels good.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I breathe. \u201cI\u2019m in the pros now...I need to think about my career.\u201d</p><p>Darryl claps, making the stopwatch around his neck jolt. \u201cNow that\u2019s sorted, we\u2019ve got training to do. Grappling, let\u2019s get into it.\u201d</p><p>After seeing Don, training flew by and Darryl seemed to be impressed with my \u2018aggressive\u2019 approach. It helped to picture Don\u2019s head on Jackson's body, although I don\u2019t think Jackson appreciated it much. Especially when I hit too hard and split his lip. Olivia watched all of the ground training, but fled the room once we took it into the cage.</p><p>Later, she resurfaced to tell me she\u2019s going home and she\u2019ll meet me at my house later tonight. I walked her to her car just to be safe, even though she told me it was unnecessary.</p><p>\u201cReady to go?\u201d Darryl asks, shutting off the training room lights and pulling me from my thoughts of this afternoon.</p><p>It\u2019s late, the sun barely high enough to produce proper lighting. All I want is to go home, have a shower, and spend the rest of the night in bed with Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I grab my shirt and pull it on over my head.</p><p>My arms felt weak. We spent the whole day in the gym working on improving techniques and all I want is to rest.</p><p>We stroll from the room and give the main area a once over before slipping out the door and locking it behind us.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow six a.m.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>I fish for my keys out of my pocket and out of nowhere a hard fist drives into my kidney, throwing me forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grunt as another fist clips the side of my cheek, causing my brain to roll in my head. In defense, I launch forward, ducking an arm and slamming someone in the ribs. Before I can throw another, a fist connects with my mouth and it starts to burn as an old cut splits against my teeth. Thick arms seize mine, pulling me upright to face the man in front of me. My eyes scan over a bald head and dark, green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou motherfucker,\u201d he growls. His arm snaps out and slams into my ribs, forcing the air out. \u201cYou think you can disrespect me?\u201d</p><p>Another hit to my ribs has me hunching in pain. Fuck. It hurts to breathe. Don grabs a fistful of my hair and I spit blood at him. What a pussy, attacking me in the parking lot unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cHey, Seth, tomor\u2014\u201d I keep my eyes on Don as he whips around to see Darryl standing there. Darryl\u2019s car keys crash to the concrete and all emotion drains from his face. He has a cold look in his eyes, like he's out for blood. He starts for Don and when he reaches him, Don throws a right hook that Darryl ducks before his fist connects with Don\u2019s jaw. Don stumbles under the force of Darryl\u2019s punch\u2014stunned that a man Darryl\u2019s age can rock him with one punch. Suddenly, I'm released and I waste no time diving forward to help Darryl. Don's friends push Don out of the way, concealing him behind their back and they come down hard on Darryl and I.</p><p>Darryl holds his own, fending off two guys as I take on the last. He\u2019s slow compared to me, and even with the pain searing through my chest, I out punch him a million to one. I grab his head and drag it down before I slam my knee into his nose. I feel warm, sticky blood seep down my leg and I let the guy go as he stumbles backwards clenching his face. Darryl is curled up on the ground next to me as two guys kick him with all the force they have. I launch for them, but Don joins the fight again, coming out of nowhere and thrusting himself into me. I stumble backwards as he grabs the collar of my shirt and swings. I just managed to duck it as he drops my shirt and delivers another strong hit to my ribs. Pain flares and my knees buckle. I fall to the ground, groaning and clenching my sides.</p><p>\u201cLearn some fucking respect,\u201d he growls before whistling to his dogs and storming off.</p><p>Moaning, I drag myself to my feet, cradling my ribs. I didn\u2019t see that coming and I\u2019m too hurt to be pissed off right now, but tomorrow, when my brain isn\u2019t swelling against my skull, he\u2019s a fucking dead man. I watch as Darryl pulls himself to his feet, his face already bruising.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d I ask, spitting blood onto the concrete.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d He coughs and winces, clenching his stomach. \u201cI\u2019m not the one with an interview next week\u2014look at the size of the cut on your lip.\u201d</p><p>I run my tongue along it, feeling the tenderness immediately. Darryl reaches out and begins poking and prodding me, making sure nothing is broken and thankfully, nothing feels broken. Weak assholes couldn\u2019t even do a decent job</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to fucki\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything, Seth.\u201d Darryl exhales, running his hands over his face.</p><p>All pain drains from my body. \u201cYou\u2019re not serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to deal with this professionally, police and everything. You can\u2019t risk losing your career over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I was with Olivia tonight? What if she got hurt instead of you?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow. \u201cYou\u2019re my main concern, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d I snap.</p><p>I\u2019m too tired and too battered for this shit. Dropping my gaze, I shove my hands in my pocket, angrily digging for my keys. When I get them, I turn from Darryl and storm to my car.</p><p>Wincing, I slide in and slam the door before turning my car on and zooming away. The aches of my body fade away as I try to come up with something to tell Olivia. I don\u2019t want her to come over tonight. I don\u2019t want her to see me like this.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Olivia</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Chase laughs, tilting his head back. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad.\u201d</p><p>I hold the photo of him at fourteen closer to the computer and point at his horrible undercut.</p><p>\u201cLook at it! How can you look at that and think it looks good?\u201d</p><p>Chase laughs again, this time running a hand over his tired face.</p><p>Our Skype session with Chase ended early last night because he was called out on duty at the last minute, so we rescheduled for tonight. I smile, looking at my brother. The buzz cut suits his strong face\u2014much better than his undercut did.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Seth?\u201d he asks, genuinely interested.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I bite back a smile. \u201cI\u2019m staying at his place tonight.\u201d</p><p>His face scrunches and he flicks his hand at me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>Growing up, my brother and I told each other everything. Even though we had our own friends at school, we\u2019d always come home and hang out with each other, sharing gossip about the other kids. We continued to share secrets and information up until we both became sexually active...after that, it got real awkward\u2014especially when Chase started sleeping with a few of my friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the hidden pocket in my dress, my phone buzzed. I know it\u2019s either Seth or Darryl. They\u2019re closing the gym early tonight and they said they\u2019d call to let me know when it\u2019s all locked up. I slip my phone from my pocket and glance at the screen\u2014\u2018Darryl\u2019\u2014thought so.</p><p>Taking the phone call as a heads up, I let it ring out, knowing it\u2019s nothing important.</p><p>\u201cIs that Seth? Do you need to go?\u201d</p> <p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Seth\u2019s coach, Darryl. He said he\u2019d call me when the gym is all locked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet. How\u2019s the gym going, anyway?\u201d</p><p>I smile widely. \u201cIt\u2019s going great, actually. We\u2019ve tripled our sign ups.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes again, drawing my attention and I frown. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d I grab my phone.</p><p>\u201cDarryl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia...\u201d He sighs in a tone that sends dread spiraling into the pit of my stomach. \u201cI\u2019m heading over to Seth\u2019s now...I think you should meet me there.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the top of the desk and seeing nothing but Seth\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOli\u2014\u201d Mom steps out of the kitchen and I silence her with a flash of my palm.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d I ask slowly, wondering what the hell could have happened in the gym.</p><p>\u201cNot really, no.\u201d Piece by piece, he rattles off what Don had done to them. Mom and Chase watch me and I can see their mouths move as they ask questions, but I can\u2019t hear them. By the end of it, my hands are shaking and my vision glazes over in a red haze. Don jumped them in the parking lot? Seth is hurt?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p> <p>I hang up and leap from my chair, raking my fingers through my hair.</p><p>\u201cO?\u201d Chase asks, his face hard. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d I shake my head, unable to repeat what Darryl told me.</p><p>\u201cLiv?\u201d he says, using his nickname for me. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve heard it and it immediately clears my head. O, Olly, Liv, sometimes it\u2019s hard to keep up.</p><p>\u201cSeth is hurt.\u201d</p><p>Mom gasps, her fingers reaching up to bridge her lips.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>I slip my phone into my pocket and run into the kitchen, grabbing my keys off the rack.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later,\u201d I tell Mom without looking over my shoulder. \u201cYou too, Chase.\u201d</p><p>I slam the door behind me and my heart begins to race as it all sinks in. I look at my phone. Why hasn\u2019t he called me?</p><p>I practically jump into my car and speed away, going way over the speed limit. In the cup holder my phone buzzes and despite the risk, I grab it and read the message.</p><p>FROM: SETH. TIME: 7:08PM</p><p>Going to bed early tonight. Tired. Sorry.</p><p>I drop my phone and press down harder on the accelerator. I shake my head, upset that he neglected to mention he\u2019s hurt in his vague text message. I know he doesn\u2019t want to see me, but I\u2019m not turning around, not when I know he\u2019s hurt.</p><p>I make it to Seth\u2019s house in record time. His car is there\u2014and so are Darryl\u2019s and Jackson\u2019s. I park on a small angle along the road and barely wait before I turn my car off to get out. Unintentionally, I slam my door and my heart beats harder. Anxiety claws at my chest because I know he doesn\u2019t want to see me right now and I can only imagine how bad his pride hurts. My palms begin to sweat and I rub them together, praying that what I\u2019m about to walk into isn\u2019t going to be anything more than a busted lip.</p><p>I shake the thought from my mind. If it were me, he\u2019d never leave my side. The round door knob fits perfectly into the palm of my hand and I turn the handle slowly before slipping into the hallway. Jackson is on me in an instant. His hair is disheveled and I swear I can feel the stress radiating off of him in intense surges. \u201cHeads up, he\u2019s in a really bad mood right now. We\u2019ve checked him out. There are no broken bones or fractured ribs, but he\u2019s a little bruised.\u201d</p><p>I slip past Jackson with a nod, ignoring both Selena and Darryl that sit on the couch, staring at nothing. I look at Seth. He keeps his gaze on the floor in front of him, not looking at me once, although I know he knows I\u2019m here. My heart swells in my chest as I scan his body. I see tiny droplets on his skin from a recent shower and even though he\u2019s in pain...I still feel the familiar desire flood my system. That desire quickly molds to anger as my eyes rests on his bruised ribs.</p><p>\u201cCan you guys leave us alone for a minute?\u201d I ask, never taking my eyes off Seth.</p><p>He tilts his head up and his dark eyes flick to my face. At this angle, I can see the cut high on his cheek bone and the one on his lip has been reopened.</p><p>When I hear the back sliding door close, I step forward, never dropping eye contact with him. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d I ask, first and foremost.</p><p>His jaw clenches. \u201cI think we both know I\u2019ve seen better days.\u201d</p><p>I ignore his attitude. I can\u2019t hold it against him, I\u2019d feel the same if I was in his shoes. Trying a different approach, I step closer and take his hand in mine. I tug on it and he pushes himself to his feet, gritting his teeth against the pain of the bruising. I pull him along\u2014through the kitchen up the stairs and into his room. I want privacy. I want to talk to him and take care of him...because he is mine to take care of.</p><p>I close the door and wait until Seth has lowered himself on the bed. I flick the light off and kick off my shoes before sliding onto the bed next to him. Out of instinct, I reach out to him, running the open palm of my hand up his damp, hard body. The fresh scent of washed skin fills me and I slide closer, desperately needing to comfort him. As my hand passes over the side of his ribcage he flinches and I pull my hand back, gritting my teeth against a new bout of anger. After a few seconds, I touch him again, purposefully avoiding his tender ribs.</p><p>I run my hand over his chest and he grabs my wrist, pulling it up to his mouth and kissing the tips of my fingers. I feel the uneven swells on his lip and my chest almost constricts.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fight back?\u201d I ask as he let my hand go and I move back to sliding it over his stomach.</p><p>\u201cOf course I fought back,\u201d he growls and it sends vibrations up my arms and through the rest of my body. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. They caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>I scowl, trying to picture how it all went down. I noticed Darryl looking a little beat up when I walked in, as well. Don attacked them both? I\u2019m so mad words can\u2019t even begin to describe it.</p><p>\u201cHow could Don do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>Seth scoffs, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, O. I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t happen sooner. These are the consequences of being an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshole or not, you don\u2019t deserve to be beaten. He has to pay for what he did. We need to get him back, somehow.\u201d</p><p>Seth shifts on the bed, turning his body toward me. \u201cHe will pay for what he did, but he will pay legally, not physically.\u201d</p><p>I hear the skeptical tone in his voice and I know he wishes it was the other way around, but there\u2019s no way Darryl or Jackson is going to let Seth get revenge on Don.</p><p>Seth\u2019s large arms surround me and he pulls me into him, holding me slightly against his body. I close my eyes briefly as his thumb strokes my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201d</p><p>I feel his body tense and he lets out a slow exhale. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want you to see me like this...this isn\u2019t how a man should look\u2014all bloodied and bruised.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI should have come out on top, if not for me, then at least for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any less of you. In my eyes, you\u2019re still amazing\u2014beyond amazing. I love you. You should\u2019ve called me instead of lying through text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. You\u2019re guilty by omission.\u201d</p><p>His chest fills with air and he expels it with a defeated sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I should have called you.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, I pull away from him and he rolls flat on his back. I rest my head on my hand and I don\u2019t say another word as I let my fingers trail his torso, feeling every line and muscle. His skin is soft and smooth, and my fingers glide over the surface easily, as if he were coated in baby oil. It bothers Seth to know he can\u2019t get back at Don, but I can. I can\u2019t get back at him physically, of course. There\u2019s no way I can go toe to toe with Don, even on a good day, but I don\u2019t have to lay a finger on him to bring him to his knees. Darryl knows we recently had cameras installed in and around our gym. I know he\u2019s going to use them against Don legally, but I want to be the one to tell him. I want to see Don\u2019s heart crash and watch everything he\u2019s worked so hard for become an unattainable dream.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I waited for Seth\u2019s breathing to even, but it eventually does and in the dim lighting seeping through the bathroom door, I can see Seth\u2019s face. It\u2019s the perfect picture of calm. I drag the tips of my fingers from his chest down to his obliques. My fingers slide over the impressions and grooves and I feel his muscles contract briefly before completely relaxing under my touch. It sends a flustering heat through me and I can\u2019t help myself. I run my finger along the band of his shorts, tucking the tip of my index finger under the fabric. A deep, sleepy moan falls from Seth\u2019s lips and it sends an electrical current through me\u2014igniting my skin from my head to my toes. The urge to slip my hand in or to take him in my mouth while he sleeps is strong\u2014so strong I don\u2019t realize I\u2019m digging my fingers into his skin to stop myself from going further. Seth sighs, shifting his body in my direction. Oh, crap. I slip my hand away from him and roll out of the way before he can pin me beneath his large body. Believe me, there\u2019s nothing more I want right now than to be pinned between Seth and a comfortable mattress, but I have revenge to dish out.</p><p>I know when Seth finds out what I\u2019m about to do he\u2019s going to flip, but hopefully he sees that I did it for him... well, kind of. I\u2019m also doing it for me. Nothing will make me happier than knowing Don will never be in the same circles as Seth and I. He needs to be knocked down a peg or two and I\u2019ll happily be the person to do it.</p><p>I slip off the bed and tip-toe to my shoes, putting them on one by one. I straighten myself and waste no time in opening the door and running from the room. As soon as I close his door behind me, adrenaline flares through my system, pumping hard and fast and kicking my heartbeat up a notch. I don\u2019t know much about Seth\u2019s sleeping pattern so I have to get out of here before he notices I\u2019m gone. I speed walk through the house and out into the backyard. Jackson, Darryl, and Selena are chilling in the barbeque area, not saying a word.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Don, Darryl?\u201d I demand, placing my hands firmly on my hips.</p><p>Darryl frowns, confused. Then, his eyes widen and he leaps from his chair. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d he demands in a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go see Don?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to see him. I\u2019m going to destroy him.\u201d</p><p>He steps closer. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that, Olivia. Seth will flip the fuck out and come looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask, emphasizing my words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind if you think I\u2019m going to send you to Don on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with her,\u201d Jackson offers, pushing himself off of a chair next to Selena.</p><p>\u201cJackson, you saw what they did to Seth. You\u2019re not going,\u201d Selena protests.</p><p>Jackson ignores her, keeping his eyes on Darryl. With a frustrated exhale, Selena pulls a cigarette from her pocket and ignites it, inhaling deeply. Jackson\u2019s eyes shift, zeroing in on her. Selena\u2019s green eyes settle on his face, almost like she\u2019s challenging him. Without hesitating, he yanks the cigarette from her lips before crushing it beneath his sneaker. Selena rolls her eyes, expelling the smoke before glancing at me. I guess she wasn\u2019t kidding when she said Jackson hates her smoking.</p><p>There\u2019s a warning in Jackson\u2019s eyes before he turns them on Darryl. \u201cI know where he is. C\u2019mon, O.\u201d</p><p>Jackson grabs my arm and pulls me forward, but Darryl steps in front of us, blocking the door. \u201cIf Seth wakes up and finds you gone, he\u2019s going to come down here looking for you. What do you expect me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cTell him the truth. I won\u2019t hide anything from him.\u201d</p><p>Darryl laughs once, running his hands over his face and pinching the bridge of his nose. \u201cTell him the truth? Are you insane? If I tell him the truth, the only thing standing between him and you and Don is me, and I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed or not, but I\u2019ve already been treated like a fucking boxing bag today.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I step closer to Darryl. \u201cYou can go home. You don\u2019t have to have any part in this.\u201d</p><p>He blinks at me.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Darryl, move. I need to do this.\u201d</p><p>He exhales, shaking his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll be at his gym on Weir Road. He has a night time training schedule on Tuesdays.\u201d</p><p>Before I can say thank you I\u2019ve already pushed past him and headed out the door with Jackson in tow.</p><p>I drive fast, occasionally noticing Jackson wipe the palms of his hands over his jeans from time to time.</p><p>\u201cAre you scared of Don?\u201d I ask, gripping the steering wheel out of my own fear.</p><p>He snorts, like I\u2019ve said something ridiculous. \u201cDon couldn\u2019t provoke fear in me even if he was a hundred feet tall and fifty feet wide.\u201d</p><p>My brows furrow.</p><p>\u201cSeth, however,\u201d he shakes his head. \u201cis a different situation entirely.\u201d</p><p>I chew my bottom lip. I\u2019ve seen Seth angry before, but I haven\u2019t seen him as angry as this will undoubtedly make him. Strangely though, I don\u2019t feel bad about it, and if I get out of this okay, then no harm done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can take you back...it\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want to see Don\u2019s smug face fall when you tell him. I\u2019ll risk pissing off Seth for that.\u201d</p><p>I clench the steering wheel again. \u201cYou really think he\u2019ll flip out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah, he is going to go mental.\u201d</p><p>Nervously, I unhand the steering wheel and slip my index finger into my mouth and begin to chew at the nail.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should crash at Selena\u2019s tonight...after this I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m going to be too welcome,\u201d he thinks aloud.</p><p>Eager to change the subject away from Seth freaking out, I ask, \u201cSpeaking of you and Selena, what\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>He counters instantly, \u201cWhat\u2019s she told you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing, that\u2019s the thing...she usually tells me everything, but lately, nothing. I\u2019m trying to decide if it\u2019s because she\u2019s too happy or too unhappy.\u201d</p><p>Jackson runs his fingers through his hair. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re both grownups now and don\u2019t need to share gossip like a pair of giggling teenagers.\u201d</p><p>I glance sideways at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI\u2019ve told Selena things about me that I\u2019d prefer she never repeats\u2014even to you.\u201d</p><p>I wonder what\u2019s so bad about Jackson\u2019s past that has him so damaged? Seth claimed his own life was complicated, but besides a dead father, drunken mother, and a sister who ran away to Vegas with her wannabe rock star boyfriend, his life isn\u2019t too bad.</p><p>\u201cThere was a girl...\u201d I prompt him, my eyes flick to him. I see him tense.</p> <p>\u201cNo, there was a woman. \u2018Girl\u2019 implies there was some kind of vulnerability or innocence about her.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of emotion to his tone, not love or longing, but hate...disgust. He swallows hard, as if trying to get rid of a bad taste.</p><p>\u201cWas she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re cool and all, but I don\u2019t want to discuss what I went through with that whore. I haven\u2019t even told Seth the whole story and we\u2019ve been friends forever.\u201d He flexes his fingers. \u201cI promised myself I\u2019d keep my hands to myself when I see Don tonight, but I can\u2019t if you\u2019re going to try and get in my head. As for Selena, if she was unhappy, she\u2019d leave.\u201d</p><p>\u2018If she was unhappy, she\u2019d leave.\u2019 That\u2019s true. I\u2019ve known Selena long enough to know she doesn\u2019t do anything she doesn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cThird building on your right,\u201d Jackson mumbles, causing my heart to shoot into my throat.</p><p>Suddenly, this feels like a bad idea. Images of Seth filter into my mind with his discolored ribs and busted lip...it\u2019s enough to clear my head and allow me to group my thoughts.</p><p>Don hurt Seth.</p> <p>Don is going to continue to hurt Seth until he takes everything from him.</p><p>I slam my foot on the brakes and the car jolts to a stop, sending Jackson and I shooting forward before our seatbelts catch us.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Jackson grunts.</p><p>Without hesitating, I unclip my seatbelt and fumble to get my keys out of the ignition. Anger courses through me as I think about Don and how he\u2019s using me as a pawn in his game to get revenge on Seth. I keep moving erratically, knowing if I slow down now, my anger will fade. I need to act while it is still white hot.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I grumble at Jackson as I shoot myself out of the car.</p><p>Without closing my door, I storm across the small parking lot and towards the modern gym in front of me. Jackson falls into step beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo fighting,\u201d I clarify.</p><p>He agrees, \u201cNo fighting.\u201d</p><p>I slam my hands into the glass doors, pushing them open to let me through. I ignore the stares from late night gym goers and enter the main room. I eagerly scan the room for a tall, bald dickbag. When I spot him standing by the boxing, ring chatting and laughing with a massive guy who has a fresh swollen eye, I lose it. Inside, a pressure begins to build in my stomach before spilling over and filling my chest. I want to scream and cry. I want to kick him until he can\u2019t move...but I can\u2019t do any of that. That\u2019s what he wants...and I will never give him the satisfaction of getting what he wants.</p><p>Instead of raging and mauling him to death with my claws, I plaster a wide smile on my face and stroll casually toward them. The hulk-like man slaps Don on the shoulder and nods in my direction. When Don\u2019s slimy gaze falls onto me, my skin crawls like a bucket of baby spiders have been poured over every single inch of my body.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he purrs, leaving a bad taste in the back of my throat. \u201cWhat a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>He smirks, turning his attention to Jackson. \u201cI see you only brought one of your dogs. The others weren\u2019t feeling up for the trip?\u201d</p><p>I step forward, desperately wanting to slap him or spit on him, but Jackson\u2019s finger hooks around the thin strap of my dress and pulls me backwards. I let out a slow, steady breath. \u201cSomething like that,\u201d I reply bluntly. \u201cTell me, what\u2019s the next event you\u2019ve got coming up?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI have a fight scheduled.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not in Vegas, though, is it?\u201d</p><p>An electrical current flows through me as Don\u2019s smirk fades and just like that I\u2019m addicted to hurting him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry your pretty little head about me. I\u2019ll get to Vegas one day and I\u2019ll go through your boy to get there.\u201d</p><p>I stick my hands into my dress pockets. \u201cSee, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Seth will make sure you never fight again.\u201d</p><p>Don chuckles and looks over his shoulder at his friend, who also happens to find what I said hilarious.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it to you, sweetheart, but the only way Seth is going to stop me from fighting is if he breaks both my legs.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOr if he has proof you hurt him and his coach and turns it in to the MMAC.\u201d</p><p>Don folds his arms over his chest in an attempt to come off as intimidating. I analyze his face, watching familiar emotions flicker over it. Disbelief shows first, followed by fear, then frustration before his lips finally curl upwards in a smug grin.</p><p>\u201cNice try, but you can\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>Jackson lets my dress go and I take it as an indication to go in for the kill. I step forward. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to scare you, Don. Everything you and your friends did was caught on camera.\u201d</p><p>His smug smile falters, straightening into an impassive line. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking lying,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I shake my head, smiling ever-so slightly. \u201cAfraid not.\u201d</p><p>Don watches me closely for a few seconds and when he realizes I\u2019m not fucking around, his eyes become glossy with various emotions. I can tell his brain is confused, unsure which feeling it wants the rest of the body to feel first. I know I shouldn\u2019t be enjoying this as much as I am, but I can\u2019t help it and the exciting, addicting feeling of seeing Don weak spurs me on.</p><p>\u201cLook for a new career, because this one is closed to you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like flipping on a switch\u2014one second he\u2019s dark and brooding and the next he\u2019s bright and alive, punching the massive guy behind him and dropping him to his knees. The force behind the hit jolts me back to my senses. Holy. Shit.</p><p>He turns his dark eyes on me. \u201cIf he uses those tapes I swear to God I\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard, taking a few small steps backwards and it isn\u2019t until Jackson\u2019s hand plants firmly on my back that I stop. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your bed. Lie in it.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019s arms shoot out and he grabs my forearms, squeezing me with unnecessary force. I gasp and grit my teeth against squeezing my eyes shut. I won\u2019t appear weak in front of him.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, asshole,\u201d Jackson demands, keeping his hand on my back for reassurance.</p><p>Don ignores him, his dark, green stare remaining solely on my face. \u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he almost whispers. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me!\u201d The rest of his sentence comes out in a mighty roar and it\u2019s so loud my head spins with a mild case of shell shock. He shoves me backwards and I don\u2019t stumble as Jackson\u2019s hand stabilizes me. Jackson launches himself forward, stepping in front of me. I can feel panic rising in my chest at the thought of Don and Jackson getting into a fight right now. I grab Jackson\u2019s arm and tug him backwards.</p><p>\u201cNo fighting,\u201d I shout and he glances over his shoulder at me, clearly frustrated that I still want this meeting fist free. No longer interested in us, Don tears around the gym, punching and throwing things like we don\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jackson demands, grabbing my elbow and pulling me towards the exit. People stare at us like we\u2019re criminals while others cower like we\u2019re going to kill them and when we pass a mother and her young boy no older than twelve. I stop. The mother grabs her son and pulls him into her.</p><p>\u201cIf you use it\u2014\u201d Don shouts but we don\u2019t look over our shoulder. \u201cIf you fucking use it\u2014look out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter before Jackson nudges me out of the gym.</p><p>I inhale the cool air, filling my lungs to maximum point and my hands begin to shake. I flex and shake them a few times in an attempt to get them to stop, but it doesn\u2019t work. I pull my car keys out of my pocket and hand them to Jackson, who\u2019s as calm as the eye of a storm. \u201cCan you drive?\u201d</p><p>He nods, takes the keys, and heads for the car.</p><p>I follow him and climb into the passenger seat. He drives me back to Seth\u2019s house, neither of us saying a word about what happened tonight. I use the tips of my fingers to massage my temples, hoping to gain some composure. My heart is racing, not because of what I did, but because I know Seth will be up and waiting for me when I get home. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do, or what he\u2019s going to say, but I do know what I did tonight satisfied me and I won\u2019t apologize for it.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Seth</p><p>With a groan, I roll off my stomach and aching ribs and onto my back. Sleeping is definitely going to suck for the next few days. I run my hands over the mattress in search of Olivia\u2019s warmth.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Slowly, I open my eyes and stretch further, feeling only the cool bed.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d I grumble, my voice husky with sleep.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>What the hell? I push myself up into a sitting position ignoring the pain in my chest and the throbbing headache behind my eyes. I slide off the bed and waver uneasily on my feet before I slowly make my way out of the room. Downstairs, the lights are on and I can hear voices speak in low, cautious tones. I stroll through the kitchen and into the lounge room, frowning as my gaze settles on Selena and Darryl. Selena\u2019s eyes widen and she quickly averts her gaze before adjusting her dress and shifting uncomfortably on the couch. I look at Darryl and he analyzes my bruises at first, before his eyes flit to mine.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Olivia?\u201d I ask and I swear I see Selena flinch out of the corner of my eye.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out,\u201d Darryl replies.</p><p>Selena rises to her feet, drawing my gaze as she steps around the couch before trotting into the backyard. Alarm bells begin to ring as she closes the door behind her.</p><p>I lean against the wall. \u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer and Jackson...\u201d he clears his throat and rubs the back of his neck,\u201c...went to see Don.\u201d</p><p>I push off the wall as powerful anger rages through me, making my throat curl tightly around my words. Surely I heard that wrong. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe went to see Don...\u201d</p><p>My jaw clamps down and I grit my teeth together. I let out a slow exhale, trying not to completely flip the fuck out. \u201cAnd you let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a choice. It was me against Olivia and Jackson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you let him take her?\u201d I\u2019m shouting now, unable to keep my cool. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? How long have they been gone?\u201d</p><p>I pivot on my heel and storm into the kitchen, searching for my keys. I have to go and get her. Darryl strolls in behind me. \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time looking for your keys. Jackson took them so you couldn\u2019t follow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Needing to take my anger out on something, I grab the fruit bowl off the bench and throw it across the kitchen. A familiar tightness overcomes my chest and my breathing deepens. I can feel panic rising inside me, but I can\u2019t calm down. Not until I see Olivia. Olivia...why the hell would she go and find Don? Is she out of her mind?</p><p>\u201cSeth, calm down.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cCalm down? You want me to calm down? Look at me. I\u2019m fucking bruised and beaten because of that asshole and I wake up to find my girlfriend has gone to pay him a visit. Sure, I\u2019ll calm down when she\u2019s here and safe with me. You want to hope for your sake there isn\u2019t a fucking scratch on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t need this shit. I\u2019m sore too, and I have a family that I need to spend time with before I have to get up early to train your ungrateful ass again.\u201d</p><p>Darryl turns and storms from the room. A few seconds later, I hear the front door slam shut. A growl tears from my chest and I grip the edge of the bench, squeezing as hard as I can. I can\u2019t just sit around and wait, I need to do something\u2014anything. Freeing the bench from my grip, I turn from the kitchen and march up the stairs. I flick my bedroom light on and head straight for the boxing bag hanging in the middle of my room. A nauseating pain cramps my stomach and I want to be sick...tossing the hanging gloves to the floor, I swing my fists into the bag, clenching my jaw against the pain every time I connect. If I don\u2019t punch or fuck until I\u2019m exhausted, there\u2019s no getting rid of the anxiety. It lingers, gnawing at me until I completely lose my mind and I\u2019m worried if I don\u2019t calm myself enough before Olivia makes it back (if she makes it back) I\u2019m going to both say and do something stupid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When my arms refuse to connect with as much force as I intend, I stop punching. Forty minutes I stood here punching this bag and still no Olivia. I squeeze my eyes shut and roll my head from side to side. I\u2019ll have a shower and if she\u2019s not back by then, I\u2019ll walk\u2014fuck it\u2014I\u2019ll run to her.</p><p>After I\u2019ve washed my body, I lean my head against the tiles, hoping any second now she\u2019ll come through that door. When I hear the bathroom door click shut, relief washes over me. The relief fades just as quickly as it came when I remember why I\u2019m feeling so shitty in the first place. Olivia left me while I was sleeping to go see my enemy...</p><p>I shut the shower off and stand for a little while longer, letting the excess water run off of me. When I\u2019m done, I step out and she immediately hands me a towel. Without looking at her, I grab the towel and run it over my face. I have no idea what I\u2019m going to say yet and I\u2019m buying time, trying to talk myself out of saying something stupid. I drop the towel and wrap it low on my hips, and finally, I look at her and she almost flinches. She fingers the small black buttons that run up the front of her dress.</p> <p>\u201cDon hurt you\u2014and Darryl. I had to do something,\u201d she says without any prompting from me.</p><p>\u201cSo you thought you\u2019d go and handle it without me?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth and they ache slightly. I\u2019m doing that way too much tonight. \u201cDo you know how worried I\u2019ve been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping.\u201d She lowers her voice. \u201cI\u2019m capable of handling myself.\u201d</p> <p>I almost laugh and she scowls at me, no longer intimidated. She thinks she\u2019s capable of handling herself against a fighter who would love nothing more than to get back at me? Yeah fucking right.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, one hundred and thirty pounds? I could lift your entire body weight on my fucking big toe, yet here you are walking around like you can\u2019t be touched.\u201d</p><p>Her thin, well-shaped eyebrows pull together. \u201cDon hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I snap. \u201cHe hurt me. Let me deal with it.\u201d</p><p>She steps toward me and digs her skinny index finger into my chest. \u201cYou can\u2019t control me, Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t control you? You think this is about controlling you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I pinch the bridge of my nose, trying for the one millionth time to control myself... and I fail. \u201cThis is about you!\u201d I yell and she takes a defensive step back, swallowing hard. \u201cEver since I met you, you do stupid things that put you in danger! You have no consideration for anybody\u2014you\u2019re selfish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m selfish?\u201d she scoffs. \u201cI am far from selfish!\u201d</p><p>She turns from me and attempts to leave the bathroom, but I grab her by the elbow and pull her back, slamming the door shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d I warn, holding her tightly against me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am.\u201d</p><p>She tries to pull her small frame away from me and gets nowhere. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting her go. Not yet. I drop my hand and grip her hips, lifting her and placing her on the counter. I slip between her legs and anchor her hips so she can\u2019t get away.</p><p>Her eyes flare with anger and it stirs something wicked inside me. \u201cI\u2019m warning you, let me go.\u201d</p> <p>I almost smile. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Olivia?\u201d She claims she can handle herself and I want her to show me. She struggles against me and nothing happens. \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything to help yourself and that\u2019s why you need me. We are together. We\u2019re meant to make decisions together. Isn\u2019t that what a relationship is? I mean, shit, you were the one in a relationship, so tell me why I\u2019m the one giving you the advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, let me go.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze her harder. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She shuffles her hips forward abruptly, trying to slip off the counter. I grip her legs and yank her hips forward, forcing her thighs to wrap tightly around me. She gasps and presses a hand against my wet chest, arching her back in an attempt to lean away from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go until you tell me I\u2019m right. You know I am.\u201d</p><p>She straightens her spine, bringing her delicious body closer to mine and getting right in my face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So fucking stubborn.</p><p>Her warm breath caresses my face and I look at her perfect lips. I lurch forward, slamming my mouth to hers. Her hands immediately slide around my neck, pressing me harder against her. I reach under her dress and roughly pull her panties to the side. She gasps against my mouth, dragging my bottom lip between her lips. I can see it in her face, she\u2019s pissed off, but she can\u2019t possibly be as pissed off as I am.</p><p>I grasp the fabric of her dress and pull it open, sending buttons scattering along with my thoughts and exposing her body to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuc\u2014\u201dI lace my fingers in her hair and force her mouth back to mine. Her ankles lock around me, pulling me closer\u2014so close I can feel the heat radiate from her.</p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m right,\u201d I demand against her mouth.</p><p>She bites down on my swollen lip, not giving a shit that it\u2019s sore. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her quick, shallow breaths hit my skin as she lowers her mouth to my neck and licks my clean flesh. I feel her hands grip my towel and a second later it falls to the floor. Cool air clings to my skin, spurring me closer to her. Her lips suck and nip at my neck while her fingers wrap around my extremely hard length. She guides it toward her opening\u2014right where she wants me. I feel her wetness on the tip of my cock and I can\u2019t help myself. I groan, thrusting deep and hard. Olivia cries out, sending white hot arousal through my body, forcing me to go hard and fast .I look at her face. Her eyes are closed and her mouth is agape as she pants heavily. I grab her low on the hips, forcing her to move against me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you until you tell me I\u2019m right,\u201d I rasp, dropping my mouth to her collar bone.</p><p>I run my hands up her back before I entwine them in the base of her hair. I pull hard, tilting her head backwards and she moans loudly, my name sharp on her lips. Who would\u2019ve thought my sweet Olivia likes it rough? I drag my lips over her collar bone and up her neck. Every time I move inside her, I get closer and closer to release. I can feel her tightening around me and it\u2019s making it harder to hold on. I yank her bra down, letting her tits spill over the cups and I take one in my mouth. She presses her chest deeper into my mouth all while digging her nails into my flesh.</p><p>I pull away. \u201cYou fucking like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She rakes her teeth over her bottom lip, shaking her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m just humoring you.\u201d</p><p>I smile a little before pulling out and thrusting all of the way back in. She inhales sharply and grips me tighter. I pull her off the counter, grabbing her backside in large handfuls and whirl around on my heel, bracing her hard against the bathroom wall. Gravity forces her to settle fully onto my length and I clench my jaw as my body hums with intense sexual energy. Olivia leans back, showing off her perfect breasts that bounce every time my hips collide with hers. My fantasies of Olivia never do her justice. Her soft, pliable body is perfection from the strands of chocolate hair on her head to the hot fuck noises she makes as I thrust into her. I pull back from her and slip out. She groans, her eyes closing briefly and I bite the inside of my lip against a smirk. She\u2019s frustrated, although she\u2019ll never admit it. With a trembling breath, I propel myself back into her.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Her cry echoes around the bathroom, bouncing off the tiles and hitting me right in the sweet spot.</p><p>I moan, dropping my mouth to her neck as her hand reaches out and she turns the door handle.</p><p>\u201cBed. Now,\u201d she demands in a husky pant.</p><p>I crush her against me, pulling her away from the wall and out into the bedroom. She rakes her fingers through my hair, harshly tugging on it and forcing my mouth to hers. Fuck the bed. I want her on the couch. My legs move quickly and I drop her onto the white fabric. Her eyes snap to mine and I know she\u2019s going to protest. Before she gets the chance, I grab her waist and flip her around. She rests over the back of the couch and glances at me over her shoulder with an uncertain look...the sight alone is enough to make me come. I kneel on the edge of the couch, lining myself exactly where I want to be. I grab her hip with one hand and her ass with the other, squeezing with enough pressure to let her know I\u2019m not going to be gentle. She started this. If she wants rough, she\u2019s going to get rough. I\u2019m going to fuck her hard until she comes and is begging for me to forgive her. She\u2019s a tiny woman but it isn\u2019t like she\u2019s made from glass. I enter her with a harsh thrust and she cries out at once. I watch her reactions every time the tip of me reaches maximum point, enjoying the way she claws at the couch as her body lurches from the impact. Her fingers dig into the fabric in an effort to keep herself steady. There are no pauses as I rear back and rock forward again, sheathing myself all the way to the hilt.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she mewls, grinding backwards on me. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>With a growl, I pump her faster and harder. Every time, I pull back, she slams herself back onto me and I feel her muscles grip me tighter. The firmer she gets, the closer I come to, well, coming. I grit my teeth and slip my hand off her hip and around her stomach before gliding the tips of my fingers between her legs and into the creases of her sweet pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she moans, her body speeding up in its movements.</p><p>I feel her legs begin to tremble and I know she\u2019s close. As I circle her, I pound her harder and harder until she can\u2019t breathe, until she\u2019s trying to crawl away from me. One more thrust has her clenching me tightly and melting down with me deep inside her. The sound of her being taken away into bliss with my name a husky rasp on her lips is enough to send me over the edge and I sink over her, pressing my body against her back and unconsciously sinking my teeth into her shoulder as a powerful release surges from me.</p><p>We rest in a piled heap on the couch until one of us has enough energy to move. When my arousal wears off, the ache in my body comes back full force. Shit. I should\u2019ve taken it a little easier. Without a word, Olivia slips out from underneath me and storms to the bathroom, shutting the door with a small slam behind her. I guess she\u2019s still pissed off that I called her selfish. I get it, it was a little harsh and I don\u2019t believe she\u2019s selfish, not like I am, anyway. She\u2019s done lots of selfless things for me, neglecting her job, for one. But when I called her selfish, I meant in terms of her decisions. She doesn\u2019t think about how her decisions affect anyone else\u2014getting involved with me affected Mason and her mom. Going to dinner with Brent affected me\u2014seeing Don affected me. She doesn\u2019t think and that\u2019s the one thing that bugs me above all else. I have every right to be mad, not her.</p><p>I push myself off the couch and stroll over to my wardrobe, not wanting to shower for the third time tonight. I grab a pair of sweat pants and slide them on before strolling to bed and climbing in. I lie flat on my back, choosing the least painful position for the best chance at getting some sleep. A few minutes later, Olivia emerges from the bathroom, her hair damp and sticking to her clean skin. Helping herself, she pulls a tank top from my wardrobe and a pair of black sweatpants, matching mine. Her eyes flick over to me as she pulls the white top over her head and covers her bare breasts. My gaze falls onto her shoulder, where I\u2019d bitten her. It\u2019s a little red; I didn\u2019t cut the skin, but it might bruise.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d I ask, trying to keep the detached tone in my voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her response is clipped and blunt and I can\u2019t help a small smile. She can\u2019t stay mad at me forever and I\u2019ve already forgiven her. Hell, my heart forgave her the moment she stepped into the bathroom, but my dick refused to. It wanted to punish her, to make her scream...it got what it wanted and now I know I have to apologize for calling her selfish, but my damn pride won\u2019t let me. I can\u2019t. If I apologize, it means I won\u2019t do it again and that I can\u2019t guarantee. I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019m not going to say it again or say something even worse next time because that\u2019s what I do. According to Dad, I take every good thing I get and destroy it. I don\u2019t deserve good. I deserve nothing because I don\u2019t appreciate anything. Some inspiring, fatherly words right there.</p><p>Olivia stalks toward the door with a frustrated sway in her hips. She flicks off the light, plunging the room into total darkness. I wait a few seconds before I feel the mattress sink slightly. I know she\u2019s got her back to me and instinctively, I reach out for her. Before I touch her, I quickly pull my hand back. All I want from her is a \u2018sorry I left without saying anything.\u2019 Is that so hard?</p><p>I wait for a very long time...just waiting for her to sigh and apologize.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>And it isn\u2019t until she mutters for someone to clean their machine and shifts in my direction that I realize I\u2019m not going to get one, at least, not while she\u2019s sleeping, anyway.</p><p>Allowing myself one last feel of her skin before I drift off, I slip my hand underneath her shirt and run the palm of my hand down the side of her waist and over the rise of her hip. A soft sigh of relief escapes her and her body relaxes even more as she falls deeper into sleep. I pull my hand back and sling it over my head, covering my eyes.</p><p>Why are we both so fucking stubborn?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Olivia</p><p>(T-minus four days until Las Vegas)</p><p>I stretch, spreading my legs and arching my back before I open my eyes. As they flutter open, I take in my surroundings and the sleeping giant next to me. He has an arm slung over his face and I can just see the cut on his lower lip. Dread rolls through me as I recall last night. It wasn\u2019t a dream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Awesome.</p><p>I watch Seth for a little while longer, trying to find the right way to apologize. I know I\u2019m the one in the wrong. I know I should\u2019ve told him my plans and I definitely shouldn\u2019t have ignored him until I fell asleep last night, but what he said hurt me. I\u2019m not selfish...I can\u2019t be, not to him. I\u2019ve given up so much for him. I chose him over my job. I chose working at the gym over my writing. I haven\u2019t opened a Word document since we got together. I don\u2019t have time. Between Mom, Seth, and the gym, I can\u2019t do the things I want to do, but I\u2019m happy with that. Is that selfish? Is being there for him selfish? I grit my teeth.</p><p>No.</p> <p>Seth shifts, moving his arm and rolling onto his side. His face contorts in pain before straightening itself out. My muscles relax from a cramp I didn\u2019t know I had. The thought of Seth waking up and being as angry as he was last night terrifies me. The dark, murderous look in his eyes when he stepped out of the shower last night is something I never want to see again. The sex was really good though, I can\u2019t complain about that. I didn\u2019t anticipate it happening, but he was so angry and intense and I wanted him to take it out on me, to punish me for leaving him. I reach out and run the tip of my finger over the back of his hand\u2014the same hand that had gripped me so tightly last night as he fucked me hard and fast, sending endless amounts of electrical currents pulsing through me. I pull my hand back and squeeze my thighs together and wince at the tenderness. I\u2019m a little sore, last night was...passionate, to say the least.</p><p>I sigh. Seth is used to getting his way and I know he expects me to cave in and apologize first...but I need him to know I won\u2019t take him talking to me like that. I am his equal, not a child\u2014even though my actions say otherwise.</p><p>I leave the bed and cringe at the ache in the muscles between my legs. Today is not going to be comfortable, that\u2019s for sure. I tip-toe from the room and down the stairs. Surprisingly, Selena is here eating breakfast at the counter. When we got home last night, Selena and Jackson left to stay at her house...Had they come back? Had they heard Seth and I last night?</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Selena smiles tightly, licking her spoon. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>I run my hands over my face and lean on the breakfast bar. \u201cWe argued.\u201d And had epic sex. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really spoken since then...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Jackson demanded we come back this morning so he can talk to Seth.\u201d She flicks her head toward the backyard. \u201cHe\u2019s been sitting out there for over an hour now.\u201d</p><p>I look out the glass door and see Jackson sitting there on the chair, his face tired and worried.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep last night,\u201d she adds.</p><p>\u201cPoor guy...It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>I hear heavy footsteps coming down the stairs and my entire body goes rigid. Seth is either going to ignore us, which I can handle, or he\u2019s going to lose his mind and kick the shit out of Jackson.</p><p>I don\u2019t turn around to look at him as he steps into the kitchen and Selena drops her gaze to her bowl.</p> <p>\u201cGood morning, Selena,\u201d he says coolly and I hear the fridge door open.</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d she mutters, confused. \u201cGood Morning.\u201d</p><p>I frown, looking over my shoulder and watch as he pulls a small bottle of milk from the fridge. He opens it and takes a long sip. When he puts it back, his eyes flick to me.</p><p>\u201cI see waking up without you is becoming a routine.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrow in on him and Selena shifts uncomfortably in her seat. He waits for a response, watching me unapologetically. He\u2019s not in the least bit uncomfortable about arguing in front of other people. Realizing I have no response for him, he strolls past me, running a hand over his chest and through his already disheveled hair as he steps outside and closes the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was awkward,\u201d Selena mutters and bites her bottom lip as I glare at her.</p><p>We watch as Jackson rises from his chair. His lips move fast as he explains last night to Seth. With every word, Seth\u2019s features darken and his hand shoots out, gripping Jackson by the collar and pulling him into him. Selena and I gasp, frightened a fight is about to break out. How the hell are we meant to stop that? Jackson remains cool and neutral\u2014not scared, not worried\u2014nothing. It\u2019s like he\u2019s been through this a million times. Seth drops Jackson and storms back into the house. Selena looks away again, pretending she wasn\u2019t watching the interaction between the two boys. I don\u2019t look away. As Seth\u2019s dark gaze settles on me, I stare right back\u2014sadly, getting a little heated by the intensity in his face. He marches past, keeping eye contact until he passes me and heads back up the stairs. When he\u2019s gone, I pull a sour face.</p><p>\u201cWow, there really is a wedge between you two right now.\u201d</p> <p>I sigh. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019ll end up in an argument. He wants me to apologize...\u201d</p><p>She quirks an eyebrow. \u201cSo do it. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>Offended, I blow a gust of air out of my cheeks. \u201cGeez, tell it like it is much? I\u2019m not going to apologize first. He called me selfish.\u201d</p><p>Granted, when I say it aloud it sounds childish and stupid, and the look on Selena\u2019s face tells me I\u2019m not far from the truth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t apologize first. Not to Seth.\u201d She doesn\u2019t understand what he\u2019s like. He thrives off power\u2014he loves getting exactly what he wants. That\u2019s why he smiled at me last night before I switched the lights out. He expects it from me, but he won\u2019t get it until we\u2019re on equal ground\u2014until he engages me in a loving conversation.</p><p>She gives me another one of those \u2018you\u2019re a moron\u2019 looks and I turn away from her.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any clothes here? I need to borrow some,\u201d I call over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a bag on Jackson\u2019s floor,\u201d she replies when I\u2019m halfway up the stairs. \u201cApologize, O. It\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and finish climbing the stairs. I sneak into Jackson\u2019s room and find Selena\u2019s bright purple suitcase open on the floor. Thankfully, Selena has been wearing jeans and shorts more often since being with Jackson, so when I fish through her clothes, I easily find a pair of jeans and a light cotton shirt to wear to work. I take the clothes to Seth\u2019s room and fortunately for me, he\u2019s in the shower. I get changed, managing to only just pull the shirt over my head as he enters the bedroom. I fight hard against the urge to let my eyes roam his body. I want to. I want to push him onto the couch and lick him everywhere, tasting his clean skin on my tongue as he entwines his fingers in my hair, pulling until my scalp burns.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d His rough voice snaps me back to attention and I realize I\u2019m staring.</p><p>Goddamn it!</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My voice comes out a lot more frustrated than I expected it to and I feel like an idiot.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I take in his fully clothed body, embarrassed that I completely zoned out thinking about all of the things I\u2019d do to him.</p><p>\u201cYep, let\u2019s go.\u201d I whirl on my heel and stroll from the room.</p><p>In the car, neither of us speaks. It\u2019s stupid, really. We aren\u2019t mad anymore, but we\u2019ve started a war we want the other to finish. Seth knows I\u2019m competitive, like I know he\u2019s competitive, and I can only see this game ending badly, but I can\u2019t swallow my pride.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>I flinch away from the training room window as Seth slams his fist too hard into his partner\u2019s ribs. I see his flesh ripple and his ribs bend, reacting to Seth\u2019s force. The guy drops to his knees and Darryl bangs on the cage, throwing his clipboard across the room. Gritting my teeth, I push open the training room door. Seth knows to keep the windows blacked while he\u2019s sparring, I don\u2019t want to see it\u2014not unless I have to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re injured!\u201d Darryl shouts. \u201cIf you keep going full strength, it\u2019s going to take longer to heal, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>On the sideline, Jackson shakes his head at me, warning me off, but I\u2019m not going anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWill you take it easy?\u201d I demand, approaching the ring and crossing my arms.</p><p>Seth turns his sweat-coated body in my direction, instantly making my breathing quicken. His chest moves quickly and his eyes are dark, like fresh coal.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep hiring spar partners because you break your old ones. They\u2019re humans, not toys!\u201d</p><p>He watches me for a little while, his intense eyes never relenting, before he turns away. When his partner catches his breath and rises to his feet, they square off again. To further my point, I stay rooted in my spot and watch them circle each other. The guy launches forward and Seth sidesteps him, driving his fists twice into his partner\u2019s side and the other straight into his face. My insides clench, sending waves of fear curling through me.</p><p>Like a tree cut from the base, he sways minutely before crashing to the ground with a loud thud. Seth casually turns to face me and I swallow down the sickness I feel in the pit of my stomach as he approaches the edge of the cage. He crouches, getting as close to eye level as he can.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, I\u2019m going to need a new one, and if it\u2019s not too much to ask, get me one that can actually take a punch.\u201d</p><p>And just like that I\u2019m transported back to the first time I met Seth. What a spoiled, aggressive asshole! I completely forgot what a major dick he can be.</p><p>\u201cDo it yourself.\u201d</p><p>I storm from the training room, slapping the button to blacken the windows before I exit. I don\u2019t look over my shoulder, even when I hear him snap my name. Perhaps our game has gone too far. We\u2019re pushing each other now, deepening a disagreement that could have been resolved before we got up this morning, and unless this ends today, who knows what it\u2019s going to do to us in the long run.</p><p>I leave the gym in a huff. The good thing about being your own boss is you can leave whenever you want. Although I don\u2019t think Seth will appreciate it too much\u2014or maybe he\u2019ll be relieved I left.</p><p>I pull into Mom\u2019s driveway and turn my car off. I linger for a moment, thinking about Seth and how he\u2019s acting. To be annoyed with me because I went behind his back and refuse to apologize is one thing\u2014it\u2019s almost harmless\u2014but to physically hurt someone else to get back at me is not okay and now I have a whole new reason to be mad.</p><p>I exit my car and enter through the small, white picket gate. Beneath my feet, pebbles crunch and grind together. I like the sound. It reminds me of home...of Dad. I pull my key from the back pocket and unlock the door. Even though Mom is home, I\u2019d hate to wake her if she\u2019s napping. As the front door opens and I step inside, she shifts on the couch, drawing a tissue to her face. I quickly shut the door behind me and step toward her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she sniffles. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you to be home this early.\u201d</p><p>I drop into the couch beside her, pulling her into me. She rests against me, patting her red face with a tissue. I often see her cry...and it never gets any easier. I purposefully avoid the home video playing on the TV and I hear Chase and I sing in the background.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday dear Daddy, happy birthday to youuuu!\u201d</p><p>His young laugh fills my ears and my eyes begin to well. I never thought I\u2019d hear it again, and it\u2019s a marvelous sound, but it\u2019s still too soon for me. I\u2019m not ready to hear him, not when I\u2019ve only just been able to stomach looking at photos of him. I swallow and my chest hiccups as I press my tongue to the roof of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mom apologizes, shutting off the TV. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be okay seeing him by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad died, it\u2019s never going to be okay...and that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She wraps one arm around me and it feels bony. Mom has lost a lot of weight since Dad\u2019s funeral. She\u2019s never been a big girl, but she sure as hell hasn\u2019t been as tiny as she is now. I hold her for a little while longer. I think I almost fall asleep and before I fully drift off, I\u2019m jolted awake as Mom shifts away from me.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? I have chicken wraps in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Stifling a yawn, I shake my head. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night so I\u2019m probably going to take a quick nap.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cSeth, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m so sorry, darling. I completely forgot. How is he? Is he okay?\u201d</p><p>I lick my bottom lip against a smile. For someone who seems to be so indifferent about him, she sure is worried.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine\u2014more than fine. He\u2019s still his usual asshole-ish self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to go into details with Mom so I give her the simplest, quickest version I can. \u201cSeth has a long history with another fighter and last night it came back to bite him in the ass.\u201d I roll my eyes unintentionally and Mom frowns.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy Seth is okay...after I saw him last night and he fell asleep, I went to see the other guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one that hurt Seth?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI told him that we had the whole thing on camera, he lost his mind, and when I got back to Seth\u2019s, he was mad and we fought and then went to sleep. When we woke up, we were still mad at each other and we have been all morning.\u201d</p><p>She pinches her earlobe and the pretty pearl earring between her thumb and index finger. \u201cYou didn\u2019t apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize? Mom, he called me selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left him while he was asleep to go and see the guy that hurt him...it\u2019s not exactly selfless. Why\u2019d you do it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shifted in my seat. \u201cBecause...\u201d My voice sounds whiny and juvenile, and I hate it. \u201cDon is an ass and I wanted to hurt him like he hurt Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think that maybe Seth would\u2019ve liked to be the one to bring Daniel\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019s,\u201d I correct her.</p> <p>\u201cRight\u2014I\u2019m sure Seth would\u2019ve liked to be the one to bring Don\u2019s world down\u2014being as arrogant and self-important as he is.\u201d Mom bites back a smile. \u201cI hate to say it, honey, but you\u2019re the one who owes the apology here.\u201d</p><p>Mom on team Seth, who would have thought? I sink lower on the couch, instantly feeling like an idiot. \u201cHow do you know when you\u2019re right and they\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>She chuckles, slapping my arm. \u201cOh, darling. Lesson one on men, they always think they\u2019re right\u2014especially the fighter types. You want to come out on top? Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Let them think they\u2019re right. Like your father, Seth is going to say stupid, hurtful things to you at one time or another, nobody is perfect. Even the good ones have their moments, but at the end of the day, if they can make you feel loved beyond anything else, if they show you just how much you mean to them, then the other things are just bumps in an otherwise smooth pavement.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head. I never thought Mom could ever give me advice I\u2019d agree with. She\u2019s grown so much since Dad\u2019s death. I don\u2019t even know how to explain it. We have conversations without arguing\u2014actual full length conversations. I can\u2019t remember the last time we\u2019ve been so close.</p><p>I\u2019ll go see Seth at lunch time and apologize for taking the satisfaction of seeing Don crumble. I can\u2019t give it back to him, but hopefully the apology is enough. Mom leaves the couch and enters the kitchen, allowing me to lie down and stretch out. My eyes become heavy and I yawn countless times before finally falling asleep.</p> <p>Three strong knocks rap on the door and my eyes shoot open. It\u2019s almost dark, the living room is two shades from being pitch black. I push myself off the couch and climb sleepily to my feet. My stomach growls and churns because I haven\u2019t eaten today. Instead of making me hungry, it puts me off the mere thought of food.</p><p>There\u2019s another knock against the wood and I shuffle slowly towards it. I flick the light switch on and pull the door open. On the other side of the screen stands Seth in a white shirt that clings tightly to his chest and arms. My heart rate instantly skyrockets. Not out of fear or intimidation, but out of pure unwholesome desires\u2014oh, and the thought of having to apologize to him. He\u2019s going to make it as painful as possible.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy to see me, don\u2019t deny it.\u201d He lowers his gaze to my breasts. \u201cOr at least your nipples are.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring my less than impressed expression, he opens the screen and holds it, all while looking at me like I\u2019m the most amusing thing on the planet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been asleep this whole time?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night.\u201d But of course he knows that.</p> <p>Seth\u2019s amused expression fades, turning serious. \u201cI won\u2019t have us fighting for a second longer, Olivia.\u201d His voice is commanding, like he\u2019s ordering me to stop being mad at him. \u201cAll you have to do is tell me I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I interrupt him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have gone to Don, or at the very least, I should have told you.\u201d I step forward. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t have hurt that guy to get back at me. That was cruel. Promise me you won\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leans forward an inch. \u201cI\u2019m not going to promise you something I can\u2019t keep. I can promise you I\u2019ll always be here for you or that I\u2019ll never be unfaithful to you, but I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t hurt you in other ways. It\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s who I am. I have strange outlets and it\u2019s how I deal with things.\u201d</p><p>I hug myself as the cool air brushes along my skin. \u201cBut those people do nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey signed a contract agreeing to be my punching bag wherever and however I please. If they don\u2019t like it, they can always leave.\u201d</p><p>The fact he\u2019s being so careless is beyond me and quite frankly, it pricks at my frustration levels.</p> <p>\u201cYou know who I am. I\u2019ve been nothing but honest with you from the start. I won\u2019t change, not now. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you want? What can I say\u2014or do\u2014or give you to make you happy?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to tell him what will make me happy. I want him to automatically know\u2014which has to be the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever thought because even I don\u2019t know what I want\u2014I want him. I want us to be happy and not act like children.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight with you anymore. You win.\u201d</p><p>His face softens in a way that makes me want to squeeze him.</p><p>\u201cI love winning...so why do I feel like shit right now?\u201d He steps forward and playfully strokes my arm with his index finger. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the huge puppy dog eyes you\u2019re giving me.\u201d</p><p>My lips curl into a smile. \u201cDoes it make you feel bad?\u201d I ask, flicking my eyelashes.</p><p>Seth laughs once. \u201cYes, actually, it does.\u201d</p><p>I step aside and Seth crosses the threshold and into the house. Before we settle in for night, I shut all of the curtains and checked all of the rooms. Strange. Mom isn\u2019t here. I stroll into the kitchen where Seth casually sits on the counter, drinking a big glass of cool water.</p><p>\u201cYour Mom left you a note.\u201d He hides his over-confident smile behind his glass as he takes another mouthful.</p><p>Sprawled in elegant handwriting on the whiteboard stuck to the fridge, there\u2019s a message from Mom.</p><p>\u2018Olivia,</p><p>Will be out late tonight. Going on a dinner cruise with your Aunt Kate, remember?</p><p>See you tomorrow morning.</p><p>P.S.Who bit you? Never mind.\u2019</p><p>I cringe, slipping my fingers under my cotton shirt and over the flesh Seth sank his teeth into last night. \u201cWell, that has to be the most awkward note I\u2019ve ever received.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs, slipping off the counter and coming up behind me. I feel the hard front of his body graze faintly across my back and my breath hitches as his fingers curl around the edges of my hair and he pulls it across one shoulder. I take my fingers from the bite and almost immediately, Seth\u2019s lips sensually brush over it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I bit you,\u201d he murmurs deeply, sending shivers cascading down my spine. There\u2019s something about his low, husky voice that gets me every. Single. Time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d I breathe, my fingers trembling to touch him. \u201cI liked it.\u201d</p><p>And I did. No word of a lie. The frisson of energy his teeth sent through me as we both came was intoxicating and something I\u2019d let him do over and over again.</p><p>\u201cThis is much better.\u201d I sigh, relaxing against him. \u201cI don\u2019t like fighting with you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles against my skin. \u201cMe either, but I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I learned a lot of new things about you.\u201d</p><p>I turn around. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re passionate. You\u2019re stubborn, and you like it when I fuck you hard.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke, feeling my cheeks heat immediately. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>My breath hitches as he comes at me, one hand snatches my wrists and the other swiftly grabs a handful of my ass. He slams me hard against the fridge and electrical currents flow through me, pooling in the most sensitive places as he pins my arms above my head. Embarrassingly, my breathing quickens and I soak my underwear.</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d he says.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t smile\u2014there\u2019s no victory to his expression, only darkness\u2014sweet, arousing, darkness...and I want all of it to myself. Forever.</p><p>His mouth finds my neck and he roughly sucks and nips at me, and I grind my hips against him with urgency. I can feel him hard against his jeans and pressing eagerly into mine. I\u2019m ready for him to rip my clothes off and take me on the countertop right now...or at least I am until his phone rings.</p><p>He pulls it from his back pocket and slips it onto the counter, all without taking his mouth from me. I\u2019m more than happy to ignore it. I want all of his attention on me\u2014where it counts. I hook my finger around the hem of his jeans and almost get the button undone when his phone rings again. He pulls away with a frustrated groan, and keeping my arms pinned above me, he grabs his phone. When he reads the screen he hesitates for a moment.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia,\u201d he mutters, answering it and putting it to his ear. \u201cHello? Yes. Visits?\u201d He pauses as the person speaks on the other end. \u201cHow is she?\u201d A longer pause. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be there the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He hangs up and frees my wrists. I wait for him to speak as he rakes his fingers through his hair and expels an exhale from his lips. \u201cWe\u2019re going to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? As in me and you?\u201d</p><p>He arches a brow. \u201cNo, me and the fridge\u2014of course you and me.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes playfully at his sarcasm. \u201cWhat about the gym? Who\u2019s going\u2014\u201d</p><p>He silences me, pressing a finger against my lips, and bringing the phone back to his ear. I swat him away and he smiles, tucking his fingers into my jean pocket and tugging me closer. I laugh once as I push off of him and slip away from his hold.</p><p>\u201cJackson, it\u2019s me\u2014everything\u2019s fine. I need you to book two tickets to California for tomorrow afternoon. Yes\u2014and look after the gym for a few days...\u201d Seth frowns. \u201cBecause I\u2019m going to California.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I smile. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re on good terms again. He slaps his phone against the palm of his hand. \u201cJackson has got the gym and Selena will probably help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your training?\u201d</p><p>Seth leans against the kitchen counter crossing his legs at the ankles. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be able to sort that out over the phone.\u201d He groans. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>My insides deflate. \u201cGo? You can\u2019t go. You were just\u2014we were\u2014I was\u2014really?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles, pushing himself off of the counter and circling me in his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you, I promise. When we\u2019re in California, I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do to you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of going to California to see Seth\u2019s mother suddenly becomes tolerable. \u201cDeal, but you better bring your A game.\u201d</p><p>His hand slips under the fabric of my shirt and around to the small of my back. \u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d</p><p>I smile. He sure does.</p><p>Seth plants a quick kiss on my lips and stalks from the house, locking and closing my front door behind him. I drop into the couch with a heavy sigh. The thought of seeing Vanessa again makes me nervous...the last time I saw her, Seth was carrying her passed out from the police station. She\u2019s had finer moments, I\u2019m sure, and I hope she\u2019s better, for his sake. I think it\u2019d do him some good to have his mom back.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Seth</p><p>Talking to Darryl about skipping on training for a few days is something that had to be done to his face. He isn\u2019t going to like it, but the truth is, I\u2019m fucking sore. My body aches, my ribs hurt, my face hurts, and I have a constant headache that\u2019s driving me insane.</p><p>Sleep.</p><p>I can\u2019t wait to climb into bed and fall asleep. Unfortunately, Darryl lives on the other side of town and I have to venture through a million and one traffic lights, meaning I\u2019m going to be driving for at least forty minutes there and back\u2014not to mention the long, long conversation I\u2019m going to have with Darryl following my announcement.</p><p>I roll to a stop outside Darryl\u2019s nice family home. It\u2019s small, but it gives off a loving vibe. It doesn\u2019t feel cold or emit an unwelcome feeling like my house does or the ones I grew up in. My parents were hardly home\u2014dinners were always frozen instead of fresh, leaving the kitchen feeling sterile. There was no warmth of a freshly cooked meal floating in the air...not that it matters now, I guess. I didn\u2019t really mind, it was all I knew.</p><p>When I walked in on Olivia\u2019s family dinner months ago, before Rick died, I knew I\u2019d missed out on so much, but my kids will never have to. That I can guarantee.</p><p>I shake my head, ignoring the thoughts. I\u2019m only twenty-four. No need for kids yet\u2014not until I\u2019ve accomplished everything I need to. I don\u2019t want to be a fighter when I have kids. I don\u2019t want to drag Olivia to events and parties when she\u2019s pregnant. I smile at the thought of a small, round belly protruding from her t-shirts. A firm knock on my window forces the way too domesticated thoughts from my head. I\u2019m beginning to wonder exactly who is the female in this relationship...Darryl steps away from my door as I open it and I try hard not to laugh at his \u2018best dad in the world\u2019 pajamas and fail.</p><p>\u201cHa. Ha,\u201d he deadpans. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his shirt, pulling it around his shoulders more. \u201cWhen you have kids, you\u2019ll see how much strength it takes to actually use the gifts your kids buy you and then I\u2019ll be laughing at you.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth curls upwards and I know he enjoys it more than he lets on. \u201cAnyway, you never visit me at home, not since the night you almost slept with Olivia and your mom was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.\u201d</p><p>I swing my legs over the edge of my chair and rest my feet on the step. I remember that night. During the weeks Olivia and I couldn\u2019t have sex I remembered that night over and over, torturing myself. Had I known all of the things I said was going to end up being a waste of hot air, I would\u2019ve taken her right then and there, and I know it would have been the sweetest victory ever\u2014had the hospital not called for the third time that week, that is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not one to beat around the bush, so I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m taking a few days off training.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows draw together and I brace myself for the speech sure to follow. Surprisingly, they relax back to their natural curve. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d He shrugs, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cYou need time to recover and if you keep going as hard as you did today, it\u2019ll take too long.\u201d He paused. \u201cAre you and Olivia still fighting?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, we made up. We\u2019re going to California tomorrow to see Mom.\u201d</p><p>Darryl\u2019s eyebrows pull closer to the middle of his forehead again. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea so close to a fight? You know how your mother is. You\u2019ve barely been anxious since she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting her out, Darryl, I\u2019m only going to see her to see if she\u2019s made progress.\u201d And because every morning I wake up and she\u2019s not in the house, I feel like the biggest asshole in the world. Support, that\u2019s all she needs, but I don\u2019t have time to look after her and me, not now that I\u2019m in the pros. When the season ends, I\u2019ll contemplate signing her release. \u201cAnd I want Mom and Olivia to spend some time together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas your mother even met Olivia?\u201d</p><p>I nod, almost cringing at the memory. Mom had been drunk on both occasions\u2014calling Olivia by another girl\u2019s name. \u201cI doubt she remembers, but yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you rest, I don\u2019t see the harm in going to California. We\u2019re leaving for Vegas in two days and tomorrow morning, we have a meeting with the authorities and the MMAC to discuss suing Don and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sue him.\u201d</p><p>He inches closer to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to sue him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want his money. I want him out of fighting\u2014for good. I don\u2019t want him to have the balls to even look at a glove, ever again.\u201d</p> <p>Darryl rubs his forehead with the tips of his fingers. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to go for that, they\u2019ve had their eyes on Don for a while. He\u2019s a good fighter, Seth, one that the company can benefit from.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no contest and I won\u2019t budge. \u201cDon will never fight in the MMAC again and I won\u2019t tolerate anything less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t give you what you want?\u201d</p><p>I shift my weight. \u201cWe were attacked outside our gym, unprovoked and unaware. They\u2019ll give me exactly what I ask for.\u201d</p><p>Darryl shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve yet to have your first fight and you\u2019re already threatening your employers.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m one of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzes with a text message and I pull it from my pocket to take a look.</p> <p>FROM: JACKSON. TIME: 8:00P.M</p><p>Flights booked. You leave day after tomorrow @ 5 a.m.</p><p>I slip my phone back into my pocket. \u201cWhat time is the meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>He extends his hand to me and I put mine in his. His long fingers clasp mine in a firm grip and he tugs me forward, wrapping an arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d He releases me. \u201cWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll find the right time to propose to Olivia in California.\u201d</p><p>I straighten myself in my chair and grip my door. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The thought alone sends dread spiraling through my stomach. I\u2019m freaking out over a question I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll say yes to. A question...that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s strange how something as small as talking can have me paralyzed with fear. I close my door and start my car. Chatting to Darryl didn\u2019t take as long as I expected. I can tell he needs a break, he seems tired, and a day or two should be plenty of time to refresh his body and mind. I didn\u2019t take it easy on him today\u2014especially after last night\u2014and I still haven\u2019t apologized for getting pissed off at him, but I don\u2019t have to. He won\u2019t accept an apology. They make him uncomfortable. He prefers to forgive and forget with no heartfelt exchanges. That\u2019s just who he is.</p><p>I contemplate going back to Olivia\u2019s house. Knowing her mom is out until God knows when is tempting...holding Olivia is tempting too, but I need sleep and I\u2019d never get my much needed sleep in a bed with someone like her\u2014not until I exhaust every opening and every position.</p><p>I pull out of Darryl\u2019s street, unsure where to go. I turn right, in the direction of Olivia\u2019s house. Ignoring the \u2018don\u2019t text and drive\u2019 sign I pass, I retrieve my phone from my pocket and send her a text message.</p><p>TO: OLIVIA. TIME: 8:11 P.M.</p><p>Go home or come to yours?</p><p>A few minutes later, she replies. And what a reply it is. I\u2019d set the image she just sent me as my wallpaper, but such naked perfection is only meant for me. There\u2019s a caption too:</p><p>You decide.</p><p>In the picture, her dark hair is wet and it drapes down her glistening chest, barely settling above her gorgeous, pink nipples. I want to see her bottom half\u2014I want to see water glisten on the other parts of her body. The parts I\u2019d lick over and over without hesitation. That is my idea of heaven. Now, I\u2019m glad I turned right instead of left toward my house. Dropping my gaze to my phone routinely, I text back.</p><p>TO: OLIVIA. TIME: 8:18 P.M.</p><p>On my way. Don\u2019t you dare move.</p><p>I drop my phone into the center console and press a little harder on the accelerator. I don\u2019t think I can get there fast enough.</p><p>(T-minus three days until Las Vegas)</p><p>I enter the gym with Darryl hot on my heels.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re late\u2014even after I told you we had a meeting this morning.\u201d</p><p>I hear the annoyance in his steps and I zone it out. I\u2019m not that late\u2014twenty minutes, give or take a few. He follows me up the stairs, past the office and into the meeting room\u2014the only room in this entire building I haven\u2019t been in.</p><p>A long, varnished wooden table complete with big (and no doubt comfortable) chairs. It\u2019s very corporate compared to the old school styling outside of this room. My eyes drag over the men and woman sitting before me. They don\u2019t seem bothered that I\u2019m late. Then again, with \u2018suits\u2019 you can never really tell. They have their poker faces perfected.</p><p>Darryl steps by me and into the room. \u201cGentlemen...\u201d he clears his throat. \u201c...and lady.\u201d</p><p>The caramel haired woman with the large whiskey eyes nods at him, acknowledging his correction. As Darryl goes back to addressing them, her eyes flick to me and I know that look. Her eyes are glossy, her cheeks slightly flushed. Lust. I\u2019ve seen it a million times and it doesn\u2019t really come any clearer than that. I think she\u2019s attractive. I like the way her hair is pulled back into a loose bun and I like her tight business dress, but the look on her face doesn\u2019t make my stomach clench. I don\u2019t want whiskey colored eyes looking at me from underneath slack, aroused eyelids. I want green...I want long chocolate hair and perky, natural breasts. Olivia. I want her, no one else.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we standing on the decision?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Darryl steps to the side and I drop into the chair at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve come to an agreement with Don\u2019s lawyers.\u201d</p><p>Thomas, MMAC\u2019s best lawyer replies, \u201cThey\u2019re willing to pay a substantial amount of money to stop this from escalating.\u201d</p><p>I sit forward in my chair, resting my elbows on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t want his money.\u201d</p><p>Thomas\u2019s thick, dark eyebrows furrow. \u201cYour trainer told us\u2014\u201d</p><p>Darryl sighs, cutting him off and sitting in a spare chair. \u201cForget what I said. Seth has his own idea about the outcome of this case.\u201d</p><p>Thomas knows exactly what I want and the stress on his face tells me he doesn\u2019t want to go that way.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Seth?\u201d the woman asks, slipping the end of her pen between her lips.</p><p>She knows what she\u2019s doing and I\u2019m sure many others have fallen for that whole \u2018sex kitten\u2019 vibe. Shit. I would have months ago.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a single dime from him. I want him gone. No more competitions, no more training, and no more fights.\u201d</p><p>Thomas pulls his glasses down the bridge of his nose and off his face, before his beady blue eyes zero in on me.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, Mr. Marc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I correct him. Mr. Marc sounds weird.</p><p>\u201cSeth, sorry. The MMAC is in need of good fighters. Don Russell is our number two choice\u2014second to you. He\u2019s an asset we\u2019d like to possess when he\u2019s earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want someone like him to represent the MMAC? Look at my face.\u201d I rise to my feet and tug my shirt up, exposing my darkened ribs. \u201cLook at my ribs. He isn\u2019t a fighter. He\u2019s a fucking pussy.\u201d</p><p>The young guy next to Thomas shifts in his seat and leans closer to mutter something into his ear. When he pulls away, Thomas clears his throat. \u201cI understand there was an incident in Boston during the amateur tournament...you hit Mr. Russell in the face?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t let my eyes waver from him. How does he know that? I thought the tapes were gone? I lower myself back into my seat. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to refresh my memory.\u201d</p><p>As Thomas glances down, I steal a look at Darryl, whose face is locked on me. He seems just as surprised.</p><p>\u201cMr. Russell\u2019s lawyers have informed us that you attacked him and his lady friend at the Polaris gentlemen\u2019s club in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Lady friend? I think for a moment and it isn\u2019t until Darryl laughs once under his breath I realize he\u2019s talking about Olivia.</p><p>\u201cLady friend? Is that what he called her?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cDon was sexually harassing my girl. I didn\u2019t attack him for no reason. I was protecting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what she was to you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs,\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs,\u201d I say again. \u201cWhat she is to me. She\u2019s still mine.\u201d</p><p>I say it with a hell of a lot more possession than I intend.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake,\u201d he replies, worried he\u2019s overstepped a boundary. \u201cRegardless of what she is to you, you broke the rules and he looked the other way. Don\u2019s lawyers and the MMAC are asking you to do the same, and they\u2019re offering you a substantial amount of money for it.\u201d</p><p>I snap. \u201cRolling over and letting Don Russell fuck me in the ass is not something I\u2019m willing to do.\u201d</p><p>I won\u2019t budge. Never in a million years will I ever look weak in his eyes again. He will learn to fucking fear me. Thomas and the MMAC lawyers watch me with excitement. They enjoy the rivalry, but I don\u2019t want them getting any ideas about a rematch. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be in the same ring as me.</p><p>Exhaling, Thomas shuts his folder. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do another hearing with his lawyers. You have rights and we don\u2019t want to take them away from you, but think about it. Having Don in the MMAC will benefit you immensely.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply. I think I\u2019ve said enough and I\u2019m sick of repeating myself.</p><p>They trail out of the room, one after the other until there\u2019s no one left but Darryl and I.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Darryl announces after a few long seconds, leaning forward on his elbows. \u201cHaving Don in the MMAC will be good for your career. Spectators love rivals\u2014it excites them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy rivals don\u2019t begin and end with Don. I\u2019ve pissed off a lot of people\u2014I piss off Junior Moset all the time.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s not rivalry. That\u2019s a little cocky banter. As far as I know, you haven\u2019t slept with his girlfriend. No one hates you like you Don hates you.\u201d Darryl laughs loudly, making me smile. \u201cAnd he hates you so fucking much.\u201d</p><p>I shift in my seat. \u201cHe has to go. I want to humiliate him\u2014to break him into tiny little pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the ring is the perfect place to do it. You\u2019re in the pros now. Every fight you\u2019re in will be broadcast to millions of viewers. You\u2019ve beat Don before. Do it again. Do it over and over until he begs you to leave him alone.\u201d</p><p>I lean back in my chair. I was right about them being comfortable, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It isn\u2019t about beating him anymore. I\u2019ve done that. It\u2019s about closing old chapters and moving forward. I don\u2019t want Don in the MMAC because I\u2019m in the MMAC, which means Olivia will see him frequently. She knows why Don hates me, and I don\u2019t want her to get hurt because of something I did before I met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is about Olivia?\u201d</p><p>I begin to nod, but change my mind and start to shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s about moving forward. I\u2019ve changed and I don\u2019t want to be associated with the person I used to be.\u201d</p><p>Darryl sighs. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to give you what you want. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I know that and I fucking hate it.</p><p>\u201cCall my lawyers and have them call the MMAC. They need to be reminded of the rules. Don is out.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Olivia</p><p>My car rolls to a stop outside Seth\u2019s house. Thankfully, neither Jackson nor Selena\u2019s car is at the front and I\u2019m hoping they\u2019ve gone somewhere else for the night. Seth has told me all about his lovely plan for us\u2014dinner by the pool, wine, and a swim. I\u2019m excited. My blood flows rapidly through my veins, causing my head to spin like I\u2019ve already ingested alcohol. I didn\u2019t bring anything to swim in\u2014I did it on purpose, too. I\u2019ve never swum naked before in my life, even when Selena insisted it was cool and routinely did it in her pool. For me, being naked in a swimming pool just isn\u2019t something that I\u2019m into\u2014not until now, that is. I slip from the car and approach the front door. I tug on the hem of my dress, hating that I chose to wear something so short and skipping on the underwear. It barely hits mid-thigh and I feel the loose, flowing fabric sweep across my backside. The dress is a nice royal blue and cuts low, exposing the sides of my breasts. I bought the dress two days ago. A little while back, Seth and I went shopping. He really liked the dress, but I insisted it was too \u2018out there.\u2019 I went back the next day and bought it, hoping we\u2019d have a secluded moment so I could wear it for him. I decided to wear my hair up in a messy bun tonight, too. If there\u2019s one thing I hate about swimming pools, it\u2019s getting chlorine in my hair. It makes it go all dry and stringy\u2014not sexy, at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I open the door and step inside. A delicious smell filters through my nose and my mouth instantly waters. Whatever he\u2019s cooking, it smells amazing. I don\u2019t pay attention to the dim lighting as I make my way toward the kitchen. My legs aren\u2019t going off orders from my brain, but from my stomach. It wants to fill itself with the delicious basil and tomato scent.</p><p>When I enter the kitchen, it\u2019s clean, only the warmth of a freshly cooked meal lingers in the air. I scan the room and wait a few seconds. Still no Seth. As I\u2019m about to step toward the living room to sit and wait for him, I notice the back door is open and I instinctively make my way towards it. I hear the sounds of cutlery clashing against porcelain and a curse word fall from his lips. He\u2019s in the pool yard, prepping our dinner. My heart flutters. I never expected Seth to be the cooking type. I mean, he obviously has to make crazy meals to keep his nutrition up, but cooking for two? It can\u2019t be something he\u2019s done before. I follow the stepping stones up to the gate and peer through the bars. The mere sight of him sends my heartbeat sky-rocketing\u2014loose jeans and a tight tee\u2014my favorite. I like the way it stretches over his back, showing every line of muscle. He adjusts the huge bowl of pasta, shifts a chair and moves a glass of wine. He steps back and puts his hands on his hip, analyzing it. With a frustrated \u2018humph\u2019 he shifts the bowl back to its original position and pushes the second, wide chair away. As he nods approval to himself, I open the gate and it screeches. Slowly, he looks over his shoulder, his eyes immediately zeroing in on my legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you look...\u201d His lips twitch as he recognizes the dress. \u201c...edible.\u201d</p> <p>I feel my skin burn under his intense gaze and if it wasn\u2019t for my stomach growling, I would have skipped the meal and gone straight for dessert.</p><p>\u201cYou cooked.\u201d I smile. \u201cIt smells amazing.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s lips curl into a proud smirk and he turns his body around to face me front on. \u201cI did. I made one gigantic bowl of pasta for us to share.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me like I should say something and I bite back a laugh. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? I thought you\u2019d be a little more excited than that.\u201d</p> <p>I scratch my head. \u201cOver a bowl of pasta?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and the sound is so rough it sends goosebumps rippling over the surface of my skin. There are no words to describe the way someone\u2019s laugh elevates you higher than the clouds and no, Seth Rogen\u2019s laugh doesn\u2019t count, no matter how glorious it is and no matter how many times you set it as your notification tone and text yourself over and over just to hear it. I didn\u2019t do that...okay I did, but it was only my message tone for two days before I realized I\u2019d crossed the \u2018sane\u2019 line and frolicked dangerously on the edge of \u2018bat-shit crazy.\u2019</p><p>It\u2019s strange how my body reacts to him. Last night, after I sent Seth the picture of me fresh out of the shower, he came over and spent the night with me. We didn\u2019t have sex...but he did spend most of the night with his face between my legs. Over and over and over he made me come...I thought I\u2019d be set on the orgasm front for a few days, but seeing him now, laughing and trying being all romantic, moistens me. I can feel it, slick and wet between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen Lady and the Tramp, right?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, girls love Lady and the Tramp.\u201d He\u2019s almost proud of himself.</p> <p>I laugh once at his reference to the iconic movie, famous for the \u2018pasta kiss.\u2019 \u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena was watching it when I got home this afternoon. She said you two have watched it a million times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agree. \u201cWhen we were twelve.\u201d</p><p>Seth rolls his eyes and places himself in his seat. \u201cDo you want to share a bowl of pasta with me or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d I stroll over to the empty chair and as I\u2019m about to drop into it, Seth clicks his tongue in a disapproving way. \u201cThat\u2019s not your seat.\u201d</p><p>I pause mid-squat. \u201cWhere do I sit?\u201d</p><p>His thick fingers nonchalantly tap his knee. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>I quirk a brow. \u201cWait, who\u2019s the tramp here? I don\u2019t think a lady would sit on a man\u2019s knee at the dinner table.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flare, apparently enjoying the banter. \u201cSit on my knee before I bend you over it.\u201d</p><p>I comply because I know he\u2019s a man of his word. I slip onto his knees and he pulls me right into his chest, inching the glass table closer to us. I inhale subtly as his smell engulfs me. It\u2019s that clean, fresh out of the shower smell\u2014the kind of smell that filters through your nose and lingers at the back of your throat, igniting your blood. You swallow hard in an attempt to quench the desire to lick the flesh the scent emanates from, only you can\u2019t. Nothing extinguishes the craving, not until the skin becomes slick with your saliva as your tongue glides over it ever so smoothly.</p><p>He twirls his fork in the delicious chaos of pasta and sauce before bringing it to my lips. I open my mouth and he puts it in. I glance backwards at him and his eyes are locked on my mouth. They watch closely as my lips wrap around the food and I pull it off the fork.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for California tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I nod, chewing my food. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He spins the fork in the pasta, pulling a forkful out for himself.</p><p>I look around the pool yard. It really is beautiful. The lights are all on, giving the pool a beautiful, forbidden glow. Right now, I feel like I\u2019m in the jungle somewhere, near a hidden location untouched by anyone else. The rocks that house the lights look real. The blue water looks like it\u2019s glowing, and there\u2019s a chorus of chirps from crickets that make it all that much more believable.</p><p>The pasta doesn\u2019t get finished, which makes Seth happy. It turns out he\u2019s a big fan of reheated foods, not me. It\u2019s fresh or nothing. When he takes the leftovers to put in the kitchen, I whip my dress over my head and unclip my bra. When he comes back, I\u2019m naked and waiting to get in the pool. As he opens the gate, he stops abruptly, his eyes completely glued to my naked body. I bite back a smile as his stare darkens and he pulls his t-shirt off in a single, fluid move. All of his hard muscles and tattoos are exposed to me and I try hard not to faint into the pool. Without saying a word, he stalks toward me\u2014his naughty intent clear in his eyes and he doesn\u2019t stop until his warm torso is pressed firmly against mine, sending white hot arousal to every tip in my body\u2014head, toes, fingers\u2014you name it, it\u2019s there. My body buzzes as his eyes remain locked on mine while his thick fingers travel down my stomach before slipping right into my wetness. His free arm surrounds me, pulling me tightly against him and he lowers his mouth to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking wet,\u201d he growls, firmly touching me.</p><p>His voice, low and husky, vibrates through my body and I almost shiver. I groan in agreement and he chuckles darkly once under his breath. The sound sends a stronger arousal, pure and unmatched by any other feeling, rocketing through my system.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing this outside,\u201d I say, although I have no intention of stopping.</p><p>This time, I shiver as his mouth moves to my ear and the very edge of his plump lip brushes against it. \u201cWe should and we will.\u201d\u2019</p><p>The first stroke of his fingers causes me moan. It\u2019s loud, low and unbelievably shameless. It\u2019s a sound I shouldn\u2019t have made outside, but my care-factor for being seen or heard is suddenly below zero.</p><p>Freeing myself from his pull, I step backwards, making my way down the steps of the pool. The warmish water laps at my ankles and then my shins. I move backwards, maintaining eye contact with the beast waiting on the sidelines who\u2019s watching me closely like I\u2019m his next meal. When the water breaks against my shoulders I stop, waiting for Seth to make his next move. There\u2019s a small smile on the corner of his lips as he pulls his belt off and tosses it to the side. I catch my lip in between my teeth as he pops the button on his jeans and drags down the zipper. I sink lower in the water, up to my neck\u2014until my hard breathing causes the surface to ripple.</p><p>In one swift movement, Seth is naked\u2014all of him on show\u2014and he likes it. Quickly and with absolute purpose, he makes his descent into the water, barely flinching at the cool temperature. When he\u2019s shoulder deep and a short distance away from me, my body heats up and the water isn\u2019t enough to cool me down. I\u2019m certain if Seth doesn\u2019t put his hands on me right now, I\u2019m going to implode.</p><p>When he finally does reach me, I realize I\u2019ve backed all the way up to the wall and now my backside is pressing hard against the smooth pebbles. Seth lowers himself so he\u2019s eye level with me and his hands grip the edge of the pool, either side of my head.</p><p>The glow of the pool darkens his features and I drag my gaze over his jet black hair, dark eyes, the healing cut on his cheek and finally, a set of full lips\u2014all of them are only a few painful inches away from me. Thankfully, he decides to close the distance and bring his mouth to mine. Surprisingly, the kiss is at a much slower pace than what I was expecting\u2014it\u2019s sensual and stokes the small flames inside me. Without breaking the kiss, his hands drop from the edge of the pool and slip onto the nape of my neck. As soon as they touch my flesh, they begin their descent over my shoulders, down my arms, and circle my waist. I inch closer to him, reveling in the sensation of his bare, rough hands on my exposed skin. Even in the silky water his hands feel rough and invigorating.</p><p>A small quiver rolls down my spine and I feel his lips twitch before he pulls his head back to look at me.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you react to me.\u201d Ever so slowly, the hands that hold my waist glide higher again, until his thumb brushes against the swell of my breast.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>He nods once, smiling his beautiful smile. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Seth leans closer to me, bringing his gorgeous lips right by my ear. I listen closely and he moans his own name, mimicking me, and a jolt of embarrassed energy frissons through me. I shove him backwards.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I squeal, feeling my face heat up. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>I can see it on his face\u2014the way his playful expression leers at me\u2014he loves the reaction I\u2019m giving him.</p><p>\u201cOh, Seth,\u201d he says in his best \u2018Olivia\u2019 voice. \u201cI fucking love that. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I try really hard to sound threatening and not amused by his taunting, but it\u2019s just not working.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he continues, boosting his ego sky high. \u201cHarder. Faster.\u201d</p><p>He knows he\u2019s the best I\u2019ve had and he loves it. I launch forward, wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him against me. \u201cYou need to stop before I drown you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like hearing how sexy you sound?\u201d His hands travel down to my backside and he lifts me, forcing me to wrap my legs around his hips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sexy\u2014at least not when you repeat it back to me in that horrible tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorrible tone? I\u2019m so good at impersonating you that I gave myself a boner.\u201d</p><p>I almost choke on a laugh and attempt to push off of him, only he squeezes me harder against him and I can\u2019t get away.</p><p>\u201cYou are a piece of work, you know that? I sound nothing like that. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>His glorious lips cut me off and my eyes flutter shut on instinct. Such a typical Seth move, thinking he can shut me up with his mouth. I\u2019ll show him\u2014</p><p>In a minute...</p><p>...when his mouth stops feeling so damn amazing.</p><p>My brain wants to contest Seth, to fight him for being so pert, but my lady parts want other things and they know exactly how to silence my brain.</p><p>My hands whip through his hair, following the orders of my hormones instead of my brain. They slide over his strong shoulders, the defined muscles of his back and down his solid arms. He kisses me down my neck and continues on his familiar route to my collarbone\u2014I love it when he kisses my collarbone. At the apex of my thighs, I can feel his length waiting patiently for us to get the show on the road. Any second now...I don\u2019t think I can hold out for much longer.</p><p>I roll my head to the side and watch the water glisten on the dark marks of Seth\u2019s tattoos. My arms surround his neck again, and I hold him close to me. Underneath, I feel him lining himself up and no more than a second later, he shoves himself inside of me. I gasp in euphoric shock as my body enlivens with erotic sensations. Even though I knew it was coming, I forgot the indescribable feeling that comes with being completely filled by him. He keeps his mouth on my neck as he grips my ass, pulling our hips as close as possible.</p><p>He\u2019s so deep, striking all of the chords in the very back of my depths causing bursts of heat to explode throughout my body.</p><p>\u201cFucking...hell...\u201d He breathes against my skin before hanging his head back.</p><p>I watch him, completely mesmerized by his parted lips and his muscular chest that heave with his strained breaths.</p><p>A wave of lust hits me with the full force of a tsunami behind it and without thinking I lean forward and press my open mouth to his neck. I lick his skin and feel his throat vibrate underneath my tongue.</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Seth rasps and I don\u2019t hesitate. Not for a second.</p><p>I bite down on his neck and the growl that erupts from Seth sends heat shooting through my veins in steady bursts. My muscles clench and I scream into his shoulder as my stomach rolls with familiar waves, and I swear to God white lights blind my eyes.</p><p>When I come back to, I realize I\u2019m pressed against the edge of the pool. I release Seth, lean backwards and rest my elbows on the dark edges of the concrete. He holds my hips and I look up at him as the water laps over our bodies as he thrusts into me. His dark eyes are on my breasts before they flick to my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He half smiles, half catches his lip between his teeth. \u201cSo sexy.\u201d</p><p>Seth draws his body closer to mine and my back grazes against the rocks with every thrust, sending new waves of lust through me. He begins to groan and swear under his breath with every second thrust. I can tell by his face and his erratic movements that he\u2019s close.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby,\u201d Seth grips my shoulder, pulling me off the edge of the pool and right into him. I manage a sharp intake of air before he slams his mouth to mine and the moment our tongues rush to entwine, he groans harshly, crushing me to him. His hips move in an unsteady rhythm, his fingers digging roughly into my flesh. I hear his growls soften and eventually die down to relieved moans and satiated sighs. As my own waves of bliss begin to fade, the mere thought of snuggling up to Seth in bed sounds like an amazing idea.</p> <p>His mouth slips from mine and he nuzzles my neck, kissing it softly. When his grip on me loosens, I slip away from him, planting my feet on the floor of the pool. I attempt to pass him, to leave the water and gather my dress, but before I get anywhere, he grabs my elbow and pulls me right back to him. His lips part, drawing my gaze, and he purses them in thought.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just\u2014\u201d He almost smiles, but behind the smile I see the frustration. \u201cIt can wait.\u201d</p><p>I feel my brows draw together. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>He seemed pretty conflicted a second ago, but now all traces of it are gone.</p> <p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>He releases me and I linger for a few seconds before continuing my way to the steps.</p><p>When I emerge from the water, the warm air is suddenly cool and unwanted. I glance over my shoulder at Seth. He\u2019s completely submerged himself under the water and by the time he resurfaces, I\u2019ve already slipped my dress over my body. It clings to my wet skin as I lean lazily against the fence with my hands tucked tightly underneath my armpits in an effort to warm them.</p><p>I blink a few times in order to stay awake. My eyes threaten to shut and the only thing keeping them open is the stunning mass of muscle that rises from the pool. I swear my world goes slo-mo while I watch him roughly rake his fingers through his hair, making it look all disheveled and sexy. That\u2019s not all that caught my attention, either. My eyes roam his perfect form\u2014like they did the first time I ever laid eyes on him. \u2018My mouth goes dry and I want to run my lips over his moist throat. I\u2019m suddenly aware of a strange, searing heat across the back of my neck and an electrical current I\u2019ve never felt before tingles.\u2019 I smile. It\u2019s nice to see nothing has changed. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to his unadulterated perfection.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking at me like that and I\u2019ll take you for round two.\u201d</p><p>I push off the fence and lick my bottom lip. It feels cold and numb. I really hope it\u2019s not blue. \u201cWe have to get up early tomorrow, remember?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugs. \u201cIf we miss it, we\u2019ll book another flight.\u201d He smiles a cocky smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d</p><p>I bend over, pulling Seth\u2019s shirt off the ground and tossing it to him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a plane before and I\u2019m excited, so, if you make me miss it, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>He ditches the shirt and reaches for his jeans, putting one leg in after the other. He pulls them up and buttons them low on his hips. As he finishes, he extends his hand to me and I take it. My skin warms up in his and I can\u2019t wait to get upstairs and have his entire body heat radiate onto me.</p><p>In Seth\u2019s room, I dump the dress in the bathroom and quickly run a towel over my body, drying up all of the little beads of water that are chilling me down to my bones.</p><p>I drop the towel and stalk back into the bedroom, stopping halfway to the bed. My eyes widen a fraction as they settle on Seth and all of his damp glory casually lying in the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wet.\u201d</p><p>Wet is a little bit of an exaggeration. The air had almost dried him completely before we got into the house, save for a small spattering of drops over his chest and arms.</p><p>He flashes me another one of those smiles. \u201cI believe that\u2019s my line.\u201d</p> <p>I try not to smile, but I\u2019m sure the awkward pout on my lips as I shake my head had already given away the fact that I want to.</p><p>Seth chuckles as he rolls the sheets down to his naked hips. \u201cGet in here.\u201d</p><p>I rapidly rush to the light switch and flick it off before diving into bed. Seth\u2019s arms circle me, immediately drawing me into him and my chest flutters.</p><p>I like this.</p><p>I like the way we\u2019re connecting. When we were fighting and lying in the bed, ignoring each other, I felt empty and I never want to feel like that again. With Blade, I fell asleep alone and angry more times than I can count...that\u2019s not a relationship. What we had was an inconvenient routine I couldn\u2019t shake and I\u2019ll be damned if I let another relationship go down that path. When I\u2019m in bed with Seth, I want to touch him\u2014to feel his skin against mine. I want to feel overwhelmed by love\u2014so overwhelmed that it exhausts me and I fall asleep in his arms. That is a relationship. That is love.</p><p>Seth buries his face in my damp hair and kisses me. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers and it makes my heart stutter.</p><p>As silly as it sounds, I forget he loves me. It\u2019s hard to believe someone who walks around commanding so much attention with his acute cockiness, hard muscles, and tattoos would ever let someone like me to bring him to his knees\u2014and make no mistake, I bring him to his knees. I bring him to his knees, hard.</p><p>I shuffle backwards, pressing my body harder into his. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>In the silence that follows, I think about our trip to California. I\u2019ve never been on a plane before\u2014I\u2019ve always wanted to go on one, but believe it or not, I was a very dedicated worker before Seth came along. I never took a day off for anything. I don\u2019t know what happened...Seth stalked into my life and scrambled my internal wiring. Since then, I haven\u2019t been the same and I\u2019m okay with that. When you meet someone who makes your entire body buzz with only a curl of their lips, you can\u2019t escape it. You become drawn to it, forgetting everything that\u2019s supposed to matter to you. Seth became my sun and I gravitated around him\u2014I still do, and like the sun, there\u2019s still so much to learn about Seth. I know he\u2019s big and beautiful, but I also know he\u2019s fiery and unpredictable. In California, I think I\u2019m going to be seeing a lot more of the fiery, negative Seth. He\u2019s always moody when it comes to his mother\u2014or at least he was when I first met him. He was always in the gym, punching out his frustrations.</p><p>His mother, Vanessa, is a very hard woman to read. I\u2019ve only met her once and on both occasions she was drunk off her ass, both confusing and frustrating me with her violent mood swings, not to mention the fact she calls me by a different girl\u2019s name every time I see her. A nervous feeling twists my stomach. Vanessa\u2019s going to be mad Seth had her sent away...maybe I can sit out visiting her? No. I can\u2019t do that. Seth will need my support and that\u2019s why I\u2019m going...</p><p>For him.</p><p>The need for sleep fades and I find myself wide awake long after Seth\u2019s breathing evens out and my body bears the weight of his arm. His breathing is slow and heavy, sounding totally at peace. I wish the sudden bout of anxious nausea would go away so I can sleep. The last thing I want is to look like crap visiting Seth\u2019s mom tomorrow. I want her to like me\u2014to think I\u2019m worthy of her son. Hell, I\u2019ll even go as far as to say I want her to be proud of Seth for finding a girl like me. I\u2019m not one to brag, but comparing myself to Cassie (the girl Seth slept with before me), I\u2019m a catch. Sure she was hot, but she\u2019s hardly the kind of girl you can bring home to your Mama\u2014not unless you want to be accused of hiring a date from an expensive escort service.</p><p>Seth sighs sleepily, pulling me from my thoughts, and I stifle a yawn as sleep slowly claims me. I shift forward, hoping to roll onto my stomach, but Seth\u2019s hand clenches my stomach, holding me in place. I smile. Even in his sleep he has to have me close.</p><p>I wish he\u2019d ask me to marry him already. I know that\u2019s what he\u2019s been trying to do for the past few weeks. Only one question makes a guy that nervous. Seth is uncensored. He says what he wants when he wants and I find it cute that he\u2019s scared of my response. I don\u2019t know why, surely he knows it\u2019s going to be yes\u2014a million times yes! I\u2019m impatient. I want him to be all mine. I want his last name\u2014to carry his children\u2014you name it, I want it.</p><p>And all he has to do is ask.</p><p>I lean lazily against his car and yawn as Seth pays the meter. Apparently, you can leave your car at the airport, who knew? I\u2019d never do it, not these days, anyway. Seth, however, has no problems leaving his car. He doesn\u2019t have to, though. Jackson offered to drop us off and pick us up, but Seth insisted we do it alone. Not surprising, he\u2019s never been one to want help.</p><p>After he pays, we enter the airport, do all of the lame, time-consuming obligations like waiting in line and checking in as well as waiting an hour and half before we can even board the gigantic plane. As I sit in the plane awaiting take off, my pulse quickens. It sped up when we arrived at the airport, it quickened even more when we had our necessary IDs checked and it was violently slamming against my ribs as we boarded the plane. Through it all, Seth rubbed my lower back and gave me small squeezes of reassurance and it helped, a little.</p><p>Flying to another state is exhausting\u2014the packing, the early morning, the driving, the waiting\u2014it\u2019s all too much. Beside me, Seth shifts closer, putting his hand on mine.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he tells me, giving a slight lopsided smirk. \u201cThere can\u2019t be two anxious messes on the plane.\u201d</p><p>I study his face and the slow rise and fall of his chest. Neither betrayed any sign of the anxiousness he apparently feels inside.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like flying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. I\u2019d much rather have both my feet firmly planted on the ground, but sometimes, we have to do things we hate.\u201d His smirk widens. \u201cAnd this is one of those things.\u201d</p><p>A tall, lanky stewardess with beautiful auburn hair slips by us and strolls into a small room at the front of the plane.</p><p>\u201cTry not to freak out or they\u2019ll throw you off the plane.\u201d</p><p>I lean into him, whispering. \u201cWhat? They\u2019ll kick me off? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>Seth is enjoying this. The amused expression on his face says so and he licks his lips to hide a smile. \u201cYep, so behave.\u201d</p><p>I relax back into my seat and try to come off as uncaring and cool, but I can\u2019t help tapping my fingertips along the hem of my skirt, occasionally touching my bare thigh. Seth chose my outfit for today\u2014a tight, black business skirt and a light pink silk blouse with a frilly collar. I planned on saving this outfit for dinner if we go out, but Seth couldn\u2019t wait that long to see me in it and demanded I wear it today. I\u2019d be happier in a pair of sweatpants and a plain tee. Isn\u2019t that what people wear on planes? Comfortable clothes?</p><p>I drag in a deep inhale and reach to open the window. We aren\u2019t in the sky yet, but I figure if I face my fear head on and watch our ascent, then I\u2019ll be ready for the flight. Before my fingers curl around the handle of the blind, Seth whips across, grabbing my wrist. I gasp as he pulls my hand away from it.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, daredevil.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cYou might want to conquer your fears, but I\u2019m fine hiding from mine.\u201d He lets me go. \u201cPlease don\u2019t open the blind.\u201d</p><p>Am I trying to hide a skeptical smile? I think I am. \u201cYou\u2019re that scared? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He nods his head, unashamed. \u201cYes, I am that scared. We\u2019re going to be very, very high up\u2014tens of thousands of feet\u2014and I don\u2019t care how beautiful it is, it\u2019s a sight I never want to see.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m itching to open the blinds now. I want to see the clouds...my thoughts of the fluffy white clouds are interrupted by the pilot\u2019s voice. I barely pay attention to what he\u2019s saying. All I can focus on is the erratic pulse of my heart. A few minutes and a dozen safety announcements later, we\u2019re racing down the runway and officially on our way to California.</p><p>(T-minus two days until Las Vegas)</p><p>My body is charged with excitement and a sense of self-accomplishment as we drive away from the airport in an SUV Seth rented. I went on an airplane for the first time! I don\u2019t care how childish I sound, it was amazing and when Seth went to the toilet, I even peeked out the window.</p><p>Seamless. Serene. Surreal.</p><p>Those are the only words I have to describe what I saw. I want to see it again and I want to take photos of it, to remember exactly how perfect it was. I pull down the visor and check my hair in the mirror, not bad considering I was squishing it against the headrest of a chair for a couple of hours.</p><p>I peek sideways at Seth, his eyes focus on the road and I notice his hands grip the steering wheel off and on again, over and over.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d I ask, placing a hand on his jean-clad thigh.</p><p>He drops his hand from the steering wheel and takes my hand in his. Strangely, the gesture sends a million and one flutters up my arm and directly into my chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He moistens his lips and keeps his gaze out the front windscreen. \u201cThis can go really well...or it can be a total fuck up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it goes well?\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take her home with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it\u2019s a fuck up?\u201d</p><p>He ponders for a second and his jaw clenches imperceptibly. \u201cShe stays.\u201d</p><p>I analyze his face. He doesn\u2019t like that idea and I can tell he\u2019s conflicted. He wants to bring his mother home, but not until she\u2019s better and I pray for his sake that she is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The institute is nothing like I imagined. I pictured a cold, white cube-like building\u2014I didn\u2019t expect a resort by the beach. We drive up a long, straight driveway, lined with gorgeous palm trees and bushes. I wind my window down and the car floods with the smell of various flowers. What a lovely place.</p><p>The color scheme of the buildings\u2014the browns and charcoals\u2014contrasted well with the blue sky and almost white sand\u2014it\u2019s nothing like the dull prison I envisioned. I contemplate cracking a joke about becoming an alcoholic just to get locked up in a place like this, but I decide against it. It\u2019s way too soon for jokes like that.</p><p>I breathe in the crisp scent of sea salt and it tickles the back of my throat. I love it here. We\u2019re not in Kansas anymore, Toto. California feels worlds away from Portland, Maine.</p> <p>I\u2019m paralyzed with awe at the serenity of the institution\u2014from the driveway to the parking lot\u2014all of it amazes me and it isn\u2019t until I feel Seth\u2019s full lips press quickly against my cheek that I realize we\u2019ve stopped. When I look at him, he smiles at me, but it\u2019s a fake smile that I assume is supposed to make me feel better. His eyes are dark\u2014clouded\u2014and the beautiful golden rivers are barely distinguishable.</p><p>Without a word, I slip from my seat and shut the door. As we meet around the back of the car, Seth stuffs his hands into his pockets. I study him closely as he breathes deeply, preparing himself for the reunion with his mother. His sky blue shirt tightens around his chest with every inhale and I reach out to him, running my arms up the hard ridges of his biceps and onto the nape of his neck. He blows air from his cheeks. \u201cI feel stupid.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhy do you feel stupid?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs his broad shoulders. \u201cBecause I\u2019m nervous...\u201d His eyelids droop a fraction and for some reason, his sudden vulnerability pierces my heart. \u201cThere\u2019s a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and I feel like throwing up.\u201d</p><p>In this moment, I see a glimpse of what Seth might\u2019ve looked like as a child, with all of his innocence still intact\u2014big, glossy brown eyes, straight lips, and a worried little furrow between his brows.</p> <p>Adorable.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel stupid,\u201d I say, unable to hide a smile.</p><p>I bring my arms back down and hook one around his. Slowly, I draw him closer to the front doors. \u201cYou have every right to be nervous and whether it ends on a good note or a bad note, this will all be over soon. Then, we can both sit around and sulk or we can go to the beach\u2014whatever you want to do, we\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He nods and the movement keeps me linked to his childhood.</p><p>So fucking adorable.</p><p>Once we pass the reception desk and they check us over a few times to make sure we aren\u2019t trying to smuggle anything in, a nurse leads us up spacious halls and through luxurious sitting areas. Everything seems to be a bright white trimmed with gold. All stonework is marble and the lights are low, crystal chandeliers. This place is more like a six star hotel than an alcoholic recovery center. The nurse veers around a corner and we follow. The uniforms here aren\u2019t scrubs in various colors of blue, but more office attire\u2014tight business dresses and lavish, too-high heels. Sadly, I fit right in here.</p> <p>The nurse stops outside a door and suddenly a tornado of nerves sweeps through me. I hate not knowing what\u2019s on the other side of the door. It can swing both ways. Either it\u2019ll make this trip worth it or it\u2019ll be a complete waste of time.</p><p>The pretty blonde nurse turns to us. \u201cHeads up, she\u2019s in a little bit of a foul mood this morning.\u201d</p><p>Great. I lick my lips in an attempt to moisten the nervous dryness that has seized them\u2014it doesn\u2019t help. With a friendly nod, she leaves us alone at the door. I shift closer to Seth, allowing my finger to glide over the back of his wrist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait out here for you.\u201d I step away from him, feeling a little relieved that I don\u2019t have to go in there with Vanessa\u2014I almost get away with it too, until Seth\u2019s hard, strong hand envelops mine and he pulls me right back into him.</p><p>\u201cI want you with me,\u201d he says under his breath as he crushes me to his chest. It\u2019s low and aggressive, striking all of the right chords. \u201cDon\u2019t make me face her alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, she\u2019s your moth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking you, O. I need you in the room with me.\u201d</p><p>His face...I can\u2019t even take it. He\u2019s sweet and demanding all at once. How can my brain compete against my heart? My brain knows it\u2019s better for Vanessa and myself if I\u2019m not in there tainting their reunion, but my heart knows I should be there to support Seth\u2014regardless of how uncomfortable it makes me.</p> <p>I nod in compliance and he holds me closer for a little while longer. Time and space falls away as he holds me in his gaze. The building could be on fire right now, alarms could be blaring\u2014sprinklers blasting\u2014and I\u2019d have no idea. I\u2019d be completely oblivious to anything that isn\u2019t Seth. His hands circle my waist and my sight drops to his lips as he lowers them to mine. I feel his breath on my face as he painfully eliminates the distance between our mouths. My lips are parted by the time his graze mine and before they seal shut, his body goes rigid and he turns his head, taking his luscious lips away from me. I blink rapidly, feeling as though I\u2019ve just been let out of some crazy, lust-filled mind control. I was too consumed in Seth to hear Vanessa\u2019s door open and when I turn my head, I\u2019m met with the dark, espresso eyes that belong to one pissed off mother.</p><p>Seth shifts his weight and I pull away from him, straightening my shirt and skirt. I feel my face heat up and I clear my throat. There\u2019s no sign of embarrassment on Seth\u2019s features and I wonder if he actually cares that we were busted by his mother outside her door.</p><p>There\u2019s a long silence and my gaze flicks between the two. They watch each other in some silent showdown\u2014at least now I know where he got it from. The silence doesn\u2019t last long and is quickly broken as Vanessa\u2019s hand shoots out and slaps Seth right across the face. I gasp and my hands fly up to cover my mouth. He barely looks hurt by the slap and he keeps watching his mother. Hair prickles over the surface of my body and my entire system floods with shock and anger.</p><p>What the fuck?</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Seth</p><p>My face stings, but I\u2019ve been hit by things ten times bigger and stronger than my 120 pound mother. I don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t deserve it. I had her taken away in her sleep and sent to the other side of the country for rehabilitation. I\u2019d be pissed, too.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Olivia barks, stepping forward. I reach out, pressing my hand firmly against her stomach. The last thing I want is a fight between my mother and my girlfriend\u2014Mom is tall and has reach on her side, but don\u2019t underestimate Olivia\u2019s fierceness. The girl can throw a mean jab, too.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your son,\u201d O continues and I feel her stomach clench under my hand.</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am his mother,\u201d Mom interrupts. She flicks her long, back hair over her shoulder and straightens her blue blouse. \u201cYet he had me shipped to California against my will, kicking and screaming.\u201d</p><p>Despite the angry features that contort her face, she looks healthy. Her skin is free of that alcohol-induced sweat and her eyes are wide and alert. She really is a beautiful woman and I don\u2019t hold the slap against her.</p><p>\u201cYou look good, Mom,\u201d I tell her, unable to hide my smile.</p><p>I can feel Olivia\u2019s confused stare burn into the side of my face. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever understand me. I\u2019m unpredictable\u2014the best kind of unpredictable. Tears well in Mom\u2019s eyes and I know she\u2019s already forgiven me for putting her here.</p><p>\u201cOh, Sethy!\u201d she sobs before launching forward and wrapping her arms around my neck. I hug her back. I don\u2019t know how long we hug, but it\u2019s nice. With one hug, all of the apprehensions and nerves I had upon arrival are gone. They\u2019re replaced with feelings of happiness. Maybe it worked this time and she\u2019s better. Maybe I can take her home.</p><p>Mom pulls away as Olivia speaks. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you down the hall when you\u2019re ready.\u201d I see her lips slightly pouted, she\u2019s still a little mad and it\u2019s cute that she\u2019s fired up to protect me.</p><p>I nod at her and she whirls around on her heel before heading back the way we came.</p><p>\u201cI see you brought Nata\u2014\u201d</p><p>I look at Mom and frown. Why can\u2019t she remember her name? It\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s the one name I want her to remember and she can\u2019t even do that.</p><p>\u201cSara\u2014jane?\u201d</p><p>Holding in my frustration, I prompt her. \u201cOlivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, right. She\u2019s still around, I see.\u201d Mom turns around and enters her room.</p><p>I follow her and close the door behind me. Mom\u2019s room is immaculate\u2014definitely worth the money I forked out for it.</p><p>\u201cShe must be good in bed for you to keep her around this long. The other girls I saw at the house came and went in the same day.\u201d</p><p>Olivia is good in bed\u2014great in bed\u2014but that\u2019s not why I keep her around. I lean against the wall and fold my arms over my chest as Mom drops into a hard looking arm chair. \u201cShe\u2019s around because I love her.\u201d</p><p>Mom\u2019s eyebrow quirks and she pulls a small ball of fluff off her black slacks. \u201cYou? In love? C\u2019mon, Seth, we both know that\u2019s not true. Love isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIt is now.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve come a long way in such a short period of time that my mother wouldn\u2019t even know who I am anymore, and it\u2019s all because of one girl. My girl. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Her full lips twitch upwards. \u201cYou sound certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She starts to pick at her nails\u2014a habit that really gets under my skin. \u201cIf you\u2019re so confident, why haven\u2019t you asked her yet?\u201d</p><p>I grind my teeth together, frustrated. It\u2019s the same damn question I\u2019ve been asking myself every night before I sleep. Mom\u2019s lip twitch turns into a full smile.</p><p>\u201cYou want to marry her? Do you need my blessing?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s blessing. I\u2019m just informing you of my plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd children? Last I heard you never wanted kids. Has that changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I want kids. Three\u2014all boys.\u201d I tell her without hesitation.</p><p>When the hell did I decide that? Children used to be a \u2018no-go\u2019 zone, but now I know how many I want and the sexes I want them to be? If I\u2019m not careful, I\u2019ll be writing baby names into a notebook by the end of the week. Scary.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t choose their sex, Seth. Why don\u2019t you want a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarma, that\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Mom laughs and the sound is a welcome noise to my ears. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve heard her laugh hiccup free. \u201cAnyway, we have limited time. Tell me everything. How\u2019d your tournament go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won,\u201d I reply. \u201cI\u2019m in the pros now.\u201d</p><p>She shifts forward in her seat, excited, and it makes me feel all warm and shit inside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so great! I knew you could do it. How\u2019s Maddi?\u201d</p><p>How\u2019s Maddi? I should have assumed a conversation about my success would spark one about hers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I deadpan. And I didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been ignoring her calls since she moved to Vegas. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken since you hit her.\u201d</p><p>Mom flinches at the memory and sits back in her chair. I immediately feel bad. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up. It was years ago. Before we moved to Portland, Mom came home pretty drunk and Maddi and I were watching a movie. By that stage, it wasn\u2019t unusual for Mom to indulge in alcohol after work and we didn\u2019t hold it against her, considering Dad had passed away. Maddi told Mom about her plans to drop out of law school to go to Vegas with her douchebag boyfriend, Kye, and Mom lost her shit. She threw things, cursed, swore and cried\u2014she went through the usual over the top drunk emotions before lashing out and attacking Maddi. I knew Mom had crossed the line, but I let her slap Maddi repeatedly in hopes Maddi would come to her senses\u2014hell, I wanted to slap her. I don\u2019t like Kye. I don\u2019t like the way he looks at my sister\u2014or the way he touches her. He fills her head with hopes and dreams, ones I know she\u2019s too good for, and if, by some fucking miracle, his band does get picked up, I don\u2019t want Maddi to become second to him. She has to be first\u2014always. I want nothing but the best for my little sister. He\u2019ll fuck her around and I know he will...because he\u2019s like me. Difference is, I fucked around before I met the girl of my dreams. I\u2019ve experienced it all. He hasn\u2019t, and when the women start to throw themselves at him...I\u2019m worried my sister will get hurt.</p><p>Anyway, back on topic. I shouldn\u2019t have sat back and let Mom hit Maddi. I should have fucking done something.</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d Mom mutters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t myself.\u201d</p><p>I step closer. \u201cBut you are now and you seem okay. Let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>A sudden tear rolls from Mom\u2019s eyes and down the length of her cheek. She wipes it away. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Well, I wasn\u2019t expecting that. I crouch low, getting to eye level. Did I hear her correctly?</p><p>\u201cThis is where I need to be right now. I\u2019m so close to kicking the habit. I want to come home, but all I\u2019m thinking about right now is going to a bar for a Cosmo. I want to get better, Sethy, and I have to be here to do it.\u201d</p><p>She tucks a lock of black hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m okay physically, but mentally, I\u2019m drained. I can\u2019t go back to the real world yet. Not yet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want her to come home, but I\u2019m not going to pressure her. If she feels she needs more time, then that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll give her for as long as she wants.</p><p>\u201cYou can have more time, but the second you truly believe you\u2019re ready to come home, call me and I\u2019ll be on the first flight, regardless of where I am in the world.\u201d</p><p>Mom reaches out and cups my face. \u201cOh, my baby boy.\u201d she sniffles and blinks back tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to take care of me. You\u2019ve done so much for me...I\u2019m the parent, not you, and yet you stepped up to the plate and kept me going.\u201d</p> <p>To hear her acknowledge all that I\u2019ve done for her strikes me directly in the heart. It makes everything I\u2019ve done worth it. It makes all of the stress, all of the sleepless nights and scares I\u2019ve endured worth it.</p><p>Her bottom lip quivers and I want to flinch away. Seeing your mother cry is the worst thing in the world. It makes you feel small and helpless, like a child.</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve passed the dark stage I was in, I can admit to myself and to you that I wanted to die. Before I fell asleep every night, I prayed for death. I begged God to not let me wake up, knowing I\u2019d have to repeat it over and over\u2014waking up alone, driving to work alone, eating alone\u2014all of the things I was so used to doing with your father, I had to do alone and it affected me.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward, planting a quick kiss on my forehead. \u201cI never want to feel that again. I never want my children to see me like that ever again. I\u2019m better now, not perfect, but better.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never really had a deep and meaningful conversation with Mom. Not like this, anyway. She drops her hands from my face and I smile at her. \u201cYou were never alone and you never will be.\u201d</p> <p>A distracting beep over the P.A. pulls us from our conversation and Mom wipes her pink face with the back of her hand, sniffling with sadness...no, happiness\u2014maybe both.</p><p>\u201cAttention guests, visiting time is now over. Please say your goodbyes. You are more than welcome to return in four hours when visiting hours recommence. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my feet and run my fingers briefly through my hair.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you in California for?\u201d Mom asks, pushing up off of the couch.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow morning. I was going to take Olivia to the beach this afternoon, but I\u2019ll come back and visit you instead.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs and swats me away. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Take the girl to the beach. Cali is too beautiful to be stuck indoors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d Her long, thin arms surround me as she pulls me in for a hug and her familiar scent envelops me. \u201cTake her to the beach. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>After a quick goodbye, I close her door behind me and draw in a deep inhale. When I exhale, I feel different\u2014renewed. Mom is okay. For the first time in a long time, she isn\u2019t playing on my mind and I\u2019m completely at ease when I think about her. It has been years since I\u2019ve felt that way, and since meeting Olivia, the old chapters in my story have closed one by one\u2014Mason, Mom, all of the random girls and even Don. From here, new chapters will be written and they\u2019ll feature Olivia in every single sentence of every single paragraph. Without her, my story can\u2019t move forward and it can\u2019t be completed. I love her. She\u2019s the one good thing I\u2019ve allowed myself to have since I let Dad get into my head, and so far, so good. Maybe I am good. If I wasn\u2019t, why would the universe give Olivia to me? They wouldn\u2019t put someone as innocent as her in harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Maybe Dad was wrong about me.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I watch the beautiful girls in glamorous dresses practically glide around the restaurant. I envy them and their porcelain skin. I envy the way they sway with fluid movements\u2014movements so graceful, they give flowers swaying gently in the afternoon breeze a run for their money. I definitely feel like I\u2019m sitting low on the attractive scale tonight\u2014especially with the minor sunburn I received after being at the beach with Seth all day. Why he let me sleep in the middle of a Californian beach in the middle of the day is beyond me. Apparently, I looked \u2018too comfortable\u2019 to wake. He smiles at me from across the table and I roll my eyes at him. I don\u2019t care how comfortable I looked, I\u2019m not comfortable anymore, my skin stings a little and I\u2019m tired as hell.</p><p>The tight black dress with the plunging neckline I\u2019ve chosen to wear tonight may make me look slimmer, but it does nothing to lessen the pinkish hue in my skin.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve been to California before?\u201d I ask, slipping a piece of ravioli into my mouth.</p><p>Seth has been more than accommodating here in California. He knows which beaches to hit, what restaurants make the best steak, and I\u2019ve yet to pull out my wallet to pay for anything\u2014which is very strange for me. With Blade, I paid for almost everything. I don\u2019t like depending on people, it makes me uncomfortable. Depending on someone else doesn\u2019t come natural to me, but Seth has no problem swiping his card anywhere we go.</p><p>\u201cJackson and I used to come here every summer for a couple of years.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at me before taking a long sip of his ice cold water. I admire the way his black formal shirt tightens around his thick arms as he lowers the glass to the table.</p><p>\u201cHardly an innocent visit, I presume?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flare, dropping briefly to my chest before dragging back to my face. His lips curve into a mischievous smirk. \u201cIs anything I do innocent?\u201d</p><p>Marveling over my burning cheeks and how quickly he made them flush, I reply, \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>He holds me in his stare and suddenly my mouth is dry. I swallow hard and his dark eyes drop to my throat. The way he stares at me, like he wants to take me right now, sends a myriad of heat through my body and it pulses everywhere. I quickly run my tongue over my lips to moisten them. I need to do something\u2014anything\u2014to quench my desire for him and to stop myself from diving over the table and running my mouth over him. He looks at my lips with such fierce, erotic intensity before finally looking me in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s no question to his words. He wants to get out of here, now. Dropping my fork against my bowl with a cling, I nod my head. Who needs dinner when I have dessert waiting for me? Seth rushes to his feet in a hurry, pulling cash from his back pocket and dropping it on the table. As I push my seat back, a tall, beautiful girl in a gorgeous red gown floats graciously toward our table. Her eyes are on me first and I look at Seth, who\u2019s watching me with a questioning gleam in his eye. I arch an eyebrow. Strange that he thinks she\u2019s here for me, I haven\u2019t made any friends in California and Selena is my only real girl friend, anyway. I give him a \u2018She\u2019s not mine\u2019 shake of the head and look back to the girl, who\u2019s closed the distance between her and the table. Once she\u2019s here, her gaze shifts to Seth and I\u2019m no longer worthy of her attention. I take in her tight red dress. It clings to the subtle curves of her body and I hate that it looks so fucking good on her.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d she cheers, stepping forward and wrapping her arms around his neck. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s been so long!\u201d</p><p>I watch, curiously, as his body goes rigid and he places a hand on the small of her back, returning the hug\u2014sort of. When she pulls back, he seems almost frustrated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t remember me?\u201d</p><p>He glances at me, his facial expression melting from annoyed to worried. There\u2019s a bubble in my chest...jealousy? I think so. I\u2019m mad, but I don\u2019t want him to know it. Frustration burrows in under my ribs and I shuffle back in my seat. I forgot that Seth has a myriad of lady followers\u2014I remember the ones that came for him in the gym clearly.</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry.\u201d</p><p>She shifts her weight, planting a manicured hand firmly on her hip. \u201cJesse? We hung out at the Newport beach party last year.\u201d The way she says \u2018hung\u2019 makes me sick. I really hope she stops sparing my feelings\u2014besides, how old is she?</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d I blurt out, leaning forward in my chair.</p><p>Seth\u2019s stare flicks to me, warning clear in his eyes. I\u2019m not implying Seth would voluntarily have sex with someone under the legal limit, but there\u2019s no way this girl is older than seventeen.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d</p><p>I clench my teeth to prevent my mouth from falling open. Twenty-six? How is she older than both Seth and I? Her face is doll-like and she has a mass of golden curls that are tied into a classy bun. She has high cheek bones and huge blue eyes. Seventeen. I swear to god she\u2019s seventeen.</p><p>\u201cAnyway\u2014\u201d She exhales, turning her attention back to Seth. \u201cHow long will you be in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long...\u201d He glances sideways at me. \u201cMaybe we should have this conversation somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>The red-lipped smile that spreads over her face makes me sick. As she steps past him, he turns to me. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Stay here.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glaring at him, I can feel it. With a clenched jaw, Seth turns and follows the girl somewhere. When they disappear from sight, I slump into myself.</p><p>I tap my fingers along the white tablecloth for what feels like my fourth hour. I pull my phone from my handbag. It\u2019s only been eleven minutes. I sigh, dropping it back inside and placing my bag on the table. What the hell is this? We\u2019re having dinner one minute and about to go home and tear into each other. The next, he\u2019s gone with a girl he\u2019s fucked and I\u2019m alone at the table. That\u2019s not okay, right? Shit. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s acceptable and what isn\u2019t! Why couldn\u2019t he tell her to go? Why couldn\u2019t he tell her we were leaving? Why am I so pissed off? I can feel it poisoning my mood.</p><p>As soon as that thought passes, Seth appears back at the edge of the table. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, I grab my bag and rise to my feet. I keep my eyes on the floor as we leave the restaurant. When we reach the car, he opens the door for me and I climb in. When he slips into the driver\u2019s seat and shuts his door, my brain sends words shooting from my mouth before getting my tongue\u2019s approval.</p><p>\u201cDid you have sex with her last time you were here?\u201d I\u2019m proud of the indifference in my voice.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Not one second of hesitation on his part and I don\u2019t know whether I should be disturbed or proud of his honesty. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>I ponder the question, raking my teeth over my bottom lip, nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know...is it always going to be like this?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer and I take it as a big fat yes.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I told you that this part of my life was complicated. It\u2019s not complicated with drama and dark secrets. It\u2019s complicated with girls and their partners who want to kick my ass. I want to tell you that it won\u2019t happen again, but that\u2019d be a lie.\u201d He exhales. \u201cI\u2019m not good...and I don\u2019t have any emotional back story that\u2019ll make you sympathize with my behavior. I like sex\u2014love sex\u2014I love the way it feels. Plain and simple. I\u2019m bad, I told you that...and you still wanted me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right, I know that, but things were different before I fell in love with him. Back then, I only wanted fun. I only wanted to get back at Blade, but now, I want to be with Seth for the rest of my life. I want to be proud of him...I don\u2019t want to feel sick every time a girl talks to him because they\u2019ve fucked. It\u2019s not a nice feeling.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight, just take us home,\u201d I tell him, leaning back against the headrest and shutting my eyes against a headache that threatens to form. I know he\u2019s going to try and sort this out before we sleep and I hope we can. I don\u2019t want our time to be ruined because of this.</p><p>I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m happy with my own thoughts, but at this moment, my thoughts suck. I keep picturing the two of them having sex...her golden hair flowing everywhere, his strong hands gripping her hips as he thrusts into her.</p><p>I open my eyes, desperate to get away from the mental visions.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the silence while you can,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cBecause we\u2019re talking as soon as we get back.\u201d</p><p>I look out the window as dread fills my stomach. Talks with Seth are always intense...he doesn\u2019t believe in sulking and ignoring the issue. He faces things head on and doesn\u2019t stop until a conclusion is made. I don\u2019t know whether I like that approach...or absolutely loathe it. Either way, it was going to happen.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Seth</p><p>She drops onto the bed and kicks off her shoes while I lean against the wall with my arms crossed firmly over my chest. I watch as she reaches up to pull the big hoops from her ears and one after the other, she tosses them onto the mahogany bedside table. She\u2019s preparing for bed, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m letting her go to sleep yet, not until I break down every thought she has and reassure her that she is all I want. I\u2019ll replenish whatever love she lost for me tonight and then some\u2014I won\u2019t take anything less than one hundred and fifty percent.</p><p>\u201cTell me the three little words I said to you in Boston.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head. I know she doesn\u2019t want to get into this now, but I\u2019m not giving her a choice.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d I demand, stepping forward. \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>Easy enough.</p><p>\u201cNow ask me how many girls I\u2019ve said it to, besides you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighs, her attitude suddenly radiating off of her in waves. \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me.\u201d My voice comes out a lot more aggressive than I intended, but it startles her enough to answer me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many?\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me and the sight of her face is almost enough to make me falter and forget the whole situation. \u201cBut you already knew that, so why are you upset?\u201d</p> <p>She glances down at her hands. \u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a girl I had sex with in the past approached us at dinner? Because I walked her away from the table because I could see how much she was upsetting you?\u201d I unfold my arms. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give two shits about that girl and it hurts that you think she means anything to me.\u201d I quickly rake my fingers through my hair. I need her to believe that the girl was\u2014is\u2014nothing to me. \u201cShe was as much a stranger to me as she was to you.\u201d</p><p>I approach the bed and drop to my knees in front of her. Her body is tense, waiting for me to do something. I glide my hands up her smooth calves and up the sides of her thighs. Her gorgeous green eyes lock onto mine and the intensity of it makes my heart speed up.</p><p>\u201cWhat more can I say? Did I have sex with that girl? Yes, twice, but I can tell you with one hundred percent honesty that I don\u2019t even remember how the sex was\u2014I don\u2019t remember my sex life before you anymore. I don\u2019t. You are my resolution, O. You are the person I\u2019m here with\u2014the person I choose to be here with.\u201d I grip her, pulling her closer to me. \u201cI love you. I fucking love you more than you\u2019ll ever know and I know tonight hurt you, but I swear to God I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flick between mine as she soaks in what I said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t even tell you her name,\u201d I add, sincerely. \u201cBut I can tell you your name.\u201d I feel my lips twitch. \u201cI can tell you your favorite color, favorite food, favorite book and your favorite brand of perfume. I can download your favorite song right now and not think twice about it. I know you like I\u2019ve never known anyone else.\u201d I inch closer, bringing my face to hers. \u201cIf I could go back and change things, I would, without a doubt. But I can\u2019t. So, all I\u2019m asking is for you to trust me. I could never and would never hurt you like that. Ever. You\u2019re good and you deserve good. I know I\u2019m far from it, but what I am is all I have to offer you. If you want me, you get everything\u2014my problems, my passions, my past\u2014everything.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t need a response from her to know she\u2019s happy with what I said and I get the reaction I want from the feel of her fingertips grazing up my arms.</p><p>Olivia is the kind of person that shuts off whenever she\u2019s upset. She won\u2019t touch or talk. She prefers solitude, to wallow in her own thoughts. Fuck that. The thought of leaving her alone for a second when she\u2019s upset kills me and it\u2019s even worse when I know I\u2019m the one who made her upset in the first place. There\u2019s no filter on my mouth or my actions. I do it and watch the chemicals react. It\u2019s a science experiment, really.</p><p>O\u2019s fingers curl around my collar and she pulls me onto the bed. I willingly follow, neglecting to kick off my shoes. Her soft, alluring body molds perfectly to mine, and I love how soft and feminine she is. I lower my mouth to hers and I can feel her breath quick and nervous on my face, but before I touch, I tell her: \u201cI fucking love you with everything I have...and I won\u2019t take anything less from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you.\u201d</p><p>I run my hand over the top of her head, smoothing the dark locks as I look her in the eyes. \u201cTell me how much you love me.\u201d</p> <p>I want to hear it. I want her to use ridiculous metaphors and lame lines. I need it. I need to be reassured because I will not fucking lose her, not tonight.</p><p>Her gaze flicks nervously over my face. \u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>I feel my eyebrows draw together. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there are no words that describe what I feel for you.\u201d She swallows hard. \u201cI can tell you I love you to the moon and back, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s not enough. I can tell you I love you to the next universe and back and the distance still isn\u2019t enough to describe how I feel. I love you. I love you more than any word, any object, any emotion and any measure of distance this life can ever depict.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s wide green eyes remain locked on mine and she clears her throat. \u201cI overreacted...\u201d The corner of her delicious mouth twitches. \u201cMaybe, but it\u2019s only because I love you and you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>I agree. \u201cI am yours.\u201d</p><p>Lines carve their way through her otherwise smooth face, like she wants to get something off her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want other girls touching you.\u201d</p><p>She catches her plump bottom lip between her teeth and releases it, lighting my body up like a goddamn Christmas tree. Olivia has always played indifferent when it comes to girls until now and the thought of her claiming me sets my body alight with fiery passion. She hitches her thigh over my hip, pressing me into her.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like hearing your name on other girls\u2019 lips.\u201d Her fingers snake around my collar and she draws my head closer until her lips graze my ear. \u201cYour name coming out in excited gasps should only fall from my lips and the lips of your spectators, not random girls in restaurants.\u201d</p><p>Her tone is aggressive and possessive\u2014a tone I never thought I\u2019d hear come from my sweet \u2018do what she\u2019s told\u2019 Olivia. I want to unbutton my shirt so I can breathe a little easier, but I wait and watch, looking forward to what she\u2019s going to say next. Her eyes narrow. \u201cYou will not disappear with another girl ever again. Even if I\u2019m crying and my chest is hiccupping with sobs, you will not fucking leave me.\u201d</p><p>I open my mouth to agree with anything she wants, but she yanks on my neck, stopping my words from forming and pulling my lips hard against her own. Her hands push hard against my chest and I let her roll me over onto my back. She straddles me, her warm center hovering directly over my length that presses hard against my slacks. I can feel her warmth radiating through the fabric, teasing me. Her tongue glides against mine and this kiss isn\u2019t like our usual kisses\u2014the kind of kisses where I lead. She\u2019s claiming me, telling me exactly how things are going to go and I can\u2019t be more obliging. Hell, I\u2019ll agree to anything she wants me to do if it means her taking control of me like this every time.</p><p>Her hand runs down my stomach before slipping between our bodies and pressing her palm right against my hard dick. \u201cI could make you forget where you are\u2014forget your name and forget her with one swipe of my tongue.\u201d Her finger twitches against my cock and I subtly flex my hips into her hand. She\u2019s never put her mouth on my cock before. I\u2019ve thought about it a million times and I\u2019ve wanted her to, but I\u2019ve never pushed for it. \u201cBut I\u2019d much rather you sit and stew, blaming her for not getting any tonight.\u201d</p><p>Olivia slips off me and I abruptly push myself onto my elbows. My head spins as oxygen floods into my lungs, neglecting my brain. Her fingers trail up the side of her body before curling around the zipper and dragging it down the length of her torso. As the zipper nears the end, the dress falls from her, pooling at her high, glassy heels. Words fail me at the sight of her and all of her fucking naked perfection as my eyes drag down her pretty face, over her slim shoulders and linger on her perfectly round breasts. I stare for a few seconds as she stands there, letting me take in her whole form. My stare finally leaves her breasts before making their descent down her smooth navel and onto the bare slit between the gap in her thighs. Jesus. Fucking. Christ. I close my eyes briefly in an attempt to prevent a premature accident. She doesn\u2019t have to touch me and I\u2019m all ready to go. I want her to stroke herself while I touch myself\u2014and I want her to do it in those heels. She twirls and strolls toward the bathroom. I shoot up to a seated position. Where does she think she\u2019s going?</p><p>She turns back to me, shielding her body with the bathroom door. \u201cI\u2019m going to shower and then I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>Bed? Now? After she brought me to the edge? I don\u2019t think so. I launch myself off the bed, ready to join her in the shower, but she shakes her head, stopping me on my war path to ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d I can\u2019t believe it. When has she ever said no to me? Is it possible to scowl with a smile? I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. \u201cYou\u2019re sadistic.\u201d</p><p>With a flick of her eyebrows, she closes the bathroom door, leaving me alone in the bedroom. I stare at the chocolate panels of the door, my fingers itching to reach out and twist the gold door handle. If I hadn\u2019t pissed her off tonight, I\u2019d kick the door down and show her exactly who\u2019s in control here, but since I\u2019m already the bad guy, I\u2019ll leave it. I hurt her, so she can be in control for the night and only this once. I sigh, turning on my heel and exiting the bedroom. It\u2019s going to be a long fucking night.</p><p>I kick my shoes off behind the couch and trot up the stairs. I\u2019ve been outside on the balcony in the warm salty air for over forty minutes. I only planned to be out here while Olivia was in the shower, but I got to thinking and I couldn\u2019t stop. Tonight shouldn\u2019t have happened. I\u2019ve never been ashamed of my past. I\u2019ve never stopped and reflected on all of the decisions I\u2019ve made, or at least I hadn\u2019t until they started coming back to bite me in the ass one after the other. I knew they\u2019d come back on me, that\u2019s how karma works, but at the time I didn\u2019t care. The various emotions that flicker over her face when something like this happens\u2014sadness, distaste, jealousy\u2014all of them, they twist my stomach into knots and I feel unworthy of her. Dad always told me that I destroy every good thing I get. Was I destroying Olivia? If this keeps happening, will it change her? Will she care less for me?</p><p>I need to marry her so she can\u2019t leave me...I\u2019m not trying to trap her, I just want the proof that she will be beside me forever\u2014that she wants to be a part of my existence.</p><p>Olivia is the one thing I know my Dad would\u2019ve approved of. He wasn\u2019t there for me and when I think of him, the word love doesn\u2019t exactly spring to mind...but I still wanted him to be proud of me. What son doesn\u2019t want to make his father proud?</p><p>I push open the bedroom door and my eyes scan the semi-dark room. I don\u2019t know what I expected to find...a naked, horny Olivia perhaps? She\u2019s dimmed the lights and dimmed lights are always a good sign. I close the door behind me and as it clicks, I hear the sheets ruffle. In amongst the mass of royal blue sheets and pillows, I see a small foot sticking out over the edge of the bed and I smile to myself. She actually went to sleep. She put me in my place and then fell asleep without another word...strangely, I\u2019m proud of her.</p><p>Her stubbornness is what drew me to her in the first place, I suppose. She knows when to contest me and when to surrender. It\u2019s like she has a radar for when I need to be put in my place and when I need to be in control\u2014sure, she\u2019s mixed the two up a few times, but usually, she\u2019s right on the money.</p><p>Button after button, I undo my shirt and throw it to the floor. I drop my slacks and replace them with a pair of loose sweatpants from my suitcase that\u2019s awkwardly strewn across the room. As I crawl across the bed, her clean, fresh scent hits me like a ton of bricks and I realize I\u2019ve frozen in my spot. Her smell flows through me and I close my eyes as it filters through every pore and sets fire to my blood. Forcing myself to move again, I pull back the sheets on my side and slip in. Olivia is facing me, her hand tucked adorably under her chin and her body clothed in a thin, grey nighty that\u2019s pulled up over her hips, exposing the tiniest pair of white lace panties I\u2019ve ever seen. In the dim light, I can\u2019t make out the exact tone of her skin, but I know it\u2019s all a slight shade of pink. I smile, recalling the forty minutes I laid next to her on the beach. I had my sunglasses on so to passersby, we were both sleeping, but in reality, I was watching her. I memorized every inch of exposed skin, creating maps in my head\u2014maps I plan to follow with my lips.</p><p>I inch closer to her, keeping my eyes on her peaceful face. Without thought, my hand reaches out and I brush my fingertips over her outer thigh and over the thin, white material of her underwear. The very tips of my fingers seem to heat up as our skin connects and I continued my ascent, gliding my tips over her hip. Her lips part and she expels a warm breath of air, sending a pleasurable chill through my body that forces my hair to stand on its ends as goosebumps erupt over my skin. I can\u2019t help but imagine the sound right by my ear as I pleasure her. I drag my finger over the edge of her hip and across her stomach. With another breath, she rolls onto her back. I wait for a little while, not wanting to wake her, and when I\u2019m positive she won\u2019t, I continue to let my fingertips roam. Before long I\u2019m stroking the hem of her underwear. Despite being on her back, she\u2019s still facing me and I can hear her heavy breaths of anticipation. Even in her sleep she wants me to touch her. I know I should just leave her and let her sleep, but the pull she has on me is unstoppable. I slide my fingers over the outside of her lace panties, avoiding her sweet spot, to caress the insides of her thighs. I hear her breath catch in her throat as the edge of my finger grazes her center and she minutely thrusts her hips. Her leg inches closer as she spreads her legs a little wider. I keep my eyes on her face and her parted lips as I slide the very tip of my finger under the edge of her underwear. Her skin is soft and unbelievably smooth and as I slip my finger between her moist creases, she moans and it sends electricity crackling through my body. She spreads her legs even wider and I push my index finger inside. Her walls tighten around me, almost sending me over the edge and my dick hasn\u2019t even touched her yet. Forget touching, I\u2019m all about tasting. I push myself on top of her, taking extra care not to wake her. I lower myself until my face is directly between her thighs and right over the honey pot I so desperately want to taste. Her sweet scent overwhelms me, sending my senses into a frenzy. My cock aches from digging so hard into the mattress and I shift my hips to alleviate some of the pressure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pull her panties to the side and I admire her perfection in the dim lighting before parting her with my tongue. As soon as my tongue touches her hot flesh, she inhales sharply, her hips flexing into my mouth and forcing my tongue harder against her clit. I swirl my tongue, slowly at first, and her back begins to arch as her breathing becomes heavy enough for me to hear. The sound spurs me on and I lick faster and harder, until she\u2019s moaning and gripping the sheets. Heat, white-hot heat tears through my veins and I want to fuck her sweet pussy\u2014but I can\u2019t. This is about making it up to her and I\u2019ll gladly give myself a severe case of blue balls if it means making her happy.</p><p>I stop swirling my tongue against her delicious bundle of nerves and trace my tongue down her center and across her hole. Olivia shivers as my tongue sends feelings through her sleeping body. I hear the sheet strain under the pull of her hands as she tugs at it and I switch back to massaging her clit. An unintentional groan releases itself from my throat as I rub the back of my hand along her inner thigh before slipping the tip of my finger inside her. Olivia releases the sheets and I look up to see her lift her shirt and expose her breasts as she gropes herself, pinching and rolling her nipples between her fingers.</p><p>Fucking.</p> <p>Hell.</p><p>I move my finger in and out, slowly at first, until her hands fall from her tits and rake through my hair, urging my lips harder against her body as her legs hook over my shoulders. I glance up at her and see her still in a dreaming state. I drop my attention back to what I\u2019m doing, focusing on getting her exactly where I want her to be.</p><p>\u201cMmmm...\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick back to Olivia\u2019s face and lock onto her wide green eyes. Even in the dim lighting, I can see her cheeks flushed with her arousal. Her body shakes under the thrust of my finger and the quick, rough lashing of my tongue. I know she loves my fingers, so I add another and the effect of it has her rocking her hips into me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she pants, closing her eyes. \u201cOh, fuck yes.\u201d</p> <p>I feel her walls begin to tighten as she nears orgasm. The feel of it has me finger fucking her harder and faster. If she gets any tighter, I won\u2019t be able to move my fingers at all. I curl my fingers up and Olivia\u2019s legs draw nearer, threatening to crush my head between her thighs. I almost smile at the thought of making her come and catch her clit between my teeth, biting down on it ever so softly.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d she groans, her chest rising and falling quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not going to. As I slip in a third finger, Olivia\u2019s hips jerk upwards as loud moans tear from her lips. \u201cOh! Oh, God, fuck!\u201d</p><p>Her thighs crush my head, but it\u2019s not enough to keep me from pounding her with my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYes! Ohhh! Seth!\u201d Her walls spasm around my fingers and her pussy makes a slushing sound as they slide in and out. Sweet juices trickle from her, coating my finger and my tongue. Her body twitches as the effects of her orgasm wear off, leaving everything in a hypersensitive daze. I remove my fingers and run my tongue over her sweet spot one last time, making her body quiver and her chest heave with a satisfied giggle.</p><p>I slide my body up hers, pressing my hardness into her soft core and she squeezes my hips between her thighs. Excitement flares in the depths of her eyes as I kiss the very tip of her nose and roll off her. I close my eyes briefly, hoping the pulsating tightness in my pants wears off. Olivia sighs, slowly rolling her body my way and tucking herself into my side. Her fingers trail down my chest along my stomach before dancing along the hemline. I\u2019m still hard, still wanting to bury myself inside her, but I won\u2019t. Not tonight.</p> <p>I want to be inside her, but I think being selfless and giving her something without receiving anything in return is the best move I can make tonight, in terms of our relationship. She needs to know it\u2019s not all about sex with me. I love her more than sex, and not having sex with her tonight will (hopefully) show her that I\u2019m capable of giving without taking back. I pull her right into me, nestling my chin on top of her damp, strawberry scented hair.</p><p>As her hand curls underneath the band of my pants and swipes the tip of my cock, I snatch her wrist and pull it back. I feel her smile against my skin and I picture her perfect lips curl vividly in my head. So beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I want to.\u201d I press the palm of her hand against the hard bulge in my pants and grit my teeth against the urge to make her stroke it. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers twitch against me and I close my eyes, swallowing the mass of saliva that floods my mouth as the taste of Olivia lingers.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I say again, more as a reminder to myself than Olivia.</p><p>She yawns, pulling her hand back and slinging it around my waist. \u201cWho knows, maybe I\u2019ll wake you up with a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cDon\u2019t. When you do it, I want to be wide awake from start to finish with the lights as bright as they can be. I don\u2019t want to miss a second of it.\u201d</p> <p>She chuckles sleepily, snuggling closer. \u201cDo you want to film it, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I?\u201d I ask, a little too excited than I should have been.</p><p>Olivia swats my chest. \u201cI was being sarcastic. No, you can\u2019t film it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I can picture her rolling her eyes and I squeeze her a little tighter. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now.\u201d</p><p>I fall asleep soon after with the love of my life in my arms and the sweetest taste in the world on my tongue.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Olivia</p><p>(T-minus one day until Las Vegas)</p><p>I was alone on the way back to Portland\u2014or at least I might have well as been. Seth slept the whole way after taking a sleeping pill or two because he was feeling particularly anxious about the plane ride with all of the dark clouds hanging around.</p><p>I had to drive us to the airport and try and keep him awake until we got on the plane. It\u2019s not easy bearing the weight of his large frame, I\u2019ll tell you that. In the end, I had him leaning against a pole as I read stupid, unfunny jokes and articles from a Male\u2019s Humor magazine I found on a table nearby. The amount of strange glances we received was ridiculous and Seth\u2014I laugh once under my breath as Seth\u2019s sleepy smile fills my mind\u2014he\u2019s such a goofball sometimes. It was funny trying to watch him string together complete sentences. He zoned out that many times and ignored that many people I was worried they weren\u2019t going to let us on the plane. Eventually, they did and Seth was down for the count before the pilot had addressed the passengers. I had to clip his seatbelt on and make up a story about him being unwell to the concerned stewardess, who I think wanted Seth to wake up just so she could talk to him. It was all...amusing, to say the least. On the plus side, a sleeping Seth meant I could have my blind up and watch as we soared through the clouds.</p><p>Thankfully, Seth\u2019s car was still there when we got back into Portland, and I was the lucky designated driver again.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for the rest of the day?\u201d Seth yawns, still tired.</p><p>I glance sideways at him as he tugs his black hoodie up over his head and rests against the window. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s wearing a hoodie. The weather in Portland is warm and sticky\u2014it\u2019s anti-hoodie weather, really.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think I might sleep this off.\u201d</p><p>I glance at him again. \u201cIt\u2019s only nine a.m. and you want to spend the whole day in bed? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not the fun kind of \u2018all day in bed,\u2019 either?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make it fun.\u201d I swear I hear him smile. \u201cAfter a few hours\u2019 rest.\u201d</p><p>I pout. Maybe I can read while Seth sleeps, that might be fun. I haven\u2019t read in a while and I\u2019ve been dying to finish my latest historical romance novel, Love\u2019s Curse.</p><p>I pull into Seth\u2019s driveway and slip from the driver\u2019s seat. I love driving Seth\u2019s car\u2014on the rare occasion that I\u2019m allowed to drive it, that is. It\u2019s big compared to my blue Mazda 6 sitting outside Seth\u2019s house, but I love it so much more.</p><p>I lock the car and hand him his keys when he steps around to meet me on the other side. I glance down the quiet street, thankfully, Jackson isn\u2019t here and Seth and I might just have some absolute peace and quiet to wind down after our trip. Before we walk towards his house, Seth checks his mailbox and pulls out two white letters. One, he stuffs back in, but the other, he opens.</p><p>\u201cApparently, we have a dinner to go to in Vegas. Formal dress.\u201d He looks up at me, pulling the hood off his head and exposing his messy dark hair. \u201cI hate formal wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormal dress?\u201d I ask, ignoring his complaint. I wrack my brain, desperately trying to remember if I have a dress remotely nice enough for an event like that. Crap.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving for Vegas tomorrow,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m have to go dress shopping today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday? You can\u2019t go tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI need as much time as I can get. It has to be perfect.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already backing away from Seth towards to my car and dialing Selena\u2019s number in my head.</p><p>\u201cWait, at least take my card.\u201d He reaches for his back pocket and I feel my eyes go wide.</p><p>I\u2019m appalled that he\u2019d reach into his wallet for me. He\u2019s spent enough money this weekend\u2014plane rides, hotels, meals, cars\u2014I can\u2019t fathom him spending another cent on me. I stuff my hands into the pocket of my jeans as he pulls the black and gold card from his wallet, extending it to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking that.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, like I\u2019m being stupid. \u201cWhy? I don\u2019t want you spending your money on a dress you\u2019re only going to wear once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking your card. I\u2019m a big girl, I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>He steps forward. I step back and he exhales. \u201cNot this again, Olivia. Take the card.\u201d</p><p>I whirl around on my heel and unlock my car with my spare key. Thank God I put it in my back pocket before we left California. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>I duck down as I open the door. As quickly as I ducked, I pop back up, meeting Seth\u2019s disapproval head on. \u201cThanks for California. Love you.\u201d</p><p>I dive into my car, start it up for the first time in a few days, and drive towards Annie\u2019s Formal Wear. It\u2019s the only dress shop I know that will definitely have something breathtaking for me. I see the gowns in the window every time I drive past on my way to work in the morning. I dial Selena\u2019s number and bring the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHey you! Are you back?\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cYep, meet me at Annie\u2019s Formal Wear in fifteen. We need dresses for a formal dinner in Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJackson and I are already sorted for that, but I\u2019ll meet you there, anyway. I don\u2019t want you picking a dress I\u2019d approve of in the nineties.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cFifteen minutes or I\u2019m shopping without you.\u201d</p><p>I drop my phone into a cup holder and speed towards the dress shop. I can\u2019t contain my excitement. It bubbles in my chest and I clench my hands tighter around the steering wheel. Forget clubs and tight small dresses. Elegant gowns and formal dinners are what I\u2019m all about. Those are worth wasting a night for and I need to find the perfect dress\u2014the kind of dress that will knock Seth\u2019s socks off and have everyone at the dinner eating out of the palm of his hand.</p><p>I meet Selena in the convenience store across the road from the dress shop. I take one look at her tight black dress and tall, gold heels and glance down at my jeans and tee. At least I don\u2019t look like a hooker.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d I ask, approaching her with a wide smile.</p><p>She smiles back and her bright green eyes flare at me. \u201cFree for you, baby.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around her slim frame, pulling her tightly against me. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve hung out with her, just the two of us. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything when you\u2019re giving it out to everyone for free, anyway.\u201d</p><p>She squeezes me and the sweet smell of her candy perfume engulfs me. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just trying to make you feel better about yourself.\u201d</p><p>I swat her away and she giggles, exposing her perfect teeth. \u201cBefore we go across, I want to get some snacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnacks? We\u2019re going dress shopping, not seeing a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, if I\u2019m going to be sitting around for a while watching you try on dresses I probably won\u2019t approve of, I\u2019m going to need all of the sustenance I can get.\u201d</p><p>With a heavy exhale, I follow her into the convenience store. We walk around the shop and every now and then, I catch Selena glancing at me like she really wants to tell me something.</p><p>\u201cDo I have something on my face?\u201d I ask her, rubbing my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cNo.,\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you staring at me? It\u2019s awkward.\u201d</p><p>She stops walking while I look at little packets of Tylenol. There\u2019s a small throb at the back of my skull and I know it\u2019s going to expand into a full blown headache within the next hour or two.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d She complains, frustrated with herself.</p><p>I drag my eyes from the box of Tylenol to her face. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine!\u201d She sighs. \u201cI let Jackson do something to me.\u201d</p><p>I tuck the Tylenol under my arm as I choke on a laugh. \u201cGeez, I didn\u2019t even finish my question and you\u2019re ready to spill everything. Remind me not to tell you anymore of my secrets. You suck at this interrogation thing.\u201d</p><p>She slaps my arm and folds her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019d never repeat your secrets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I narrow my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAt least not the really important ones,\u201d Selena clarifies with a satisfied nod of her head.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all important, that\u2019s why they\u2019re secrets.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think there are definitely different degrees of secrets. For example\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the examples,\u201d I demand, plucking the Tylenol from under my arm and giving it to her. \u201cJust tell me what you want to tell me.\u201d</p><p>She blushes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say. I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m weird.\u201d</p><p>I snort, absentmindedly picking up a small box and reading the back of it. As soon as I read the first sentence \u2018Ribbed increases her pleasure,\u2019 I flip the box around and read the front before stuffing it back on the shelf. I feel blood rush to my cheeks as Selena laughs her laugh\u2014you know, the head back mouth wide open kind of laugh, the same laugh that also draws unwanted attention. I move erratically and end up knocking a whole row of condoms off the shelf. Forgetting the mess, I grab Selena\u2019s arm and drag her away. When we round the corner, she shrugs out of my grasp. \u201cRelax, you\u2019re old enough to buy condoms.\u201d Her eyes grow wider with excitement. I know that look. It\u2019s the same look she gets when she\u2019s ready to gossip. \u201cTell me, what size does Seth use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so obsessed with my sex life and what size condoms my boyfriend uses?\u201d I whisper as an elderly woman strolls past.</p> <p>I give her a kind smile, one she gracefully returns. Thank God, she didn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m curious. I want to know. I like sex and I like to talk about sex, and now that you finally have a boyfriend I wouldn\u2019t mind picturing naked, I want to know all of the details.\u201d We stroll down another aisle\u2014the confectionary aisle\u2014and Selena grabs a long, skinny packet of Twizzlers. \u201cSo, what size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I mumble, avoiding her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t use them.\u201d</p><p>The Twizzlers fall to the ground and I stare down at them before looking at Selena\u2019s terrified face. You\u2019d think she just saw a ghost.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me? You start banging a hot guy and you throw all caution to the wind? You know what comes from unprotected sex? Fucking babies\u2014crying, pooing, eating\u2014babies. Not necessarily in that order and sometimes all at once.\u201d</p><p>I laugh at her because there\u2019s nothing else to do. Typical Selena, always blowing things out of proportion.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh, O. I\u2019m serious. Do not take that unprotected sex shit lightly\u2014did you even hear what I said? Babies. B. A. B. I. E. S. Screw that.\u201d</p><p>Selena never has been a baby person, but I have. I\u2019ve always wanted kids\u2014hell, I even expected to have at least one by the age of twenty-three.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protected,.\u201d I say, picking up her lollies. She takes it from my hands and puts in on the shelf. Apparently, she\u2019s lost her appetite.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and smoke alarms in houses actually prevent fires,\u201d she states sarcastically. \u201cBy the time you\u2019ve woken up to a smoke alarm, it\u2019s too late. The fire has started and the smoke is already filling the house. Don\u2019t rely on the pill. Double up on protection\u2014shit, triple up on protection. Make no mistakes.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and proceed down the aisle. \u201cAnyway,\u201d I exhale. \u201cWhat did you let Jackson do to you?\u201d</p><p>With a huff, she drops the conversation about Seth and I having unprotected sex.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me start off by saying that I\u2019m not afraid to try anything and I\u2019m pretty much DTF for anything.\u201d</p><p>DTF? What the hell does that mean? I roll my eyes and Selena scoffs. \u201cDon\u2019t you judge me, O. I was born to be awesome, not perfect.\u201d She continues with her story. \u201cJackson is into some weird things and last night...I let him tie me down.\u201d</p> <p>I stop walking. \u201cYou let him tie you down?\u201d</p><p>The old lady that passed by us earlier walks by again, this time hearing my mini outburst. I give her my best \u2018I really hope you didn\u2019t hear that\u2019 smile and she frowns at Selena and I before shaking her head and slowly strolling away.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you let him tie you down? You\u2019re a human being, for Christ\u2019s sake, not an animal,\u201d I tell her in a harsh whisper.</p><p>\u201cBecause I like him and he promised he wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, that\u2019s what the serial killer said to his victim in the last Law and Order episode I watched.\u201d</p><p>She blinks at me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a TV sho\u2014never mind\u2014the girl was found in a garbage bin. My point is...\u201d I say. \u201cOkay, so I don\u2019t actually have a point. You can do whatever the hell you want with your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2014and I do, but the thing is...it doesn\u2019t stop at tying down. I wish I could tell you, O, but I promised him I wouldn\u2019t say anything. It took him so long to open up to me sexually and I don\u2019t want you to repeat it to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho am I going to tell? Mom?\u201d I laugh once. \u201cYou\u2019re my only friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I won\u2019t tell you everything, I\u2019ll just tell you that he\u2019s into public sex.\u201d</p><p>That I knew already.</p><p>\u201cAnd he likes to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>I frown.</p><p>\u201cOnly when we have sex, it\u2019s not anything over the top. He doesn\u2019t bruise me or cut me or anything like that.\u201d Is that supposed to make me feel better? \u201cHe likes to slap me... on the ass really hard and sometimes with things like belts or whips. He likes to bite me and pinch me as well as pull my hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait...\u201d I interrupt. \u201cYou just let him do those things to you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cHe needs it. He can\u2019t...finish, unless something unusual is happening and I want to be the person to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he needs is professional help.\u201d</p><p>Selena\u2019s brows pull together and her lips straighten into an impassive line. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need professional help, Olivia. He needs someone who understands him.\u201d</p><p>Oops. I didn\u2019t mean to step on anyone\u2019s toes, but Jackson has definitely got some deep seated issues.</p><p>\u201cCan you do that, though?\u201d I ask her straight out. \u201cWhat if he wants things that you can\u2019t give to him? What if you draw a line and he wants to cross it?\u201d</p><p>She visibly thinks about my question. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you like it when Jackson does all of these things to you, then fine, more power to you. All I\u2019m saying is talk to him before you give yourself over because his problems probably go deeper and darker than what he\u2019s showing you.\u201d</p><p>Selena opens her mouth to protest, but I flash her the palm of my hand. \u201cI know he doesn\u2019t like to talk, but you\u2019re compromising for him. Make him compromise for you.\u201d</p><p>She thinks for a second, before slowly nodding her head.</p><p>I sigh, hoping she talks to Jackson. I don\u2019t want him taking advantage of Selena\u2019s carefree soul, especially now that she\u2019s falling for him.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s go find a dress.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re barely in the shop for five minutes before my gaze falls onto a stunning deep purple gown. It flows to the floor and has two thin straps covered in exquisite beaded patterns that come down and circle the waist. Underneath the beaded waist, there\u2019s a thin strip of purple lace that will expose a thin strip of skin before the beaded pattern starts again.</p><p>This.</p><p>This is the dress I\u2019ll wear to Seth\u2019s dinner. It\u2019s sexy. It\u2019s elegant and it\u2019s perfect.</p><p>\u201cThat is amazing!\u201d Selena coos. She reaches out and pulls it off of the rack. \u201cTry it on.\u201d</p><p>She shoves it into my hands and the smooth satin fabric glides between my fingertips. Yep, this is definitely the dress I\u2019m going to wear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to try it on. I want it.\u201d</p><p>Selena stares at me, the same stare that Seth gave me after I declined using his card. Her stare doesn\u2019t make me excited like Seth\u2019s does, though. \u201cYou have to try the dress on, to make sure it fits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll fit,\u201d I tell her, hugging the dress closer to me.</p><p>She grabs my shoulder, her bony fingers dig into me as she spins me around, nudging me in the direction of the changing rooms.</p><p>Inside, the rooms are spacious. So spacious there\u2019s even a couch to sit on and watch your friends get dressed. That\u2019s not weird at all. Of course, Selena has to sit and watch me change. Once I\u2019m in the dress, I feel different, and at risk of sounding like a complete and utter loser, I feel like a princess. The dress exposes an appropriate portion of my breasts and clings to my waist and hips before flowing smoothly down my legs in an endless stream of purple perfection.</p><p>\u201cSeth will really like this.\u201d I smile, twirling to look at the back. The back of the dress elegantly exposes my back.</p><p>\u201cHe will. Who knows, maybe he\u2019ll like it enough not to tear it from your body.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flick to her and I feel my cheeks grow red. Seth has a habit of tearing all of my pretty things. \u201cNo comment.\u201d</p><p>Selena falls back against the couch in defeat. \u201cCome on. You\u2019re no fun! Tell me about it. Tell me something about Seth and sex. I bet he\u2019s good, is he good?\u201d</p><p>The store owner peers awkwardly around the door and Selena smiles at her like nothing is wrong. The lady returns Selena\u2019s smile with a glare, like we\u2019re unworthy of being in her store before huffing once and stalking away. Selena rolls her eyes and continues talking, unashamed. \u201cAt least tell me one thing he does that you like?\u201d</p><p>I proceed to unzip the dress. \u201cNo, Sel, I\u2019m not telling you anything. You\u2019ll repeat it to Jackson and whoever else will listen\u2014probably even my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and Selena tries a different approach. An approach she knows will get a reaction out of me.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it when he kisses your neck?\u201d I step away from the mirror so she can\u2019t see my emerging smile in the reflection. \u201cMaybe you like it when his strong hands roam your body, gripping you in all of the right places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelena,\u201d I warn her. Her words make me breathless as I imagine all of the things she says vividly in my head.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you like it when he moans your name...\u201d She moans my name in her best \u2018Seth\u2019 voice and I grab the emerald dress that hangs on the rack. I glance over my shoulder and she smiles wickedly at me as my face heats up. \u201cWhen he takes you roughly from behind?\u201d</p><p>I turn and throw the dress at her and she laughs wildly, balling the fabric. \u201cYou are such a dirty girl, O! Underneath that innocent face there\u2019s a sexual beast, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>I want to be mad at her for being so uncensored, but I can\u2019t. She has one of those faces\u2014like Seth\u2019s\u2014one you just can\u2019t bring yourself to hate. As she giggles like an idiot, I remove myself from the gown and get back into my plain blue jeans and white tee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get this dress. Now, let\u2019s get the hell out of here before you embarrass me anymore.\u201d</p><p>I trot from the dressing room and pay for my dress, all while Selena giggles behind me. She can\u2019t stop. She loves tormenting me, she always has, and the store owner doesn\u2019t appreciate me blurting out a laugh once or twice as she rings my purchases up on the register. I think I even spat on her a couple of times. Stupid Selena, it\u2019s like high school all over again. You know, when you\u2019re trying desperately not to laugh, but end up cackling like a psychopath? Yeah, this is one of those moments and when she hands me my receipt, I can\u2019t get out of there quick enough.</p><p>After the dress shop, Selena went to see Jackson and I went home. I figure I\u2019ll have an easier time keeping myself from showing Seth my dress if I don\u2019t see him straight away. Strangely, Mom isn\u2019t home, so I go straight to my room and hang my dress in my closet. Boxes still litter the floor, along with a ridiculous amount of clothes. Dirty or clean, I have no idea. My phone rings and I know it\u2019s Seth because I set his walk in song as his personal ringtone while we were in California. I pull it from my pocket and bring it to my ear, closing my wardrobe and leaning against it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>He yawns his hello to me. Seriously? He was sleeping the whole time I was out? Somehow, I was gone for almost three hours.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have if you were here.\u201d He sighs. \u201cI slept okay. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I love when his voice is all husky from sleep.</p><p>\u201cI just got home and put my dress away. I\u2019m probably going to start packing for Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun,\u201d he deadpans and I smile. Seth hates packing more than I do and I know he\u2019ll leave his until the hour before we leave. \u201cI\u2019m heading down to the gym. Darryl called and wants to do a small training sesh this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful. How are you feeling? I didn\u2019t really take care of you too well in California...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were perfect in California and I\u2019m fine. I hardly feel a thing.\u201d</p><p>I believe him. The time we spent in California was both relaxing and liberating\u2014we didn\u2019t have sex and Seth didn\u2019t get into any fights, so his body had a good chance to recover. I know he won\u2019t miraculously heal overnight, but he\u2019ll be perfect by the time his fight comes around in a little over two weeks. We\u2019re all leaving for Vegas in two days\u2014Selena, Jackson, Darryl, Seth and I\u2014plus whatever staff the MMAC have assigned to Seth. From twelve a.m. the day of our departure to Vegas will be exactly t-minus two weeks until Seth\u2019s first debut professional fight. He seems excited for it, but I wish he expressed his feelings to me\u2014not the cocky bullshit he uses to cover his worry. Seth is confident in his skills, but I also know he doubts himself more than anyone else I know. Not that he\u2019d ever admit that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill I see you today?\u201d he asks, pulling me from my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYou can see me anytime you want. I was going to pack, but if you need me at the gym, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I can manage...just.\u201d He laughs once under his breath. \u201cPack your bags and I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d His three little words make me smile widely and I turn my body so I don\u2019t see my cheesy smile in the mirror on my dresser.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>He lingers on the line for a few seconds longer before sighing and hanging up. I don\u2019t know what goes through his head sometimes. I lob my phone onto my bed and place my hands on my hips. I don\u2019t have to pull my suitcase out from any hidden nook\u2014it\u2019s already open on the floor of my room. I step toward it, lifting my feet higher than normal so no tricky clothes wrap themselves around my toes and trip me. I kneel beside the suitcase and run the palms of my hands down my thighs, letting a heavy exhale fall from me. Finally, I reach out and begin sorting through the clothes as I pack for the biggest adventure of my life.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>Seth</p><p>I lean against my car, my hands stuffed into my jeans as I wait for Olivia. Portland is surprisingly cold at four-thirty in the morning. Apparently, Darryl booked the earliest flights he could get. He\u2019s all about making the most of his day and he doesn\u2019t want to spend the bulk of it sitting in an airplane. By my calculations, we get on the plane at five-thirty a.m. and we\u2019ll be in Nevada by eleven a.m. Not bad, but it\u2019s still too goddamn long for me. I\u2019d much rather drive the two thousand, eight hundred and eighteen miles to get there and avoid falling from the sky. I\u2019ve been lucky so far, but how long can I dance with death? One of these days, he and karma might decide they\u2019re sick of my shit and send me plummeting into the ocean.</p><p>I\u2019m jerked from images of a falling, fiery death by the sound of Olivia\u2019s front door opening and the screen slapping against the brick wall. Seeing her immediately eases some of my hesitation and I push off of the car and make my way through the gate to grab her suitcase for her. She looks adorable in a white hooded jacket and black slacks. Olivia smiles sleepily at me and I can\u2019t help but smile back. She\u2019s too pretty not to smile at, even when she\u2019s mad.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she greets me, making my heart feel all stupid and warm.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I reply, taking her suitcase and pushing it behind me.</p><p>Forgetting the luggage, I grab Olivia\u2019s jacket and tug her to me. Her sleepy face wakes up the instant I press my body against hers. I don\u2019t know why I always pull her into me...but I feel better when I\u2019m touching her. I feel at peace, like everything is okay. Her green eyes study my face, watching me closely. I want to kiss her. I\u2019m going to kiss her. I lower my mouth to her, barely pressing my lips against hers. I pause for a little while, listening to her quick breathing. I love the way I affect her and I know if I slipped my hands into her pants, she\u2019d be wet and ready for me\u2014she always is. As I press my lips harder against hers, her Mom, Sandra, trails out behind her carrying a long black bag.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your dress, Olivia. Morning, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Olivia snaps away from me, like I\u2019m a hot plate she absentmindedly put her hands on. I smile, amused by her reaction. Olivia takes the dress from her mother and briefly looks at me, her pink cheeks flaring before she takes the dress to the car. An awkward silence fills the air between Sandra and I. I know Sandra isn\u2019t exactly my number one fan, but I also know she likes me enough to be with her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask her to marry me,\u201d I tell Sandra flat out, no bullshit.</p><p>Her thin, brown eyebrows almost rise to her hairline, but she tries to play my announcement off as no big deal. \u201cAre you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, while we\u2019re in Vegas. And I\u2019m going to take her from this house and put her in mine.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Sandra\u2019s lips twitch, her sludgy, green eyes narrowing in on me. \u201cI get the feeling you\u2019re not asking for my permission?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m telling you how things are going to go.\u201d</p><p>She folds her arms. She looks so tiny in her floral robe. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully confident Olivia is going to say yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am,\u201d I say and my stomach churns with the lie. I don\u2019t know why I feel so much apprehension about her response. She loves me. She tells me almost every day, but she\u2019s also flighty and unpredictable. There\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll say no or not yet and my mission in Vegas is to take away those chances. When I\u2019m positive she\u2019ll do anything for me, I\u2019ll ask her and I won\u2019t ask her the traditional way. No. I\u2019ll ask her the \u2018Seth\u2019 way so she never fucking forgets it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have my approval...even if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>Her words catch me off guard and I\u2019m suddenly frozen, incapable of speech. Did she just give me permission? Did Sandra James give me, Seth Marc, her blessing? I fight the urge to pinch myself to see if I\u2019m dreaming.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She flicks her hand at me and I snatch it, pulling her into a hug. Instead of swatting me away like I expected, she chuckles and quickly pats my back. When I release her and she steps back, she swipes at her eyes and turns her back to me.</p><p>\u201cSafe travels. Keep my baby safe.\u201d</p><p>Before I can respond, she enters the house and shuts the door. I grab the suitcase and turn toward the car, Olivia has the door open and both she and Selena are staring at me, their eyes bulging out of their skulls.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask as I open the gate and step through it.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d they respond in unison.</p><p>I approach the rear of the car and put the last suitcase inside. Olivia and Selena\u2019s suitcase takes up the most space, leaving just enough room for the rest of us.</p><p>Thankfully, Jackson is in the front seat and Selena is in the back. I swear to God if I have to listen to one more make out session or moan fall from either of their lips I\u2019m going to snap. I climb into the backseat and Olivia immediately snuggles into me. I haven\u2019t seen her since I called her last. I\u2019ve been so busy sorting out the gym for our leave and dealing with lawyers I haven\u2019t had time to show her any attention.</p><p>On the plus side, my lawyers told me the MMAC is reviewing the settlement details. They refuse to let Don go, they want to draft him at some point and this little...predicament is the only thing stopping them.</p><p>Darryl drives towards the airport. I wrap my arm around Olivia\u2019s shoulder, pulling her closer. I want to touch her\u2014to smell her. I need anything and everything from her, to make up for her absence.</p><p>\u201cYou amaze me,\u201d Olivia mumbles, her voice loud enough for only me to hear over the sound of the soft music. I glance down at her, taking in the sharp angles of her face and her kind eyes and juicy, soft lips.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>She nods without an explanation and I don\u2019t press her. I can survive off those words alone. Her eyes don\u2019t drop from mine and I keep watching her, waiting for her to look away. Instead, I feel a build up of electricity starting in my chest and radiating south. Suddenly, my surroundings fade away and she holds all of my attention. I run my fingers up her neck and across her cheek to her bottom lip. Her lips part, her tongue emerges, and I watch as it licks the top of my finger\u2014so soft and wet. I can\u2019t help but wonder what her tongue feels like against other parts of my anatomy and I shift slightly in my seat, hoping to make my jeans feel less...tight. My mouth runs dry and if it were just us, I\u2019d pull over and moisten it with the taste of her. I\u2019d let her soak every inch of fabric in the car with her delicious wetness.</p><p>I slip my finger from her mouth, but keep my gaze locked on her lips. She straightens her back, bringing her mouth closer to mine and then she kisses me. It\u2019s slow and quiet, going unnoticed by the other three. My eyes close and I run the back of my finger along her jawline. Then, I crack under my urges and grip her jaw, forcing her mouth harder against mine. I feel her breath being sucked from her lungs and I swear I hear her heartbeat pick up and her pussy become slick with need.</p><p>\u201cEasy now.\u201d I hear Selena giggle. \u201cMy makeup isn\u2019t water proof.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulls away from me and rests against my shoulder. I hear Jackson laugh in the front seat and see the side of Darryl\u2019s face as he smiles. \u201cNeither is my phone.\u201d</p><p>Silence falls in the car for a split second before it\u2019s broken by laughter\u2014from all of us and soon after, we dive into conversations about Vegas and what we should do there. Darryl is first to pipe in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re unavailable five hours a day, every day, leading up to the fight. That\u2019s two hours in the morning\u2014four a.m. to six a.m. One hour during the day, eleven a.m. to twelve p.m., and then four p.m. to six p.m.\u201d He clears his throat. \u201cOutside of those times, you\u2019re free to do whatever you like\u2014except all of the things you\u2019re not allowed to do like drinking, or doing something stupid that can put you at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip clubs aren\u2019t bad for you,\u201d Jackson chimes in and I feel Olivia go rigid against me.</p><p>I rake my teeth over my bottom lip, recalling the last time we went to a strip club. It was such a stupid move on my part. Olivia wanted to stay home, but I was the designated driver and I forced her to come out with us. We all made a few bad decisions that night and Olivia suffered the consequences for all of them.</p><p>\u201cNo strip clubs,\u201d Olivia orders. \u201cI\u2019m not making out with a stripper again. It was disturbing enough the first time.\u201d</p><p>Jackson roars with laughter and I hear him slap his thighs. \u201cJesus Christ, that was so funny. Every time I picture your face when she kissed you, I laugh. You were a deer in headlights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Ha. Ha. Laugh it up.\u201d</p><p>I stroke Olivia\u2019s arm with my thumb as Selena speaks. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to go to a strip club in Vegas. We have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to Vegas and not going to a strip club is like going to Paris and not bothering with the Eiffel Tower. What\u2019s the point?\u201d Jackson chimes in.</p><p>Selena agrees.</p><p>\u201cNo one is stopping you guys from going, but don\u2019t expect me to tag along,\u201d Olivia states, yawning.</p><p>The car fills with lively chatter about all of Vegas\u2019s endless possibilities and all I can think about is snuggling with Olivia in my spare time. Fuck the casinos. Fuck the strip clubs. I want to lie in bed with my girl and enjoy every second I can because the closer I get to my first pro fight, the more unnerved I know I\u2019ll become. I\u2019m two weeks out and I already feel anxious...my first pro fight...in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the MGM Grand in front of thousands of spectators as well as being broadcasted across the sports network. I need my head in the game, not in some stripper\u2019s breasts or in a poker machine.</p><p>I\u2019m not in Las Vegas for pleasure. It\u2019s business only and I will treat it as such.</p><p>We drive along Las Vegas Boulevard, but I\u2019m still too nervous from the plane ride to really appreciate it. I rest my head against the headrest while Olivia and Selena stick their heads out of the limo sunroof like little puppies. I almost smile. I was the same the first time I rode in a limo. It\u2019s hot in Nevada and the open sunroof doesn\u2019t allow for the air conditioning to work to its full potential.</p><p>\u201cShutting the roof!\u201d Darryl calls through the front window, as if reading my mind.</p><p>Darryl decided he\u2019ll drive the limo, not trusting anyone else to chauffeur his precious cargo around. Here\u2019s an unknown fact about Darryl, he has a license to drive a bus, a car, a limo, and a truck. How many of them fall under the same license category, I have no idea, but it\u2019s still impressive.</p><p>Selena and Olivia drop down, nestling comfortably in their seats with a remaining fit of giggles shaking their bodies. Their faces are flushed with the outside heat and as soon as the roof closes, I feel the cooler air brush over my skin.</p><p>I watch as Olivia slides across the leather seats and right into me. My eyes flit to her nice sky blue blouse. It clings to her slim waist and hips, exposing a small portion of her cleavage, too. The fabric is thin and I know I can easily ruin it with my teeth. She removed her jacket a long time ago and I\u2019ve had the pleasure of carrying it around with me.</p><p>During the day, Vegas is still surprisingly busy, filled with the tourists who want to avoid Vegas\u2019s nightlife. I don\u2019t blame them. The nightlife here in Vegas can get pretty wild. Everyone is looking to make their own Hangover story and to indulge in all of the city\u2019s darkest pleasures.</p><p>We slowly make our way up Las Vegas Boulevard and soon enough, we arrive at the MGM Grand. The others waste no time in clambering excitedly from the car, but I wait a little while to gather my thoughts. Olivia waits too, watching me curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou made it to Vegas,\u201d she tells me and I look at her.</p><p>She tucks a lock of long, chocolate hair behind her ear and her lips curve with the hint of a smile. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Her long, soft fingers slide over the back of my hand that lies idly in my lap. I don\u2019t know why I feel so out of it. My chest aches and the warmer air makes it harder for me to breathe. This is the beginning of my new life\u2014the life I never really expected to have. I made it through hard work and dedication...so why do I suddenly feel like I\u2019m not strong enough to be here? The feeling of impending failure is weighing down on me and I can\u2019t shake it and I haven\u2019t been able to since I fell asleep last night. I guess I always expected this to fall to pieces. Every good thing I get never works out and I\u2019m cautious as to why this is all still happening for me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead weight,\u201d Dad\u2019s voice rings throughout my mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I remember laughing at him. \u201cI\u2019m not dead weight. I\u2019m a fucking balloon\u2014a soaring fucking plane and I\u2019m never coming down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBalloons may fly high, but after a certain limit they pop and planes have to land sometime. They both have their needs and limitations, just like you. You could have said bird, they don\u2019t need much sustenance and they don\u2019t fly too high, but you had to go and put yourself thousands and thousands of feet above everyone else. That says a lot about you, your personality and your temperament. You always have to be number one. You always put your wants and needs before anyone else\u2019s, and you always have to be in control...I feel sorry for you, Seth.\u201d</p><p>I swallow. Would it have killed him to say that he\u2019s proud of me on a regular basis? Shit, he didn\u2019t even have to tell me he was proud of me, actually disciplining me and giving me proper advice on what to do and what not to do would have sufficed. Yes, I fucked up a lot with school and girls. Yes, I dropped out of college and refused to get a normal job. I probably drank way too much and started way too many fights, but I was only a kid. Isn\u2019t that what kids do?</p> <p>This year has done nothing but inflate me...why haven\u2019t I popped yet? Why haven\u2019t I landed for fuel? I\u2019m getting dangerously close to the sun with no sign of bursting. My fuel is redlining, but my engines are running just fine on the fumes.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure your dad is proud of you as well,\u201d Olivia adds with a smile.</p><p>And then it hits me. I haven\u2019t popped or crashed and burned yet because of her. She has been keeping me up. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I\u2019d have flaked on my first fight in the amateur tournament against Frederick Kennedy\u2014I was about to throw in the towel, but she helped me. She came into my room and touched me. She didn\u2019t have to. I did nothing but treat her like shit prior to that\u2014only seeking to get one thing from her. She let me in...she saw something in me and let me into her life. The other night Jackson asked me why I chose her, but the real question is, why did she choose me? Why did she take a risk with me? She\u2019s not the lucky one here, I am, and I count my blessings every fucking day. Olivia is the string attached to my balloon. I haven\u2019t popped because she hasn\u2019t let me. Olivia is the fuelling jet, following me as I soar through the clouds. She feeds me fuel a little portion at a time, so I don\u2019t get ahead of myself. She keeps me grounded and that\u2019s why I love her.</p><p>Olivia doesn\u2019t know about the tense relationship with my dad\u2014at least not in its entirety, and it isn\u2019t really a big enough issue to share with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that anymore,\u201d I reply, sliding my arms around her waist and inching her closer to me.</p> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cOnly what you think of me matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>I nod, slipping my hand under her shirt and caressing the small of her back. The touch alone is enough to ease the nervous grind in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think of me?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips in thought and as she\u2019s about to speak, Jackson\u2019s light hair and green eyes peer around the door and stick into the car. \u201cYou two coming?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d I demand. \u201cShut the door.\u201d</p><p>With a swift nod, he closes the door.</p><p>\u201cCan we do this later? We\u2019re holding everybody up.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, slightly. \u201cNow is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She drops her gaze and fidgets with my shirt. \u201cI think you are insatiable, intense, aggressive, hard to read, and stubborn.\u201d</p><p>Old news. Even I know that.</p><p>\u201cBut I also think you are confident, determined, hardworking, handsome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood in bed,\u201d I chime in, suddenly feeling playful. \u201cAmazing with my hands, but better with my mouth and I have nice sized c\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEgo,\u201d she cuts in, her cheeks flushing. \u201cYeah, your ego is huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what we\u2019re calling it now? It\u2019s a strange nickname but I think I can make it work.\u201d</p><p>She slaps my chest and I grab her arms, pinning them to her side. She thrashes against me trying to break away. I\u2019m barely using any strength to hold her down and I find it extremely amusing (and a little arousing) that she\u2019s fighting so hard against me.</p><p>\u201cYou love my ego.\u201d I chuckle, yanking her forward so her chest is flush on mine and her lips only inches away. \u201cYou love the way my ego feels.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head forward and she gasps as I suck her bottom lip into my mouth. I let it go. \u201cWhether you like the way it tastes is yet to be seen.\u201d</p><p>I watch her face as her lips straighten into a serious line. \u201cKeep this grip on me and I guarantee your ego won\u2019t see the outside of your pants this entire trip.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow, but her face doesn\u2019t falter and I release her. Not a second later, she crushes her lips to mine. Olivia parts her thighs and slips them over mine as she rakes her fingers through my hair. It takes me by complete surprise. I\u2019m thoroughly dazed, my brain and body out of sync as they desperately scatter to catch up with each other. As her tongue roughly massages mine, my hands come up and grip her ass, pulling her hard against me. With a sharp inhale, she rolls her hips into me and I groan into her mouth. Luckily, the windows are black glass and no one can see in. Only my eyes will see my girl when she\u2019s like this\u2014horny and commanding. I think having her hands on me is exactly what I need to ease the negative thoughts. My head swims with the taste of her and the feel of her against me. Only she has the power to consume me, to eradicate all train of rational thinking. Even an occasional brush of her hand against my skin is enough to send a warm shock through my system.</p><p>Olivia pulls back an inch and our breath collides between us. I look at her face. Her eyes are thinned into lusty slits, her lips swollen from our kiss. The waves of energy between us has my heart pounding and it takes all of my strength not to swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cI promise I will love every second I get to taste you.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward and in one painfully slow movement, she kisses me softly before sliding off me and exiting the car.</p><p>I exhale, pulling her jacket over my lap to conceal the erection that\u2019s trying to force its way through my zipper and I give myself a few long minutes to compose myself before sliding from the car. The hot, sticky air clings to me and I can\u2019t wait to get inside and out of the desert heat.</p><p>The valets take the keys from Darryl while the bell boys retrieve our bags from the back.</p><p>\u201cVegas, baby!\u201d Jackson cheers, slinging an arm over my shoulder.</p><p>I nudge him with my elbow and he recoils. \u201cLet\u2019s not make this a repeat of our first trip to Vegas. Let\u2019s keep it like last time, nice and quiet.\u201d</p><p>He scoffs. \u201cYou had a ball when we came the first time.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s referring to the time he and I came to Vegas for my twenty-first birthday .I roll my eyes at him. \u201cIt\u2019s because of that first time I don\u2019t drink anymore.\u201d</p><p>Jackson is the only one I know who wears a t-shirt with a formal jacket. Sure, it looks good, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less weird.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only person in the world that\u2019d be upset by what you did.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNot me. That was fucking awesome!\u201d</p><p>My gaze nervously flicks to Olivia, who seems to be deep in conversation with Selena as they gush over the giant gold lion at the front. I don\u2019t want her to know what I did years ago in Vegas. It makes me sick to even think about it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring it up anymore,\u201d I order, my voice sounding a lot more aggressive than I intend.</p><p>Jackson flashes me his palms, smiling deviously. \u201cRelax, I won\u2019t tell her. Your secret is safe with me.\u201d</p><p>He winks and it makes me a little nervous. It\u2019s not really a secret. It\u2019s not that I want to hide it, I just don\u2019t like being reminded of it. I was only twenty-one at the time and I was stupid. Jackson and I got a little wild. Vegas is the ultimate party spot and when I drink, I tend to get a little out of control\u2014in every sense of the term. I got into a fight outside a strip joint\u2014broke the guy\u2019s nose in two places and had sex with three girls at the same time. My stomach churns as my brain pulls up on and off broken flashbacks of me fucking all of them. I cringe. I\u2019ve never been more disgusted with myself. I\u2019m not one to regret or care about my decisions because at that point in time, it was exactly what I wanted...but that night left me feeling as stupid and as low and pathetic as my dad always implied. When I drink, I become uncontrollable\u2014angry, horny, and unstoppable. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of, either, and it\u2019s something I tend to avoid. I don\u2019t like that part of me. I don\u2019t like that alcohol brings out a more magnified version of me and my inability to control myself was part the reason I always declined alcohol around Olivia. If she thinks I\u2019m insatiable and aggressive now, she hasn\u2019t seen anything until I\u2019ve had my fair share of booze. The second time I saw Olivia, at Lux\u2019s back in Portland, I went out that night with only the intent to drink and fuck her out of my mind...but then I saw her dancing with Selena and she planted her roots in. I stopped drinking after half a beer on the notion that if I drank anymore, I wouldn\u2019t treat her like the good girl she is. I wouldn\u2019t have stopped until I had Olivia in the bathroom, in the alleyway, or on the fucking dance floor\u2014I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Olivia, however, is the polar opposite. When she drinks, she\u2019s all cute and bubbly, complete with hiccups and all.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go and settle in, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Darryl announces, slipping a pink \u2018Let\u2019s Party\u2019 shirt on over the top of his black tee. \u201cThis is our home for the next three weeks. I am without children and other father-related responsibilities.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cWell, mostly.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Darryl is a known party animal. He loves beer, boobs, and dancing. He\u2019ll undoubtedly want to hit up a strip club or two while we\u2019re here, and he\u2019ll call his wife, Janie, right in the middle of it. That\u2019s the kind of relationship Darryl and Janie share. Janie has no problem with Darryl having fun with the boys. In fact, she\u2019s tagged along once or twice. Olivia\u2019s fingers thread though mine. I hadn\u2019t realized she left Selena and approached me. I squeeze them gently and I feel her fingers flex in return.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d Selena squeals, pointing out toward the road. \u201cThey\u2019ve got you on a TV.\u201d</p><p>I follow the direction her skinny arm is pointing and I see me on an LED television up high by the road. I scan my stern face and oiled skin. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get used to seeing myself so...public. Being \u2018out there\u2019 only makes it more embarrassing if I fail .I look at my opponent, Junior Moset, on the opposite side of the screen, who I\u2019ll fight in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. He\u2019s a little smaller than me...not intimidating at all...so why am I suddenly feeling so much self-doubt? I don\u2019t deserve this and I\u2019m going to fuck it up. I start to over think things\u2014everything feels wrong. Olivia releases my hand and her fingers travel north before wrapping around my elbow and pulling my arm into her chest. Olivia doesn\u2019t touch my face or hold me like she usually does when I\u2019m feeling on edge. Those moments are for us only and I don\u2019t like sharing my problems with everyone else\u2014even Darryl and Jackson. If I really focus, I\u2019m sure I can feel her heart beating against me and the thought alone is enough to ease my tension.</p><p>\u201cWe can all gaze on Seth\u2019s perfection later.\u201d Olivia laughs. \u201cI want to see my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you boys are going to be busy all the time, maybe Olivia and I should share a room?\u201d Selena suggests, flicking her long blonde hair over shoulder.</p><p>Like fucking hell. Jackson and I start our protest at the same time, forcing Selena to take a slight step backwards.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad ide\u2014\u201d Olivia begins and I cut her off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>Vegas is a big city and not the kind of place I want Olivia walking around without me, especially under the influence of Selena who, let\u2019s face it, isn\u2019t exactly the smartest person in the world or the most innocent. When I first met Olivia, she was drinking beer in a steakhouse in the morning, roofied in a club, and groped in a parking lot all because of Selena. I won\u2019t have it. No fucking way.</p><p>Selena\u2019s green eyes narrow in on me. \u201cJesus Christ, it\u2019s only a suggestion. Nobody is taking your precious away from you.\u201d</p><p>Beside me, Olivia giggles and when I look down at her, she shrugs and bites her lip. I\u2019m glad she finds this so amusing, but I don\u2019t. I need our time in Vegas to go off without a hitch. Everything I\u2019ve planned for Vegas all adds up to the one big question I will ask her. All of it. I can\u2019t take any chances.</p><p>Darryl sighs. \u201cKeep fighting and Olivia and Selena are sharing a room with me. Stick to the original plan. Selena and Jackson, Seth and Olivia, and me and myself. Happy?\u201d</p><p>Everyone agrees and turns to enter the hotel. I glance over my shoulder and take one last look at the sign.</p><p>I can do this.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I still can\u2019t get over the sheer extravagance of our room. Even with Jackson, Darryl and Selena here, the Skyline Terrace suite still feels large and empty. The two-story suite is easily seven hundred and eighty square feet and is filled with loads of elegant furniture. Why he paid for such a big suite for just the two of us is beyond me, all five of us can fit in here easily.</p><p>I drop my black stilettos onto the bathroom tiles and adjust my clingy dress. Selena brought it up for me to wear after she refused to let me leave the hotel in the plum colored dress I\u2019d originally chosen. This one is nice, if not a little revealing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I side step in front of the arty floor length mirror just outside of the bathroom and into the master bedroom. I adjust the front of the dress to prevent my nipple from falling out before analyzing the rest of my outfit. The hemline at the base of the dress stops mid-thigh and curves a little higher in the middle, exposing a large portion of my legs. I turn around and my back is completely exposed, the whole dress held together by a few thin straps attached to a metal ring in the middle of my spine. This dress is the epitome of sexy club dresses...and it so isn\u2019t my style.</p><p>The bedroom door whips open and Seth strolls in. I watch him, waiting for him to see me, but apparently he thinks he\u2019s alone up here. I lean against the wall and watch him and his delicious naked torso walk around the room, apparently in search of a shirt. He threw his clothes all over the bed when we arrived and I put them away in the wardrobe. Might as well settle in, this is our home for three weeks.</p><p>He pauses and scratches the back of his head. I smile and bite back a giggle. Watching someone as beautiful as him be so genuinely perplexed is amusing and heart-warming.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re in the wardrobe,\u201d I tell him with a chuckle.</p><p>He snaps around to face me and his expression shifts from surprised to...something else. I know the look. I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of it for months now\u2014desire. Pure desire. The look in his eyes makes my heart rate increase, but I continue to lean coolly against the wall, like he isn\u2019t affecting me. He inhales and his muscles contract, relaxing on exhale.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the other dress? The purple one?\u201d</p><p>I want to tell him the difference between purple and plum, but you know what? He\u2019s a male, he\u2019ll never understand. Lavender, plum, mauve\u2014to them it\u2019s all \u2018purple.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s Selena\u2019s. He already has a few...issues with her decisions. \u201cYou don\u2019t like this one.\u201d</p> <p>He nods slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be an idiot to let you leave this room in it.\u201d</p><p>I step forward, feeling rather daring. I don\u2019t know what it is, but lately I like challenging Seth and it turns out, with enough force, he melts like putty in my hands. It\u2019s a nice change. He\u2019s always the one to order me around and mold me to what he wants, but now it\u2019s me. I wonder if he realizes that he\u2019s bending to my needs. I wonder if he realizes that he\u2019s a hell of a lot more in love with me than he knows. What does Jackson call him? Pussy whipped. That\u2019s it. Seth is pussy whipped, by me.</p><p>I step toward him, smiling. It\u2019s not one of my usual smiles. I can feel it. It\u2019s mischievous\u2014daring. \u201cAre you going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes thin out and the challenge comes through loud and clear. Testing him, I proceed to walk past him and I barely make one step past his body before his hand shoots out, planting itself on my stomach. The heat from his hand causes my stomach muscles to clench. I look at him and his dark eyes are on mine. They lure me in from underneath his brow and I turn my body toward him, completely hypnotized by his intensity.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stop you,\u201d he tells me. \u201cBut I am going to make sure you remember exactly who you\u2019re with and exactly who you\u2019re coming home with.\u201d</p><p>As if I\u2019d forget. He comes at me, gripping my hips and forcing me backwards. The back of my legs hit a table and pushes me against it. I drop my hands to the surface to stabilize myself as Seth smashes his mouth to mine. Tingling warmth and pleasure sweeps through me as one of his hands rest on the table behind me, the other heavy hand pulls my dress up to my hips and slips straight into my underwear without so much as a please. He doesn\u2019t check to see if I\u2019m ready or not because he knows I am\u2014I always am for him and he slips a finger inside me. I sink my teeth into my bottom lip as a shiver tears down my spine. A frisson of hot, sinful pleasure hums my skin and I shift my hips forward, wanting to be closer to him as my patience gets the best of me. I\u2019m so incredibly wet and his finger glides with ease in and out of me.</p> <p>I lift my hands, placing them on his hard biceps and I feel him trembling with lust. He hunches over me with a rough exhale, adding a second finger and forcing me to bend with him, arching my back.</p><p>His fingers slide in and out quickly now, with purpose and intention. He lowers his mouth to my ear and I shudder, rolling my hips on his hand. \u201cAll night you are going to feel my fingers inside you.\u201d</p><p>He curls his fingers, grazing my sweet spot, and I clench his arms, gasping unashamedly into his shoulder. He pumps his fingers harder and faster, pressing into me from the inside. My mind blanks and my body jerks as heat explodes inside me, leaving me breathless and desperately limp.</p><p>Seth pulls his fingers out and brings them to my face before dragging one over my bottom lip. \u201cAll night you are going to remember how hard I made you come and you\u2019re going to be eager to get home so I can do it to you all over again.\u201d The way he draws the last three words moistens me immediately. \u201cWhen we come home, I\u2019m going to pound into you so hard, you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re going to break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to break me?\u201d</p><p>His scorching eyes flare at me. \u201cLike fucking porcelain. I\u2019m going to lie you down on the bed, spread your legs, and fuck you so thoroughly the only word you\u2019ll remember tomorrow is my name.\u201d</p><p>I catch my breath. \u201cThat epic, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p> <p>He kisses my nose and saunters toward the cupboard. I watch, trying to regain my composure as he pulls a shirt from the bedside table. When he\u2019s happy, he turns back around and strolls toward the door. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I slip off the table and trail lazily behind Seth as he pulls a nice light blue tee over his head. That\u2019s all it takes for him to get dressed? I spent forty minutes doing my hair and makeup. He rakes his fingers through his hair, throws a shirt on, and calls himself finished\u2014and somehow, he still looks perfect\u2014as if he\u2019d spent an hour grooming himself. If only I could be that simple with anything I do.</p><p>A loud wolf whistle pierces my ear and I cringe, snapping my gaze to Selena.</p><p>\u201cI knew that dress would look amazing on you.\u201d</p><p>I take in her outfit and suddenly feel a little underdressed. I have never, ever, ever in my life seen Selena dressed and ready for a club in anything more than tissue sized fabric. Yet, here I am, the one in a skimpy dress and her dressed to the classy nines in a pair of tight, black slacks, high black heels and a beautiful, satin pearl shirt with a plunging neckline.</p><p>\u201cSelena...\u201d I ask cautiously, walking down the rest of the stairs and towards the kitchen. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>She arches an eyebrow and eyes me curiously. \u201cLas Vegas.\u201d</p><p>In the background somewhere I hear Darryl chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAnd how many dresses do you own specifically for Las Vegas?\u201d</p><p>Selena flicks her long blonde curls over her shoulder\u2014and she didn\u2019t straighten her hair? What the hell? Has hell actually frozen over? I watch her, still in shock as she steps into the kitchen. On the counter there are three shot glasses already made up, filled with unknown and undoubtedly potent spirits. She grabs one and hands it to me. I look at it for a second before taking it from her.</p><p>\u201cYou need to relax. I have three weeks to wear slutty dresses.\u201d She winks at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll only go out twice maximum, so you can wear the nice dress tonight and the stupid plum one next time.\u201d</p><p>I feel Seth move from behind me. He leans on the counter next to me. \u201cAnd here I was thinking Olivia was an adult capable of making her own decisions.\u201d</p><p>Jesus Christ. I down my shot in one swallow and slap it down on the counter, gritting my teeth against the burning booze.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll wear the dress,\u201d I smile at Selena. \u201cbut only because I know it\u2019ll kill you seeing me in one while you\u2019re stuck in pants.\u201d I poke at the empty shot glass, inching it closer to her. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>She flushes a shade of pink I\u2019ve never seen grace her cheeks before as she fills the glass. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fill for the night,\u201d she informs me, sliding the glass back.</p><p>Seth and I look at each other and he seems just as baffled as I am. Selena doesn\u2019t \u2018have her fill.\u2019 When it comes to alcohol, her stomach is a bottomless pit.</p><p>From behind me, Jackson swoops in and wraps his full lips around the glass, tipping it down his throat. I glance at Seth again and he shrugs with a small smile on his lips.</p><p>I have the feeling Jackson has a lot to do with Selena\u2019s behavior tonight. I\u2019m happy that he\u2019s helping her to quit smoking and drinking, but I hope he isn\u2019t putting too much pressure on her. I\u2019m her best friend and I couldn\u2019t even get her to listen to me about the risks of ingesting too much alcohol. She\u2019s always been assertive and her own person in her own right and no one has been able to tell her differently...until now. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind that Selena isn\u2019t drinking. I just hope it\u2019s her own decision and not Jackson\u2019s.</p><p>Jackson slides the remaining shot glass across the counter to Seth. Without hesitation he pushes it right back. I\u2019ve never really found out why Seth chooses not to drink...my assumptions always begin and end with his mother, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the whole story. I watch the silent exchange of glances between Seth and Jackson. Jackson appears to be having the time of his life as he bites back a smile. Seth, however, tries to keep his calm fa\u00e7ade, but even I can see the warning in his eyes. Whatever is going on, it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.</p><p>My mood suddenly dampens and going out feels like it\u2019ll be more of a chore than an adventure. I fail to see the point in going out of it\u2019s only Jackson and I drinking\u2014and Darryl too, wherever the hell he is. I can\u2019t hide my pout.</p><p>\u201cYou guys have all been to Vegas before. You\u2019ve all done it, but I haven\u2019t. I want crazy, dramatic, and exciting. I want loud music, gambling and strong alcoholic beverages with stupid sexual names...I want the Vegas experience.\u201d</p><p>Which is actually stupid. I hate clubbing, I\u2019ve hated it for as long as I can remember, but I\u2019m in Vegas and you don\u2019t avoid the clubs in Vegas. Am I being selfish? I can\u2019t tell.</p><p>With an exhale, Seth reaches for the shot glass and slams it back with such ease you\u2019d think he\u2019s shooting water.</p><p>\u201cYou want the Vegas experience then I\u2019ll give it to you at your own risk,\u201d he tells me, sliding his glass to the middle of the marble counter.</p><p>Jackson claps his hands before pouring us another round of drinks and Darryl slips into the kitchen from the living room as soon as he hears the lid unscrew and joins us at the island.</p><p>\u201cMy own risk?\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYep. You want crazy, dramatic, and exciting? It\u2019s yours, but I\u2019m only giving you until I finish my next shot to back out. Once I\u2019ve downed the shot, you\u2019re on the Vegas rollercoaster, your safety bar is locked, and there is no getting off...\u201d He smirks and caresses the hem of my dress. \u201cUnless it\u2019s by me, of course.\u201d</p><p>I feel heat flood my cheeks. Seth will say anything in front of anyone and sometimes, I admire his boldness. Other times, I want to jam my hands in his mouth to prevent him from speaking. I drop my sight to his fingers and I watch as they curl around the tiny glass. It seems almost doll-like in his large hand. I follow the cup all the way to his lips. His brown eyes lock with mine and he seems almost excited, like he\u2019s daring me to let him drink it. Seth begins to pour the liquid into his mouth before tipping the whole thing down his throat. He swallows and my pulse begins its rapid ascent, from normal to overdrive. Shit. What have I gotten myself into?</p><p>\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Jackson cheers, pouring a shot and handing it to Selena. \u201cWe are in for a treat tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Seth is here and he\u2019s bringing the action!\u201d</p><p>Seth rolls his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Jackson slides us all a shot each and we take it. Sadly, I\u2019m the only one to recoil from the taste. It\u2019s then I realize I\u2019m barely going to be able to hang with these guys\u2014even Seth, who seems to be more acquainted with the taste of alcohol than me, which really piques my curiosity.</p><p>\u201cLocked and loaded. Let\u2019s blow the roof off this bitch!\u201d Darryl shouts, adjusting his black button up shirt. It seems Darryl has been drinking prematurely and is probably a little too over the limit to chauffer us around.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to drive?\u201d</p><p>Selena laughs over her shoulder at me as I approach the door. \u201cWe\u2019re on Las Vegas Boulevard with Luxor, Bellagio, Mirage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re walking everywhere tonight. You want the Vegas experience and that means you have to drunkenly stumble everywhere you want to go or catch a cab.\u201d</p><p>I look at Seth and he shrugs at me.</p><p>\u201cYou guys walked everywhere when you did Vegas?\u201d</p><p>They all nod\u2014even Darryl.</p><p>\u201cAnd the casinos? Are they what they make them out to be on TV?\u201d I ask as we reach the front door.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re everything you\u2019ve seen and more,\u201d Darryl says, looking over his shoulder at me. \u201cThe lights. The sounds. The pulsating energy\u2014\u201d He smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll love every second of it, that I guarantee.\u201d</p><p>The air is charged like an electrical storm. I can almost taste it\u2014as well as feel it. What shot is this? Eight. Maybe seven. I slam it back and squeeze my eyes shut against the licorice tasting burn at the back of my throat. There\u2019s music blasting in quick, booming beats. I\u2019m way over my limit and my brain is too fuzzy to register the music, but I can feel it vibrate the metal stool I\u2019m sitting on as it hums through my body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t know what casino I\u2019m at. Wherever it is, it\u2019s loud, filled with people and exotic dancers in tiny cages and glass boxes. I love the atmosphere and the way excitement and anticipation hangs heavily in the air.</p><p>\u201cDo you want another?\u201d Seth shouts into my ear and I look at him over my shoulder.</p><p>He\u2019s had as many shots as I have, but he seems hardly affected by the alcohol, unlike me. My eyesight sways and I see two of him before they merge back into one. If only there were two of him...the things I would do...He smiles down at me, amused, and I realize I haven\u2019t responded to his question. I open my mouth, but he cuts me off.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d His warm hand engulfs my elbow. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I hold onto him as he pulls me over to Darryl, who sits on a purple looking couch\u2014or maybe it\u2019s pink. Hell, it could be red for all I know. My eyes aren\u2019t exactly my most reliable source right now and the dark lighting makes it that little bit harder. My head rolls and my heavy eyes threaten to close so I sit down on a small compact arm chair while Seth joins Darryl on the couch.</p><p>Darryl slides a shot glass over to me. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>The thought of having another shot while the last one lingers so freshly at the back of my throat makes me nauseous, but I can\u2019t stop now. Seth sits back on the couch, his arms stretching over the back. He watches me for a few seconds before giving me a nod of the head. Maybe I don\u2019t look as drunk over here as I did at the bar. Without hesitation, I down the shot and surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t burn my throat. I return the glass to the table and let my head roll to the side to rest against the velvet fabric. I\u2019m feeling sleepy, my eyes heavy with the effects of the alcohol. Sleep would be great right now, but as far as everyone else is concerned, the Vegas experience has only just begun. We still have yard glasses to drink from, casinos to throw money at, and cabs to take to nowhere. They feel combining all of their experiences into one huge experience is necessary, but I\u2019m ready to go home\u2014not that I\u2019ll ever admit that. I wanted this. Everyone is drinking because of me\u2014even Seth and Selena. I have to go through with it. I\u2019m a twenty-three year old woman drinking alcohol because she feels bad that her friends are doing it, how pathetic do I sound? I guess the main thing is that I\u2019m feeling a lot better now I\u2019m very well under the influence.</p><p>Out of nowhere Jackson and Selena stroll up to our table with more drinks\u2014all shot glasses\u2014some with wedges of lime and a shaker of salt. Selena sits a shot down on the wooden table in front of me and the thought of drinking it makes me sick. She watches me eagerly, enjoying every second of my drunkenness. Unwilling to fail, I force myself forward and reach out for the little cup of mind-numbing, head-spinning, nausea-inducing poison. Before my finger makes it within an inch of the glass, Seth leans forward, taking the shot for himself and buying me a few more conscious seconds. I offer him a small smile and he returns it.</p> <p>\u201cLast stop on the Vegas experience, The Spearmint Rhino. We\u2019ll spend the rest of the night there and then walk back to MGM.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Spearmint Rhino?\u201d I ask, unsure if my voice is coming out in a slurry fumble or if I\u2019m imagining it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only the greatest strip club in Las Vegas\u2014quite possibly the world!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never felt so out of the loop. I rake my fingers through my hair in an attempt to wake myself up. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly a sexy name for a strip club...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Seth cuts in, leaning back in his seat again. \u201cNo strip clubs.\u201d</p><p>Selena struts toward me and slowly drops herself into my lap. I rest my head against hers and watch while Jackson folds his arms across his chest. \u201cOlivia wants the Vegas experience. What\u2019s Vegas without a trip to the Spearmint Rhino?\u201d</p> <p>I swear if I hear the words \u2018Vegas experience\u2019 one more time I\u2019m going to puke.</p><p>Seth laughs once. \u201cYou\u2019re in no position to tell me what she wants, Jackson.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a small smile on Seth\u2019s lips, but his eyes are dead serious. Both Selena and I groan at the same time, rolling our eyes. Here we go.</p><p>\u201cWe can go,\u201d I cut in, drawing everyone\u2019s shocked eyes\u2014even Seth\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the argument. I said I\u2019d do everything and if going to a strip club is included, then I\u2019ll do it, but I swear to God, if a stripper touches me, I\u2019m out of there.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why strip clubs and strippers freak me out. It\u2019s nothing against them or their profession\u2014I think it\u2019s quite brave to get up and dance for seedy men, although I\u2019d never do it.</p><p>Ever. I don\u2019t like that the last stripper invaded my personal space for money. I was never asked by the stripper in Boston if it was okay for her to touch me or kiss me. She took the money and she did what she was told without approval from me. I\u2019m not a homophobe, either. I don\u2019t flinch away from lesbians in the street or treat them differently because of their preference, but if one were to kiss me, I\u2019d freak out, because that isn\u2019t my thing. I don\u2019t kiss girls to impress boys. I don\u2019t see women (no matter how hot they are) and think \u2018man, I\u2019d kiss her.\u2019 It\u2019s just not me.</p><p>All three of them\u2014Jackson, Selena and Darryl\u2014are excited about my willingness to go to the Mintyfresh Rhino (or whatever the hell he called it). Seth, however, watches me from underneath his brows, his eyes dark and questioning.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll meet you outside!\u201d Selena squeals and they leave\u2014the lot of them\u2014they leave me alone with Seth and his less than happy state.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to be caught alone waiting for him to speak. I know he hates that, so, in one swift and surprisingly sober move, I join him on the couch.</p><p>We watch each other for a few seconds, gauging each other\u2019s state. He moves first, leaning forward to bring his mouth toward my ear. My stare follows his full, parted lips right up to the side of my face. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go. If you want to call it quits, I\u2019ll take you home right now.\u201d His voice close to my ear causes pleasant chills to rush through me.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cBut the others\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget them. They\u2019ll go with or without you. Tell me now if you you\u2019re up for it. If you are, I\u2019ll shut my mouth and continue to make sure you\u2019re having a good time. If you\u2019re not, we\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p><p>I ponder for a little while. He\u2019s giving me a way out of this whole scenario, but I don\u2019t know if I want to take it. \u201cBut if I go home...I\u2019ll have to walk in these heels and my feet are killing me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll carry me? Do you know how far we are from\u2014wait, where are we?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s features straighten and he looks around the club for a sign or something that tells us where the hell we are. I glance down at the table, there are some coasters, but they\u2019re all ripped up or so wet the writing is unreadable. I don\u2019t think he knows where we are, either.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I tell him, rising to my feet.</p><p>I sway unsteadily for a moment and Seth reaches out, wrapping an arm around my waist. He stabilizes me by pulling me down and onto his lap, flush against his chest. Even in the club I can smell his cologne\u2014it\u2019s fucking sexy\u2014whatever the hell it is. I\u2019ve never smelled it before now and it\u2019s intoxicating. It envelops me and I think it makes the hairs on my body stand on their ends. Then again, it could be the alcohol or the air-conditioning blowing straight down the back of my neck. Being the romantic I am, I\u2019m going to narrow it down to his smell.</p><p>\u201cNew cologne?\u201d I wonder aloud.</p><p>He nods and an excited smile pulls at his lips. \u201cI bought it yesterday. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSur\u2014it\u2019s nic\u2014yeah,\u201d I stutter my answer. I exhale and nod my head instead...how charismatic of me. Seth\u2019s eyes flare at my response and I make a mental note to fill the bath with his perfume when we get back and drown in it.</p><p>I clear my throat. \u201cTo the Pepper Albino?\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs loudly, dropping his head to my shoulder and my body shakes as he laughs into me. Did I say something funny? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pepper Albino?\u201d He chuckles, pulling back from me.</p><p>In the dim light, I see the glimmer of happiness in his eyes and I want to know what made him so happy so I can do it again. And again. And again and\u2014well, you get the picture.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, O? Where\u2019d you pull that name from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Spearmint Rhino, is what he said.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him for a little while. The Spearmint Rhino? Is that right? It doesn\u2019t sound right. \u201cOh,\u201d is all I manage to say. Now I feel like an idiot.</p><p>My chest hiccups as I randomly spit out a laugh and I quickly slap my hand up to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI will forever call that place The Pepper Albino.\u201d</p><p>I swat at him, but he pulls back and manages to avoid it. He grabs my hands, pulling me back into him. \u201cand I think I\u2019ll keep you drunk,\u201d he says, kissing my nose.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re funny and you don\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>I arch my eyebrow at him. \u201cWow. Only you can tell someone they\u2019re dumb and make it sound like a compliment.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his brown eyes at me. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. When you\u2019re drunk, there are no cog wheels in your eyes as you try to decipher your next move. You do and say things right from the top of your head and I love that. You should do it more often.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cSee, that\u2019s not going to work. We can\u2019t have two people in this relationship throwing caution to the wind. Someone has to be the responsible one.\u201d</p><p>He bites his bottom lip and then rakes his teeth over it. \u201cThat\u2019s true, but for tonight, let\u2019s both be reckless and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReckless and stupid? I like it. Should we add \u2018crazy\u2019 and \u2018exciting\u2019 to the list while we\u2019re at it?\u201d I suggest, inching my face closer to his and setting my body alight with arousal.</p><p>He nods. \u201cAnd dramatic and passionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, now. Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never broken a promise in my life and I\u2019m not going start tonight.\u201d</p><p>He grabs the shots and hands one to me before he tips his down his throat. Following his lead, I slam mine back and grit my teeth against the taste as I throw my glass onto the couch. Seth grabs me by the face and crushes his mouth to mine. Tequila floods my taste buds and I gasp into his mouth as his tongue forces more of the flavor into my mouth. He produces a lime from nowhere and my heavy stare drops to his mouth as his wet tongue slips out from between his lips. He licks the lime slowly and brings it to my mouth. I watch him, dazed, as he rubs it along my bottom lip. I part my lips and suck it into my mouth, now he\u2019s the one watching me with a heavy, lust-filled stare. I bite down and sour juice floods my mouth, mixing with my saliva.</p><p>I keep watching him as he grabs the salt shaker and opens the lid, dipping his lime moistened finger in. He draws his finger to my mouth, while retrieving the lime with his other hand. He rubs the very tip of his salty finger along my bottom lip and I take his whole finger in my mouth, sucking the salt off. I make sure I swirl my tongue to get every grain. It\u2019s not a coincidence that he\u2019s wants me to suck the salt from his finger. I know he\u2019s fishing to see if I know what I\u2019m doing when it comes to \u2018other\u2019 sexual acts. I haven\u2019t taken Seth in my mouth yet, and I know he\u2019s curious to experience it with me. He probably thinks I\u2019m avoiding it because I haven\u2019t done it before. I\u2019ve done it before and I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty good at it. Every time I\u2019ve done it, I\u2019ve received the appropriate response, but I haven\u2019t done it with Seth because, well, compared to Blade, his penis is a lot bigger. Like, a lot bigger. I\u2019m nervous\u2014or at least I was until I downed a copious amount of shots and he put his finger in my mouth with that sexy look in his eyes. Under the influence, I\u2019m not nervous. I can do it tonight\u2014I will do it tonight.</p><p>Selena\u2019s hand convulses around mine, she can barely contain her excitement as we enter the Spearmint Rhino. She loves clubs, but she loves strip clubs even more. According to her, men leave you alone in strip clubs and focus more on the already provided bare breasts instead of trying to free yours from your dress.</p><p>Inside, the club is decorated with lots of blacks and golds\u2014everything seeming to follow that strict color code. Unlike the Polaris in Boston, the Spearmint Rhino strangely offers a homier vibe\u2014which is probably the weirdest thing I\u2019ve ever thought in my life. In this club, I don\u2019t feel dirty. The red-haired girl doing her thing on the narrow stage isn\u2019t fully naked and that makes me feel better...even if I can still see her hard, fake breasts and dark erect nipples.</p><p>I feel Seth plant his hand low on my back. \u201cOne word and we\u2019ll go, okay?\u201d he tells me, his breath caressing my earlobe. I nod my head. One word and I can go home, that\u2019s all it takes. Relaxing, I inhale deeply, drawing in the scent of whiskey and Coke.</p><p>We follow Jackson over to a little group of black chairs in the far corner of the room.</p><p>\u201cHere we are, nice and secluded for Olivia\u2019s bashful eyes, but not too far away for the rest of us to enjoy the show.\u201d</p><p>I smile, knowing very well that Jackson is taking a shot at me and my timidness about being at a strip club. I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m just glad he was thoughtful enough to not get us seats right underneath the stage. Without sitting down, Darryl leaves and brings us back a round of drinks. I\u2019m already having a hard time keeping my eyes open and preventing sharp lines from blurring into one another. And I\u2019m trying hard to ignore the pressure I feel at the front of my forehead, behind my brow. I bring the wine glass that he sits in front of me to my nose\u2014it\u2019s red wine of some kind. I sip at it and it goes down smoothly, not burning like the shots I\u2019ve been taking all night, and the feeling of having something so fruity and smooth slip down my throat is refreshing. After the drinks are received, we talk about the upcoming fight. Seth doesn\u2019t seem so keen to add to the conversation and I know it\u2019s because he\u2019s nervous. I don\u2019t know what it is with him but he\u2019s usually so confident that it borderlines self-obsessed, but when it comes to fighting he can be so reserved\u2014like he thinks he\u2019s not good enough. I push myself off my chair and straight onto his lap. He hands me his drink and his lips curve into a delightful smile as he wraps his arms around me. \u201cWhat do you know, a beautiful girl is sitting on my lap and I didn\u2019t even have to pay for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I chuckle. \u201cAren\u2019t you lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely lucky.\u201d His fingers dance around my thigh, toying with the edge of my dress.</p><p>I lean in to kiss him, but a guy in a very nice suit with three girls on his arm strolls past us in a haze of giggles and whispers, distracting me.</p> <p>\u201cThat looks familiar.\u201d Jackson snickers, drawing my attention and the glass to his lips.</p><p>Underneath me, I feel Seth\u2019s body tighten and I look down at him. He takes his drink from my hands and takes an uncomfortable sip, his eyes never leaving Jackson.</p><p>\u201cFamiliar?\u201d Selena asks, curiously. \u201cYou\u2019ve had three women? At once?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, I don\u2019t have enough stamina to entertain three women.\u201d His eyes flick to Seth and then his smug smile fades as realization sets in.</p><p>Does he mean Seth? Seth has had three women at once? I glance down at Seth again, whose eyes are no longer on Jackson, but on me. He\u2019s tense, like he\u2019s expecting me to freak out. Faintly, in the background mixed with sensual music and lively chatter, I hear Selena start a new conversation in an attempt to forget the last one. Wait...why is Seth so worried? When did he do three women? The last time he was in Vegas? When he was fighting Don?</p> <p>\u201cThree?\u201d I spit out, feeling my own eyes widening. I glance back at the rest of the group. They\u2019re engaged in a new conversation, ignoring Seth and I. A few seconds pass and the three of them rise from their seats and stroll toward the bar.</p><p>Seth cringes, shaking his head. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice...he shouldn\u2019t have said anyth\u2015\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? The last time you were in Vegas?\u201d</p><p>He frowns, seeming almost agitated. \u201cNo, I was with you the last time I was in Vegas. I did it when I was here on my twenty-first birthday.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s voice lowers a few decibels and I let out a breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding. I don\u2019t know why I was expecting him to tell me he did it when we were together...I\u2019m used to it, I guess. How pathetic does that sound?</p><p>Is he ashamed? No, he can\u2019t be. Seth Marc ashamed of something he\u2019s done? Now I\u2019ve seen everything.</p> <p>\u201cDo you remember them?\u201d I ask, never dropping eye contact.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d</p><p>Trick question. I know he does, but I want to hear him say it. I want him to tell me how beautiful I am compared to them. I want him to tell me that I\u2019m the only one he ever wants to be with. Every girl wants that when they ask these kinds of questions. We fish for compliments and reassurance. No girl will ever admit it, but it\u2019s true. We always want to be told how much better we are than the last girl. Always. Even when we\u2019re compared to our best friends, we want to be put on top. Girls, we can be such vain creatures.</p><p>Seth\u2019s face doesn\u2019t falter at my question, his intense eyes still penetrating me with the same dark gleam. \u201cEvery rise and depression, every scar\u2014every fucking freckle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen...\u201d I say, slowly, \u201cwe have no problem.\u201d</p><p>He watches me closely, trying to decipher if I\u2019m playing with him or not. Who am I to hold what he did before he met me against him? I know I\u2019m guilty of it\u2014especially after my little outburst in California, but since then I\u2019ve realized when you meet someone new, it\u2019s all about starting fresh. You can\u2019t take someone\u2019s past and throw it in their face. It\u2019s called the past for a reason.</p><p>\u201cWhen I drink I get a little out of control. I get mad and horny and I can\u2019t stop...\u201d He confesses with a small cringe on his face.</p> <p>Here I am thinking he\u2019s traumatized by his mother enough not to drink, but it\u2019s because he\u2019s an aggressive-horny drunk and he doesn\u2019t like it. How unexpected...</p><p>\u201cAnd you did all three of them?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cAll three.\u201d</p><p>I feel my pussy pulsate at the thought. Sure, I\u2019m jealous, and yes, there\u2019s a swirling mass of nauseating butterflies in my stomach at the thought of him touching them like he touches me, but underneath all of that, there\u2019s desire...desire to see this other side of him\u2014to experience this other side of him. I bring the drink closer to him, holding it up to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou still want me to drink?\u201d Seth asks, curiously. \u201cAnymore and I think I\u2019m going to be way over my safety limit.\u201d</p><p>I pull the glass back a little. \u201cOnly if you promise to take all of your anger and passion out on me and not three strange women.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows arch in disbelief before pulling into a determined frown. He snatches the drink from my hand and slams it back in a few quick seconds. He leans over me, his body almost crushing me as he sets his glass down on the table. When he pulls back, I fling my arms around his neck and force my lips against his. I\u2019m not usually one for public displays of affection, but there are enough bare tits in this room to take the attention off a couple making out in the back corner of the room.</p><p>Seth pulls away as the speakers announce a new dancer and his eyes flick to the stage. After a few seconds, I feel his entire body go rigid and I drag my gaze from his lips to his eyes. The colorful spark of lust, gone; replaced with dark anger. In one rapid movement, he shifts out from underneath me, swiftly laying me flat on my back on the couch. What the hell?</p><p>In the distance, I hear the sound of a metal stool colliding with the side of the bar and it forces me out of my confused stupor as Darryl runs right by my couch and after Seth\u2014Jackson in tow.</p><p>I push myself up onto my elbows before sitting up and swinging my legs off the edge of the couch. I watch Seth stalk his way past chairs, infatuated business men, and rowdy bachelors to get to the stage. The lone girl on stage\u2014the one he appears to be going for\u2014is oblivious to his approach and Jackson and Darryl are unable to reach him before he jumps onto the stage in a single bound.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Selena demands as she drops into the seat next to me.</p><p>We both watch Seth grab the girl on stage. She looks genuinely terrified to see him and desperately tries to cover her breasts and tiny light blue G-string.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck, O?\u201d Selena breathes, grabbing my wrist.</p><p>I don\u2019t speak as I watch Seth and the girl silently yell at each other. By the time Jackson and Darryl make it to the stage, the bouncers are already there, trying to contain Seth, but he\u2019s too powerful for them. When he shrugs them off, they stumble back several feet before they find their footing again. The girl tries to run back through the doors she came from, but he grabs her wrist, forcing her to stay with him. Her long black hair whips around and her face is flushed with both embarrassment and anger. I can\u2019t see all of the fine details from here, but I hate that she\u2019s so pretty.</p><p>\u201cWho is that? Do you know who that is?\u201d</p><p>Again I ignore Selena, heartbrokenly immersed in the scene before me. Surely I\u2019m imagining this. Whoever this girl is, Seth doesn\u2019t like her stripping in front of all these people, and the way he handles her with such aggression and possession sends my stomach in knots. From the dark corners of the club, six security guards march onto the stage and restrain Seth. They pull back on their heel, dragging a pissed off Seth from the stage as the girl disappears behind the staff doors. I leap off the couch and make it to the doors as Seth is forced from the club.</p><p>Outside, Darryl has Seth against the wall, trying to calm him, and Jackson is by the road, hailing a cab. Everything is happening so fast and my dizzy brain can\u2019t take it all in. My head spins as a result of all of the alcohol and the scene that just played out before me. It can\u2019t be what I think it is...We haven\u2019t been in Vegas long enough for him to find someone else...right?</p><p>A cab pulls up almost immediately and it\u2019s white\u2014completely different to the yellow ones we have in Portland\u2014not that that\u2019s an important piece of information right now. Seth pushes past Darryl and I watch as he storms toward the cab. He pulls open the door and turns to me. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>I step forward and then pause. \u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus-fucking-Christ,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI said get in!\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Selena and she folds her arms tightly over her chest.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, you don\u2019t have to go with him,\u201d she tells me, spitting the word \u2018him\u2019 like it fills her mouth with a bad taste.</p><p>\u201cStay out of it, Selena,\u201d Jackson demands and Selena opens her mouth, about to protest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell her, proud of how steady my voice comes out. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>I look back at Seth and receive no hint of warmth or sympathy for what I just witnessed\u2014whatever the hell that was. Trusting Seth, I approach him, hoping he\u2019ll give me some kind of sane explanation inside the cab. I hunch and climb into the taxi and he follows me, slamming the door behind him. After he grumbles out the hotel to the taxi driver, he doesn\u2019t move or even try to explain what just happened and I don\u2019t know if I should be the one who starts the conversation.</p><p>The Persian taxi driver smiles at me through the rear-view mirror and I decide dragging him into this isn\u2019t a good idea. I can hear Seth\u2019s loud, fast breathing, but I don\u2019t do anything to comfort him. I sit with my straight posture and watch the lights whip past. I keep my hands in my lap, entwined in each other to fight the urge to touch him.</p><p>Seth winds down the window, letting in more fresh air and I can hear his fingers playing in an uneven beat against his denim jeans as he becomes more and more anxious.</p><p>I flinch when he finally speaks. \u201cI know how fucked up that probably looked to you, but I\u2019ll explain it all...once I come to terms with it myself.\u201d</p><p>I nod without looking at him. I hope he explains it to me soon because I fear I\u2019m about to burst into tears at any second. As the bright lights of the Las Vegas Boulevard begin to whip past, I bite my lower lip and ask myself the same question Selena was asking me earlier. Who the fuck was that and what the fuck just happened?</p><p>I lean against the wall at the base of the stairs to our bedroom, my body tight and on high alert as Seth loses the plot. He grabs a small orb candle holder and tosses it hard against the wall. The pretty red and silver glass shatters into tiny pieces on the ground and I avert my gaze as he snatches up a bar stool and puts it through the beautiful glass coffee table. Fear catapults through my body and grips my stomach as I flinch away from the loudness. Note to self: If we ever live together, avoid purchasing anything ceramic, glass or anything else he can destroy. Sadly, I\u2019m having a serious case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from Boston. Only now it\u2019s over some random girl in a strip club instead of Don.</p><p>He snaps around on his heel, his dark eyes zeroing in on me. \u201cGo to bed,\u201d he growls and I almost flinch. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply, pressing myself harder against the wall for support and to prevent myself from cowering away from his dark, aggressive stare. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I want to hate him right now. I want to slap him and call him names and leave...but he told me he loved me. He has told me over and over that he\u2019d never hurt me like that and although tonight leaves me feeling highly betrayed, I know there\u2019s more to it. Miscommunication is a killer and I won\u2019t let this relationship fall victim to it.</p><p>His chest rises and falls in quick pants and his lips are parted as his breath is quickly expelled from his lungs before he draws it back in again. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to watch me flip out and give yourself another reason to love me less?\u201d</p><p>I feel my features pinch together. \u201cLove you less? How can I love you less?\u201d I step forward. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way. I love you to my fullest capabilities or I don\u2019t love you at all. There is no in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you love me now?\u201d</p><p>I purse my lips. Yes. Yes, I love him now. Yes, I love him after the scene I witnessed at the strip club, but he\u2019s in no position to ask me questions\u2014not while I\u2019ve yet to receive an explanation from him.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to give me an explanation, I\u2019ll be ready to give you the answer.\u201d</p><p>I know I should be fuming. I know I should be the one throwing things and demanding answers, but sometimes a girl just needs to take a step back and be told what to do. A girl should have strong moments, where she\u2019s fierce and in control and sometimes, a girl should have weak moments, where she\u2019s vulnerable and wants to cry just to be told everything is going to be okay. This is a weak moment for me. Maybe I don\u2019t want an explanation...maybe I\u2019m scared of what he\u2019s going to say. As quickly as he builds me up with his sweet lips, I know he can send me crashing at any second.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t like my response. I can see panic settle in his eyes and as I\u2019m about to crack\u2014to tell him how much I love him\u2014he storms from the room, slamming the door with a loud hit behind him. I sag against the wall and close my eyes. How the hell am I going to deal with this? I don\u2019t even want to deal with this right now. I\u2019m drunk\u2014a weird on and off sober kind of drunk\u2014but still, my brain is fuzzy. All I want is sleep and some cold fresh water...but first, I have to find my angry fighter.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how long I walk around the hotel before I locate Seth in the gym. I\u2019m so stupid. The gym should\u2019ve been the first place I checked. I hear Seth\u2019s fists before I see him. My heart beats harder every time his fists slam into the bag, pumping hot, nervous blood through my veins in record time.</p><p>I stroll past a long line of treadmills and over to the bags in the far corner by the weights station. Sure enough, there he is. He has his naked back to me and he doesn\u2019t hear my approach, which is fine by me. I slip onto a nearby bench and watch his shapely back as the muscles tighten and flex while he works his knuckles into the bag. I see his body ripple every time he makes contact and the sound of him expelling air soothes me. He relaxes with every hit, his body becoming increasingly tired. Every now and then, he\u2019ll realize he\u2019s slowing down and then he\u2019ll pick up again, sometimes increasing his power and speed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After one whole hour of watching him, I lie down on the bench. My spine aches from hunching and my eyes grow heavier with every passing second. My eyes teeter between alert and sleepy, occasionally falling over the edge and allowing me to take a micro-nap. I wake myself up because I don\u2019t want to fall asleep. I don\u2019t want to deal with this tomorrow. I want it to be over now. I\u2019ll sit up, so I don\u2019t fall asleep. My toes twitch at the thought, but my body refuses to comply. I give myself a few minutes to gather energy, but after the sixth attempt of fighting sleep, I succumb to it, leaving this situation to linger until tomorrow.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Seth</p> <p>My knuckles throb and the skin threatens to split as I thrust my bare hand into the bag one last time. How could I have been so fucking stupid? I\u2019m supposed to protect her\u2014to look after her\u2014and yet I\u2019ve ignored her calls for the last ten months and neglected to respond to any of her voicemails. Sweat coats my body and I bend down to retrieve my shirt from the floor. I run it over my face and the back of my neck. Where the fuck is Kye? And why is he letting my little sister grind naked on poles? The image of her naked body bombards my mind and I recoil from it. How could I have let this happen? My baby sister...dancing naked for money. I grit my teeth and draw myself to full height. She\u2019s not stepping another goddamn toe in a strip club, not if I have anything to do with it.</p><p>I turn around, ready to make my way back to the room, but I\u2019m stopped dead in my tracks by a passed out Olivia. The sight of her tired body almost brings me to my knees. She followed me down here? How long has she been lying on that hard bench?</p><p>I remember smashing all of the breakable things upstairs and I remember her leaning against the wall. She\u2019d never admit it, but I could see the absolute fear in her eyes, like she was scared I was going to turn on her like a wild dog. Sometimes I overreact and smash things...and the thought of her seeing me so mad kills me. I don\u2019t want her to fear me, or to fear pissing me off. She should feel safe, always, and I\u2019d never hurt her physically. She\u2019s so small compared to me...it\u2019s funny how someone so small can completely incapacitate me.</p><p>I approach Olivia\u2019s sleeping form and the urge to wake her up and tell her how sorry I am eats at me. I wanted to clear this up before she fell asleep. All I needed was a little more time. When I get like this...all anxious and crazy, I can\u2019t talk. The mere thought of trying to explain or even listen to people try and explain things to me while I\u2019m so wound up is infuriating. I need to be left with my thoughts and space to work through it alone. If I don\u2019t, I end up saying and doing stupid shit I\u2019ll regret when I\u2019m calm. Seeing her all exhausted and alone makes me anxious and I contemplate waking her just so she can look at me with her green eyes\u2014then I know the pressure in my chest will dissipate.</p><p>In the morning, I\u2019ll tell her everything. As much as it kills me to even think about, I\u2019ll tell Olivia that my sister is apparently a stripper at The Spearmint Rhino. She\u2019ll understand.</p> <p>I throw my t-shirt over my shoulder and bend down, scooping Olivia up into my arms. She barely bats an eyelid. There\u2019s no way she\u2019s waking up, she drank way too hard tonight\u2014and how\u2019s Jackson\u2019s fucking form? He has never, ever, let anything slip about me before\u2014ever. He\u2019s used to people pressuring him for info on my personal life and he has never slipped up, not once, but the one time I needed him to keep his mouth shut, he speaks. What if he ruined everything for me and O? Olivia isn\u2019t your usual girl. She\u2019s confusing. She\u2019s one big bag of emotions and tricks. Anything you say or do can provoke a different reaction every time. This time, she was cool with it\u2014which was one hundred percent unexpected considering her reaction to the girl at the restaurant. If she decided to flip and leave, I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done. But she shrugged it off like it was no big deal and I don\u2019t know whether I should feel bad or relieved. I know Selena sees Olivia as weak because she bends to my every command, but that\u2019s not weakness. Olivia is anything but weak. Sure, she stayed with her douche ex for a ridiculous amount of time after he cheated on her repeatedly, but that isn\u2019t weakness, either. That is fucking strength. I couldn\u2019t handle constantly looking at the face of someone who betrayed me. It\u2019s not her fault. Olivia is a romantic. She sees love in everyone and ignites it in those who care to know her. She believes people can change even if they prove to her a million times that they won\u2019t. I think that\u2019s why she can be so flighty at times. She doesn\u2019t know what to be mad at and what to let go. Blade has done a very good job at training her to deflect her emotions onto random things. Things that should upset her don\u2019t and things that don\u2019t really matter, she freaks out over. It\u2019s like her emotions go into hyper drive and she doesn\u2019t know how to express them. She so desperately tries to give everyone everything they need that she doesn\u2019t realize when people are helping her and when people are attacking her.</p><p>I sigh and dip my lips toward Olivia\u2019s damp head and I kiss it. Hopefully, I\u2019ll always be around to help. So much for a perfect time in Vegas to erase all of her doubts of marrying me. It\u2019s barely day one and I\u2019ve already made a huge mess of it. I pull her tighter into my chest and glance down at her face. I don\u2019t want morning to come because I\u2019m afraid to look her in the face when she wakes up. What if I\u2019ve left it too long and the damage is already done?</p><p>My arms ache by the time I get Olivia back to the bedroom. The blue glowing numbers on the bedside table signifies it\u2019s two a.m. but I can\u2019t sleep. I can\u2019t sleep knowing my little sister is still out and about in this fucked up city. I don\u2019t know where Kye is, but when I see him, he\u2019s a fucking dead man.</p><p>I lie her down on the right side of the bed. Normally, that\u2019s my side of the bed, but since I\u2019ve started sleeping with Olivia, I\u2019ve opted for the left because she also likes the right side. I pull a light sheet over her and she shifts onto her side. If I ignore the slight furrow between her brows, she looks peaceful.</p><p>I turn from the bed and leave the room. I drop my t-shirt on the stairs and sit down with a loud exhale. I know I should be trying to get some sleep now, considering I have a formal dinner tonight (technically) but I can\u2019t sleep, not after tonight, and definitely not after seeing my sister naked, dancing on a pole. I have to go back and get her. No sister of mine will dance for money\u2014and what pisses me off the most is that it\u2019s all my fault. I ignored her calls and I refused to get back to her because I\u2019m too damn stubborn for my own good. I\u2019ve been so caught up in how my life was going that I didn\u2019t care to know how Maddi\u2019s was panning out.</p><p>I reach for my shirt and pull it over my head. It\u2019s a little wrinkled and damp, but it\u2019s going to have to do. I use the rail to pull myself to my feet and I stomp down the rest of the stairs. When I get to the door, I pull it open and instantly my stomach sinks into itself in both anger and relief. She\u2019s clothed, at least, in a loose t-shirt and a pair of tight, black skinny jeans. My eyes zero in on a small trail of inked lady birds that appear to be strolling along her collar bone.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at them like that,\u201d Maddi scoffs, pushing past me and into the room. \u201cThey\u2019re cute.\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to mock her as I shut the door and turn around, leaning my back against it. I watch her as she stuffs her hands into the back pocket of her jeans and strolls around the main room, assessing all of the damage with an amused smirk on her lips.</p><p>\u201cStill smashing things when you\u2019re upset, I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkip the bullshit, Maddi,\u201d I snap. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>She tucks one side of her long black hair behind her ear, all while her brown eyes glare at me. \u201cNow you want to talk? Do I have to show up unannounced just so you\u2019ll talk to me?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cTen months. For ten months I\u2019ve been calling you for help, but you ignored me.\u201d</p><p>I push off of the door. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy\u2014look where you\u2019re standing. It took me a lot of time, money, and effort to get here.\u201d</p> <p>Maddi flinches, her eyes narrow into accusing slits. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give two shits if I\u2019m standing in the Queen\u2019s palace right now. The material items you have mean nothing to me.\u201d She strolls toward the kitchen. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even spare one second for your sister? Family...have you ever heard of the fucking word?\u201d</p><p>She leans against the white, square kitchen island and plucks a grape off its bunch before popping it into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI know that word better than you. You left me to deal with Mom when you knew she and I have a difficult relationship.\u201d</p><p>Maddi smiles. She fucking smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that going for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going? She\u2019s in a rehab facility in California. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>Her posture stiffens. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t think to call and tell me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted nothing to do with her after she hit you. Why would I call you? So you can tell me you don\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I fucking care! She\u2019s still my mother.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders and she rolls her eyes at my attitude. Why does she always make me feel like a child? God knows we argue like children. Anyway, going over this is pointless\u2014it won\u2019t change anything. It won\u2019t get Mom out of rehab or magically fix Maddi\u2019s stripping problem.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell is Kye?\u201d I ask her. \u201cI want to see him.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, I see the color drain from her face. Even her bright red lipstick lessens in its hue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he is.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s lying. I can tell by the way she averts her gaze and her eyelids flutter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play with me, Maddison. I\u2019ll go out and search every shitty bar in this city until I find him.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t move and I let a few seconds pass. When I know she isn\u2019t going to tell me, I move for the door. I\u2019m not fucking around. When I say I\u2019m going to do something, I do it. Period. As my fingers curl around the cool metal of the door handle, she breaks.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>Slowly\u2014almost triumphantly\u2014I turn around. She starts to pick nervously at her red nail polish. \u201cKye doesn\u2019t know that I strip for cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My voice comes out in a loud boom, making Maddi jump and undoubtedly waking Olivia. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know? Who takes you to and from work? Who protects you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do it all myself, I\u2019m not a child anymore. I\u2019m twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her say it the way she does sounds anything but grown up. I don\u2019t see her as twenty-one. I see her as the little girl I grew up with. In my mind, she doesn\u2019t drink or have sex\u2014or get tattoos. She\u2019s supposed to be the good child...</p><p>Holy.</p><p>Fucking.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Have I become the good child?</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I breathe, running my hands over my face. \u201cOut of everything you could do, why stripping?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive in Vegas. The touristy prices are ridiculous and well, I\u2019ve got the body for it.\u201d</p><p>I scowl at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only temporary,\u201d she adds. \u201cuntil Kye and his band gets picked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...there\u2019s no way I\u2019m relying on that talentless asshole to help you out of this situation.\u201d I spin on the heel of my foot and march up the stairs, ignoring my sister calling after me. I can fix this...all I have to do is find my goddamn checkbook.</p><p>I dig around in my suitcase, locating it underneath a few pairs of socks. When I turn around, my gaze skims over the bed and I see Olivia\u2019s tired face blinking at me. I can\u2019t help but smile. I like seeing her dazed, it\u2019s cute. She opens her mouth to say something, but I cut her off.</p><p>\u201cIf you give me ten minutes, I\u2019ll be right back with the answer to any question you want to ask me.\u201d</p><p>I tear from the room before she responds. I want to come through on my promise of ten minutes. Olivia has waited enough on my account tonight and she still has no idea who Maddi is to me. The last she saw, I was on the stage at the Spearmint Rhino trying to pull a girl off of it and then I refused to talk to her...man, am I shaping up to be dickbag of the year or what?</p><p>Downstairs, Maddi is still pigging out on grapes and I ignore the way she peels them from their skin. Old habits never die. I detach the pen from my checkbook and lay the book flat against the table top. I\u2019ll give her thirty thousand dollars. That should keep her out of the clubs for a few weeks and when she runs out, I\u2019ll give her more and more and more until she realizes Kye and his lame dream isn\u2019t going anywhere and drops his loser ass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Maddi asks me curiously as I sign away tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like? I\u2019m giving you money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I came here.\u201d</p><p>I ignore the offended tone in her voice. \u201cMaybe not, but since you did, you\u2019re not leaving here until you take the money and promise me you\u2019ll stop stripping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t take your money?\u201d</p><p>Maddi. I shake my head, she\u2019s always misunderstanding my demands for questions\u2014like Olivia.</p><p>\u201cTake the money, stop stripping, and I won\u2019t tell Kye about your temporary lapse in judgment.\u201d</p><p>I rip the paper from the book and fold it once, then twice, before I extend it to her. She doesn\u2019t take it from my hand, only glances at it.</p><p>\u201cAre you seriously blackmailing me into taking your money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you take it, I won\u2019t have to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brown eyes stay locked on mine for a few long seconds before she expels an exhale and takes the money from me. As soon as the money leaves my fingertips, weight is lifted from my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d come through for me...eventually. You always do.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cNo more silence between us. I want you to know that you can contact me whenever you want and not get pushed to the side.\u201d</p> <p>I feel her head nod against me as she pats my back. I notice her brown eyes are swimming with tears when she pulls back and she stubbornly wipes them away. It\u2019s nice. I like helping my little sister\u2014when I\u2019m not being a total dick and ignoring her, that is.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go get something to eat? There\u2019s a good pizza place a few corners away from here.\u201d</p><p>I rake my fingers through my hair and glance at the clock. Three minutes is all I have until I return to Olivia and I need to explain everything to her. I don\u2019t want her waiting a second longer than she has to.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back upstairs...\u201d</p><p>Maddi\u2019s pretty face contorts into a cringe, like I\u2019ve given her too much information. \u201cSorry, I should\u2019ve known you\u2019d have company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of company.\u201d</p><p>She smirks, pulling a final grape from the bunch and peeling it between her long nails. \u201cIt\u2019s always that kind of company when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d I reply and I even smile a little. \u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>She cocks her head to the side, like an adorable puppy. \u201cIs my big bro finally settling down? I want to meet her!\u201d She drops the remnants of her grape, bounces past me and toward the stairs, but I snag her tiny arm and pull her back before she makes any real progress. Olivia is unaware of Maddi. She knows her as the stripper I flipped out over and having that same girl sprinting up the stairs to say \u2018hi\u2019 isn\u2019t going to help anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou can meet her when I\u2019m not in the doghouse for trying to pull a stripper off a stage.\u201d</p><p>Maddi frowns. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m your sister?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m going to tell her in\u2014\u201d I glance at the clock. \u201cForty seconds.\u201d</p><p>She flashes her palms at me, stepping backwards. \u201cThen don\u2019t let me hold you back.\u201d Her lips curl into an adoring smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you ran into me tonight. It\u2019s nice to clear the air.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her and she steps past me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt\u2019s late, crash on the couch for the night.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, not slowing her pace to the door.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Maddi calls over her shoulder as she opens the door. \u201cI have to meet Kye at three a.m. Love you, bro.\u201d</p><p>She steps out and closes it behind her, leaving me with seven seconds to spare. Without a second thought, I rip my shirt over my head and bolt for the stairs. I clear them one, two\u2014no\u2014three steps at a time and slam to a halt before I reach the door. I take a second for myself, swallowing hard and dropping my shirt to the floor. In my back pocket, I feel my phone vibrate. It\u2019s been vibrating all night. Darryl knows better than to show up here tonight. He knows Olivia is the only person I want to be around right now and when I sleep, my phone going unanswered, he\u2019ll know that I\u2019m okay because I\u2019m with her.</p><p>The door creaks a little as I open it and slip through, locking us in a pitch black room.</p> <p>\u201cO?\u201d I whisper, almost tripping over a bunch of random clothes as I make my way over to the bed. \u201cYou awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I think so.\u201d She yawns and I hear the bed sheets ruffle before a choked yelp and finally a relieved exhale. \u201cShit.\u201d She breathes. \u201cI almost fell off the bed.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle under my breath. \u201cHold on, I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward, my arms extended, searching for the gigantic bed. My fingertips brush against the mattress and I push forward until the palms of my hands are planted firmly. I straighten my posture and fidget with my buttons, unable to get my jeans off quick enough. When they pool at my feet, I kick them\u2014somewhere\u2014and slide onto the bed. On my side, the fabric remains cool and untouched, but when I slip under the blankets and shuffle toward Olivia, it\u2019s warm and inviting. I reach out and touch the bare skin of her stomach. She\u2019s taken her dress off and the thought of her lying next to me in her underwear has me hard and ready. My blood pools in the only place it knows how when she\u2019s around and the pressure hurts. I pull her against me, hooking a leg over the blanket and hiding my hard cock from her. She squirms forward, pushing her head right into the gap between my neck and shoulder, oblivious to how hard I\u2019m trying to keep a rather eager part of my anatomy away from her.</p><p>\u201cYou said you were going to tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>I nod, kissing her ear. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen please start...you\u2019re the only one who can take away the sick feeling in my stomach...or make it worse.\u201d</p><p>My poor girl. She\u2019s been so worried this whole time. I need to make her feel better. She needs to know she\u2019s the only girl I love, the only girl I\u2019ve ever loved and the only girl I\u2019ll ever love.</p><p>\u201cI really wish tonight didn\u2019t happen...I wanted you to have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did have fun,\u201d she counters. \u201cUntil we got to the strip club\u2014I think I\u2019m going to stay away from them from now on. They only seem to ruin my night, not enhance it.\u201d</p><p>I see there\u2019s no point in warming up, straight to it then. \u201cThe girl was my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the strip club?\u201d The disbelief is clear in her voice. \u201cYour sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maddi...it turns out she\u2019s a stripper at The Spearmint Rhino.\u201d I exhale. \u201cShe just left here...I gave her money, so here\u2019s hoping she never takes her clothes off for cash ever again.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulls back from me and I can feel her trying to decipher my expression in the dark. When she realizes it\u2019s too dark to see anything, her hands fly to my waist and she presses herself into me. \u201cI thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you thought,\u201d I tell her. I don\u2019t want to hear how little she thinks of my loyalty to her and I don\u2019t think I can handle hearing such doubtful words from her\u2014at any stage in our relationship. Olivia\u2019s trust levels are naturally low and I guess I don\u2019t blame her. We all know Blade was a douchebag, with a douchebag name to boot, and if I have to spend the rest of my life gaining her trust because of him, then bring it on. I like a challenge and I\u2019ll love the look on her face when I\u2019m on my deathbed and she sees that I\u2019ve been faithful to her every single second of our relationship. \u201cWhat matters is that it\u2019s sorted out now and I\u2019m here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I meet her?\u201d O asks, her voice slightly hesitant. I want to tell her how close she came to meeting her, but decide against it.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she anything like you?\u201d</p><p>Is Maddi anything like me? She\u2019s tough with too much attitude for her own good. She\u2019s over-confident to the point of being crazily egotistical and she\u2014 \u201cShe\u2019s a hell of a lot like me.\u201d I laugh, realizing how similar we are.</p><p>\u201cThen I think we\u2019ll get on just fine.\u201d</p><p>I smile at the thought of Maddi and Olivia having \u2018girl time,\u2019 doing girly things like shopping and whatever else it is that women do when they hang out together. Knowing Maddi, it\u2019ll be mimosas and a baseball game\u2014or whatever hippie music festival is on. Olivia will have her work cut out for her when she\u2019s tries to keep up with my sister. She\u2019s full of life, never turning down an opportunity and never taking a breather. I think Olivia will appreciate my lifestyle a lot more after experiencing Maddi\u2019s.</p><p>I shift my body weight forward, resting against Olivia. \u201cSorry for scaring you...and for not talking to you.\u201d I twist the tip of my index finger in her hair, causing the ends to wrap around me. \u201cI\u2019m not used to expressing myself...you make it easier for me, but sometimes I can\u2019t.\u201d I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t have a reason for being the way I am...not everyone has a horrible back story. Do I need one? Do I need to have a dark, horrifying past to be the way I am? Why am I this way if I grew up okay? I don\u2019t fucking know, but what I do know is, breaking things, swearing, fucking, punching\u2014all of it\u2014it helps me. It helps me when I\u2019m mad, sad, anxious, and depressed. Does that make me psycho because I\u2019m not reliving some twisted past? Shit. I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cIt\u2019s unhealthy and it leaves too much room for miscommunication. If I\u2019d have left tonight\u2014\u201d</p><p>I flinch inwardly at the thought.</p><p>\u201c\u2014because you weren\u2019t talking to me...what would\u2019ve happened between us? Don\u2019t you think a situation like that would inflict too much damage on our relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t leave,\u201d I tell her, my voice takes a cold, dark edge, on purpose, to make a point. She can\u2019t leave me, I won\u2019t let her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple, I love you, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m invincible to the hurtful things you do. And it\u2019s because I love you these things hurt me more than they should.\u201d</p><p>I untangle my finger from her hair and drag it down her spine to the small of her warm back.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I ever want to do is hurt you, but there are certain ways I handle things,\u201d I confess. \u201cWhen I\u2019m mad, I need time and space. I need to work it out of my system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo work it out another way\u2014by, I don\u2019t know, kissing me or something\u2014anything other than what you\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing you isn\u2019t going to work,\u201d I say. \u201cI need something fast, to work the anxiety and anger out of my system.\u201d</p><p>Olivia pulls back from me. \u201cKissing me won\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And I truly don\u2019t think it will. I\u2019m so used to doing it my way, it\u2019s too late to try anything new.</p><p>Her warm, feminine hands slide up my bare stomach and my muscles clench as her delicate fingers rest on my chest. \u201cBut when I touch you, you feel better?\u201d</p><p>A cool, calming buzz melts through my hot veins under her touch. \u201cYeah, but that\u2019s when I\u2019m feeling anxious, not exceptionally pissed off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, it\u2019s not going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she replies, mimicking my tone. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not going to wo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s pricking at my frustration levels and I know she\u2019s doing it on purpose. It\u2019s awfully cocky of her to think her lips are the answer to everything, but if she wants me to kiss her, then fine, I\u2019ll kiss her with everything I have. My fingers fall from her back before they bury themselves in her hair. I tighten my grip and she gasps against the pain as I tug her head backwards and roll my body on top of her, making sure she feels me everywhere. I press her hard into the mattress, one of my thighs resting firmly between her legs and against her sweet, warm spot. My mouth lingers less than an inch from hers and her breath hits my face in a quick, anxious pant. \u201cYou think your lips can help me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Her pouty, marshmallow-like lips curl. \u201cI know they can.\u201d</p><p>I crush my lips to hers and her mouth opens willingly underneath mine. As soon as her tongue glides against mine and she wraps her hands around my neck, I\u2019m lost. Adrift from my original intent...which I\u2019m sure was to prove her wrong, yet here I am, completely captivated by the taste and feel of her. Maybe she\u2019s right. I shouldn\u2019t push her away when I\u2019m mad. I should pull her closer and let her calm me. I trace the curve of her soft little body with my hand before gripping her thigh and hooking it over my hip. Forgetting the fact I was previously hiding my erection from her, I shamelessly press it into her, letting her know exactly how bad I want it.</p><p>\u201cEasy...\u201d Olivia giggles against my mouth, pressing her hands firmly against my chest. I rake my teeth over her bottom lip and release it. \u201cWe have a dinner to go to tonight and sleep is a more viable option than sex.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. It\u2019s the morning and I\u2019m beyond tired...I want to sleep, but I want her more. \u201cI can assure you we\u2019ll be finished by tomorrow night.\u201d I drop my mouth to her neck, licking her flesh and eliciting a half moan-half giggle from her.</p><p>She pushes against me, forcing me away from her body. Olivia laughs once under her breath. \u201cI\u2019m telling you to get off me and go to sleep, not asking.\u201d</p><p>I pull back. I\u2019m unable to see her face in the dark, but I\u2019m certain I hear her smile. Cheeky little minx. I roll off her and onto my back. Instantly, she melts into my side, wrapping an arm over my waist. I pull her closer, but it still feels like she\u2019s too far away.</p><p>\u201cHow does your own medicine taste?\u201d she chuckles, ending it with a quick, sleepy yawn.</p><p>\u201cBitter, like that gross cherry shit you\u2019re force fed as a kid.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and it vibrates my ribcage\u2014it also makes me smile. Olivia has the funniest, cutest, strangest laugh I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s halfway between a giggle and an actual laugh\u2014and most times, it sounds kind of nervous. I love it; the sound of it is addicting.</p><p>Soon, the room falls silent and I feel her arm become heavier as she falls deep into sleep. My eyes grow heavier as I follow quickly behind her. Tonight, we\u2019ll attend a formal dinner downstairs in the function room. There\u2019s no purpose to it other than to shake hands and meet other fighters, but I\u2019m excited (and a little nervous) to officially be welcomed into the professional community. Tonight\u2019s dinner isn\u2019t just about me, either. It\u2019s about Darryl and Jackson. After tonight they\u2019ll formally be recognized as legitimate trainers and team members of the MMAC, something I know they\u2019ve both been looking forward to. They deserve it. Olivia\u2019s heavy breathing filters through my ears and eradicates my thoughts. It lulls me nearer to sleep and I shift closer to her, absorbing the warmth of her soft skin. I will never ignore Olivia again. I\u2019m going to try my hardest to share my emotions with her, I tell myself before I fall over the edge into sleep. I\u2019ve already told her I loved her, how hard can the rest be? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Olivia</p><p>The bathroom door creaks as Seth leans his weight against it.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d He sighs, tapping his fingers against the wood in a cute, fast beat.</p><p>I roll my eyes and adjust the beaded purple straps. How is he dressed already? I\u2019ve barely been in here five minutes. And the dinner is downstairs in the function room by the arena. I pull my phone off the counter and check the time. Oh! It turns out I\u2019ve been in here going on forty minutes. It\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m moving slo-mo. Seth and I went to bed sometime this morning and only woke up two hours ago. I don\u2019t drink coffee, either, so being a normal human being at tonight\u2019s dinner is becoming less realistic by the minute. We slept until late in the afternoon and when we checked our phones, they were full of messages and missed calls from the rest of the crew. Seth had a lot of calls to make once he woke and I replied to Selena\u2019s myriad of demanding text messages. Now, we\u2019re getting ready for dinner. Nerves chew their way through my stomach lining at the thought of being there on Seth\u2019s arm. That\u2019s why I needed the perfect dress, so I don\u2019t look so out of place next to his beyond gorgeous face.</p><p>I smooth my hands over the satin fabric against my thighs. The dress is perfect, to say the least and my long chocolate hair that I\u2019ve curled into subtle waves adds that extra touch of elegance. I remind myself of a Cadbury chocolate bar. I twirl once, careful not to roll my ankle in these ridiculously high heels, and when I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve finished, I unlock the bathroom door, meeting Seth\u2019s suit-clad back. The fabric is crisp and straight, following the same shade of his hair\u2014jet black. He turns around and I visibly see air being forced from his lungs. His eyebrows lift and his lips part\u2014the exact reaction I was hoping for. Forgetting me, I take in his entire form. The white shirt under his black jacket clings to his chest and you just know there\u2019s a killer body hiding underneath it. I nervously run the tips of my fingers along my neck. I feel like I\u2019m wearing a collar and it\u2019s suddenly choking me. He looks...there are no words. In the suit, he looks mischievous. Like he\u2019s ready to do indecent, naughty things at the drop of a hat and hide it behind his classy suit.</p><p>\u201cNow I feel bad,\u201d he says, finally speaking and raking his fingers through his hair.</p><p>Instinctively, I step forward, pressing my hands against his chest and under his black tie. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>He reaches for my chest and runs a single, thick finger underneath the beaded strap. He avoids my eyes and miraculously comes off as indifferent. \u201cBecause you spent money on a dress I\u2019m only going to destroy.\u201d His eyes flick from my chest to my eyes to gauge my reaction. \u201cBut I promise I\u2019ll make it worth every single dollar you spent.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve already kissed the dress goodbye. His rough hands, wet tongue, and hard body feels better on my skin than any fabric ever could\u2014even one as expensive as this.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and my breath catches in my throat. Our friends have impeccable timing. I suppose them showing up is a good thing. Five seconds longer and I would have torn the dress myself.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d He smiles, extending his elbow to me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>He leads me out of the bedroom, down the stairs, and over to the front door. He wastes no time in yanking it open and exposing our glamorous friends. Selena takes one look at my dress and launches forward, pulling me into her arms. \u201cOh my God, O!\u201d she squees. \u201cYou look amazing.\u201d</p> <p>Selena\u2019s black silk gown has Vegas written all over it. She releases me and adjusts one of her tiny pearl earrings. Her golden hair is tied up in an elegant bun on the top of her head with strategic strands that spill from it. I admire her dress\u2014it\u2019s a halter neck with a plunging neckline. It clings to her waist and goes wide at the skirt. From mid-thigh to the floor, there\u2019s a huge slit, exposing the majority of her tan, slim leg.</p><p>\u201cWow, look at you, Ms. Angelina Jolie,\u201d I say, taking a step back.</p><p>I think Selena would even look amazing in a tartan patterned plastic bag. She looks elegant, but at the same time, casual, and I wonder if she spent half as long as I did getting ready. Who am I kidding? She probably spent the whole day preparing herself for the dinner.</p><p>\u201cSo that girl was Seth\u2019s sister?\u201d Selena whispers to me when Darryl and Jackson pull Seth to the side and scold him quietly for last night.</p><p>I nod and fidget with the thin, silver bracelet on my wrist. \u201cYeah\u2014Maddi. Did Jackson tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I bet he never saw that coming.\u201d</p><p>I laugh once. \u201cDid you see his reaction? Of course he didn\u2019t see it coming.\u201d</p><p>She inches closer to me. \u201cDarryl had a cleaner come up today and clean all of the glass.\u201d I look over my shoulder. All of the destruction is gone. There\u2019s no trace of what happened last night when Seth and I came home. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How\u2019d Darryl know he smashed things?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cHe knows how Seth is.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. How regularly does he smash things?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a hefty bill Seth has to foot when we leave here, though. The hotel is not impressed and even contacted the MMAC. Darryl has been apologizing on Seth\u2019s behalf since last night.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I guess that\u2019s what Darryl and Jackson are talking to Seth about. I look at him, there\u2019s the faintest hint of a smirk on the side of his lips and Darryl watches him in exasperation. There\u2019s no getting through to Seth. I find myself smiling at him. He does what he wants and explains himself to nobody\u2014except me. I\u2019m his exception and I guess deep down, I love arguing with him. I like riling him up and watching him become aggressive and demanding. Granted, it\u2019s not the hobby I\u2019m most proud of, but it\u2019s definitely one that excites me above all others. With a swift nod of his head, Seth steps away from Darryl and Jackson, focusing his eyes on me.</p><p>I must be still smiling at him because he angles his head ever so slightly, his eyes flaring that over-confident gleam of his. I feel heat pool in my cheeks and flood down the back of my throat before settling in random spots, sending waves of hot flushes through me. I hate getting caught looking at him. He never lets me live it down. Thankfully, he doesn\u2019t say a word in front of the others. I couldn\u2019t handle it if they started pointing it out, too.</p><p>I know I look at Seth a lot, but give me a break! He\u2019s kind of hard to ignore and I\u2019m only human. I can\u2019t be held accountable for the decisions my hormones make while they hold my brain at gun point.</p><p>Selena, Darryl, and Jackson stroll from the room and once again, Seth extends his elbow to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, baby?\u201d he asks me gruffly.</p><p>I don\u2019t take his elbow straight away and I don\u2019t answer because this isn\u2019t about me. This is about him. I\u2019m just here for moral support.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready? Because this is it\u2014everything you\u2019ve worked so hard for has led to this moment.\u201d</p><p>His eyes never leave mine as he ponders my words. \u201cTonight is going to change both our lives. I need to know if you\u2019re ready for that. If you\u2019re not, I\u2019ll shut this door right now and we can go back to bed. But if you\u2019re ready...\u201d He glances down at his extended elbow. \u201cWe\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>I slip my fingers around his large arm, feeling it all before hooking my elbow around his. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d I exhale with a steady breath.</p><p>He smiles widely. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Seth</p><p>The function room is immaculate and beside me I hear Olivia\u2019s breath catch. I take note of all of the things her eyes linger on for more than five seconds\u2014the glass water drop chandeliers, the large pane-free windows and gold edged paintings of some countryside. All of them I\u2019m going to find and put in our house. I want to see her smile and hear her breath catch every time she enters our family home. I quickly notice I\u2019m not the only one watching Olivia, either. There are loads of beautiful women here in dresses more provocative and edgy than Olivia\u2019s, and still the prying eyes of seedy men linger. Every eye in this room snaps towards her, they devour her every dip and curve, but she pays them no attention. She looks up at me and I feel the tension leave my shoulders once our eyes meet. I drop my elbow and grip her waist instead, guiding her with my hand away from the center of the room before I lash out at someone I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Selena and Jackson disappear immediately and Darryl leaves to do his rounds, introducing himself to all of the \u2018right\u2019 people, people that could help my professional career with their knowledge, skills, and endless amounts of money. I don\u2019t need any of it, but Darryl thinks it\u2019s always good to have contacts. \u2018You never know when things will go sour and if they do, it\u2019s good to have powerful people behind you,\u2019 Darryl always says and maybe he\u2019s right. A woman, holding a large plate of wine glasses, comes to a stop in front of Olivia and I and we both cringe away from it, still feeling the effects of last night\u2014well\u2014this morning, technically. There\u2019s another reason I avoid alcohol...the hangover. The pound of my brain against the front of my skull hurts.</p><p>My eyes flick to a light grey suit, pushing through the sea of black suits and colorful dresses. I recognize the tall, chubby man instantly. Matthew Somer, the CEO of the MMAC. He\u2019s doing pretty well for himself for someone so young\u2014forty three\u2014maybe. He runs his fingers quickly over his black/grey hair and stalks toward us. Olivia slips from my grasp, slightly, but I tighten my hand and hold her against me. I don\u2019t want her walking around without me.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d Matt cheers, clapping his hands together twice before extending one to me. \u201cGood to see you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019ve only met Matt once and that was when we were signing my six figure MMAC contract. His eyes pass over me and onto Olivia.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Matt,\u201d he says, smiling wide and wolfish, making his skin crease around the eyes.</p><p>Olivia smiles back, as friendly and as beautiful as ever. \u201cOlivia,\u201d she tells him as he extends his hand to her.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, it\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d He clears his throat and they shake hands briefly. \u201cDo you mind if Seth and I have a quick, private discussion?\u201d</p><p>Under my hand, I feel her body sag with relief, but it never shows on her face.</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d She turns to me. \u201cCome find me later.\u201d</p><p>I nod and it takes all my strength to pry my fingers from their snug position on her hip. Matt watches Olivia walk away, unashamedly enjoying the way her hips sway.</p><p>He shakes his head and turns back to me. Luckily for him, another passing tray of wine swings by us and I pull one off to busy my hands and prevent them from lashing at out.</p><p>\u201cThe women this sport gets you is insane. Fucking nines and tens, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Like he knows anything about nines and tens. To him, nines and tens are the girls everyone has had\u2014the girls everyone wants. Those aren\u2019t tens, take it from me, a ten is a girl who respects herself, who doesn\u2019t ruin her body with vain necessities and endless strokes of cock.</p><p>\u201cShe was my woman before I made pro,\u201d I tell him, avoiding eye contact. I draw the glass to my lips and take a sip. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m drinking fucking wine to avoid punching out my boss. I hate wine. I\u2019ve always hated wine, and yet I let the fruity liquid linger for a few seconds on my tongue before I swallow it. \u201cYou wanted a private discussion?\u201d I prompt him, eager to ditch him, ditch this wine, and find Olivia.</p><p>He smiles and his hazel eyes flare at me. \u201cWow, you really are the cocky, not-so-subtle asshole everyone\u2019s been warning me about.\u201d</p><p>I shrug my shoulders. At least he\u2019s straight to the point. I can admire that. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-proclaimed as well, I see?\u201d</p><p>I smirk at him. \u201cIf the shoe fits, why not wear it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d Matt says, adjusting the cuffs on his jacket. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because I like you that I\u2019m choosing not to bring up the fact you trashed your hotel room last night.\u201d He folds his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re a fighter, you\u2019re full of testosterone and energy and anger, I get it.\u201d</p><p>He shifts his weight, leaning closer to me. \u201cBut if you so much as reflect negatively on this sport and my fucking company, I will end you as quickly as I made you. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>I bring the wine glass to my lips to hide a smile. I\u2019ve already pissed off the boss and I haven\u2019t even started work yet. I sip the foul liquid and swallow it. The whole time Matt\u2019s gaze never drops from mine.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He turns and then turns back. \u201cOh, and by the way, if I want you to fight Don, you will fight Don. I\u2019m the rule maker in this game. I created them and I can change them.\u201d He rubs his fingers together, gesturing all of the money he could make off of us. \u201cThink twice before you go against the MMAC. Don can easily end up the one on top, not you.\u201d</p><p>My fingers clench around the slender stem of the wine glass as Matt stalks away before camouflaging himself in with everyone else. Not a second later, I ditch my glass on a nearby table cluttered with all kinds of white and leafy decorative crap. I have to find Olivia, and luckily for me, she\u2019s the only one wearing such a vivid, alluring shade of purple. I stroll around with my hands stuffed in my pockets so I don\u2019t fidget. I\u2019m feeling a little anxious and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of Matt\u2019s words or because I plan to propose to Olivia tonight. I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve planned to ask her...I\u2019ve lost count.</p><p>After thirty minutes, I give up and lean against a wide table next to a couple having a disagreement. I tune them out, uninterested in their problems. I let my eyes scan the room\u2014I look up the wide, long staircases and along the walls, but I still can\u2019t see her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I\u2019m about to give up and start socializing, a large group of men in black suits step out of the way and my eyes are drawn to a purple fabric like a moth to flame. I let them roam up the length of her legs, over the curves of her body, and onto the side of her face. How does someone look perfect from every angle? Of course only she can manage something so mind blowing. I see her and the two guys she\u2019s talking to.</p><p>She spots me stalking toward her from her peripherals and angles her head slightly to look at me. A nervous blush flashes across her cheeks and she seems almost scared. Shit. Am I really that bad? Am I that much of a jealous asshole? The answers to those questions I know myself, but I\u2019m sure as hell not going to admit them.</p><p>I walk toward her, proud by the way I keep my cool, and on my approach, when I slow to a stop beside Olivia, she abruptly hooks her elbow around mine. Her fingertips brush against my arm in a soothing gesture...am I not doing a good enough job at looking calm?</p> <p>\u201cThis is my boyfriend, Seth,\u201d she says, introducing me to them.</p><p>Boyfriend. Boyfriend is not enough for me. It seems childish\u2014high schoolish. I want to be referred to as her fianc\u00e9, better yet, I want to be called her husband\u2014so others know she has given everything to me and there\u2019s no chance in hell for them to get closer to her. They eye me closely and one\u2014the one wearing a tan suit and has blond hair and blue eyes to match\u2014seems intimidated, but the other\u2014the one with the sharp features and shaved head\u2014seems almost territorial. He eyes me up and down like he can take me, no sweat. I wouldn\u2019t fight either of them. Both seem barely twenty-one.</p><p>\u201cHow long you guys been dating?\u201d His thick Texan accent comes through loud and clear...and it irritates the shit out of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d I demand, inching closer.</p><p>Olivia subtly elbows my ribs, but I hardly feel it.</p> <p>\u201cA couple of months,\u201d she tells him</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too long,\u201d he states, his eyes flaring suggestively at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, it is short. Undoubtedly shorter than your stay in the hospital if you keep going with your unsubtle bullshit.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it is about him that irks me. It could be the way his hair juts outwards or the way his lips curl crookedly when he speaks\u2014or maybe (just for added craziness)\u2014it\u2019s the way he\u2019s talking to my girl in front of me. His blond friend\u2014the smarter one\u2014mutters for his friend to relax, but he ignores him. The idiot.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can put me in hospital?\u201d</p><p>I smile because I know I can put him in hospital.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d O snaps at him, tugging on my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t challenge him.\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t move, although I know I should. I\u2019m just not finished here. I can see it in his face how badly he wants Olivia, how desperately he wants to impress her and I want to take that away from him. Without taking my eyes off him, I snatch Olivia\u2019s waist and pull her to me.</p><p>\u201cYou want to fight me for my girl?\u201d I ask, narrowing my eyes on him. He doesn\u2019t say anything, only glares as I continue. \u201cYou see, Olivia here likes men, not boys.\u201d I wrap my hands around her waist, feeling the subtle curves of her body. \u201cYour hands are small and inexperienced. I feel sorry for every girl that has ever been with you and has strangely given you the confidence to even blink at a woman like this. My hands, however...\u201d I feel my lips curl devilishly. I know I shouldn\u2019t say it. \u201c...are experienced. They\u2019ve made her come more times than you question your sexual orientation, which\u2014judging by your outfit\u2014I assume is a lot. Go away and come back when you know how to treat Olivia like a real woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr better yet,\u201d Olivia growls, pulling away from me. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She stalks off and I don\u2019t follow her right away. I want to, but I want these to assholes to disperse first. With the dirtiest look I\u2019ve ever received in my life, the douchebags turn and disappear.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cMaking friends everywhere you go, as always.\u201d Darryl exhales behind me.</p><p>He\u2019s getting pretty good at watching me from the background without my knowledge and I smirk over my shoulder at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go and get her before she leaves.\u201d</p> <p>My smirk fades. Fuck. Now I\u2019ve got to find Olivia and apologize for being an idiot. It\u2019s like one big vicious circle, but I can\u2019t help it\u2014how many times do I use that excuse? It\u2019s true, though. I see someone that wants her and I feel the need to crush their souls. The thought of a mental image of Olivia popping into their brains pisses me off. I can\u2019t explain it...and I know it\u2019s pure, crazy selfishness that has me acting this way, but I\u2019ve never felt the way she makes me feel. I\u2019ve never had the stomach churning, chest levitating love before and now that I have it, I can\u2019t let it go. I won\u2019t.</p><p>I see her pushing her way through the throng of people and I march after her, catching up in no time. I reach out for her, grabbing her small, fragile wrist and forcing her to stop and turn around. Her cheeks are flushed pink\u2014with embarrassment or anger, I have no idea.</p><p>\u201cI told you to stop using me against people after you did it with Mason,\u201d she whispers harshly, avoiding attention.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think she or anyone will ever understand that I don\u2019t have reasons for anything that I do. I do it. That\u2019s it.</p><p>\u201cBecause that guy was a douchebag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me show you something.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p><p>I nod as excitement begins to pool inside me. I grit my teeth against a smile that threatens my lips. Now is the perfect time to unleash what I want to do on her.</p><p>\u201cIs it going to make up for what you just did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She studies my face for a few seconds and I wonder if she can read my thoughts. I\u2019m taking her to the Garden Arena where I\u2019ll fight Junior Moset and I\u2019m going to let her in the cage...then I\u2019m going to ask her to be my wife.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Olivia</p><p>He leads me away from the gala and nervousness replaces my previous frustration. Are we even allowed back here?</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I wonder aloud as he escorts me up a corridor, his hand low on the small of my back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d is all he says as he glances sideways at me.</p><p>In that quick glance, I saw it. I saw his eyes flash with indecent excitement and heat spreads through my organs. The wild gleam in his eyes doesn\u2019t pass me by, and as he pushes through some double service doors, I follow behind him. After a few more steps I\u2019m suddenly standing in the Garden Arena looking down on the intimidating cage. My chest tightens and I grip the black metal railing for support. I haven\u2019t been in a stadium in a few months and being back both terrifies and electrifies me.</p><p>Seth clears his throat and I snap my attention to him. His hand is extended and his eyes clearly reflect the positive emotions he feels.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going down there?\u201d I ask, taking one step.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything, only nods. The weak lighting barely filters off the plastic chairs and to think in two weeks this place is going to be as bright as day and filled with thousands upon thousands of screaming people bewilders me.</p><p>Seth walks with purpose, pulling me along behind him as he leads me through rows of seats and down concrete stairs. The closer I get to the cage, the larger it seems, and the larger it seems, the more the apprehension of what Seth does settles in. I\u2019m with a fighter...How the hell did that happen and what the hell is wrong with me? I don\u2019t like fighting and I never have, so how the hell did I fall for a fighter?</p><p>The tall cage looms over me, distracting me from my thoughts. I gape up at the monstrous structure. I\u2019ve never been this close to a cage before\u2014a real cage, I mean. I\u2019ve seen Seth\u2019s training one plenty of times, but it doesn\u2019t intimidate me like this one does.</p><p>Seth moves from me and up the small steps before opening the cage door. He smiles down at me with those gorgeous goddamn lips and says, \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>He gestures for me to enter the cage with one gentle swipe of his hand.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I almost glance over my shoulder. \u201cAm I allowed to go in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do whatever we want. Who\u2019s going to know?\u201d</p><p>The way he says it\u2014with such promise\u2014has my stomach doing flips and I inch forward. When the tip of my shoe hits the bottom step of the ring, I halt and look up at him.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>His irises flare at me and his mouth curls into a cocky smirk. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>My body reacts as if he said, no, I shouldn\u2019t be scared. It\u2019s like he has me under some kind of spell. I ascend the steps and inch forward until I\u2019m standing firmly on the vinyl flooring. The floor doesn\u2019t bounce or bow underneath my weight. How hard do these guys slam each other to make it bounce so much? I do a full circle, taking in the view from this spot. How amazing would it be to see the arena filled with people from where I\u2019m standing? Even now, when it\u2019s just Seth and I, adrenaline flows through my veins like rapid-fire, making my head spin. I circle the ring slowly, letting my fingers glide over the vinyl baked wiring. Halfway around, I run out of breath. Not because I\u2019m tired, but because I\u2019m overwhelmed by the size of it all. I rest against the cage, letting the cold metal cool my burning skin. I drag my eyes around the ring before settling on Seth\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI see why you love being on this side of the wire,\u201d I wonder aloud, feeling a hot flush flow through me as he pushes himself off of the cage door. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing from here.\u201d</p><p>The door closes behind him with a light slam and I watch as he hooks a finger around his black tie, loosening it. I swallow hard and subtly squeeze my thighs together as a familiar pulsing starts\u2014the pulsing only Seth can arouse. Only he can provoke such feelings with one painfully normal act. I expel a slow, heavy breath as he saunters toward me. There\u2019s no mistaking the way he walks\u2014he wants me and he wants me now.</p><p>Seth stops once his hard body grazes mine and his hand wraps around my wrist, pinning it above my head. Being within a foot of him, I feel my body come alive, humming as pure sexual energy starts to take over. Our eyes stay locked as he pulls his tie from the collar of his white formal shirt. The soft silk of his tie glides against skin and I frown. What is he doing? The fabric bites into my wrist and I lurch forward, rebounding off his large torso and ending flush up against the cage again.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I gasp, tugging at my wrist and getting nowhere. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He works the fabric around the wires of the cage, ignoring me. The whole time I watch him, panicked by what\u2019s happening, he has a mischievous, smoldering gleam in his eyes.</p><p>When he\u2019s done successfully tethering me to the cage, he runs his rough fingers up my sensitive forearm, sending heat inducing tingles tearing through my body. I can just make out his features under the glow of security lights and exit signs as his hands slide onto the nape of my neck and his lips crash to mine. My body melts to his as he presses me hard against the wire and all is well and fun until his fingers slide across my waist and clasp the zipper to my dress. I pull away from him, breathless.</p><p>The zipper begins its painfully slow descent and my nerves rise. I flinch away from his hand in an attempt to get him to stop.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he scolds me. \u201cI\u2019m already trying hard not to rip this thing at the seams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone will see us...\u201d</p><p>He stops and looks me dead in the eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019d put you on show for someone else to see? No. You\u2019re all mine.\u201d</p><p>Using my free hand, I squeeze it between us and reach to untie the tie, but I\u2019m stopped as he yanks my hand away. I squirm as he presses it against the cage above my head, right next to the other and his free hand slips into my dress, clamping on my bare hip.</p><p>\u201cWhy here? Why can\u2019t you wait until we get home?\u201d</p><p>He lowers his head, bringing his full lips to my ear. His breath hits my face and it\u2019s like fire lapping at my nerves, singeing and burning my insides.</p><p>\u201cWhy wait?\u201d he breathes, his hand tightening around my hip. \u201cI fight here and I want to fuck here.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have time to react\u2014or even frown\u2014before his mouth claims me for a second time. I shiver as his rough hand skims my bare flesh. He tugs my dress down and it pools in a purple mess at my feet. Kissing me harder than I\u2019ve ever been kissed before, his hands roam my body, harshly grabbing and squeezing everything and eliciting moans from me every time.</p><p>I can\u2019t say I ever pictured myself bound to an MMA ring in my underwear...but that\u2019s how it is with Seth. If he wants something, he gets it, and he gets it any way he wants it.</p><p>His fingers curl around my underwear and he snags it, snapping the flimsy fabric and leaving me bare. Too consumed in his mouth, it takes me a while to register what he\u2019s doing...until the lace of my underwear tightens around the wrist above my head.</p><p>He catches my lip between his teeth and I wince as he rakes them over it before taking a step back. His eyes linger on my breasts, long enough for my cheeks to burn from the scrutiny as he admires me, giving no indication if this is to his liking or not. Seth steps in close again and reaches round me, unhooking my strapless bra. I feel my eyes widen as the cups fall to my feet, landing on top of the fabric.</p><p>I try and cross my legs, but he jams a hand between them, chuckling deeply. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t lure you all the way up here and tie you to the ring only to have you shy away from me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cO, I want you to take all of those nervous thoughts that are skittering around your head and I want you to forget them. I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you. I\u2019d never do anything to demean you...\u201d His lips twitch. \u201c...intentionally. All I want is to make you feel good.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hands from my thighs, slips out of his jacket and tosses it to the side like it isn\u2019t worth a cent. \u201cI want you to feel special, like you\u2019re the only girl I want to be with.\u201d</p> <p>I keep my eyes on his as his fingers curl around his buttons one by one, exposing his alluring flesh piece by piece. I\u2019m enthralled by the vision. Every muscle in his perfect body is obvious and sculpted to complete perfection.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scream for me when I\u2019m fighting, but you will scream for me now.\u201d He strokes his finger along my bottom lip then pushes it inside. He surveys his finger in my mouth before he snatches it back, grabs my jaw and swoops down, claiming it with a heavy breath. His tongue tastes me with an aggressive passion that sets my body alight. I can hear our breath smashing into each other and I gasp loudly when he pulls away without any notice. He rests his forehead against mine. \u201cAnd I will replay your screams over and over in my head every second I\u2019m in this ring two weeks from now.\u201d</p><p>I nod my compliance eagerly, but I don\u2019t know whether to be petrified or exhilarated. He shrugs out of his shirt, exposing all of his clean cut muscles and he kicks the fabric to the side, uncaring if it wrinkles. He doesn\u2019t give me much time to admire him topless in a nice pair of slacks. His hands shoot out and grip my bare hips as he descends on me, lowering his head to suck harshly on my neck. Fervently, I press myself into him, unable to get enough. Seth\u2019s rough hand glides down my navel and between my legs. I shudder as a low growl rolls through his chest like thunder and he drags his lips to my ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking wet.\u201d He sucks my earlobe between his lips and releases it. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be, but you\u2019re really turned on by this, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He strokes me and it sends a bolt of pleasure down through my body, making my knees weaken. I rake my teeth across my bottom lip and shake my head, refusing to play into his hands straight away even though my heart pounds hot blood through my veins.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do better than that, baby,\u201d I tell him, not in the slightest bit embarrassed that my voice is low and breathless.</p><p>His eyes flare. He knows he has me melting like butter, but he plays along, undoubtedly eager to see how long I can keep from letting myself go. His fingers slip from me and a pang of disappointment courses through my body...or at least it does until I hear the zip of his pants. Before I have time to see if he\u2019ll drop them or not, his hands tighten around my hips and I\u2019m suddenly being thrust upward. He hoists me up, forcing me to wrap my legs around him while he shoves his hips into mine, thrusting against me. Seth smirks as he presses his bare erection deliberately into the apex of my thighs, and I squirm as my breath escapes in a sharp gust. His expression turns predatory\u2014dark and hungry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you strut around in your dress while others stared.\u201d He cups one of my breasts and my peaks strain against the palm of his hand.</p><p>I squeeze him tighter, forcing him even closer to me. In response, he runs his tongue slowly over my bottom lip. \u201cI\u2019ve watched other men flirt with you and eye-fuck you.\u201d He drops a hand to position himself right where I want him to be. \u201cYou\u2019re here with me now, though,\u201d he rasps, entering me a fraction and sending white hot pleasure arrowing through my core. \u201cAnd all I want is to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t push further as he waits for me to say it\u2014whatever it is. I flex my hips, forcing him in deeper, but he pulls away, keeping me desperate and wanting.</p><p>\u201cSeth...\u201d I groan.</p> <p>Cold tingles\u2014wait\u2014hot tingles dance over the surface of my skin as he pushes a little deeper then moves back out.</p><p>\u201cYou were mad at me upstairs,\u201d he says, his breath sounding awfully shaky for someone who is meant to be in control. I almost smile.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never my intent to demean you, but I had to let those dick bags know that you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>I feel my brows draw together. \u201cI know I\u2019m yours. That\u2019s all that should matter.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cFor as long as you\u2019re with me, I\u2019ll make sure everyone knows it. Whoever talks to you, touches you, or looks at you will know that you are mine, and I will do and say an endless amount of stupid shit to achieve that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He moves inside of me and I desperately want to grip his shoulders against the shudder that rolls through me.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I love you and I\u2019ve never loved anyone before...I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel how you make me feel. I told you when we met that I\u2019m fucking selfish and spoiled, and I wasn\u2019t kidding. I want every one of your smiles, every laugh, every tear, every-fucking-thing\u2014all of it\u2014I want it and I want it all to myself.\u201d</p><p>My heart swells at his words\u2014although not elegantly stated\u2014and I want to give him all of me. I do give him all of me. I want to break through these restraints and glide my hands across his shoulders and up his neck to reassure him. \u201cI am yours and solely yours. The smiles I give everyone else aren\u2019t like the smiles I give you. For them, I smile out of courtesy. For you, I smile out of love\u2014something only you make me feel.\u201d</p><p>His features soften and I watch his tongue glide quickly over his bottom lip. \u201cWhy do you love me?\u201d</p><p>I stare into his choc-honeycomb eyes and think about my answer. After a few prolonged seconds, I realize I don\u2019t have one and I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer...and maybe that\u2019s what love is.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrow. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe love is enigmatic for a reason. Think about it, all of the greatest things in this world are indescribable because there are no words that can accurately portray them.\u201d He smiles and I mimic it. \u201cIn short, inexpressible beyond words is my answer for you.\u201d</p><p>His forehead falls softly against mine. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you...I shouldn\u2019t be tying you up out in the open and I shouldn\u2019t be treating you like you\u2019re anything but good.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, my stare falling to his lips. I don\u2019t want him to stop this. It feels right. All I want is Seth on me, around me, inside of me\u2014I can\u2019t get close enough to him.</p><p>\u201cEven good can be a little bad sometimes.\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirks up on an adorable angle. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to, now shut up and finish what you started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand how this works.\u201d He bites back a cocky smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the one tied up...which means, you are in no position to give me orders.\u201d</p><p>With a flick of my eyebrows, I roll my hips on him and he growls deep in his chest, gripping my hips. I may be tied up, but I still have the power. I sink my teeth into my bottom lip as Seth slams himself all the way inside, making me take all of him in one deep thrust. As he fills me, the air whooshes out of my lungs and stings when I forget to breathe. His hands squeeze me as he moans my name. With each thrust his length fills my hot core completely and my helpless body writhes against the wire as I cry out in ecstasy. My eager moans spur Seth onward and he slams into me with surprising, spine-tingling force.</p><p>\u201cYou are here with me,\u201d he mutters in a sexy husky voice and I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s to me or himself. \u201cBecause you are fucking mine.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip harshly and moan my agreement. My head spins and momentarily, I\u2019m worried that this is all a dream\u2014that I\u2019m about to wake up and find this isn\u2019t happening, but when I drag my eyes to his and see his scorching eyes and sexy smirk, I know there\u2019s no way I\u2019m dreaming. This is real. He feels real...and fucking amazing.</p><p>\u201cUntie me.\u201d</p><p>I want to engulf my fingers in his dark hair. I want to run my hands over his hard body and feel his muscles tremble because of me.</p><p>\u201cYou want to touch me?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cDesperately.\u201d</p><p>In an instant he reaches up and manages to free my hands. It\u2019s clear the tying thing doesn\u2019t work for us. We need to feel each other with our hands\u2014every time we have sex we explore each other and touch each other like it\u2019s the very first time all over again.</p><p>Immediately, I plunge my fingers into his hair and he groans as I weave my fingers tightly through his locks. His tongue plunges into my mouth, assuming all control. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have marks on my back from the cage, but I don\u2019t care\u2014not right now, anyway.</p><p>Seth\u2019s movements speed to a frantic pace and I can hear him grunting and growling low in his chest, begging me for his release as he continues to fuck me. I\u2019m close, and I begin to pull at his hair as I climb higher to my peak. I\u2019m falling endlessly, waiting for something to explode inside me, but I don\u2019t want to come yet. I want to stay here on the edge of euphoria with him. Seth grips the base of my thigh, thrusting in long, quick strokes.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I hiss, locking my ankles.</p><p>My mouth and brain are disconnected from each other. My brain knows to shut up, but my mouth insists on begging for more. When I\u2019m panting for air, his mouth slips down to my neck and he bites down on it, sucking fiercely. He releases the skin instantly, realizing a love bite isn\u2019t the classiest thing to show off at an event like this, and runs his tongue over the spot he sucked. My hands grope him and my mouth nips and licks every section of exposed flesh available to me.</p><p>\u201cTell me...\u201d he moans into my ear. \u201cTell me how much you love this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you taking me hard against the cage.\u201d</p><p>He moans, deep and husky, and it vibrates every sensitive part in my body, increasing my pleasure tenfold. My body contracts as sensations begin to build in me, forcing me to pant hard and heavy. I\u2019m going to come...I try to hold it off, wanting to prolong this feeling and this moment, but as soon as Seth reaches down in between us, and he flicks a rough, thick and hard finger over my sensitive bundle of nerves, all is lost. I\u2019m spinning down an endless spiral, floating above my body. He\u2019s swearing under his breath as my muscles constrict almost painfully around him, and I\u2019m milking him deeper and deeper inside of me.</p><p>\u201cSeth!\u201d I grab his shoulders as the friction of him thrusting into me becomes too much.</p><p>\u201cYou better fucking scream for me,\u201d he rasps, rubbing me harder, thrusting deeper. He bites my bottom lip and the feel of his tongue, the nip of his teeth, the heat of his breath, the friction of his fingers\u2014it\u2019s all too much and dark coils unfurl in my stomach, whipping wildly inside of me, shattering my self control and fragmenting me. I dig my nails into the taut flesh of his shoulders and I scream out as wave after wave of the most intense orgasm of my life rips through my entire body, causing my muscles to spasm and my breath to falter. Seth\u2019s hips drive harder and faster as I ride out the surge, his eyes never leaving mine.</p><p>\u201cFuck yeah...oh...\u201d he growls, pressing his forehead against mine. Our breaths clash in a heavy pant and our lips barely graze. His thrusts become quick and shaky, his eyes half-lidded and lust-filled. Not a second later, he jams his tongue in my mouth and I absorbed all of his moans on the tip of my tongue as warmth spreads throughout my womb. Long after I feel him soften, he continues to kiss me. His lips slow moving against mine in a relaxed rhythm as his tongue licks and tastes me. I feel myself melt into him and he supports most of my weight. With a small nip of my bottom lip, he pulls away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do just nicely.\u201d He smiles, and it\u2019s a cute, lazy smile that makes my heart swell hard against my ribs.</p><p>He steps away from me and fresh, cool air clings to my skin in his absence. I reach for my dress, but his voice stops me. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>I freeze and draw myself back to full height. Excitement bubbles at the thought of doing what we just did again, but when Seth starts putting his own clothes back on, I really become confused. I watch, leaning thoughtfully against the wire\u2014the wire that is probably printed onto the flesh on my back, too.</p><p>As he pulls his jacket over his shoulders, he steps closer with a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou are so amazing.\u201d He chuckles, stroking my nipple with his index finger and it stands to attention.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me this when I\u2019m dressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, but it\u2019s what I\u2019m going to tell you afterwards that I want you to be naked for.\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you to remember this. When you think back to this life changing moment, I want it to have my name all over it.\u201d</p><p>Seth drops before me, down on one knee! My heart stops and stutters, threatening to implode and kill me on the spot. When it continues to beat, it pumps blood through my veins at a pace too quick for the rest of my body to accommodate and my head spins. Do not freak out. This can\u2019t possibly be what I think it is.</p><p>He looks up at me through thick, dark lashes.</p><p>Oh, fuck.</p><p>Without taking his eyes from mine, he reaches into his jacket and produces a gorgeous green velvet box. I\u2019m frozen. It\u2019s exactly what I think it is. He opens the box and exposes the most beautiful ring I\u2019ve ever seen. Gold. Emeralds. Diamonds. All of the pretty rocks are arranged on top of the gold band in a breathtaking display of elegance.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t do this now, I know I\u2019ll regret it later. I\u2019m here in my favorite place, with my favorite person\u2014naked, might I add\u2014and I can\u2019t think of a more perfect time other than right now to ask you what I\u2019ve been dying to ask you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to speak, but only pathetic gusts of air come out.</p><p>\u201cBefore I ask, I want you to know that I know I\u2019m a difficult person. I know I\u2019m childish and immature and a million other things, and I want this one second to say thank you for putting up with me and I thank God\u2014or whatever\u2014everyday for making you as masochistic as me.\u201d I roll my eyes at him. I\u2019m hardly masochistic. \u201cI know you have a lot of people you can rely on that are more than willing to be there for you and to support you, but no one can look after you or take care of you like I can, O. Not your mom, not your brother, not even you, at least, not like I can and not like I want to.\u201d</p><p>He inches closer, his eyes glossy and pleading. \u201cI want to be the one to look after you and to care for you. I want my last name to be the one you sign forms with. I want to be the person you call when you need help or advice. I want to be the love of your life, your reason for living, and your best friend. What I\u2019m asking, O, is for you to give me the chance to take care of you, to give you everything you\u2019ve ever wanted, and everything you\u2019ve always deserved. I want to marry you. I want you to have my last name and carry my children. I want us to buy a home together\u2014to be together.\u201d</p> <p>Whoa. That is a lot of wants...my mouth is still open, still in utter shock at what is unfolding before me. I snap my mouth shut and squeeze my fingers against my damp palm to stop from trembling. I feel sick...but it\u2019s that excited/nervous kind of sick. Time slows and my gaze drops to his lips as the question falls from his lips.</p><p>\u201cWill you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to ask me to marry you when I\u2019m naked in a cage and you\u2019re fully clothed?\u201d I choke out, completely avoiding the point to buy myself more time. I\u2019ve been waiting for this to happen...but now that it has, I\u2019m a deer in the headlights.</p><p>He smiles wickedly. \u201cThis is exactly how I imagined it, but that\u2019s not the response I want from you.\u201d</p><p>Right. I flick my tongue over my bottom lip to dispel the dryness. \u201cYes.\u201d I tell him, unable to hide my sudden, face-splitting smile. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a yes.\u201d</p> <p>The smile that splits Seth\u2019s face is like no other and in one fluid motion he pulls the ring from the box, takes my hand in his, and slips the ring on. Without missing a beat, he launches at me, sweeping me into his arms and pressing me hard against the cage again. We kiss. We kiss again. We kiss over and over, unable to express our happiness in words. When I was young and I dreamt of my engagement, I definitely didn\u2019t imagine I\u2019d be naked in a cage with a fighter. I imagined snow falling from the sky, white horses, red roses\u2014the whole unrealistic package. But this is so much better. This is real and perfect. This has Seth\u2019s name all over it and I\u2019ll never forget it, ever.</p><p>As we walk back to the function, it\u2019s hard to keep my eyes on the tiles in front of me and not on the ring wrapped around my finger. My knees wobble underneath me as my body still reels in the after effects of the mind-blowing sex and the excitement of what came afterwards. I feel different\u2014like a new person entirely. I always knew I wanted to be with Seth forever, but now the feeling is certain\u2014as solid as stone. I rest most of my weight against him. My fianc\u00e9. My husband to be.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop smiling and I glance at Seth. As usual, he\u2019s the perfect picture of calm, but I know he\u2019s as excited as I am. I can tell by the way his thumb brushes eagerly over my fingers. As we walk through the crowd and different pairs of eyes stop and stare at me, I notice Seth\u2019s fingers don\u2019t possessively squeeze me. That says a lot about our \u2018new\u2019 relationship already. He knows I\u2019m his now. He knows I want to spend the rest of my life with him. Not squeezing me gives me confidence that he\u2019s willing to grow as a person and that he trusts me. Walking with Seth is like walking with a loaded gun at times. You never know when he\u2019s feeling particularly aggressive or territorial and you never know if or when he\u2019s going to go off.</p><p>Seth is the kind of person who needs to be shown love in order to feel loved. We could be sitting alone in a room after a movie or sex and he\u2019ll feel unloved unless he\u2019s touching me or I\u2019m touching him. We don\u2019t talk much about him or his childhood. He prefers to live in the now and avoids dredging up old memories, but I know (from the small conversations we\u2019ve had) that his neediness and his need for validation stems from his father\u2019s neglect. Because of that, Seth needs constant affection. He needs to be praised\u2014he craves it. He acts like he\u2019s untouchable and his confidence is a balloon too hard to pop with a sharp needle, but deep down I think he\u2019s just as insecure as the rest of us.</p><p>Seth is jealous, commanding, and a little too proud, but that\u2019s okay with me. He\u2019s only human, and being human means you\u2019re vulnerable, that you have weaknesses and imperfections. That\u2019s the beauty of it. Being human is about making mistakes and learning from them...or not, if you don\u2019t want to. There\u2019s too much pressure to be perfect these days, and guess what? People are imperfect. People are annoying, stupid, and rude at times, but it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay because ninety percent of the time it doesn\u2019t affect you directly and it\u2019s up to you to let it bother you and poison you or you can brush it off. I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just trying to defend Seth\u2019s behavior\u2014hell\u2014maybe I\u2019m trying to defend my own behavior. My decisions haven\u2019t always been sound ones, but they are my decisions and I\u2019m the only one that has to live with them, no one else.</p><p>Seth escorts me through some more double doors and into another function room. Huge round tables fill the room, decorated with red and white dressings topped with a gorgeous ice sculpture centered in the middle. Forget the swan. These guys want boxing gloves and fists in the middle of their table to add elegance to their celebration.</p> <p>We\u2019re seated at a table with people we don\u2019t even know\u2014well\u2014people I don\u2019t know. Seth seems to know everyone and has fought and beat at least three of the five fighters at our table. The coordinators of this event has split everyone up into their occupations\u2014fighters with fighters, coaches with coaches\u2014and so on. At our table, and directly across from us, sits wrestling world champion and Seth\u2019s opponent, Junior Moset. Their relationship is a hell of a lot tamer than Seth and Don\u2019s, and they even smile and throw jokes at each other when their conversations cross paths. No matter how friendly the conversation is, though, it\u2019s clear both fighters think they\u2019re going to win. Junior is a lot like Seth, size-wise, and it\u2019s hard to believe someone his size can be so efficient on the floor. Regardless of his impressive background, Seth isn\u2019t intimidated by him, and Junior isn\u2019t intimidated by Seth\u2019s outstanding undefeated history. It\u2019ll make for an interesting fight, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>Junior is handsome\u2014light caramel skin and crazy-bright, golden honey eyes. He has a scruffy mop of chocolate hair (two shades lighter than mine) that sticks up in an array of styled spikes. It suits him and his fun, confident personality.</p><p>\u201cSeth, you do know Junior has defeated his last two opponents with a standing rear naked choke,\u201d a guy I don\u2019t know or recognize says, nudging Junior with his elbow.</p><p>I glance sideways at Seth, who shrugs and smiles. \u201cI\u2019m aware.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>Junior smirks, and rests his elbows on the table, chewing on a steamed bean. He enjoys tormenting Seth and I get it. He\u2019s new, he hasn\u2019t fought for his keep yet, but when they fight in two weeks, I know it\u2019s Seth who\u2019ll come out on top. Seth knows it too, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s casually playing along with their games.</p><p>\u201cNothing bothers me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something that bothers you,\u201d Junior snickers. \u201cSpiders bother me.\u201d</p> <p>Seth drops his fork against his plate. \u201cOkay, the anxious wait between fights bothers me. Not having sex for long periods of time bothers me, and knowing I\u2019m going to knock you out in the first round and not give the spectators a good show bothers me.\u201d</p><p>The table erupts with whistles and \u2018burn\u2019 remarks. I roll my eyes. I have no idea how I\u2019ve put up with this for the last forty minutes and I don\u2019t think I can take another second. The other girls that sit around the table with their fighters are enjoying the banter immensely, but I find it a pointless show of feathers. Every single man at this table thinks they are the ultimate \u2018alpha male,\u2019 which leads to some very loud, pointless conversations and challenges.</p><p>Seth leans into me, pulling me from my thoughts. \u201cLightning bothers me, too,\u201d he whispers with a wink.</p><p>\u201cLightning? Like the stuff that comes from the clouds during a storm?\u201d</p><p>He nods, pulling his glass of water to his lips and taking a sip. \u201cIt freaks me out,\u201d he says when he lowers it again.</p><p>I watch him, my eyes as wide as saucers. How someone his size is scared of anything, let alone lightning, is beyond me. I put my napkin to my mouth and conceal my laugh. Seth smiles back, pleased with himself for sharing this new piece of information with me.</p><p>\u201cSpiders are pretty scary,\u201d Seth tells Junior, returning to the table conversation, \u201c...to girls.\u201d</p><p>I nudge Seth with my elbow and he laughs, picking at his fish with his fork. The table roars with laughter and Junior shrugs it off like it\u2019s no big deal. He\u2019s very humble, not caring what Seth says to him, and I decide I like Junior, which will make watching Seth and Junior\u2019s fight slightly more difficult.</p><p>\u201cA girl?\u201d Junior chuckles. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have labelled me as that, now it\u2019s going to be a hell of a lot more embarrassing for you when I submit your ass.\u201d</p><p>Seth opens his mouth to reply with another undoubtedly rude, smart ass comment, but a male voice over the speakers stops him.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first official MMAC dinner of this season.\u201d</p><p>Applause erupts over the room and we twist in our chairs to the stage behind us. At the microphone is the CEO of the MMAC, Matthew Somers. Matthew seems like a good enough guy.</p><p>\u201cThis season will be a memorable one. In the break, we\u2019ve recruited a few new fighters\u2014Darren Shane, Rashad Moens, Hayne Gains, and amateur champion, Seth Marc.\u201d</p><p>The crowd goes for another round of applause and in the distance I hear whistling and whooping\u2014a female voice that sounds an awful lot like Selena\u2019s. I bite back a smile, assuming she\u2019s had a little too much wine.</p><p>\u201cAll of these new fighters will go up against our seasoned pros at one stage or another\u2014the usual, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>The way he says it sets me on edge for some strange reason.</p><p>\u201cThis season, we\u2019re going to do something we\u2019ve never done before. We\u2019re going to give an amateur a shot at joining the MMAC.\u201d He raises a finger. \u201cOne shot. One fight. We\u2019ve all seen the hype on the internet about Seth Marc. We all know what he\u2019s capable of\u2014what he can bring to this sport.\u201d</p><p>I look at Seth and his jaw clenches imperceptibly.</p><p>\u201cIn this room, we have one man capable of bringing the greatest rematch this sport has ever seen. You want to know how many views the amateur championship fight between Don Russell and Seth Marc got on the internet. Five hundred and fifty-seven million.\u201d</p><p>Matt raises two fingers. \u201cTwo weeks following his fight with Junior Moset, Mr. Seth Marc will be going up against a promising fighter at the Mandalay Bay Event Arena. One we pulled off the same streets as Seth\u2014one who wants to be here just as badly as any of you.\u201d Matt chuckles, smirking at Seth like the back-stabbing wolf he is. \u201cOne who hates Seth more than anyone else on the planet.\u201d</p><p>My mouth drops, following the motions of my stomach. Surely he doesn\u2019t mean\u2014</p><p>\u201cDon Russell.\u201d</p><p>The room crackles with anticipation and enlivens with chatter. I look sideways at Seth to gauge his reaction. His eyes are focused on Matt and his lips are held in a small smile. Watching him now, you\u2019d think he isn\u2019t the least bit phased by the announcement...but I know him and there\u2019s no doubt that deep down he\u2019s losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cIf Seth wins, Don Russell will never get a chance to join the MMAC. If Don wins, he gets a spot in the MMAC and a shot at the World Champion title like everyone else. Two weeks from now\u2014Junior, try not to hurt him too bad. I need him.\u201d Matthew laughs and puts the microphone back in its holder before turning on his heel and strolling from the stage with a wide smile on his stupid face. What a snake. Matt made this announcement public, knowing Seth will never back down and risk humiliating himself. He knows Seth is stubborn and proud...he knows doing it this way Seth can\u2019t say no. He manipulated Seth into the fight.</p><p>Seth turns back around in his seat and pushes his plate of food to the side, resting his elbows on the table.</p><p>\u201cDon Russell,\u201d Junior scoffs. \u201cThe guy is a joke. Why Matt wants him in the MMAC is beyond me. Fucking vermin.\u201d</p><p>Half the table mumbles their agreement.</p><p>\u201cCan we go home?\u201d I ask Seth, loud enough for the table to hear.</p><p>I know he doesn\u2019t want to be here, I can see it on his face\u2014regardless of how hard he\u2019s trying to hide it. Knowing him, he wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as running from the dinner directly after the announcement.</p><p>\u201cGo home?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head quickly, nudging him. He catches on, relief flooding his features.</p><p>\u201cBeauty sleep?\u201d the strange guy next to me slurs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need beauty sleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>I laugh nervously, rising to my feet and pushing my chair back with my legs. I glance at Seth, who\u2019s watching the guy closely. I don\u2019t need a drunk creep making Seth flip out right now. \u201cSeth?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He removes his attention from the guy who\u2019s already shifted his interest back to his date. Seth nods his head, says his goodbyes to the rest of the table, and I shoulder the blame for our sudden departure.</p><p>We stroll past table after table, unable to avoid the congratulations on the rematch, and when the door is only a few feet away, Darryl and Jackson slip in front of us.</p><p>\u201cNot now, Darryl,\u201d Seth growls through clenched teeth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve called your lawyers; they\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Seth pushes past them, dragging me behind him. \u201cCancel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCancel them?\u201d Jackson questions. \u201cSeth, you-\u201d</p><p>Seth snaps around and I take a quick defensive step back\u2014until my arm is straightened and straining at the elbow, but he doesn\u2019t let me go. A few passersby move quickly away from the scene unfolding before them. \u201cI can\u2019t back out now. He announced it\u2014in front of everyone. I will fucking destroy Don and everyone else the MMAC throws at me. Fuck them all.\u201d</p><p>They exchange glances for a few seconds before Darryl retrieves his phone from his pocket and dials a number. Seth tugs me in close again, letting go of my hand and wrapping an arm around my waist. He pulls me away from Darryl and Jackson and we head outside.</p> <p>We don\u2019t say a word to each other, but he keeps me held firmly against his side up stairs, through corridors and in elevators\u2014all the way to the hotel room. He lets me go to unlock the door and he pushes it open. My heart hammers in my chest like a jackhammer to concrete and I\u2019m scared to go inside and be alone with him. I don\u2019t think I can handle another night like last night.</p><p>\u201cPlease go inside,\u201d he mutters, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p><p>His voice isn\u2019t harsh or commanding\u2014he seems sad\u2014broken. I step inside and I don\u2019t look back. I tap as fast as my heels will let me upstairs and into the shower. When I come out all fresh and revived, dressed in sweat pants and a tank top, I go back downstairs. The lights are dim and the bright neon of Vegas become obvious as they filter in through the large window. I hesitate on the last step when I see Seth sitting on the couch with his head in his hands. His back is to me\u2014the depressions are darkened by shadows of absent light. Swallowing my uncertainty, I push off the last step and move to the couch Seth has dragged over to the window. As I draw nearer to him, my sight catches all of the droplets of water on the surface of his skin. He used the shower downstairs to avoid me and what I have to say about the rematch with Don. I\u2019m not hurt. He needs space and I respect that.</p><p>Before I step around the arm of the couch, I hesitate, and out of pure nervousness, I clear my throat. He lifts his head from his hands and looks over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cI can go...\u201d I mumble uneasily, shifting my weight.</p><p>Seth flicks his head, gesturing for me to join him and I can\u2019t move quick enough. He slides across the couch to make room and when I sit down, he grabs me, pulling me to him, and with a flick of his hips, he flips me, pressing my back firmly into the couch. He slides his body between my legs and my muscles tense as he drops a heavy portion of his weight on top of me. His full lips press against mine and they melt together in a slow rhythm. When he pulls back, I ask, \u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p> <p>The bright pinks and yellows outside reflect in his dark eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go to the gym\u2014you don\u2019t have to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cWhen I look back on the night I proposed to my wife, I don\u2019t want to remember it like this. I want us to be happy and loving for now...the rest can wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I slide my fingers over his shoulders and down his arms, savoring the feel of his warm skin under my fingertips. As my hands come up his neck, I see my ring glisten in the light and my breath catches. How easy it is to forget how happy we were tonight before Matthew Somers and the mention of Don Russell destroyed it. Seth asked me to marry him and I said yes...I said yes.</p><p>\u201cWe can just lie here in silence and appreciate each other\u2019s company,\u201d he adds with a soft sigh.</p><p>Seth rests his head on my chest and watches the cars driving down the boulevard. His thumb glides back and forth over my hip, sending pulses of pleasurable energy through my stomach. I let my fingers move smoothly over his shoulder, up his neck, and into his hair. I can feel his muscles are tight and alert. I know he\u2019s playing calm and collected for my sake, to show me he can change, but I don\u2019t want him to change if it means wallowing in his own anger and poisoning himself with stress from the inside out.</p><p>I flex my hips and Seth lifts himself off of me. \u201cMaybe you should lie on the bottom,\u201d I suggest. \u201cI can see the news headline now; Fighter Falls Asleep and Crushes Fianc\u00e9e Under the Weight of his Body.\u201d</p><p>With a heart-stopping chuckle, we shift positions and Seth lies flat on his back with his hands tucked underneath his head. Whoa. If I had a dollar for every perfect muscle I see in his upper body alone I\u2019d be rich\u2014or Seth would be rich...because I\u2019d pay him to let me lick them. I slip my legs over his hips and unashamedly run my hands over his stomach, feeling every bump and tremor. I glance at his mouth and he smiles up at me. It\u2019s a genuine smile, one that makes all of my insides feel light and happy. I run the palms of my hands over his chest and onto his shoulders, no longer looking at his face. I focus on relaxing him and making him feel better about tonight. I can feel his intense eyes on me, watching me as I continue to caress him.</p> <p>\u201cYour hands feel nice,\u201d he mutters almost sleepily.</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>Under my fingertips, his muscles relax a fraction. \u201cMuch better. I like it when you take care of me.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward and plant a soft kiss on his nipple, gaining a small hum of approval. If I\u2019m going to be his wife, I need to learn how to take care of him properly. I need to step up and look after him, the way he deserves to be looked after.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of you forever,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>Seth doesn\u2019t say anything in return. I\u2019m not sure if he even heard it and that\u2019s okay. I never said it to get a response. I said it because I mean it and it eases the overwhelming bubble of excitement in my chest.</p><p>After a long while, my fingertips are numb and tingly, and I\u2019m unsure where his flesh ends and mine begins. I lie on him now and I rise up and down a fraction of an inch every time he breathes. Forty minutes ago, Seth removed my shirt and watched my breasts as I massaged him. It was thrilling, to say the least, and the urge to coax him into having sex with me was almost overwhelming, but I held my own and kept my cool. Just. If he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep, I\u2019m sure my resistance would have caved. It always does when he\u2019s around. With one last slow, pathetic stroke of his forearms, my hands give up and collapse on his skin. My eyelids are heavy, like they have tiny weights tethered to my eyelashes. I let them close and snuggle even closer into my sleeping Seth.</p><p>Starting tomorrow, he will dive into intense daily training sessions and have little to no time for me. Thankfully, Selena is here and I won\u2019t be totally alone...but despite her presence, however, I know Seth\u2019s two upcoming fights are going to linger over me like a dark cloud. I know Seth can take Junior, but I\u2019m worried his emotions are going to get the best of him when he fights Don. If Seth loses to Don, it will break him. I shake the thought from my head. Seth won\u2019t lose. He is the bright center of my universe...untouchable. Infallible. He can\u2019t lose.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>Seth</p><p>(Fight Night: Seth Marc vs Junior Moset)</p><p>A plastic chair slaps the concrete wall and I\u2019m brought back to my senses. Anxiety ripples through my body and I clench my fists as it rests in my chest and threatens to suffocate me. Where is she? I sent Darryl up to the hotel room half an hour ago to find her. Olivia wanted to wait until the very last minute to come down. These fighting things still make her nervous and I try my hardest to respect that, but without her here with me now I don\u2019t think I can make it through my warm up. I want to see her calming green eyes looking at me\u2014all caring and worried.</p><p>I flex my fingers and survey my bare fingers. They stick out from the thick material and I turn my hands palm down to assess the gloves. Across the top of my glove\u2014right over the padded knuckles\u2014it reads \u2018MMAC\u2019 in big white letters. I made it. I\u2019m here, ready for my professional debut...this fight, win or lose, will be remembered for the rest of my career. The first fights always are.</p><p>Being immortalized an amateur losing my first pro fight isn\u2019t the only thing eating at me, the crowd is, too. Tens of thousands of spectators all sitting and waiting for the main card fight. Junior is the crowd favorite\u2014something I\u2019ve known for weeks now. His pro record is nine to one, losing only to disqualification in his first fight by repeatedly grabbing the cage for added support. My professional record is zero both in wins and defeats. They don\u2019t care about my amateur record or that I\u2019ve had twenty-two official fights and haven\u2019t lost a single one. What counts is now. I need to win this fight\u2014and I will\u2014I just need to keep my head clear and in the game. One mistake and Junior can have me in an arm bar, or triangle lock\u2014or even a guillotine. I\u2019ve seen his fights. He knows exactly how to lock the submissions down and getting out of them is going to take more energy than it\u2019s worth.</p><p>The door swings open, drawing my attention. The rest of the team fades out and my sight focuses solely on my woman. When her gaze lands on me, the anxiety in my chest minutely lets up and I sigh a breath of relief. Even back then I couldn\u2019t pinpoint what it is about her that relaxes me so much...maybe it\u2019s because she\u2019s always so nervous I take it on myself to make her feel better. My team filters from the room and closes the door behind them. We\u2019ve done this enough times now that they know to leave us alone when she comes to see me. I can\u2019t have my whole team thinking I\u2019m weak. Only she is allowed to see that side of me. I brace my hands on the bench on either side of my open thighs as she strolls right up between them and places her hands half on my shoulders and half on my neck.</p><p>She looks absolutely amazing in a pair of classy black slacks and a stylish white sweater. No mini skirts. No tight tube dresses. Perfect.</p><p>A relaxing hum vibrates from her fingertips and creeps over my skin before seeping into my pores. Unintentionally, I bring my lips closer to hers and I stop myself just as they graze. Her breath hitches before she expels it nervously on my face.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being here,\u201d I mumble, looking deep into her eyes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were doing just fine before I came along.\u201d</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t. I was ready to throw in the towel, to give up fighting. Darryl knew it and Jackson knew it, too, but when I met Olivia, her passion and her fight ignited a spark in me I thought was long gone. She inspired me...and I think that\u2019s why I have to see her before a fight...because she gives me the motivation I need.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I say, playfully nudging her nose with mine.</p><p>Her fingers snake around the back of my neck and lock together as she pulls my forehead harder against hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to win,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win for me, or Darryl, or the MMAC. You\u2019re going to win for yourself because you put in the hard yards to get here.\u201d</p><p>There she goes again, always knowing the right things to say.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want to win?\u201d I ask, teasingly.</p><p>\u201cThen you better lose with a smile on your face.\u201d</p><p>I laugh under my breath. Fuck that. I\u2019m not losing to anybody, my pride won\u2019t let me.</p><p>The cold cement of the hallway floor makes my feet tingle as I march down the corridor. My hands clench into fists, unclench, and then clench again while I dance back and forth on the balls of my feet a few times. When I come to a stop behind double doors and after I read the MMAC\u2019s slogan\u2014\u2018Be strong. Be smart. Be great.\u2019 I tilt my head to the ceiling with my eyes closed, and blow out a long, slow breath. In both ears, Darryl and Jackson are talking to me\u2014giving me words of encouragement and helpful tips, but I don't hear them. My mind is elsewhere, focused on cages and crowds. In no time, the bass of Seth\u2019s intro song starts thumping through the sound system and the door in front of me opens. I flex my muscles from shoulders to thighs and I prowl out of the empty, slanted hallway and into the crowd, doing my best to seem as confident as ever.</p><p>People grab at me and I ignore them, focusing only on the empty, looming cage. I run my tongue over my guard to feel it securely in place as adrenaline shakes my body and boils my blood, sending it at light speed through my veins. I love this. My nerves are electrified, like I\u2019m sitting on the edge of a severe storm, praying not to get hit by the bolts of lightning that strike the ground next to me. As I approach the steps to the cage, a staff member of the MMAC checks my gloves and mouth guard while Darryl reaches around me and unzips my black hoodie. I shrug it off and bound up the stairs and into the cage. The roar of the crowd is so loud it\u2019s deafening, and I\u2019m absolutely floored by the amount of people who have come to see me and Junior fight. Never in a million years would I have thought people would flood an arena to see me fight. I run my bare fingers across the baked vinyl cage, doing a lap of the ring. When I run my hands over a certain part of the cage, I linger for a little while. I turn my head to the left and instantly pick Olivia out of the crowd. She\u2019s right at the front, sitting beautifully with her legs crossed and fingers in her mouth as she nervously chews her nails. She\u2019s focused on the floor as Selena talks in her ear, but when she looks up at me from underneath her thick, long lashes and sees me looking at her while I touch the spot I fucked her two weeks ago, her fingers fall from her mouth and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind her cheeks are heating up. Flashbacks flood me\u2014perfect pink nipples, sleek, wet pussy and swollen lips. I have half a mind to kick everyone out of the arena and drag her back up here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gives me a warning look, like she thinks someone here will know what we did and I smile...nobody will ever know what we did. She sticks her finger back into her mouth and I see her engagement ring glisten under the bright lights, the ring that I bought her\u2014the ring that took me six hours to pick out. How easily I forget we are no longer girlfriend and boyfriend\u2014that I promised the rest of my life to her...and she promised hers in return. To think it all happened right underneath my feet.</p><p>I continue my circle of the ring until I\u2019m back in my corner. Normally, I like to show off a little bit for the crowd, but tonight I want them to see that I mean business.</p><p>An unfamiliar song blasts over the speakers and the crowd goes nuts once again. A pang of anticipation courses through me and I turn my head to see Junior Moset thundering down the walkway with a wide smile on his face. He\u2019s used to this. This is his world that I\u2019m entering and I hate that it gives him an edge over me. Junior enters the ring and does his round before settling on the opposite side of the ring.</p> <p>\u201cRemember, try to keep it standing. Avoid going to the floor if you can and go for the knock out. It\u2019s your best bet,\u201d Jackson calls as the announcer speaks, introducing the referee and the fighters.</p><p>He sounds extremely confident in me, but little does he know, it\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s almost impossible to keep a ground fighter standing for the majority of the fight. When things get too fast, they go for the takedown. When they get stung, they go for the takedown. Hell, they even go for the takedown if they miss a hit. I\u2019m not going to be able to keep this standing for long...and I hope my ground game is good enough to prevent any devastating submissions.</p><p>Junior and I watch each other from opposite sides of the cage, and when the referee, Marty Quim, steps inside, the noise of the audience lessens. Junior crouches slightly, his nostrils flare out as he breathes heavily. I monitor the way his fists tighten as he raises them up in front of his body and awareness covers me. I know the purpose of every muscle in my body, and I position each one in preparation for what's to come. This is my element, too, I remind myself. This is my show.</p><p>My life.</p><p>My passion.</p> <p>And I will not fucking lose this.</p><p>\u201cJunior, are you ready?\u201d Quim shouts and Junior flicks his cocky, dark eyebrows at me.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, narrowing my eyes at Junior. He\u2019s a good guy, but tonight he\u2019s the only thing standing between me and the respect I deserve...which makes him my enemy. The bell rings and we push off from our corners and meet in the middle to touch gloves. As soon as our hands touch, we drop our stances and square off.</p><p>Powerful feelings envelope me and I waste no time in lashing out, swinging full force. It was never in our game plan to throw power punches right off the bat, but I wanted to gauge Junior\u2019s reaction time because once I find my flow, he\u2019s a fucking goner. He takes a couple quick steps back as my fists rain down on him. He brings his hands up to shield his face, but it\u2019s no use. I drop low and slam my knuckles into his ribs, listening to them force the air from his lungs. With every hit I land, I feel myself become more and more relaxed, no longer anxious. And because of that, I find myself moving quicker\u2014more confidently. Junior is no match for my strikes. He knows it too, and he dives for my legs to avoid my punches. I sprawl, wrapping my arms around his and shoving him off me. I step back as he jumps to his feet and brings his hands back to guard his face. Junior\u2019s brow is furrowed and I know he didn\u2019t expect me to be so aggressive. Rule number one, never underestimate me. Never underestimate my weaknesses because when I use them to fuel my strengths, you better look out. Junior comes in hot with quick jabs to the stomach. I drop my hands to protect my stomach\u2014both of them\u2014a rookie mistake and he clips me in the mouth. A searing pain splits my lip (in the exact same pace that\u2019s healing from Don\u2019s beating) and I taste blood. Junior backs off as I spit blood onto the canvas.</p> <p>\u201cLucky shot,\u201d I growl, bringing my fists back up and advancing on him. As if his impatience is running out, Junior begins to jab at me again from the right. I let two hit me and feign left as the third comes in. He switches his angle, like I expected, and I go right, striking Junior once, twice\u2014no\u2014three times in the ribs. Junior hunches and I grab his neck, bringing up my knee and driving it right into his chest. I hear the crowd go crazy and I know the quick pace of this fight is driving them insane. Junior counters as I bring my leg down and grabs me by the knee. He hooks his arm around it and twists, causing me to turn at an awkward angle and fall to the mat with a bang. I yank my ankle free and roll quickly, flipping myself up onto the balls of my feet as Junior\u2019s fist flies toward my face. At the last moment, I pivot, but it\u2019s not fast enough and Junior\u2019s knuckle clips the side of my head, sending a loud ring through my ear. I take a few steps back to clear my head and Junior doesn\u2019t waste a second and dives at me almost instantly. He grabs my legs and takes me down. I struggle against him, barely getting anywhere. He\u2019s a heavy bastard, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get caught!\u201d I hear Darryl shout. \u201cWatch your arms!\u201d</p><p>I clap my hands together and squeeze them tightly as Junior does his best to work them open and wrap himself around one of them. He moves his body up mine, getting the mount and trapping my arms underneath his weight. I grunt as I flick my hips in an attempt to get him off me, but it fails. I\u2019m in full guard position and I wrap my legs around him to prevent him from standing up. Somehow, he passes my guard and rises up. My whole body tenses as I see him lift his elbow before dropping it down on my chest. A groan releases itself from my throat as he does it again and again, drawing nearer to my face. I unclasp my hands and push against his chest. My chest aches from the force of the elbows he slammed into them and I grit my teeth into the mouth guard. He copies my movements, pushing down on my chest.</p><p>\u201cNo, Seth!\u201d I hear Jackson yell and I feel Junior shift on me. Oh shit! His leg swings over my face as he twists his body. Shit! He grabs my arm and drops himself backwards, straightening my arm out until it bends in the opposite direction. I clench my jaw as pain shoots up my forearm and into my elbow. Junior pulls harder and I growl out loud.</p><p>\u201cHold it! Three!\u201d I hear Darryl scream. \u201cTwo!\u201d</p><p>A second later, the bell dings and the pressure subsides. Junior slips away from me and jogs over to his corner. What the fuck? I blink a few times, still lying on the floor, dazed. He almost beat me. I shake my head and climb to my feet. I shake and squeeze my elbow. It feels bruised and tense...he almost had me with a goddamn arm bar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Darryl says as I drop onto my stool. \u201cThe next round is yours.\u201d</p><p>Darryl and Jackson are in my face. I try to focus on what they\u2019re saying, but my heart pounds loudly in my ears. That was too fucking close. He almost had me and he would have if the bell hadn\u2019t gone off.</p> <p>\u201cWater,\u201d I demand and Jackson hands it to me.</p><p>I suck down a mouthful of water and swish it around my dry mouth before swallowing it. Darryl goes over our game plan in detail, but I\u2019m way too worked up to listen. Instinctively, I glance over my shoulder and seek her out. Olivia\u2019s wide green eyes peer at me through the gaps in her fingers. Her long, chocolate hair is messy and disheveled, like she\u2019s run her fingers through it, and even with her hands guarding most of her face, I can tell she\u2019s worried for me and I have to change that. The next round is mine.</p><p>I will not lose. Not today.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Olivia</p><p>I suck in a sharp breath but I don't cry out like I want to. Every cell in my body presses against my skin, urging me out of my chair and towards him. Every atom that I\u2019m composed of demands I protect my fianc\u00e9...and yet I remain in my seat, silent and obsessed, watching his every muscle spasm, lip twitch, and every clench of his jaw as Junior straightens his arm out. I\u2019m on the edge of my seat, absorbing all of the energy and anxiety inside the massive arena into my tiny body. I\u2019d chew my nails if I hadn\u2019t already chewed them to the bone. C\u2019mon, Seth, tap out. I don\u2019t care if he loses, but I care if he gets hurt. I see Seth\u2019s elbow begin to bend in the other direction and the pain on his face sends a sharp arrow of panic into my chest. Anxious sweat begins to bead on my skin and I rake my fingers through my hair. I witness exactly four more seconds of Seth\u2019s pain before I can\u2019t take it anymore and I shield my face with my hands.</p><p>The bell rings and I peer through my fingers.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell!\u201d Selena giggles, practically bouncing in her seat. \u201cThat was so fucking close!\u201d</p><p>She rocks her bony shoulder into mine and I jerk to the side, ignoring her. Jackson has a stool down in Seth\u2019s corner before the bell stops its annoying chime, but Seth remains on the floor\u2014dazed. Like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still in the fight. He shakes it off and climbs to his feet and stalks towards his team before dropping onto his stool. While Darryl talks, Jackson checks his body and hands him a water bottle. Seth takes a quick mouthful of the water and glances over his shoulder at me. I heat up under his gaze and I can\u2019t pinpoint what he\u2019s thinking, exactly. Jackson slaps a bag of ice down on his shoulders and Seth barely flinches at it. I look over at Junior\u2019s team and they seem really happy with the first round...there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that he won it. Seth needs to finish this before it goes to the judges. He\u2019s already lost one round.</p><p>The stools are pulled away and the teammates leave the ring.</p><p>Ding.</p><p>Round two begins.</p><p>Anticipation crackles through me, setting my blood alight. I lean my elbows on my knees and press the tips of my fingers to my forehead.</p><p>They circle each other watching, waiting for an opening. Junior is the first to break and lashes out with a hard kick. Seth grabs his ankle and yanks Junior off balance, pulling his leg past his torso and then launching forward and punching him straight in the nose. Blood gushes almost instantly and I suddenly feel under the weather. Dread swirls in my stomach, mixing with the nausea and I sink in to myself. Why do I do this to myself?</p><p>Junior wipes his nose with the back of his glove, but never drops his hand. He swings at Seth, but Seth ducks and lunges toward Junior. He grasps his neck with his left hand and begins delivering a series of devastating punches to Junior\u2019s stomach. Junior attempts to bring his knees up to protect his torso, but fails and Seth drives him back until he\u2019s pressed against the cage. Seth\u2019s eyebrows are drawn together, his lips parted in an aggressive way, exposing his white mouth guard. My eyes begin to sting and are screaming at me to blink, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to miss a second of this fight.</p><p>With a second wind, Junior drops low and rushes at Seth with a vengeance. His thick, tattooed arms wrap around Seth\u2019s legs and they both hit the canvas with a slap. There\u2019s a flurry of fists and legs before Seth rolls quickly, coming to rest on top of Junior. Junior blocks his head as Seth starts to rain heavy punches and elbows down on him. The referee gets in close, ready to call the fight in Seth\u2019s favor as a result of a TKO at any second. Jackson and Darryl are yelling directions at him and urging him to keep going. The crowd is so loud I can't make out their exact words, but when I look over at Junior\u2019s corner, I see the look of panic in his team\u2019s eyes. They don\u2019t want an experienced fighter like Junior Moset to lose to an amateur like Seth. I almost smile. They were wrong to ever underestimate my man. Seth is fierce and fast, like a train. When he reaches full speed, he\u2019s unstoppable and you better get out of the way. With terrifying speed, he hits Junior over and over and over again. When Junior blocks his face, Seth drops his fists to his stomach. He hits him with wild abandon, showing no finesse, no rhythm to his strikes. He wants to win and he wants to win in the most devastating way possible. I shiver, glancing away from Seth as he dominates Junior. I don\u2019t think Junior is going to have much of a face after this. Seth\u2019s chest rises and falls rapidly, like he\u2019s run a marathon and a half. It\u2019s splattered with his opponent\u2019s blood and I watch as the crimson dots glisten under the bright lights. Seth draws his arm back and Junior refuses to block it, he lies there breathing heavily, waiting for the ref to call it. Before he strikes Junior one last time, his eyes flick to me and my heart whams against my ribs. His dark eyes linger on me, waiting for me to do something. I realize I\u2019m shaking my head at him...because I understand what he wants. He\u2019s asking my permission to hit Junior one more time\u2014a defenseless, injured Junior\u2014and I shake my head because it\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s already given up. With a swift nod, Seth swings a leg over Junior\u2019s head, grabs his arm and falls backward. Junior doesn\u2019t tap out at first, but when Seth flicks his hips, Junior slaps the canvas so hard the spectators in the back can probably hear it.</p><p>The referee calls the fight and the crowd goes mental with cheers and screams. Selena undoubtedly squeals the loudest and pulls me to my feet. Her arms surround me and she shakes me from side to side. I can\u2019t do much with my arms forced down against my sides, so I glance back to the ring. The ring is suddenly filled with press and teammates and reporters. I can\u2019t see Seth at all and I\u2019m probably not going to for a while.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for them back in the locker room.\u201d Selena smiles, hooking her arm around mine and dragging me from my row.</p><p>I let her lead me because my body is still in shock. What a flip around...I bet everyone thought Junior was going to take that one. Not to mention Seth...and the look on his face when he was absolutely dominating Junior. Pure hunger. He wanted to win, and he did. He certainly did.</p><p>Selena and I jump as the room door swings open and crashes into the concrete wall. Whoops and cheers fill the otherwise silent room as loads of people fill it to the brim. Selena leaves my side the second Jackson makes himself present, but I decide to linger in the background on the couch. I\u2019m sitting on my hands to stop the excited, anxious energy that still flowed through me. Will I ever get used to this lifestyle? I don\u2019t like feeling like this, like I\u2019m on the edge of a panic attack, but on cloud nine as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won.\u201d His rough, tired voice hits me and clings to my skin. As a result, goosebumps form. I look up at him from underneath my eyelashes and I unashamedly let my eyes drag up his slim waist and broad shoulders\u2014even covered in someone else\u2019s blood, he makes liquid pool between my legs.</p><p>\u201cI saw.\u201d I can\u2019t help the smile that pulls at the corner of my lips.</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p> <p>I frown. My over-heated body tells me to nod, but my over-caring brain tells me to shake my head. \u201cHe started bleeding...\u201d</p><p>Seth glances down at his blood-speckled body. \u201cI think I know that better than anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it?\u201d I ask, slipping across on the couch, subtly inviting him to sit down.</p><p>He drops onto the couch and his gloveless hands reach out to me. They grip my sweater and he pulls me close to his damp body. I grip his hard forearms for stability as my body presses against his. Blood from his skin soaks into the white fabric, but I\u2019m too captivated by his raw power to care. I swallow hard as my gaze falls to his split lip.</p><p>\u201cDo I give you the answer you want, or do I tell you the truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways the truth.\u201d</p><p>My eyes lock onto his lips and I follow them all the way to my cheek before they disappear into my hair\u2014right by my ear. \u201cI fucking loved it.\u201d</p><p>The rumble from his chest vibrates down my spine and into my core, threatening to shake me to my foundations.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I whisper back to him.</p><p>\u201cTo feel someone break under your control is addicting, to overpower someone who desperately wants to overpower you is thrilling, and to destroy someone who thinks they\u2019re better than you is satisfying.\u201d</p><p>I fight the urge to roll my eyes. All of this, everything he puts himself through, is only to prove that he is the best at what he does? Will I ever understand man logic?</p> <p>\u201cYou do it all to be number one?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cWell, I sure as hell won\u2019t settle for second best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoooo!\u201d Jackson hollers, interrupting Seth and I. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit the town hard tonight, ladies and gentlemen. You keen?\u201d</p><p>I practically recoil from his words. No way in hell am I going out tonight. I\u2019m done with clubs and alcohol, for good. Well, I\u2019m done with clubs, anyway. Alcohol, I might do a few more times.</p><p>Like at my wedding.</p><p>My wedding!</p><p>I purse my lips against \u2018squeeing\u2019 out loud. I jump, completely pulled from thoughts of my possible wedding dress as Seth slaps his hand down on my thigh and squeezes me.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to go out?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve had more than enough...excitement\u201d\u2014his eyes flare\u2014\u201cfor one night.\u201d</p><p>Seth looks up at Jackson. \u201cSorry, man. We\u2019re going straight home.\u201d</p><p>Jackson blinks a few times. And then a few times more. \u201cI get that she wants to stay home, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going to let you stay home.\u201d</p><p>Selena shakes her head at me, all while smiling like I\u2019m the most interesting specimen on the planet.</p><p>\u201cYou won your first professional fight, man. Come with me tonight, have some fun and we\u2019ll get back into training tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nudge Seth\u2019s knee with mine. \u201cGo, have fun. I\u2019ll still be here when you get home.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes roam me and I see the cog wheels in his eyes as he decides his next move. Deep down, I\u2019m secretly hoping he takes Jackson up on his offer. Finishing the book I\u2019m reading and getting a full night\u2019s sleep is exactly what the doctor ordered.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Seth exhales. \u201cI\u2019ll come out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome!\u201d Jackson whips around on his heel and dives into the madness of the excited teammates and over the other side to Darryl. Selena drops onto the couch next to me.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to come out?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI need sleep.\u201d</p><p>She pouts. \u201cWe won\u2019t go to any strip clubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip clubs or no strip clubs, I want to shower, read my book, and go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Selena rolls her eyes and leans forward on her elbows. \u201cYou picked a real badass here, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiles a warm smile, eliciting one in return from me. And out of nowhere, he shoots forward, planting his lips on mine. I wrap my arms around his neck without thought and urge him harder against me.</p><p>Behind me, Selena groans and I feel pressure lift off the chair. \u201cYou two are dirty.\u201d</p><p>I smile, not only because that\u2019s awfully rich coming from her, but because we are dirty and there\u2019s no one else in the world I\u2019d rather be dirty with. Only Seth. Only the man who helped me put an end to my dead end relationship, supported me during the sudden passing of my father, and took me higher than any rocket ever could. I love him and every dirty array of public affection he gives me, and if that means I\u2019m dirty...then I never, ever want to be clean.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Seth</p><p>I draw my fourth whiskey and Coke to my lips. I swear each swallow rests not in my stomach, but on my eyelids, making them heavier. I stand at the over-crowded bar, away from Jackson and Selena\u2019s make out session. Now I know how they feel when I attack Olivia in front of them. Still, I\u2019m not going to stop. I kiss Olivia whenever the hell I feel like kissing her and I guess Jackson is the same. A loud eruption of laughter explodes from my table and I glance over my shoulder. Darryl shifts in his chair and tugs on his white button up shirt, as if he\u2019s trying to loosen it. He\u2019s having fun and it\u2019s just as much his and Jackson\u2019s night as it is mine. I turn from the bar and my head spins a little. I smile. I haven\u2019t felt this good in a while and the three shots I took before my whiskeys are just starting to settle in. This whiskey will definitely have to be my last one.</p><p>I walk towards the table, holding my drink low. About ten feet away, I\u2019m stopped in my tracks by a short woman and my eyes automatically zero in on her huge fake tits that protrude out of her tight, red tube dress.</p><p>\u201cHey, you,\u201d she purrs. \u201cRemember me?\u201d</p><p>Fuck, she knows who I am, but I\u2019ve never seen her before. I lift my gaze to her bright, cherry red lips and finally a pair of bright blue eyes masked by too much smoky makeup. Her small hands run over my chest and down my biceps, feeling as much of me as she could. Normally, (and by normally I mean before Olivia) I\u2019d probably take this girl home\u2014I\u2019m not an idiot, she\u2019s gorgeous in that fake kind of way. Unfortunately for her, there\u2019s only one pair of thighs I\u2019d like to slide between tonight and every other night for the rest of my life.</p><p>\u201cI was wondering when I was going to run into you again,\u201d she adds, squeezing me for extra measure.</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d I chuckle nervously. \u201cLook, Samantha-\u201d</p><p>Her drawn on eyebrows pull in close. \u201cNicole.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cNicole...\u201dIt still doesn\u2019t ring any bells. \u201cRight. Listen, I\u2019m only here for a drink with my friends.\u201d</p><p>Her hands glide back up my arms and down my chest before curling around the hem of my jeans. I analyze her for a moment, trying to link her face to her name...I can\u2019t. Instead, I\u2019m distracted by the way she looks. There was once a time I was into that whole \u2018porn star\u2019 look...I can\u2019t say it does too much for me now. Her index finger sweeps a little too low and I snatch her wrists with my free hand and move them away from my body. Even in the dim club, I see her eyes flare. She likes the challenge. Nicole shrugs out of my grasp and inches closer, making me more frustrated than aroused. I\u2019ve been trying to be a better person for Olivia, in terms of my promiscuity, and right now I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong. It\u2019s a feeling that twists at my stomach, I hate it and this woman is testing my patience.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your team can wait...come with me. I won\u2019t take up too much of your time. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Nicole rakes her teeth over her bottom lip and I sigh. Not out of defeat, but out of boredom. I\u2019ve had girls of every kind and every shape\u2014more than I\u2019m willing to admit\u2014and this girl is attractive, but I\u2019m not going to risk my relationship with Olivia for her. Let\u2019s be honest for a second, how good is this girl in bed really if I couldn\u2019t even remember her name or her face?</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I have a girl at home who takes care of all my needs.\u201d With a tight smile, I attempt to step past her, but she sidesteps and blocks me. I clench my glass tighter and expel a gust of air through my nose.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I can make you forget all about her.\u201d</p><p>Nicole\u2019s words strike a chord inside me and I narrow my eyes at her. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that her over-used mouth can show me a good time. She can probably suck my dick well and have me coming in minutes, but I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want her. Nicole touches me again. Her long fingernails slowly stroking a silver button on my steel grey shirt. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d</p><p>She really doesn\u2019t want to know what I have to say. I grit my teeth together against a copious amount of bad names and hurtful words. \u201cI say you try your luck elsewhere, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She steps closer, her body almost pressing against mine. The distinct smell of cigarette being masked by an expensive cherry perfume has my nose twitching. \u201cSorry, darling. I\u2019m after a ten tonight, nothing less.\u201d</p><p>And here I was thinking only men rated women on a scale of one to ten. I lower my head to her ear and as my breath blows over her skin, I hear her breath catch.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fall away from me and I\u2019m finally able to push past her. I don\u2019t dare look over my shoulder for fear of inviting her into my personal space again. I saunter over to the table and drop into an empty seat. Darryl and the rest of the team have left, leaving me alone with Selena and Jackson.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d Selena asked.</p><p>I look up at her and she\u2019s trying really hard to be calm, but I can see the anger in her posture. Her arms are crossed tightly across her chest, covering the cut out that exposed the majority of her breasts. I\u2019m sure if this were a manga cartoon, she\u2019d have one of those little exasperated squiggles on her forehead. I smile at the thought.</p><p>\u201cNobody.\u201d I\u2019m not sharing shit with Selena. She talks way too much and Olivia doesn\u2019t need to hear about this. Not because I\u2019ve done anything wrong, but because what happened in the past (if it happened in the past) needs to stay in the past. I can\u2019t confirm nor deny if I had sex with that girl. I don\u2019t remember her face and I know it makes me look like a total asshole\u2014believe me\u2014I feel like it, but it is what it is. I won\u2019t take full blame for being a using asshole, though. They let me use them and on most occasions they approached me for sex. I merely took what was offered. Sue me.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look like nobody to me. You two seemed pretty comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Jackson groans. \u201cSelena, let it go. He didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she ignores Jackson\u2019s advice. \u201cAnd she keeps looking over at you from the bar.\u201d</p><p>I draw my cup to my lips and take a long sip. Selena grows more agitated with every second I don\u2019t respond. When she\u2019s fully arched up, I lower my cup and speak.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a free country. She can look at me all she likes, and as long as she doesn\u2019t touch, I\u2019m sure Olivia won\u2019t mind.\u201d I place my glass on the table. \u201cLike Jackson said, I did nothing wrong. I turned down an invitation for sex, yet you\u2019re looking at me like I had a quickie in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking at you like anything. I\u2019m just worried for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d I interrupt, letting my frustration get the best of me. \u201cLet me worry about Olivia. I look after her better than you ever did.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen and she takes offense to what I said by scoffing at me. She angles her body towards Jackson, waiting for him to defend her; instead, he looks at her and shrugs his shoulders. With another scoff, Selena flicks her curly blonde hair over her shoulder and sits back in her seat, crossing her legs as tightly as her crossed arms. Jackson leans forward in his seat, resting his elbows on his jean-clad knees and his seedy, drunk gaze rolls onto me.</p><p>\u201cTo the bar?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, wanting an excuse to get away from Selena\u2019s condemning glare. She takes a long, hard gulp of her beer before pulling out her cellphone. I contemplate demanding her to tell me what she\u2019s doing, but I let it go. I have done nothing wrong tonight and overreacting will only make it seem like I\u2019m guilty. The only thing I\u2019m guilty of is never wanting to see Olivia hurt or doubt that I\u2019m faithful to her.</p><p>I push off of my chair, abandoning my current drink. At the bar, Jackson hands me another beer and I hesitate for a second before I take it and bring it to my lips. I know I should stop. The more I drink the more I lash out...and Selena has already got on my nerves once tonight. I have so much pent up inside me that I want to say to her\u2014that I want to blame her for\u2014and I don\u2019t think Olivia or Jackson will appreciate it if I let it all out. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a nice way of calling someone a mess...I grin into my beer bottle right before I take a long sip. I can\u2019t wrap my head around Selena. She\u2019s this out of control woman who has no goals in life and only aspires to drag people down with her. I suppose she has to have some other side to her that no one sees. Why else would Jackson stick around? I know for a fact he likes easy going, submissive girls. He likes girls that can break easily and cave at his every whim, and Selena doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of person. She\u2019s too stubborn and bitchy to go along with Jackson\u2019s shit. Then again, who knows who Jackson and Selena really are? They both seem to have lots of hidden shit they keep to themselves. Jackson with his ex-bitch-whore and Selena with her dad\u2014or whatever, her story still remains a mystery to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Selena,\u201d he tells me. \u201cYou know how she is about Olivia.\u201d Jackson rolls his eyes and pulls at the blue collar of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cFor someone who claims to be so protective of her, she sure put Olivia in some shit situations.\u201d</p><p>He takes a sip of his beer. \u201cYeah, but Selena is her best friend. They\u2019re allowed to do stupid shit and make bad decisions. Fuck, we did\u2014we still do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Olivia is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman. I know you love her and you\u2019re getting married and all of that crazy shit, but she\u2019s still human. She\u2019s curious, and impulsive and known to make bad decisions at times, but she has history with Selena. They grew up together and they\u2019re best friends. Don\u2019t belittle Selena because you see her as a threat.\u201d</p><p>A threat? I don\u2019t see Selena as a threat, do I? No. Selena is not a threat...she\u2019s just trouble. I\u2019d never do anything to force Selena and O apart, but Selena needs to realize that I\u2019m not going to step to the side and let her force Olivia into stupid situations\u2014and she also needs to realize that I\u2019m not like Blade. I appreciate what I have. I know Olivia is one in a million and I wouldn\u2019t fuck that up, not even for all of the cherry-lipped, big breasted women in the world. Trading someone you love for something you lust is like trading a grilled chicken salad for a bag of potato chips. Sure, they taste good while you\u2019re eating them, but when it\u2019s finished, you feel sick and you\u2019re still hungry. Meanwhile, the guy with the chicken salad is satisfied, he feels good, and he\u2019s nourishing his body with real nutrients. Blade took his chicken salad and traded it for a bag of chips because he\u2019s a fucking idiot. Now, I have the salad and I won\u2019t trade it for anything\u2014chips, cake, chocolate or otherwise. If only Selena would stop trying to convince herself that I\u2019m scouting for chips.</p><p>I slam the last of my third\u2014fourth? \u201cSecond.\u201d I say out loud in an awkward, kind of slurry tone. \u201cNow I remember. This is my second beer.\u201d</p><p>Jackson chuckles as my head violently rolls. \u201cFive. You\u2019ve had five beers, mate.\u201d</p> <p>Either I\u2019m hearing things, or Jackson\u2019s voice is slurred, too. Fuuuuck. I need to go home. Selena appears at Jackson\u2019s side and she wraps an arm around his waist. He leans a lot of his weight on her and she groans under the pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s seven beers for the both of you. Time to go.\u201d</p><p>Selena stumbles with Jackson across the club floor. I look around...the club has wound down and only handfuls of people litter the room instead of throngs. I follow behind the others, proud with how straight I\u2019m walking. In front of Selena and Jackson, Darryl is being carried out by another one of my teammates\u2014Aaron, our towel guy. Compared to them, I must look sober and when I think about it, I\u2019m not that drunk, just heavily tipsy.</p><p>I snap my attention to the left as a heavy arm hooks around mine. I glance down, only to see Nicole, hanging off my arm. \u201cLeaving so soon, honey?\u201d</p><p>I feel my body sag into itself. How\u2019d I not see this coming? I was hoping she left hours ago.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s place, mine or yours?\u201d</p><p>I free my arm from hers and stop walking. I\u2019m too tired for this shit now. My eyes are heavy, I can barely keep them open and my head is dangerously close to toppling off my neck.</p> <p>\u201cI am going home to my fianc\u00e9e, alone.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. I\u2019m not going to get out of this, am I? \u201cSeth Marc, settling down. When we met, you didn\u2019t even ask for my name and now you\u2019re settling down.\u201d She shakes her head and sighs. \u201cHow ironic. Anyway, it\u2019s almost morning and I live the next street over. Go home to the other woman in the morning. She doesn\u2019t have to know.\u201d</p><p>In front of, us Selena snaps around, leaving Jackson to keep his balance on his own.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear him? He said he has a fianc\u00e9e.\u201d The growl in Selena\u2019s voice triggers Jackson and puts him on edge. He sobers and grabs her wrist, holding it tightly. Selena isn\u2019t exactly a \u2018let\u2019s talk it out\u2019 kind of girl, apparently, and I\u2019m way too tired and tipsy to break up a cat fight.</p><p>Nicole smiles. \u201cYou say that like it means anything in Vegas.\u201d She turns her gaze on me. \u201cLast chance, baby, come home with me.\u201d</p><p>Selena steps forward with a grunt, but Jackson pulls her back. \u201cSelena, stop,\u201d he orders and she stills in her movements, but her eyes never leave Nicole\u2019s face.</p><p>I have to deal with this, not Selena. I\u2019ve given this woman a few chances to walk away unhurt, but now I have to take matters into my own hands. If she wants a straight out, curt, brutal answer, she\u2019s going to get one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go home with you,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you and I don\u2019t remember a goddamn thing about you. Sure, I could go home with you now, have sex and leave, but I guarantee I\u2019d forget you\u2014again\u2014by lunch time tomorrow.\u201d Her lips part and she narrows her eyes at me in an ugly scowl. \u201cI\u2019d much rather go home to the girl that I love. A girl that could be standing naked in a pitch-black room and I\u2019d still be able to kiss every single freckle in their exact location going off my memory alone.\u201d She shifts her posture and I hear Selena snicker under her breath. \u201cYou are forgettable because you\u2019re like everyone else and the girl I\u2019m going home to, isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Not waiting for a response or a reaction, I walk off, passing Selena and Jackson and ending up outside in the cool desert air. The bouncer slaps my back on the way out and murmurs words of congratulations that I don\u2019t hear. I just want to go home. I\u2019ve spoken to enough people and I\u2019ve done enough interviews for one day. Not to mention all of the interviews and talk shows I have to do the next two weeks leading up to my fight with Don. Selena busts out of the door after me, squealing like a baby pig. I cringe and watch her as she runs towards me and flings her arms around my neck.</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d She laughs, squeezing me.</p><p>I pat her back and frown at Jackson, who smiles widely walking out of the club.</p><p>She lets go and steps back. \u201cI believe that you really do love Olivia and all doubts I had are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, now I can breathe a little easier because this whole marriage thing depended purely on what you thought.\u201d I try to keep my face serious, but I fail and smile. Selena rolls her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I tell her. \u201cNow let\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>Right on cue, a taxi pulls up and Aaron drags Darryl\u2019s heavy, alcohol-filled body over to it. I open the door then Aaron stuffs him inside and climbs in after him. I don\u2019t know how, but all four of us managed to fit inside and I think I fell asleep against Selena\u2019s shoulder...the next thing I remember is her poking my head with an awkwardly twisted hand and looking at me like I\u2019m meant to be doing something.</p><p>\u201cOpen the door,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other one is broken.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Aaron, who holds Darryl as far away from him as he can. Darryl is curled up against the far door with his mouth open as he drools onto his own shoulder. Classy. I laugh at him while Jackson fumbles into his jean pockets for his phone. He opens his camera and takes snapshot of Darryl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saving that for later,\u201d Jackson slurs, zooming in on Darryl\u2019s face.</p><p>I open the door and practically fall from the car. I draw myself to full height and I don\u2019t wait for the others as I stumble through the lobby of the MGM and into a random elevator. I don\u2019t pay any attention to my surroundings. My brain is too mushy to absorb any of the details and after twenty minutes of strolling around, I finally make it to my door. I reach into my back pocket and the only thing that touches my fingers is the denim fabric. It\u2019s empty. Shit. I left my key card inside on the coffee table. I bang my head softly against the door...What the hell am I going to do? I didn\u2019t plan on waking Olivia up when I came home and I was even going to sleep on the couch. The wood collides with my numb head a few more times as I bang it quietly against the timber. Minutes later, when I look around the hallway for a comfortable spot to fall asleep, the door to our room opens. My eyes drag up her bare legs, over a pink see-through sleep dress thing and settle on two nipples barely hidden by the sheer fabric. The visions soak into my eyes and drips down my insides, pooling right between my legs. I want to peel it off with my teeth.</p><p>\u201cSeth? Where\u2019s your keycard?\u201d She yawns, husky from sleep.</p><p>I force my eyes up to her face and she swats a stray strand of chocolate colored hair away from her cheek.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>Stutter. I almost fucking stutter at my wife-to-be because she\u2019s wearing a see-through babydoll. What am I, sixteen?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean to wake me? You were banging pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>Was I? Maybe I\u2019m drunker than I thought. Forgetting everything at the words banging and hard that fell from her lips, I launch at her and force her back into the room. I kick the door shut as my arms wrap around her waist and I draw her into me. I have her face in my hands and I pull her mouth to mine. The taste of her mouth brings my dick to a painful point of confinement in my jeans. She wraps her arms around my waist, hanging on for dear life as my mouth molds to her. Her touch sends a streak of fire through me as she parts her lips to my kiss and our tongues rush to meet. Just as abruptly as I started it, I break the kiss, holding Olivia\u2019s flustered face inches from my own, drilling her with my stare.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d I breathe, desperate to feel her warmth engulf me. \u201cMake me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already mine,\u201d she points out and I shake my head.</p><p>I want to her to claim me so hard other girls can smell her on me. \u201cYou have to prove it over and over for the rest of our lives. I want to be reminded. Every time I forget, claim me back, just like I would for you.\u201d</p><p>She gulps deep, slow breaths and the seconds begin to feel like small eternities. Without an answer, she slowly, deliberately, rises up on tip-toe to capture my lips. A low groan comes from deep in my throat, and my hands touch her everywhere at once, popping the dainty buttons on her babydoll, freeing her breasts from the fabric, lifting the dress over my hips and tearing her flimsy underwear from her body. How many panties do I have to go through before she gets the picture? Maybe I should put up a sign. \u2018This house is a panty free zone.\u2019</p><p>Olivia yanks my shirt open, destroying the buttons on my clothes for a change. The heavy buttons drop to the floor with little plops as her fingertips lightly tease the hot skin of my stomach, my hips, and then skilfully divesting my belt, and opening my button fly.</p><p>My mouth joins my hands in the endeavor to touch every inch of her skin and a violent shudder tears through her body .My mouth is at her neck, her lips\u2014her eyelids in a heart beat, and I grip her elbows and draw her back with me, until my calves hit the couch and I fall into the seat, dragging her down onto my lap. Olivia\u2019s legs straddle me, her warm strong thighs above mine as our kisses grow wild and bruising. My hands engulf her breasts and the feel of her smooth, milky skin causes a light layer of goosebumps to erupt over me. I lay kisses down her throat to the swell of her breasts. Above me, I can feel the hot, silky smoothness of her center brushing against my shaft. The tip of my dick is wet with pre-cum and Olivia raises herself up slightly, maneuvering her opening over my crystal-hard erection. As the warmth of her creases graze my eager tip, our frenzied movements halt and we freeze, both caught in the other\u2019s gaze. She looks at me differently than she ever has before...there\u2019s no soft, gentle look to her, only the fierce arousal her lust-filled lids revealed and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m mimicking it. My hands grip her hips and I harshly thrust up, forcing Olivia to plunge down. She lets out a strangled moan and I cup the back of her head, fastening my mouth over hers to swallow the sounds of pleasure she\u2019s making. She feels amazing, so tight and ready for me, that I have to be careful not to come right now.</p><p>\u201cRide me,\u201d I demand, stilling my hips and letting her take control.</p><p>She gasps and her breath is steamy as it skirts across my jaw. Her walls flutter and clench around me.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I moan, letting my head roll back against the couch. \u201cSqueeze me again.\u201d Her legs twitch around me as her pussy clenches and she rises up and sinks back down on me.</p><p>Squeeze, relax, Squeeze, relax. Heat coils in my stomach and rolls through my body in perfectly timed waves. I grip her hips harder, she knows just how to bring me over the edge, how to use her body to make me come for her\u2014and she gets better at it every time we fuck. Olivia begins to lose her rhythm, as her walls tighten and she draws nearer to orgasm. I love it. I love that I have the power to make her lose control.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to come?\u201d I ask and she bites down on her bottom lip, nodding profusely.</p><p>\u201cSo fucking hard,\u201d she squeezes out.</p><p>I push her off of me, laying her on her back on the couch. Her legs surround my waist and she pushes herself up on her elbows to get closer to my mouth. Her wetness flows on my cock and I slip in and out with ease. Olivia makes a high moaning noise in the base of her throat and against my lips before she drops against the couch, arching her back.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d she gasps in warning. \u201cSeth...Seth...\u201d My name comes out in heavy pants and not a second later, her pussy clamps down on my thick cock. I pump her harder and faster as everything tightens inside me. The pressure in my groin builds up to absurdly high levels and my head fills with white noise as I reach my limit and sail over the edge, groaning and flooding her with hot, sticky fluid. My arms tremble under my weight as I hold myself above her and I give in, lowering myself onto her chest. Olivia wraps her tired arms around me and she kisses my damp forehead. I angle my head down to hers and she slowly lifts her mouth to meet mine. She explores my mouth lazily with her lips and tongue, and I threaten to fall asleep while she does it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I mutter, pulling away.</p><p>She lets her fingers trail down the side of my neck. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m proud of myself for not being as rough with her as my body and my mind wanted to be. I close my eyes, completely at peace. This is the most peace I will feel until after I defeat Don. The next two weeks are going to fly by in a blur. They\u2019ll bring me nothing new, but after the fight, my world will change\u2014for better or for worse...</p> <p>And I\u2019m praying to God\u2014or whoever is fucking listening\u2014that Don is finally pushed out of my life.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Olivia</p><p>Four weeks. I\u2019ve been in Vegas four weeks and yet, I feel like I\u2019ve only been here a couple of days. Everything has gone so fast, it\u2019s like I blinked and whole days are missing. Nothing big has happened over the course of the four weeks, besides Seth proposing to me and winning his first professional fight. This fight, the one with Don tonight, is the first time in MMAC history that a professional MMA fighter will fight an amateur fighter in an arena of this scale. Mandalay Bay...I glance around the large arena. It seats twelve thousand people and I\u2019m sure every seat is taken to watch the rematch between the two rivals. The air is heavy with anticipation. I can hear the laughs and giggles of spectators in my row. It crackles along the seats and vibrates my body. I\u2019m not excited\u2014not like everyone else is. There\u2019s a flush of heat that pulses through me with every bout of nausea and my chest tightens anxiously.</p><p>Selena sticks a bag of chips under my nose and I recoil away from it with a shake of my head. The thought of eating right now churns my already violent stomach. The chair next to me shakes as a large man drops himself down next to me. I\u2019ve never seen him before, but he\u2019s wearing a black shirt that reads \u2018DON\u2019 and I decide, rather quickly, that I don\u2019t like him. Anyone who would root for someone like Don is an idiot. I look down at my own shirt and smirk. I\u2019m happy I packed my \u2018SETH\u2019 shirt. I haven\u2019t worn it since his first fight in Portland, Maine and I figured he\u2019ll like seeing it on me again. It might ease some of his anxiety, considering I couldn\u2019t see him before this fight.</p> <p>Darryl wants Seth to be wound up and on edge for this fight. Don\u2019t ask me why, I have no idea. None of them share any of their thoughts about the fights with me, which I didn\u2019t particularly mind, until tonight. Seth contested Darryl, refusing to leave his locker room until I came in, but Darryl still sent me away. He knows Seth won\u2019t forfeit a match with Don Russell and he wanted to \u2018kick it old school,\u2019 having Seth wind down with boxing bags and skipping ropes...in order to warm up before the fight. If that makes sense...it doesn\u2019t really make much sense to me, but I went along with it, regardless. I zone out as the announcer beings to speak, but the second a familiar beat begins to play, my body forces me to tune back in.</p><p>My blood bubbles and pulses through my body to the beat of the music and I subtly squeeze my sweaty palms together. I eagerly scan the crowd, waiting for Seth to appear and every second his song plays and I don\u2019t see his fierce figure storming out here, the more my excitement melts into worry. Then, I hear the roar of the crowd as everyone jumps to their feet, sending my nerves reeling and my heart pounding. Here he comes.</p><p>The cheers grow nearer, the closer he gets to the stage and I can\u2019t see him over the shaking, yelling bodies over the other spectators. I see the top of his black hoodie first and as he rounds the corner, his entire glorious body comes into view. His mouthpiece forces his lips to protrude, giving him a darker edge\u2014not that he needs it.</p><p>His eyes scan over my row and my lips part as heavy breaths escape me. When his stare fall onto me, I cease to breathe.</p><p>With a twitch of his lips, he turns from me and shrugs out of his hoodie. Jackson throws it over his own shoulder and slaps him on the back as he bounds up the stairs and into the cage. My lungs ache and I release the breath I was holding as Seth does his usual circle of the ring, bouncing on the tips of his toes and shaking his wrists. There\u2019s no cockiness to his movements, he moves with absolute purpose. Tonight isn\u2019t a game. Tonight is Seth\u2019s one chance to remove Don from his life\u2014from our life.</p><p>Seth\u2019s music cuts off and the announcer calls out Don\u2019s weight, reach, and height before dragging out his name. A loud, metal song blast through the speakers and I cringe. So much anger and hate this guy has. I shake my head. The crowd cheers and claps, but the intensity of it isn\u2019t like it was with Seth. The crowd respects Seth. Most of them follow his career and witnessed him beat his experienced opponent two weeks ago. Don tears around the corner, topless and eager. He\u2019s determined to take back everything Seth took from him. Don\u2019s eyes flick onto me and I scowl as he winks, puckering his lips at me over his mouthpiece.</p> <p>\u201cFucking hell.\u201d Selena chuckles under her breath. \u201cThat guy has a death wish.\u201d</p><p>Seth sees Don look at me and I see his fingers clenching at his sides. He rolls his neck over his shoulders and as Don bounds up the stairs and into the ring, Seth steps forward, getting right in his face. My heart races as the crowd goes berserk, fueling the already tense relationship between the two fighters. The referee is on them immediately, ordering them to their corners. As they separate, the crowd sighs in bitter disappointment.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of animosity in the cage tonight, ladies and gentlemen\u2014can you feel it?\u201d</p><p>The crowd explodes with cheers and applause. They can\u2019t wait a second longer for the fight to start. They want bloodshed and they want it now. The camera crew and the announcer leave the cage and I start chewing my fingernails. If only Dad was here right now...he\u2019d know the right thing to say to ease me into this fight. I need him to assure me that Seth is going to win. I need to see the excitement on his face when the bell dings and Seth gets the first punch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019s got this,\u201d the large guy next to me mutters. I turn my head to look at him and he smirks at me.</p><p>\u201cIf you think so.\u201d</p><p>His bright blue eyes flare. \u201cI know so.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and turn my attention back to the cage. I really hope Seth wins now so I can rub it into the stranger\u2019s big, fat face.</p> <p>The referee calls the two fighters to the center of the ring. Each referee is different. Some prefer them to touch gloves before the bell rings, others prefer them to touch after the bell rings. Either way, the fight cannot commence until they touch gloves.</p><p>Don and Seth meet in the middle. I see the referee\u2019s lips move, undoubtedly telling them to touch gloves. Neither fighter moves. There\u2019s a silent war going on between them and the crowd watches in silence...waiting for war to break out.</p><p>I swear I can hear the rapid heartbeat of every spectator, mine included, and a crackle of excitement flows over us as Don extends his hand first. Seth smacks it away and a unanimous sharp intake of air is heard throughout the arena. The referee steps between them, sending them back to their corner. He points at each and they nod their heads. Then, the bell rings and my vision wavers with the ringing. I take a long, slow breath and close my eyes in an attempt to calm myself. Olly, relax. It\u2019s just a fight, I tell myself, pretending it\u2019s Dad\u2019s voice. Nobody is going to die.</p><p>The thought makes me feel better and I open my eyes to see Seth coming in quickly, ducking and dodging Don\u2019s swings and punching him wherever he can. With every fist that connects, the crowd gasps and cheers. I chew my bottom lip, counting down the seconds of the round. Don throws a counter punch, going for a quick left jab and to everyone\u2019s surprise, Seth dodges the punch, responding with his own left jab, followed by a quick right uppercut to Don\u2019s jaw. You can tell Seth is in the game\u2014all of his movements are planned and precise. It\u2019s almost like he knows Don\u2019s moves in advance. Seth is absolutely dominating this round and despite how much I don\u2019t like watching people fight...I know I\u2019ll enjoy watching Don fall.</p><p>Hit after hit they exchange, neither of them growing tired of smacking the other. Two minutes into the round, when both Don and Seth are bleeding, Don takes the plunge and dives at Seth and the two become a swamp of flesh as they roll around, trying to get the drop on the other. I feel my hands creep up my neck and over my mouth as they each struggle to dominate the other. As the round draws to a close, Seth gets the upper hand. He straddles Don, pushing down on his chest. Seth drops an elbow on his face and I gasp, feeling the blood drain from my face as Don\u2019s own blood pours from his eye. I hate Don, everyone knows that, but I still can\u2019t enjoy watching him suffer like this. It\u2019s not okay. I sink my teeth into my bottom lip and cringe as Seth drops another and another, splitting Don\u2019s brow wider. There\u2019s so much blood, but the ref doesn\u2019t call the fight.</p><p>I feel Selena lean into me. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom and I\u2019ll probably miss the rest of the fight, so I\u2019ll meet you in the locker room after Seth wins.\u201d I nod my head, sparing a glance in her direction. She winks at me and the big guy beside me chuckles under his breath. I peer slyly at him, but he gives no indication that he heard what Selena said, so I turn my attention back to the fight. Seth has this in the bag, Don\u2019s face is almost purple, but he refuses to tap out. Seth chokes Don harder with his own arm and the crowd goes mental, cheering and begging to kill Don. I bounce my legs and tap my fingers against my jeans. It\u2019s the only way I can express my anxiety and excitement without jumping up and down and actually looking like I support the violent sport.</p><p>I see Don\u2019s resolve finally give way and his fingers twitch toward Seth\u2019s arm. This is it! My heart levitates in my chest, hovering dangerously close to my throat and threatening to fly up and out. Seth deserves this. He deserves this win over Don. As I shift in my seat, I feel the unmistakable pressure of a large hand sliding over the top of my thigh. I jump up and away from the guy next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d He follows, grabbing at me and pulling me into him. He pins my arms to my side and holds me against his body. I struggle against him and get nowhere. No one steps in to help me and I realize it\u2019s because we look like we\u2019re a couple hugging. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d I shout, but no one hears me over the roar of the crowd.</p><p>I look at Darryl and Jackson, but they\u2019re too consumed in the fight to pay me any attention. Is this seriously happening? Damn, Selena. I wish she never went to the toilet. Out of panic, I look to Seth and I startle when I see his eyes on me. My heart beats in my chest as he lets Don\u2019s arm go.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shout, at the top of my lungs for the first time ever. \u201cWhat are you doing? Get the tap out and then help me!\u201d</p><p>Without a second to catch his breath, Don shoots to his feet and takes Seth down. There\u2019s a fumble of arms and legs before Don straightens Seth\u2019s arm out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The whole crowd is yelling with me now and all I can feel is the vibrating laughter of the asshole holding me. Tears well in my eyes as Seth\u2019s face becomes strained and his elbow begins to bend in the opposite direction. He won\u2019t tap out. He\u2019d rather Don break his arm than submit to him and admit Don is stronger. Don is the weakest person I\u2019ve ever met. He\u2019s sneaky, arrogant and asshole-ish. He knew Seth would beat him...he planned this. He planned to distract Seth, knowing he could never beat him. And it worked...worst of all, it fucking worked.</p><p>Seth</p><p>I have his own arm around his neck. Nothing is more embarrassing than choking yourself out in a fight. All of this is being recorded and I hope it haunts him for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cYour girl.\u201d Don chuckles, his voice barely audible.</p><p>I frown at him and pull his arm tighter. He tries to laugh and uses his free hand to point to something outside the cage. Out of curiosity, I look up.</p><p>Through the black metal cage I see her. My blood begins to boil at the way the huge brute holds her. I recognize him immediately as one of the large guys that jumped me outside my gym a while ago. I see his white knuckles and fingers as he presses them into her flesh. He\u2019s a dead man. Out of nowhere, my back slaps against the canvas as Don throws himself on me. I try to fight him off and get out from under him. This isn\u2019t about the fight anymore. I don\u2019t want to kick the shit out of Don, at least, not as badly as I want to kill the man holding my woman. Don wraps a leg over my chest and yanks on my arm, straightening it out over his hips and pulling downwards. Pain shoots from my elbow, radiating through my body and making me cringe. Shit. Fuck! He has me in an arm bar\u2014a fucking arm bar!</p><p>I will not tap out.</p><p>Not to Don-fucking-Russell.</p><p>I angle my head and peer through the cage\u2019s wires. Color has drained from Olivia\u2019s face and even from here I can see the tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s calling out to me, but I can\u2019t hear it under the protest of the crowd. I feel two pops in my elbow and I cringe as Don straightens it further. My heart slams into my lungs and my whole body is taut, fighting against Don\u2019s strength. I don\u2019t take my eyes off Olivia, who is desperately begging me to tap. I can\u2019t.</p><p>I can\u2019t tap...</p><p>I\u2019m prepared to let him break my arm.</p><p>Then, I see the one thing I never want to see flash over Olivia\u2019s countenance\u2014disappointment. My heart dips, deflating into nothing as my stomach churns. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to do this. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to do what I told myself I\u2019d never do. I grit my teeth against my pride and without a second thought I slap my hand down onto the canvas.</p><p>The bell rings.</p><p>The pressure on my arm is released.</p><p>... and I\u2019ve lost the fight to Don Russell.</p><p>Don...fucking...Russell.</p><p>Don leaps up and thrusts his arms in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There\u2019s no time to let the feeling of failure settle in before I jump to my feet and push past a crowd trying to make their way into the cage for photos and interviews.</p><p>\u201cDon set this whole fucking thing up!\u201d I snap at Darryl as I pass him.</p><p>My eyes are on him, the guy that has my girl tightly in his grasp. I push past a few camera guys at the bottom of the stairs, shoving one a little too hard and knocking him on his ass. From my peripherals, I see Jackson talking to me\u2014yelling at me\u2014but I don\u2019t stop. The brute lets her go as I approach and he cleverly hides behind Olivia, knowing the rows are two small for me to get to him without hurting her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to put your hands on my girl?\u201d I shout and a few people sitting flee from their seats. Olivia races forward and plants her hands on my stomach in an effort to hold me back, but I continue to walk toward him without struggle.</p><p>\u201cSeth, don\u2019t. It\u2019s not worth it, don\u2019t do it,\u201d she begs, tears still fresh in her eyes.</p><p>More of the crowd flees, afraid to get hurt in the crossfire.</p><p>The big guy takes a step back as security guards swarm in to protect him from me. They circle us, pulling us back and out toward the rooms. Olivia clings to me as I push against the guards, but there\u2019s too many of them. As I peer over one of their shoulders I see Jackson swing hard and connect with the brute-asshole\u2019s face. He goes down hard and Jackson is crushed under the bodies of two large security guards. Over the speakers, I hear Matt Somers introduce Don as a new contender in the MMAC. After that, all I see is red.</p><p>The security guards throw us into my locker room and shut the door. My entire team buzzes with discussion on the fight and how the ref should have called it when I was smashing Don with my elbows. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter that Don set me up. I fucking lost. For the first time in my life, I lost a goddamn fight and it was to Don Russell. The thought sinks to my stomach like a rock and I growl as Olivia cuts my gloves off. When my hands are free, I push off the bench, grab the nearest chair, and throw it across the room. The whole team falls silent and beside me I hear Olivia gulp.</p> <p>\u201cGet out!\u201d I demand, not wanting any sympathetic looks from them. I feel shit enough. They open the door and the security guards let them out. Olivia doesn\u2019t follow, even though I wanted her to.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to look at me like that, you can leave, too,\u201d I tell her, feeling my eyes narrow.</p><p>She averts her gaze, dropping it to the floor and fidgeting nervously with her fingers. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, he played you,\u201d she says to me, inching closer.</p><p>\u201cI still lost. Regardless of anything, I got distracted and I lost the fight. Now, he\u2019s in the same league as me. Now, I\u2019ll see him everywhere and he will look at me with that smug face and I just can\u2019t\u2014ughhh!\u201d I lash out and punch the brick wall.</p><p>Pain crepitates through my hand and I like it. It takes the pressure of my chest.</p><p>Olivia</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell him, my throat becoming thick with emotion as he hits the brick wall again. I cringe as my hand aches in sympathy. He whips around and I take a defensive step back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not okay!\u201d he shouts, kicking a stray plastic chair halfway across the room. I jump as it collides with the concrete wall and a loud slap echoes around us. \u201cWhat about this entire situation is okay? Are you okay with Don being in the MMAC?\u201d He steps closer, his eyes flaring violently and I shake my head. \u201cAre you okay with him breathing down your neck at events just to spite me?\u201d Seth grips my arms and pulls me into him. I shake my head again. \u201cAre you okay with him touching you just to get a rise out of me?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard as my knees shake. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen fill me in. Which part of this is okay?\u201d</p><p>I blink rapidly as a hot tear rolls down my cheek. \u201cNone of it.\u201d</p><p>He lets me go and confirms my words. \u201cNone of it. So don\u2019t fucking tell me it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not a child. I don\u2019t need to be reassured with lies.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for his hoodie on the bench and shrugs it on. He heads for the exit, grabs a cap with the MMAC logo on it off the hook and opens the door. The security guards arch up at Seth\u2019s appearance.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I shout.</p> <p>\u201cOut.\u201d He slams the door, leaving me alone in the room. I stare at the white door, confused and hurt. My chest is tight and I feel like I\u2019m wearing a corset four sizes too small. Does he blame me? Is this my fault? The door swings open as I sink to my knees on the floor. Darryl and Selena step inside. Instantly, Selena moves to my side and places a comforting arm around my shoulder. I wrap my arms around her waist and cry freely into her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cO?\u201d she mumbles sympathetically.</p><p>I drop my head as the tears flow harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find him,\u201d Darryl mutters, closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d I sniffle and Selena pulls me close. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, honey. Seth\u2019s just mad. He\u2019ll be okay once this all wears off.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. She didn\u2019t see his eyes\u2014she didn\u2019t see how dark they were. There was no love on his face, only pure hate. She rocks me slowly as my mascara-darkened tears fall onto her pretty white dress.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you home and when Seth comes back, he\u2019ll be calmer and you two can talk.\u201d</p><p>I peer up at her, feeling like a small child. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>She smiles, but even I can see her uncertainty. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Selena drags me to my feet and I use the bottom of my black shirt to wipe my face. She keeps a comforting arm around me as she escorts me from the room. As soon as we\u2019re in the hallway, people have their microphones and cameras in my face. Lights are going off, questions are being thrown at me and an overwhelming lump forces its way into my throat again.</p><p>\u201cPiss off, vultures,.\u201d Selena growls, pushing me through the noisy crowd.</p><p>I wonder if Seth had to deal with them on his way out or if he just missed them. They all seem to be unscathed, so one can assume they were lucky enough to avoid him.</p><p>Selena drops me home and then heads back to the arena to find Jackson. No one has seen him since he hit the guy that grabbed me and we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s being held in a security room somewhere or in jail\u2014he could be anywhere.</p><p>I pace the hallway outside our room for an eternity and every time the elevator sounds off, anticipation and fear washes over me\u2014only to be replaced by utter disappointment. I receive a text from Selena saying Jackson is okay and they\u2019re back in their room. Two down and two to go. After my second hour of pacing, I re-enter the room and have a shower. I do everything in an absent-minded daze, from undressing, to washing myself and climbing into a cold bed\u2014all of it\u2014I do without any real knowledge. The only thing I can think of is Seth and what he\u2019s doing, and Don and what he did. He didn\u2019t win the right to be in the MMAC, he stole it. I hear the door downstairs shut and I\u2019m jerked from my thoughts. My heart breaks through my lungs and slams into my ribs as I peel the blankets back and slide out of bed. I put my Seth shirt back on and head down the stairs. The lights are off, it\u2019s dark, and if it weren\u2019t for the bright neon of Vegas that shine through the window, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see a damn thing\u2014including Seth, who has dropped onto the couch. I stroll over to him and my eyes zero in on his chest, it rises and falls in an even pant and my body almost sags in relief.</p><p>\u201cI lost, O.\u201d He sighs, leaning his elbows on his knees. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Sorry? I drop to my knees in front of him and run my hands up his thighs. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for.\u201d</p><p>I hear his breathing become uneven and my body tenses. Is he crying? I can\u2019t tell. If he is, he\u2019s doing a good job at concealing it from me.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to win so bad...but I fucked it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say with more aggression this time. \u201cYou did nothing wrong. You were perfect. Don played you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I let him...I let him play me.\u201d</p><p>I hear Seth sniffle and he pulls away from me, leaning his head on the back of the couch. He is crying...and he doesn\u2019t have to shield it from me, I won\u2019t hold it against him. In my world, only real men cry. He pinches the bridge of his nose and clears his throat, forcing himself to stop.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this anymore. Fighting, I mean. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re done, just like that?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cYou beat Don months ago, did he quit? You beat world wrestling champion Junior Moset two weeks ago, do you think he quit?\u201d Still nothing. \u201cNo. He\u2019s scheduled to fight another opponent in two weeks. So you lost, big deal. You showed everyone that you\u2019re human, and wins don\u2019t stand out as much as comebacks do. Do you think people will be talking about Seth\u2019s Marc\u2019s loss? No, they\u2019ll be talking about Don Russell\u2019s comeback\u2014his revenge\u2014and when you attend the press conference tomorrow morning, you will promise them an epic comeback. You will promise to deliver your fans Don\u2019s head on a silver-fucking-platter, not disappoint them by quitting because it got too hard.\u201d</p><p>He looks down at me. \u201cIs that what you want me to do? To get revenge on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more than revenge, Seth. I want you to humiliate him. I want you to beat him so bad he gets a nervous twitch every time he sees a cage.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s nods slowly, letting my words sink in. \u201cThen that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d Seth tells the cameras. \u201cIn four months I\u2019ll be back to put him in his place, but first, I\u2019m going to go home, marry my girl, and take her somewhere nice.\u201d I hear the ring girls beside me sigh and I bite back a smile. \u201cAnd when I get back, I\u2019m going to hurt Don beyond the point of redemption. He\u2019ll be so embarrassed by the beat down I put on him, he\u2019ll leave the MMAC for good. That I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Seth winks at me, the small cut on his eyebrow bowing with it and I smile widely in response.</p><p>\u201cYou heard it, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d Matt Somers announces with a wry smile. \u201cThe third and final fight between Seth Marc and Don Russell will be settled in the cage on July sixteenth.\u201d</p><p>And just like that, Matt forces Don back into Seth\u2019s life and the drama between the two starts all over again, only this time, Seth is out for blood.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Seth</p><p>\u201cWill you keep still?\u201d Mum scolds me, fussing with my blue tie and making sure it laid the proper way under my collar and waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d I groan. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m more than capable of dressing myself, but I let Mom do it, knowing that it makes her feel good to fuss over me, like a real mother would.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying the love of your life. You should be excited, not nervous.\u201d</p><p>She reaches around me and pulls my jacket off its coat hanger. Mom holds it open for me and I slip my arms into it, shrugging it on over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat, I can\u2019t be both?\u201d I ask and she smooths the palms of her hands over my shoulders and rolls her eyes. I adjust my jacket, making sure it sits comfortably on me as she reaches for the boutonniere of some white flower and pins it to my lapel.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have to wear flowers? I\u2019m not the bride.\u201d</p><p>From the couch next to me, Jackson chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ve complained so much this morning I\u2019m really questioning who exactly the bride is today.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s my turn to roll my eyes. \u201cHilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wear it to match her, and it\u2019s not just a flower, it\u2019s a phalaenopsis orchid blossom, and it just so happens to be Olivia\u2019s mother\u2019s favorite flower so watch what you say about it around her. That woman can be very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntense,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cControlling,\u201d Jackson adds and we both chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about Olivia\u2019s mom?\u201d Maddi asks, stepping into the room and closing the door behind her. How did she know we were talking about Olivia\u2019s mother? Scratch that, how nice of her to make it. I haven\u2019t seen her since I gave her money to stop stripping\u2014two months ago. I never received an RSVP back from her\u2014not even a text to say congratulations.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d I deadpan.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry, I kind of dropped off the face of the Earth for a while. I\u2019m back now, though. You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d miss your wedding, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fear, brother.\u201d She laughs, grabbing a fistful of her long, pink dress and walking over to the couch. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d She drops in next to Jackson. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you witness the impossible.\u201d</p><p>Jackson snickers and I narrow my eyes at them.</p><p>\u201cEnough, the pair of you. This is Seth\u2019s big day and we should be as supportive as we can.\u201d Mom finishes pinning in the orchid and takes a step back. Her floor length red gown sways around her feet and tears well in her eyes as she clasps her hands over her chest. \u201cPerfect.\u201d She smiles up at me. \u201cYou look so handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous,\u201d Jackson snorts, nudging my sister. \u201cI can hardly contain myself.\u201d</p><p>I ignore them and their snickering. There\u2019s a knock at the door and Darryl pops his head inside.</p><p>\u201cAll of the guests are here and Olivia is ready. Are you?\u201d</p><p>Another bout of nervousness twists my stomach, but I nod my head despite it. He pushes the door open wider and I exit through it. I stroll eagerly down a hallway and out a small door, into the main room of the large church. Lively chatter erupts on my entrance, followed closely by Mom and Maddi. They take their seats in the front row and hold each other\u2019s hands like they\u2019ve never had a disagreement in their lives. It\u2019s nice to see. It\u2019s nice to see my family with some semblance of love and normality after the craziness of Dad\u2019s death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jackson and Darryl will come in with the bridal party. Olivia and I chose two people each to be up here with us and we figured we\u2019d choose the people that have been with us since the beginning\u2014Selena, Darryl and Jackson. I know that leaves us uneven, so I did something secretive to level it out. The color Olivia chose for the bridesmaids and groomsmen to wear is a very nice pearly grey broken up by a dark navy blue. So, I had a tailor make a tuxedo out of the same material as Selena\u2019s bridesmaid dress. And then I contacted Olivia\u2019s brother, Chase. Surprisingly, he was more than happy to be one of Olivia\u2019s bridesmaids. She doesn\u2019t know I did that for her and as far as she\u2019s concerned, her brother is too busy to make it back home for our wedding. I can\u2019t wait to see her face and I hope Selena catches it all on camera like I asked.</p><p>A second later, the piano begins to play, cutting into my thoughts. The wedding is beginning...my wedding is beginning. My palms becomes slick with sweat and I rub my fingers against them, my eyes never leaving the open doors at the back of the room. Selena steps up to the door in her beautiful gown and waits as both Darryl and Jackson take her elbows.</p><p>I smile, knowing very well that my plan has worked. Chase is here and he\u2019s going to walk his sister down the aisle because Rick isn\u2019t here to do it. And here she was thinking she was going to have to walk alone. If Chase couldn\u2019t make it, I was going to walk her my damn self and hand her over to me on my own. I smile again at my own ridiculousness. I just want to make her happy.</p> <p>Two little girls in poufy white dresses step out of the door as Selena, Jackson and Darryl reach the altar and join me on the top of the stairs. The adorable little girls (Olivia\u2019s cousin\u2019s kids) coat the aisle in beautiful white, grey, and blue flowers. I watch them only for a few seconds before my eyes flit back to the double doors. She\u2019s next. She\u2019s coming.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how this happened. I don\u2019t know how I got to be the one at the altar, waiting for the girl of my dreams...all I know is, she wants me. She will want me forever. Olivia makes me happy to be alive\u2014like I can do anything. Emotions well up in my throat and I swallow hard and roll my shoulders to rid myself of it.</p><p>\u201cEasy, big boy.\u201d Jackson chuckles under his breath. \u201cShe\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Then, I see white fabric flick over the edge of the door and a second later, there she is. My bride.</p><p>I cease to breathe as air flees from my lungs at the vision of her in her beautiful tight, white wedding dress. It clings to the curves of her body, before flaring out at the bottom, leaving a long trail of fabric behind her. My stare drags up the rest of her body and onto her face, that\u2019s hidden by a thin white veil. On her arm, her proud brother stands with his stern face and green eyes locked on the altar in front of him. I hear sniffles and gasps and low murmurs come from our relatives, but I don\u2019t dare let my eyes waver from the perfection strolling toward me. Now all I want is to see her face. I want to see her emotions\u2014to see if she\u2019s as excited as I am.</p> <p>In a few small eternities, she\u2019s in front of me with her brother, a protective dog at her side.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s yours now,\u201d Chase tells me. \u201cBut I\u2019ll always be looking over her shoulder. Treat her well\u2014like a princess.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Not like a princess. \u201cLike a queen.\u201d</p><p>Chase\u2019s lips pull into a wide smile and he places her hand in mine. He gives Olivia one kiss on the cheek and then steps down to stand behind Selena, evening out the bridal party. O clutches my hand tightly, eagerly, lacing her warm, sweaty fingers through my own. The priest begins to speak and I feel Olivia become a little restless next to me. When I peer at her, I hear her whisper \u2018fuck it\u2019 under her breath and she flicks the veil over her head and throws herself at me, crushing her mouth to mine. The guests cheer and clap, hooting and hollering and laughing at Olivia\u2019s sudden urgency to kiss me. Behind me, I hear Darryl and Jackson groan and utter \u2018Jesus Christ\u2019 under their breaths. I don\u2019t have much time to register the kiss, I\u2019m still stuck on the sudden glimpse of her beautiful face. When my body begins to react to her mouth, I wrap my arms around her waist and pull her tighter to me.</p><p>When she pulls away, she whispers,. \u201cThank you so much, you\u2019ve made my day.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are damp with tears and her voice seems shaky. I smile down at her and pull the veil back over her face. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Now let\u2019s get married already.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs up at me, stands back in her place and apologizes to the reverend.</p><p>The reverend clears his throat. \u201cLet\u2019s try that again. As Olivia and Seth take their vows today, we are privileged to witness the joyous love of a new family\u2014a family that will be nourished and nurtured through the devotion of two separate individuals growing together through the common bonds of love. May their marriage bring them the peace, joy, comfort and contentment that is known in the hearts of all God\u2019s children.\u201d</p><p>I zone out and glance at Olivia. Through the thin material, I can make out her lips as she smiles widely at the reverend. Her happiness is pouring from her in waves, exceeded only by my own.</p><p>\u201cTo truly love another person is to be willing to accept both their strong points and their weak points, with equal measures of understanding and respect.\u201d</p><p>The ceremony in itself is a traditional one, and not lengthy at all. We recited after the reverend where prompted and exchanged rings. I\u2019ve never worn a ring before, but the gold band that now decorates my finger doesn\u2019t feel out of place or alien at all. It feels right, like it\u2019s a part of my skin.</p><p>\u201cSeth, do you take Olivia to be your wedded wife, your partner in life, and your one true love? Do you cherish her friendship and promise to love her today, tomorrow and forever? Do you promise to comfort her, honor her, and keep her in sickness and in health, remaining faithful to her as long as you both shall live?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have to think. He just asked me the easiest question I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, do you take this man to be your wedded husband? Do you promise to love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness and in health, remaining faithful to him as long as you both shall live?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen by the power invested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and lift the veil from Olivia\u2019s face, exposing the single curl of dark hair that rests against her chest. I pull her to me and kiss her with everything that I have. I pour all of my love, my excitement, and nervousness into the kiss, and I feel the air leave her lungs. Everything in my life has led to this moment...the moment where I\u2019d claim my one true love as my wife in front of all of our friends and family.</p><p>And I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.</p><p>The reception was a wild blur of flashing cameras, music, dancing and food. My face muscles hurt more than my entire body does after a fight, just from smiling.</p><p>I could write a five hundred page novel about tonight. I could write about the vows we exchanged, the conversation we had, or the dances we shared in extreme detail, but to me, those things didn\u2019t matter as much to me as being joined in matrimony forever did.</p><p>I drive away from the reception at Emerald Cliff Restaurant and Marina, and head toward the resort I booked for us at The Captain Lord Mansion. I\u2019m relieved the whole thing is over\u2014before we left, our relatives were all starting to feel the effects of the alcohol and the uncomfortable childhood stories that were slowly starting to roll out. Chase, Maddi, Jackson, Selena and Darryl were huddled around a table, sharing stories and laughing like they\u2019ve always hung out\u2014and my Mom, she was happily sitting with Olivia\u2019s mother, neither of them touching the free booze. Today and tonight was perfect to say the least, but now we\u2019re finally alone again. I\u2019ve wanted to be alone with Olivia since I saw her at Saint Paul\u2019s Church and the only thing I can think about is making this night memorable for her. I don\u2019t know how...I don\u2019t know what else I can do for her. I\u2019ve taken her in a shower and tied her to cages. I\u2019ve licked between her thighs while she slept and I\u2019ve lost my fingers inside her until she melted around me a million and one times. What else can I bring to the table? What else can I do to make tonight memorable?</p><p>We pull up outside the Captain Lord Mansion and Olivia slips from the car with a yawn.</p><p>\u201cLeave the bags,\u201d I tell her as I exit the car and she reaches for the back handle. \u201cI\u2019ll get them in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Our fingers lace together as she meets me around my side of the car. I lead her up the stairs and through the mansion\u2019s double doors. She marvels at the layout and all of the decorations, but her eyes don\u2019t linger on them. I\u2019m way too tired to really care if I was somewhere nice or somewhere dodgy. She practically bounces next to me as I escort her to our room. Inside, I eye the bed, eager to lie down and rest my eyes.</p><p>\u201cCan you run a bath?\u201d Olivia smiles. \u201cI think we need to wind down a little before bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, wifey.\u201d My chest squeezes at the word and Olivia beams at me.</p><p>I pull my jacket off and undo my waist coat and tie, throwing it onto the bed, uncaring if they wrinkle. I stroll through the large bedroom and into the open, elegant bathroom. I barely marvel at the stonework as I run the bath, hot and bubbly to Olivia\u2019s liking. At the thought of her name, she strolls in with a bottle of wine and two glasses in her hand. She turns and glances at me over her shoulder. I rise up and clasp her zipper, drawing it down her spine and over the rise of her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou want to drink now?\u201d I ask, lowering my mouth to her neck and planting a soft kiss. Under my lips, light goosebumps erupt over her skin. I pull away and she smiles wickedly at me.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how I get...\u201d The last thing I want to do is fuck her too roughly her on our wedding night. Isn\u2019t it meant to be passionate and loving?</p><p>I unhook her bra and toss it away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard how you get, but I haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201d</p><p>Her words stir my dick in my pants and I watch her plump, red lips as the next two words fall from her mouth. Show me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to be kind and loving?\u201d I ask, curling my fingers around her white lace underwear and pushing them down her thighs. When they reach a certain point, they fall without my assistance and she steps out of them. She\u2019s fully naked now and I watch\u2014no\u2014I admire her as she puts one foot after the other into the bath and lowers herself down. I watch the milky skin of her thighs turn a light shade of pink, immersed in the hot water. The water is barely deep enough to cover her thighs and I love the vision before me as rogue bubbles cover one half of her nipple.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She smiles, pouring wine into a glass. \u201cYou can still love me with a fistful of my hair.\u201d</p><p>Holy. Shit. She wants it rough, hard, and fast. She wants me to completely dominate her, taking her on every surface in this room. Baby wants, baby gets.</p><p>She places the full glass on the edge of the bath and looks up at me. \u201cAre you going to join me, or are you going to continue to eye-fuck me instead of actually fucking me?\u201d</p><p>I unhook my belt almost aggressively, not believing the words that are coming out of her mouth. I shed my clothes and lower myself into the bath. She hands me a glass of wine and I slam it back in three big gulps. I fucking hate wine. I drop the glass over the edge and onto the bath mat before I surge forward, grabbing Olivia\u2019s legs and yanking her toward me. I don\u2019t need alcohol to give her what she wants. Olivia pulls from my grasp and \u2018tsks\u2019 at me.</p><p>\u201cWe have all night to do that.\u201d She smiles devilishly. She flips her body around and crawls toward me. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to do for you, first.\u201d</p><p>She runs her tongue over her bottom lips before leaning right in and kissing my neck\u2014and then my chest. The palm of her hand flattens against my chest and my heart beats rapidly into her hand as she pushes me back a little. I watch her, amazed how my body does what she tells it to without hesitation and it\u2019s in this moment I realize, Olivia isn\u2019t mine...I\u2019m hers.</p><p>I quickly moisten my lip and a gasp of air leaves me as her eyes stay locked on mine and she lowers her mouth to my cock.</p><p>Her moist lips wrap around the head, coating it in saliva and a guttural groan tears from me as my head falls back against the tiles. Pleasure radiates from my core, pulsing in consuming waves each time her tongue flicks over the very tip, and as she takes me all the way to the back of her throat, I shudder and smile, realizing I\u2019m completely, irreversibly and happily lost to my wife. </p> </body></html>"]
