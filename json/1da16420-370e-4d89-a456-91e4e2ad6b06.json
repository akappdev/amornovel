Whether they were literal and hid your face, or figurative to protect your soul, he was supremely comfortable with camouflage. Knowledge, after all, was power only if it gave you insight into your enemy. If insight was applied to you?</p><p>He\u2019d rather have a knife to his throat.</p> <p>And everyone was his enemy.</p><p>Standing in a crowd of over a hundred sexually aroused humans, he was ready to feed his dark side\u2014you know, toss some fresh meat over the chain-link fence of his sex drive and stand back as the meal was consumed, the gnawing hunger briefly satisfied.</p><p>It never lasted. But that was why he\u2019d joined this club.</p><p>The Keys was a private, members-only gig, and there were only two rules. No minors. Always with consent.</p><p>After those conditions were satisfied? You could scratch the itch of whatever sin you wanted: glory holes, gang bangs, girls on girls on guys. There were rooms for fetishes, and pits for fucking, and every tie-up, chain-down, in-the-air you could ask for.</p> <p>Especially here in the Cathedral.</p><p>Of all the spaces in the sprawling, multi-block compound, this was largest and the loftiest. Filled with swirls of white smoke, pierced by purple and blue lasers, empty of furniture and fixtures except for the altar, only the hardest of the hardcore were allowed in here.</p><p>And masks were always worn, even on nights when the rest of the club didn\u2019t require it.</p><p>Through the eye holes of his fitted skull plate, Axe looked up, way up, to the altar.</p><p>It was like a scene out of The Silence of the Lambs, a human body suspended high above the floor, arms outstretched, head tilting to the side, swaths of fabric fanning out like wings all around the torso. The Hannibal-arisons ended there, though. Not a man, a woman. Not clothed, but naked. Not real blood on the flesh, but a viscous wash that fell like rain from the ceiling, hitting her breasts, dripping over her stomach, licking down her thighs so that she glistened under the remote lights.</p><p>Not dead, but very much alive.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want that?\u201d he was asked from behind.</p><p>Axe smiled and didn\u2019t bother hiding his fangs.</p><p>None of them knew that he was an actual vampire. And not as in a neo-Victorian Dracula-wannabe with cosmetically altered canines, high-heeled boots, and a fake black rinse through his already dark hair.</p><p>As in the real deal. Different DNA. Different traditions and language. Different biological imperative that, yes, involved drinking blood from a vampire of the opposite sex.</p><p>Different sex drive.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take her first,\u201d he said.</p><p>As the staff member whistled loudly and put his hand up to summon the rolling scaffolding, a rush tripped and fell over the crowd, excitement building for the first show. And for a split second, Axe considered materializing up there just to freak them all out, just because he could, just because he liked creating chaos.</p><p>Instead, he scaled the front of the metal framework with the ease of a spider over its web.</p> <p>When he was up at the woman\u2019s level, her body responded in a starving arch, her head falling back, her mouth opening, her eyes begging him. She wasn\u2019t drugged. She was achingly aware, the scent of her sex flaring, her flesh calling out for release.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted him. Out of the many below, she\u2019d wanted him specifically.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she said. \u201cTake\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reached out his gloved hand and closed her mouth with his fingertips. Bending over her, he bared his canines and went for her throat. But he didn\u2019t bite her. He ran the tip of one fang up her jugular.</p><p>With a jerk against the chains she had volunteered for, she or-gasmed for him right then and there, the alchemy of the public display, the danger he represented, the kind of sex she needed, coalescing into a release that flushed her face and made her moan as she thrashed.</p><p>Down below, the pleasure she felt rippled through the teeming bodies.</p><p>And he was aroused, yes. But not like they were. Not like she was.</p><p>Never as any of them.</p><p>However, the screaming voice in his head that told him he was a piece of shit was dimmed down by the sex. The fire of his rage against himself was doused by the distraction. The packed house of recriminations under his real skull were, momentarily, displaced.</p><p>So yes, this worked for everyone.</p><p>Reaching up to his own throat, he released the cord of his cloak and dropped the heavy weight from his shoulders. He had black leathers on and nothing else but his tattoos and piercings.</p><p>Axe\u2019s hands went to her body and traveled, with his mouth, everywhere.</p><p>And the storm he was deliberately creating raked over the decimated landscape of his soul, obscuring the ragged, desolated mess he was.</p><p>She was getting what she required, and so was he.</p><p>Good thing. He needed to be at the Black Dagger Brotherhood training center in about an hour, in some kind of shape to continue his education. Being a soldier in the fight against the Lessening Society? Walking the line between life and death?</p><p>Now that was finally going to get him what he was after.</p><p>Inner peace through acts of war: Because he had to believe if you were facing off with the undead, surely you were too busy trying to stay alive to worry about anything else.</p><p>Fucking perfect.</p><p>STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK, CALDWELL CAMPUS</p><p>Elise, blooded daughter of the Princeps Felixe the Younger, smiled at the human male across the library table from her. \u201cOf course I\u2019d stay late. I\u2019m not going to leave you to deal with all this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this\u201d was a debris field of final papers sufficient to cover every square inch of surface except for two feet in front of her and two feet in front of Professor Troy Becke. Although the submissions for Psych 342 had been filed electronically, Troy believed in printing them out for grading purposes\u2014and after having been through midterms with the man, Elise had to agree. There was something different about holding the work in your hands and being able to write your thoughts down. It had to do with the lack of speed, she\u2019d decided. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Too easy to scan if you were doing things electronically, and she was such a quick typist; having to handwrite things gave her time to really think things through.</p><p>Troy sat back and stretched. \u201cWell, considering it\u2019s ten o\u2019clock at night only days before Christmas, I\u2019d say it\u2019s yeoman\u2019s duty.\u201d</p><p>As he smiled at her, she measured him. He was tall for a human, and he had bright blue eyes and the sort of face that was so open and friendly, it could make you forget that you were a stranger posing in a strange land, a foreigner who had come to visit and stayed because they were captivated by the freedom that was enjoyed by the natives.</p><p>\u201cSo that was my last one.\u201d She put the printout on her stack of graded papers on the left and twisted in the chair to crack her spine, a little sunburst of relief easing at her waist. \u201cYou know, this was a good group of students. They really got it\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he interjected.</p><p>Elise frowned. \u201cWhy? I\u2019m your teaching assistant. This is my job. Besides, I\u2019m learning even more now....\u201d</p><p>She let her voice trail off because she was pretty sure Troy wasn\u2019t hearing a thing she was saying. He was looking around at the stacks that bracketed them in their alcove, his eyes not really focused.</p><p>As a vampire among humans, Elise was always a little twitchy, and she hopped on the scan train, glancing about in case Troy had sensed something she had not.</p><p>The Foster Newmann library was a place where students went to study even though print was dead and notes were now taken on laptops and chalk no longer existed in classrooms. Four stories high, and marked by stretches of shelving that were broken up by sitting areas, the facility was a place where she always felt safe, with nothing but her studies and her ambitions before her.</p> <p>It was when she was at home, in her father\u2019s mansion, that she was hunted. Pursued. Threatened.</p><p>Although that was just allegorically speaking.</p><p>Noticing nothing, she rubbed her eyes, the reality that she was going to have to return to that big old house making her head pound.</p><p>Seven years into her studies and she was starting to get close to her goal. Thanks to an undergrad major in psych, she had been allowed into the Psy.D. in Clinical Psychology program without a master\u2019s. Her goal was to go into a private counseling practice for the race when she was finally finished, specializing in PTSD.</p><p>After the raids of two years before, there were a lot of vampires suffering from traumatic loss, and so few avenues for anyone to seek social workers and counseling.</p><p>Of course, the raids had also slowed her down, too, her father insisting that she cease her studies and decamp with her aunt, uncle, and first cousin out to a safe house far from Caldwell. As soon as they had come back, however, she had gotten on track again\u2014although tragedy had struck once more, making it all so much harder for her.</p> <p>She hated lying to her sire every night. Hated the subterfuge about where she was going and who she was with. But what other choice did she have? The small window of freedom she\u2019d been granted had been slammed shut.</p><p>Especially after her first cousin had been beaten to death four weeks ago.</p><p>Elise still couldn\u2019t believe Allishon was gone, and her father, uncle, and aunt were likewise in a state of renewed shock\u2014or at least, she assumed they were. No one was talking about the loss, the sadness, the anger. But they were reacting to it, for sure: Elise\u2019s father was so tense and grim, it was as if he were going to snap at any moment. Her aunt had been locked up in her bedroom for a month. And her uncle was a ghost who wandered around, throwing no shadows, casting no footfalls.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elise was sneaking out of the mansion to go to school. But come on. She had worked for years and years to get this far, and if anything, the way her family was handling Allishon\u2019s loss was exactly why the race needed good, well-trained psychologists.</p><p>Stuffing things under the proverbial rug was a recipe for interpersonal disaster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>Yanking herself out of introspection, she looked at the man. Her first thought was that he was hiding something. Her second was that she had to know what it was.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can help with?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, the problem\u2019s on my side.\u201d</p><p>As he tried to smile, she caught the scent of something in the air. Something ...</p><p>\u201cI think you better go.\u201d He leaned down for the duffel bag he\u2019d brought the exams in and started shuffling stacks of papers into it. \u201cThe roads will be getting bad because of the snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy. Can you please talk to me?\u201d</p><p>He got up, tucking his loose shirt into his khaki slacks. \u201cIt\u2019s all good. And I guess I won\u2019t see you until after New Year\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned. \u201cI thought you wanted me to do the syllabus planning with you for Psych four-oh-one, two twenty-eight, and the seminar on Bipolar Two? I have tomorrow night free\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, Elise.\u201d</p><p>What the heck was that scent\u2014</p><p>Oh. Wow.</p><p>With a flush, she realized what it was. Especially as his eyes shifted away from her: He was aroused. Because of her.</p><p>He was seriously, sexually aroused. And he was not happy about it.</p><p>\u201cTroy.\u201d</p><p>Her professor put his hand up. \u201cLook, it\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done. It\u2019s not you, honest.\u201d</p><p>As he didn\u2019t go any further than that, she found herself wishing he would just come out with it all. Not because she was necessarily attracted to him, but she hated anything that was hidden. She had had more than enough of that from her family\u2019s perennial stiff-upper-lip way of handling life\u2019s inevitable unpleasantnesses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if she wasn\u2019t attracted to him. He was appealing in an unthreatening kind of way. Smart, funny, and a heartthrob to his female students for sure. God knew she\u2019d seen plenty of the humans he taught stare at him like he was a god.</p><p>And maybe she had thought about what it would be like with him. The touching. The kissing. The ... other things.</p><p>She had no male prospects currently and that was not going to change anytime soon. Especially given the fact that she was fouled in the eyes of the glymera.</p><p>Not that anyone knew that, as the male she had lain with that one time had been killed in raids.</p> <p>\u201cI am of age,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>His eyes flipped to hers. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not young. Too young, I mean. For what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s gaze flared as if that was the last thing he\u2019d expected her to say. And then he looked at her lips.</p><p>Yes, she thought. He was safe, this human. He would never hurt her or pressure her, as that kind of aggression was not in his nature\u2014and even if it was, she could easily overpower him. Besides, she was never going to be mated, would never have a life wholly outside of her father\u2019s control, never experience anything more than the distilled life stories in her course books.</p> <p>\u201cElise.\u201d He scrubbed his palm down over his face. \u201cOh, God ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? And no, I\u2019m not going to pretend I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rules. Between professors and students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not teaching any classes of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my T.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make my own decisions, no one else does.\u201d</p> <p>At least that was true here, in the slice of life she had in the human world. And she would be damned if some rule in a society that was not her own was going to keep her from doing what she wanted. She got way too much of that in her species.</p><p>Troy laughed in a harsh rush. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having this conversation. I mean, I\u2019ve had it in my head with you a thousand times. I just never thought it would actually happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care what people think.\u201d And that much was true. When it came to humans. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say the same. I mean, I\u2019ve never done this before. I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, the whole teacher/student thing. But I\u2019ve never crossed this line. I thought I was, you know, stronger than this. You\u2019re different, though, and because you are ... you\u2019re making me act differently.\u201d</p><p>There was a curious helplessness to him as he stared at her, as if he had struggled and lost a fight.</p><p>Now she looked at his lips.</p><p>As she did, his scent flared again and she saw his chest rise\u2014</p><p>\u201cProfessor Becke? Hi!\u201d</p> <p>The human woman who came up to him was petite and curvy and wearing perfume. With her makeup on and her blond hair curling around her shoulders, she seemed like she belonged on a poster advertising the university as an attractive and fun place to go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in your survey class, or was in it, and my roommate\u2014she\u2019s here also. Hey! Amber! Look who\u2019s here! Anyway, I was the one who had to go home because my parents were getting a divorce, and you let me delay my exam. Well, I ...\u201d</p><p>All kinds of nouns and verbs continued to come out of the girl, and then Amber, the roommate, bounded over like a puppy. Meanwhile, Troy seemed scrambled, as if the intimacy that had flared before the interruption was a place he had to travel back from.</p><p>Gathering her coat and her backpack, Elise pushed her chair into the table and lifted her hand in a goodbye. As he nodded at her, there was a desperation in his eyes, as if a gift he had long hoped for was slipping out of his hands and falling into a ravine.</p><p>Elise made the sign for call-me up by her ear, and then she was striding out to where the reception area was. The older man who worked nights behind the desk was bent over his computer as if he were in the process of logging out of the network, his blue parka and his knit hat already placed on the counter next to a thermos she guessed was empty.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said as she came up to the glass doors.</p><p>He grunted. Which was the best he ever did.</p><p>Outside, the wind was strong and cold as a slap, and she one-strapped her pack so she could zip up her coat. The walkway was illuminated by lampposts, and sure enough, delicate flakes were wisping in and out of the light as if they wanted to dance with each other, but were feeling shy.</p><p>For a moment, Elise glanced around and thought that Allishon would never enjoy the quiet night again, never walk among swirling flurries, feeling the warmth inside her coat and the chill upon her cheeks. And Elise wished she had spent more time with the female. The two of them had been so different, so opposite, the bookworm and the wild child, but still, maybe there could have been some kind of opportunity to change the outcome. Shift the destiny. Flip back the switch that had taken Allishon away from safety.</p><p>Not to be, however.</p><p>Elise stepped off onto the brown grass and strode away from the light, the parking lot, the classroom building that was close on the other side.</p><p>When the shadows fully claimed her ... she dematerialized away, traveling in a scatter of molecules to her father\u2019s sprawling Georgian mansion that was miles away from campus. Troy was on her mind, maybe as a distraction, maybe as a legitimate curiosity. Probably some of both. Still, the trip didn\u2019t require much more than the blink of an eye and a wink of the will. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she re-formed on her father\u2019s lawn, Allishon\u2019s death converged with memories of Troy staring across the table of papers, his eyes burning, his body sending off its scent of arousal. Life could change in a moment, and didn\u2019t that mean you should take advantage of however many nights and days you had?</p><p>Time wasn\u2019t so much relative as an illusion. If she\u2019d known her cousin was going to die, she herself would have made different choices. On that theory, if she knew she had a week left, or maybe a month, shouldn\u2019t she see where things went with a male, even if he was just a human?</p><p>Troy had her number. And she had his. How did this work? They texted occasionally, but only about scheduling things.</p><p>A date was a \u201cthing\u201d to be scheduled, though, right?</p> <p>Walking in the grand front door, she started trying out conversations in her head, ways of greeting and following up on\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been!\u201d</p><p>Elise froze. And realized as she saw a grandfather clock and a set of stairs that was right out of Buckingham Palace that she had seriously screwed up: She\u2019d come in through the formal entrance ... and walked right past the open door to her father\u2019s study.</p><p>With her coat on, and snowflakes in her hair, and her backpack on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cElise!\u201d</p> <p>Through the open door, her father had stood up from behind his carved desk, his shock and horror more appropriate to someone having crashed an SUV through his mansion.</p><p>And actually, his pale face, his peeled-wide eyes, and his ruffled evening coat might have been funny. Under other circumstances.</p><p>With a curse, Elise closed her lids and braced herself for the onslaught.</p><p>TWO</p><p>THE BLACK DAGGER BROTHERHOOD MANSION</p><p>\u201cSo what is that?\u201d</p> <p>As Rhage\u2019s daughter piped up, he froze with his gun halfway into his under-arm holster. For a split second, he decided to pretend that he hadn\u2019t heard her\u2014but that was going to get him nowhere. In the two months or so that he and Mary had had Bitty, they\u2019d both learned that she was smart as a whip and tenacious as flypaper.</p><p>Ordinarily, he got a kick out of those two defining characteristics. When it came to describing the technical specs of a forty-caliber killing weapon to his thirteen-year-old? Pass. He wished she had an empty skull and ADD.</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d</p><p>He glanced into the mirror over the bureau, hoping against hope that she had moved on to something, anything else. Nope. Bitty was sitting on his and Mary\u2019s new bed, the one in the third-floor suite that Trez had graciously moved out of so the three of them could have adjoining rooms. The girl was way on the small side, her skinny arms and legs the kind of thing that made him want to move to the tropics instead of live in Upstate New Freezing-Fucking-Cold. Hell, even under a body weight\u2019s worth of fleece, she seemed fragile.</p><p>But the oh, dainties ended right there. Her brown eyes were direct as an adult\u2019s, old as a mountain range, keen as an eagle\u2019s. Her dark hair was thick and shiny, falling past her shoulders, nearly the exact color of Mary\u2019s. And her aura, her ... whatever, life force, spirit, soul ... was as tangible as her physical form seemed almost transient.</p><p>He took pride in the fact that the longer she stayed with them, the more she was emerging. Not like a flower.</p><p>Like a fucking oak.</p><p>Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut that didn\u2019t mean he wanted to get into the nitty-gritty of his job killing lessers with her.</p> <p>And nope. Really not interested in the whole birds-and-bees talk, either. At least they had another twelve years or so to prepare for that.</p><p>\u201cFather?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>Rhage closed his eyes. Okay, so every time she called him that, his heart got too big for his chest and this unreal, won-the-lottery feeling sunrised all over him. It took him back to right after he and Mary had been mated and he\u2019d gotten to call her shellan for the first time.</p><p>Pure, full-bore awesomeness.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bitty prompted.</p><p>That happy pink bubblegum glow faded as he seated the gun and clipped its strap over the butt. \u201cIt\u2019s a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014it\u2019s a gun. But what kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Smith and Wesson forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many bullets are in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He picked up his leather jacket and smiled. \u201cHey, you ready for movie night when I get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to tell me about your gun?\u201d</p><p>Because if you\u2019re the audience, I can\u2019t separate what I do with it from a discussion of its specs. \u201cIt\u2019s just not all that interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what keeps you alive, though, right?\u201d The little girl\u2019s eyes locked on the black daggers that were holstered on his chest, handles down. \u201cLike your knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s interesting. To me, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, how \u2019bout we talk about this when your mom and I are both here? You know, like, later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do I know you\u2019ll come home safe?\u201d</p><p>Rhage blinked. \u201cI am never not coming back to you and Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you die, though?\u201d</p><p>His first thought was:</p><p>MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARY!</p><p>His Mary, as a trained therapist\u2014who had treated Z with all his demons, for godsakes\u2014could deal with this so much better than some meathead fighter like him could. But his shellan was at Safe Place, working, and he didn\u2019t feel right about calling and possibly interrupting her with anything other than an arterial bleed or a house fire. Zombie apocalypse.

Surely there had to be a curriculum for this kind of thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for me, okay?\u201d</p> <p>Jesus, it was scary for him, too. He had so much more to lose with her in his life.</p><p>Rhage went over and knelt down. Bitty had tucked her arms around herself and her eyes were steady as if she were not going to accept a load of bullcrap.</p><p>Opening his mouth, he ...</p><p>Closed it. And wondered what he needed to do to jump-start his brain. Maybe bang it into a wall?</p><p>\u201cYou know my car?\u201d he heard himself say.</p> <p>As Bitty nodded, he had an image of Puskar Nepal\u2013ing himself until he passed the fuck out from foot-to-forehead contact: Of all the things for his subconscious, or whatever was running his program, to spit out, he led with his GTO?</p><p>\u201cWell, you know when I was teaching you to drive?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Bits, right before those kids attacked Mary and you found out that I have a dragon for an alter ego? Har-har, good times, good times.</p><p>God, he wanted to throw up.</p><p>As she nodded again, he said, \u201cYou remember when you were figuring out the gears and the steering wheel and the brakes? Going back and forth, again and again, until you could get it right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know how I drive that car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Now, she smiled. \u201cFast. Very fast and fun. It\u2019s like a rocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, someday, you\u2019re going to drive her just as well as I do. You\u2019re going to know where the gears are by feel, and you\u2019re going to work the clutch and the gas without thought. And if someone swerves in front of you, you\u2019re going to react so quick and so sure, you\u2019re not going to be aware of even thinking about it. If somebody slams on the brakes, you\u2019re going to shift lanes instinctually. You\u2019re going to feel the tires hydroplaning on the highway in the rain and you\u2019re going to know to slow up on the gas, but not hit the brakes. And all of that is going to happen because you\u2019re going to practice, practice, practice on a car that is kept in tip-top shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to practice. So I drive better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Even if the people around you drive dangerously, you\u2019re going to be aware and focused and trained to deal with whatever comes at you.\u201d He put his palm over his daggers, over his heart. \u201cI have been out there fighting for a century, Bitty. And everything I take with me into the field\u2014the weapons, the gear, the support in the form of my brothers\u2014all of it is engineered to keep me safe. Is it a perfect system? No. But it\u2019s the best it gets, I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>Bitty\u2019s arms uncoiled and she looked down. The pink and green bracelet on her wrist was made out of faceted beads that sparkled like real gems. Moving the thing around and around, she took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cAre you ... good at it? I mean, the fighting?\u201d</p><p>God, he wished he was an accountant. He really did. Because if he were some pocket-protector\u2019d numbers cruncher, he wouldn\u2019t be having to tell an innocent that he excelled at killing things.</p> <p>\u201cAre you?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very good at keeping myself and my brothers safe. I\u2019m so good at it, they\u2019re having me teach younger people how to do it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded once again. \u201cThat\u2019s what they were saying. At Last Meal the other night. I heard people talking about you and the other Brothers teaching people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m heading right now. While you hang here with Bella and Nalla, I\u2019m meeting the trainee class out in Caldwell to show them how to stay safe.\u201d</p><p>Bitty tilted her head, her brown hair cascading over her shoulder. And he let her stare at him for as long as she wanted. If that made him a little late to work, who cared.</p><p>\u201cYou must be really good at it to be a teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I swear to you, Bitty. I am effective and I take no more chances than I absolutely have to in order to get my job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the beast will keep you safe, won\u2019t he.\u201d</p><p>Rhage nodded. \u201cYou better believe it. You saw him. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, sunshine replacing the worry. \u201cHe likes me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you. But he doesn\u2019t love people who get aggressive with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He put his palms up, and as she high-fived him, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be alone, Bitty. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, as he sought to relieve any and all of her anxiety\u2014and his own, for that matter\u2014he nearly came out with the one thing Bitty didn\u2019t know about her adoptive parents. Yes, her new old man had a dragon living under his skin, but her new mom had an even fancier secret.</p><p>Mary was a unique flavor of immortal. Thanks to the Scribe Virgin\u2014and this remained true even though V\u2019s mahmen was no longer in charge\u2014Mary did not age, and could choose when she went unto the Fade. It was a gift beyond measure, insulating this family in ways that other people\u2019s weren\u2019t.</p><p>Except Rhage stayed quiet on that front. Even though the knowledge might have helped Bitty in the moment, he really felt like it was Mary\u2019s information to share, not his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re never going to be alone, Bitty,\u201d he repeated. \u201cI swear to you.\u201d</p><p>As Mary sat behind her desk at Safe Place, she put her bag down and shrugged out of her parka. Extending her arm, she pulled the sleeve of her turtleneck up and smiled at the pink and green bracelet that twinkled at her wrist.</p><p>She and Bitty had made matching ones the other night, the pair of them sitting at Fritz\u2019s kitchen table in the mansion, a jewelry-making kit spread out everywhere, a huge array of clear plastic boxes holding a rainbow\u2019s worth of iridescent beads. They had talked about nothing and everything, and greeted each person who came in, and split a bag of Combos and a Mountain Dew. They had also made a necklace for Rhage, a different-colored bracelet for Lassiter, and braid for Nalla to play with. And even Boo had come over and curled up to watch, the black cat\u2019s green eyes inspecting everything.</p><p>In a mansion full of priceless stuff? That time together had been the most precious, irreplaceable thing.</p> <p>Looking across her desk, Mary reached out and picked up a photograph of Bitty from two weeks before, when the little girl had been taking selfies with Rhage\u2019s phone. Bit was making a crazy face, her dark hair back-brushed until she looked like something out of an eighties glam metal band.</p><p>And in fact, Lassiter was over on the left, doing his best Nikki Sixx impression.</p><p>Unexpected tears pricked Mary\u2019s eyes. In all her life, she had never expected to be a woman who had pictures of a daughter at her work desk. Nah, that hypothetical, blessed, stranger of a person, that lucky female who had a husband and a family, and holidays to look forward to, and homemade things on her wrist? That had always been someone else, a stranger whose reality was something you watched on TV or saw in Maytag ads or overheard at the table next door in a restaurant.</p><p>While you were eating alone.</p><p>Mary Luce was the nurse to an ailing mother who had died horribly and too young. Mary Luce was the cancer survivor left infertile after chemo. Mary Luce was the ghost on the fringes, the shadow that passed unnoticed through a room, an allegory of where you didn\u2019t want to end up.</p> <p>Except life had corkscrewed on her in the best of all possible ways. Now? She was exactly where she had never even dared to dream of being.</p><p>And yup, this unexpected destiny came with a not-too-small dose of PTSD. Hell, sometimes, when she woke up next to her gorgeous vampire of a husband? And especially now, when she tiptoed into another bedroom to check on Bitty at nightfall? She expected to wake up, back in her nightmare of a real life.</p><p>But no, she thought as she put the picture down. This was the real stuff. Here and now was the story she was living.</p><p>And it was ... amazing. So full of love, family, and happiness that it felt as though the sun lived in the center of her chest.</p><p>They were all survivors, her, Rhage, and Bitty. She of her illness. Rhage of the curse he had to live with. Bitty of the unimaginable domestic abuse she and her mahmen had suffered at the hands of her birth father. The three of their lives had started to intersect here, at Safe Place, when Bitty and her mahmen had come in seeking shelter. And then Bitty\u2019s mother had died, leaving her an orphan.</p><p>The opportunity to take the girl in had seemed too good to be true. It still did, sometimes.</p> <p>If they could just get through this six-month waiting period, the adoption would be final and Mary could take a deep breath. At least there were no relatives coming forward. Even though Bitty had talked initially about some uncle, her mother had never mentioned having a brother or disclosed anything about any blood relations, either during intake or in subsequent therapy sessions. Notices posted on closed Facebook and Yahoo groups had yielded nothing so far.</p><p>God willing, it would stay that way.</p><p>On that note, Mary signed in to the computer network, her heart starting to bang in her ribs, a sick flush blooming in her body. As social media aficionados went, she was below amateur status, the anti-Kardashian\u2014and yet every night, but only once a night, she hopped onto Facebook.</p><p>And prayed she found nothing.</p><p>The FB group she checked was one specifically devoted to vampires, its closed roster restricted to members of the species. Created by V after the raids, moderated by Fritz\u2019s staff, the clearinghouse was an opportunity for folks to connect about anything from safe-house locations\u2014always in code\u2014to garage sales.</p><p>Scanning the posts in the last twenty-four hours, she exhaled in a rush. Not at thing.</p><p>The relief made her office spin around\u2014at least until she went to check the Yahoo group. Recipe for Crock-Pot. Knitting group having a meeting ... snowblower for sale ... question about where to get a computer fixed ...</p><p>Also nothing.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, God,\u201d she whispered as she put another small check on her wall calendar.</p><p>Almost to the end of December, which meant they were nearly two whole months down. By May? They could move forward.</p><p>As her heart shifted out of tachycardia, she wondered how in the hell she was going to face this IT gauntlet another hundred and thirty times or so. But she had no other choice. The good news was that she was able to stick to this once-and-only-once-a-night check. Otherwise she\u2019d be on her damn phone every fifteen minutes.</p><p>She had to be fair, though, to whoever else might be out there. Extinguishing parental rights in blood relations was serious business, and with no modern precedents in the vampire race to follow, she, Marissa, as head of Safe Place, Wrath, the Blind King, and Saxton, the King\u2019s head counsel, had had to devise a procedure that provided an adequate notice period.</p><p>Emotions did not have waiting periods, however, and moms and dads who loved their kids couldn\u2019t toggle back the speed of their hearts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if Marissa could read minds, the female put her head in the open doorway. \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>Mary smiled at her boss and her dear friend. \u201cNothing.

Bitty\u2019s got her physical exam scheduled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Good luck\u2014and it\u2019s too bad you have to go all the way in to Havers\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Jane says she just doesn\u2019t have the appropriate knowledge base. Pediatrics for vampires is a thing, apparently.\u201d</p><p>Marissa smiled gently. \u201cWell, my brother may be complicated for me personally, but I have never questioned his ability to provide good care to his patients. Bitty couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather just keep her with us at the training center\u2019s clinic. But at the end of the day, what\u2019s right for her is all we care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called being a good parent.\u201d</p> <p>Mary looked at her bracelet. \u201cAmen to that.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>\u201cElise! Do not tell me you have been to university!\u201d</p><p>As her father came charging out of his study, he looked as much like a raging bull as a whip-thin, utterly distinguished aristocrat could\u2014which was, actually, not like a bull at all, but more like a European prince trying to flag his butler down. Felixe the Younger did have, however, a highly uncharacteristic flush to his face, and he had failed to button his evening jacket as he had rushed from his desk at her.</p><p>If he\u2019d been a commoner, he would have been picking up pieces of furniture and throwing them around as he carpet-bombed the air with variations on an f-word theme.</p><p>And as she faced off at him, from out of nowhere, she heard that line from M*A*S*H: Winchesters do not sweat, we perspire. And Winchesters do not perspire.</p> <p>Or something to that effect. You had to love Charles Emerson Winchester III.</p><p>\u201cExplain yourself!\u201d</p><p>There were a couple of ways to handle this, she supposed. Deny, deny, deny, but with a backpack hanging off her shoulder, those pesky snowflakes all over her, and the fact that she\u2019d previously told him she was going to stay in and read? Hard sell, for one thing; for another, she detested lies. Another option was walking away, but that was a total no-go\u2014she had been raised properly, and that meant that she couldn\u2019t be rude to her elders.</p><p>Annnnnd that left her with door number three.</p><p>The truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019vebeengoingbacktoschool.\u201d As her father frowned and leaned in toward her, she put some volume into her voice and slowed things down. \u201cYes, I have been going to school again.\u201d</p><p>Her father fell silent in shock and she studied him as if he were a stranger. He had a patrician face, the even features distilled by good breeding to the point that you were aware he was of masculine derivation, but the sexual affiliation was at a whisper, not a shout. His hair was dark, whereas hers was streaked with blond, and his eyes were pale gray, not blue. But their diction was identical and so were their good posture, their moderated affect ... and their sense of values.</p><p>So, yes, she did feel as though she had done something wrong. Even though she was past her transition, arguably of age especially if you applied a human standard, and had done nothing more reckless than sit in a quiet library for three hours grading papers.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ... have you ... how can you ...\u201d It was a while before her father could get through an entire sentence. \u201cI forbade you to go there! After the raids, I explicitly told you that it was unsafe and that you were not to be permitted to go! And that was before ...\u201d</p><p>Elise closed her eyes. That last sentence wasn\u2019t finished because it was That Which Was Not Discussed.</p><p>Allishon\u2019s name hadn\u2019t been uttered since the night word had come unto the household that she had passed. They hadn\u2019t even had a Fade ceremony for her.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat have you to say for yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly be so delinquent! If your mahmen were still alive, she would be apoplectic! How long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year!\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the butler came scurrying in from the back of the house, as if he had heard the disturbance and was concerned some crazy person had broken in to the mansion for which he was responsible. When the doggen got a gander at her father? He backed off fast as a mouse before a cat.</p><p>\u201cYou have been going for a year?\u201d her father hissed, his voice shaking. \u201cHow have you\u2014you have been lying to me? For that long?\u201d</p><p>Elise shucked her backpack and put it between her feet. \u201cFather, what was I to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay here! It is dangerous in Caldwell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the raids are over. And even when they occurred, the slayers were hitting vampire targets, not human ones. It\u2019s a human school\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans are savages! You know exactly how much damage they do to each other! You see the news\u2014the guns, the violence! Even if they were not targeting you as another species, you could get caught in the crossfire!\u201d</p><p>As Elise\u2019s eyes drifted to the high ceiling, she searched for some correct combination of words to make this all go away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not doing this here.\u201d Her father\u2019s voice dropped. \u201cIn my study.

Behind her, tight on her heels, her father fell into a full march, and she was not surprised when the carved door clapped shut, closing them in together.</p><p>The room was lovely, a fire crackling in the hearth, cheery light flickering over the leather chairs, the first editions on the mahogany shelves, the oil paintings of hunting dogs that her father had owned in the Old Country.</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he snapped, though not loudly.</p> <p>She knew exactly where he wanted her and she went to the chair across from his desk, lowering herself into its antique contours and being sure to keep her pack with her.

Just like her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know where she went. It was not to university, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss the particulars and neither are you. What you are going to do is swear to me, right here and now, that you will not violate my trust again. That you will stay here and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise bolted up out of the seat before she was aware of moving. \u201cI can\u2019t waste my life sitting here, night by night, going nowhere and doing nothing but needlepoint. I want my advanced degree, I want to finish what I started! I want a life!\u201d</p><p>As he recoiled, he seemed as surprised by the outburst as she was. And to defuse the insubordination, Elise sank back down into the chair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Father. I don\u2019t mean to speak rashly, it\u2019s just ... why can\u2019t you understand that I want to be free to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not your station and you know it. I have been more than lenient with you, but that time has passed. I will be entertaining suitable males for mating\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise let her head fall back. \u201cI want more than that, Father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour first cousin is dead. After they already lost their son in the raids! You see the suffering of her parents nightly in this house! Do you want that for me? Do you care so little for me that you want me to mourn my only daughter after I\u2019ve already lost my shellan?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing a groan, she stared across the desktop. The objects upon it\u2014the sterling-silver-framed pictures of her and her mother, the pens in their holders, the ashtray in which one of his pipes sat\u2014were as familiar as the backs of her own hands, things that she had never not known. They were also part of the comfort of home, symbols of the security that she at once valued, but also wanted to escape.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d her father said. \u201cDo you want that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is to talk about her.\u201d Elise sat forward. \u201cNo one ever speaks about Allishon. I don\u2019t even know how she died. Peyton came here and talked to the three of you behind closed doors\u2014next thing I know, her room is shut up tight, Auntie has taken to her bed, and Uncle looks like a zombie. Nobody has told me anything. There\u2019s no Fade ceremony, no mourning, just this shut-off void in the midst of everyone suffering. Why can\u2019t we just come forward and be honest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not about your cousin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Allishon. Why can\u2019t you say her name?\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s thin lips got even thinner. \u201cDo not attempt to distract me from the real problem. Which is you lying to me whilst you put yourself in danger. What happened to your cousin is in the past. There is no cause for conversation.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re so wrong about that. And if you\u2019re going to try to use whatever tragedy happened to her to persuade me, then you better tell me what really happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to explain anything to you.\u201d Her father banged a fist into his desk, making one of the framed photographs jump. \u201cYou are my daughter. That is a sufficiency unto itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so afraid of talking about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis conversation is over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because you think she got what she deserved?\u201d Elise was aware of her body starting to shake as she finally spoke what had been on her mind for weeks. \u201cIs nobody in this house saying anything because you all disapproved of the way she was behaving, and the fact that she died because of it doesn\u2019t make you sad, but rather angry? Angry because you don\u2019t want the potential social complications for our bloodline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise! You were not raised to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllishon went out at night. She dated males who were not of our class and consorted with humans\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and now she\u2019s dead. Tell me, honestly, are you really worried about me getting hurt\u2014or is it more about the potential embarrassment for you and the bloodline? One unconventional female with a tragic event may eventually be forgiven, but two? Never. Is that your truth, Father? Because if it is, that strikes me as far more ugly than my seeking an education.\u201d</p><p>Axe left The Keys with the scent of the human woman on his skin. As he stepped out of the sprawling, interlocking series of buildings, he breathed in the cold, fresh air and felt his overheated body steam under his cloak.

Arming himself, he gathered the voluminous fall of the cloak and folded it into itself until the outerwear appeared to be nothing more than a three-quarter-length coat.</p><p>A moment later, he dematerialized and re-formed in an alley eleven blocks farther into the worst part of Caldie.</p><p>He was not the first of his fellow trainees to arrive. Peyton and Boone were already there, the pair of them standing together under a fire escape. They were in black and as heavily armed as Axe was, but unlike him, they didn\u2019t smell like sex.</p> <p>And Peyton didn\u2019t smell like weed or booze, either. Fucking miracle.</p><p>The male smiled. \u201cBeen busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Axe clapped palms with him and did the same to Boone. \u201cWhere\u2019s everyone?\u201d</p><p>Peyton smiled, flashing his fangs. The guy was right out of the Perfectly Bred Handbook\u2014and so exactly the kind of bastard Axe hated on principle. Rich, blond-haired, with polished nails and an off-duty wardrobe that looked like something Zoolander would wear, Pey-pey was a pey-pain in the ass. The only thing that saved him? He was a helluva shot, and either too arrogant or too stupid to understand his own limits: In training, he fought just as hard as everyone else did, took way too many chances with himself and his safety, and was so out of control, all Axe could think of was a Lamborghini that had lost half of its wheels, most of its undercarriage, and all of its brakes.</p><p>As it headed for a brick wall.</p> <p>So yeah, Peyton, first blooded son of Peythone, was the exception that proved the aristocrats-should-never-be-in-the-field rule.</p><p>But Axe still wasn\u2019t all buddy-buddy with the SOB.</p><p>Not that he went there with anybody.</p><p>Boone, on the other hand, was the anti-Pey-pey. Quiet, huge, and unusually physically adept, he was the crouching tiger of the group, the prowler who kept to himself and the shadows, the one who was most likely to pounce on your back and slit your throat with a knife you weren\u2019t even aware of him having in his hand. Axe was pretty sure the guy had been seriously fucked up by somebody or something earlier in his life. For all his outward calm, Boone was never, ever truly relaxed or at ease. Whether he was reading on his iPhone, listening to his music on the bus, or waiting for commands from the Brothers, you always had the sense he knew where everybody in a given space was.</p><p>As if he were waiting for an attack\u2014and goddamned if he was going to let anyone get the best of him.</p><p>Watch the sleeper, Axe always thought. Before the cocksucker went Grim Reaper all over your ass.</p> <p>Craeg and Paradise arrived next, the pair of them dressed in black and covered in weapons. The couple was as committed as a mated twosome, but they were not lovey-dovey in class or outside of it. And thank God for that.</p><p>After all, Axe hated vomiting\u2014and if there was one thing guaranteed to make his stomach go evac? It was the sight of two people going baby-talk and gooey-eye\u2019d all over each other. Back three years ago, when he\u2019d been doing heroin all the time, his nightmare had been when he\u2019d been too nodded out to change the channel on a Sandra-fucking-Bullock marathon.</p><p>Although he\u2019d liked The Blind Side.</p><p>Axe acknowledged them and stepped back as the rest of the greetings rolled out. And then there was a lull, during which he amused himself by watching Peyton try not to stare at Paradise. It was the same thing every night, that weak pining after a female the guy couldn\u2019t get, and it was good to see the pretty boy who undoubtedly had everything he ever wanted get shanked by fate.</p><p>So fucking pathetic.</p><p>Man, that was one lesson Axe\u2019s moms had taught him. Never give a female power over you. That shit will castrate you faster than a pair of surgical scissors.</p><p>Hell, look at what had happened to his old man after Axe\u2019s mom had left them. Decades and decades of mourning. A life wasted at the altar of \u201clove.\u201d An otherwise good male brought to his knees and kept there by an abandonment that was based on what someone else could fucking buy her.</p><p>As an old, familiar pain lit off behind his sternum, Axe bolted away from the sensation even as his body didn\u2019t move. Refocusing on the Paradise-Peyton-Craeg triangle, which wasn\u2019t a triangle at all for Craeg-adise, he found himself smiling. Yeah, the fact that the poor kid had won the girl made him happy. Craeg was the alpha of all alphas, the de facto leader of the trainees, but he came from nothing, just like Axe. Paradise, on the other hand, was the daughter of the King\u2019s First Advisor. You didn\u2019t get more pedigreed than that.</p> <p>But she had picked the scrub over the Great Gatsby.</p><p>Attagirl. One more reason to like her. Aside from her hunting skills.</p><p>The last trainee to arrive was the kind of female that would have gotten Axe\u2019s attention under any circumstances. And yup, with nothing but black leather covering her from head to foot, he took the opportunity to admire the view\u2014at a respectful distance. She was the cobra in the group, a sinewy, powerfully dangerous thing of beauty, with teal eyes, reflexes quicker than C4 exploding, and a subversive nature that Axe totally got.</p><p>But he\u2019d never hit that.</p><p>Even though she was hot as fuck, he had a couple of reasons for his uncharacteristic restraint, the main one being that you didn\u2019t shit where you ate. Although Craeg and Paradise had somehow won the destiny lottery by hooking up without losing their edge or hating each other in the end, that was not a set of dice Axe was interested in rolling. Oh, and P.S., he was about as into relationships as he was aristocrats. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Novo eased back against the brick tenement next to him, he nodded to her.</p><p>\u201cCold tonight,\u201d Peyton said to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s December,\u201d Novo muttered. \u201cYou want it to be eighty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, I do.\u201d</p> <p>Novo had some choice words under her breath for the guy, including \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cfucker,\u201d but nobody paid any attention to it. The pair of them had turned into conversational snipers, but only at each other, and hey, popcorn-and-Coke\u2019ing the show passed the time.</p><p>A blast of wind shot down the alley like it was being pursued by an enemy, and Axe flared his nostrils, testing the rush for scents of Brothers or humans ... or their enemy, the Lessening Society.</p><p>Nada. And that frustrated him.</p><p>After seven weeks of intensive training, that had covered everything from hand-to-hand combat skills and firearms to poisons, bombs, and stalking techniques, Axe wasn\u2019t alone in thinking they were ready for something other than fighting in the gym with themselves and studying hypotheticals. Each of them had their own reasons for wanting to get in the war, but the common denominator was they were all chomping at the bit to light some shit up.</p><p>And come on. They had been going in to the Black Dagger Brotherhood\u2019s hidden training center six nights a week, for six to eight, sometimes ten, hours at a time. And it hadn\u2019t been a case of a couple of seminars in classrooms and a paper typed up on your laptop. It had been hard, grueling work, and none of them had failed\u2014which proved the brutal tryouts, that had weeded the applicant pool from like sixty to the six of them, had picked the right half dozen to go through the program.</p> <p>Axe tested the air again. Still nothing. He\u2019d been stoked when, for the first time, they\u2019d been instructed to meet not at wherever the bus was going to pick them up to drive them in, but rather here in the field.</p><p>Maybe they were finally getting a chance to fight for real.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the checking of the watches started, the wrists popping up at first on the down-low, and later with increasing annoyance.</p><p>Axe didn\u2019t bother checking his. They were in the right place. They\u2019d gotten here at the right time. The Brothers would show when they were good and goddamn ready.</p><p>Fucking hell, this shit was making him twitchy, though.</p><p>He looked down the alley. Snow was starting to fall on the serious from all that cloud cover, but the currents of wind that topped these tightly packed four-and five-story deserted cages for humans meant that nothing penetrated the maze of alleys between the abandoned buildings. Off in the distance, sirens continued to echo back and forth across the city like the ambulance drivers and the cops were playing hide-and-seek blindfolded. No humans were walking anywhere in this area, as there was nothing to come here for, not even a crack house.</p> <p>Those were a little to the west. About three blocks.</p><p>He knew because he\u2019d used them\u2014</p><p>The gunshots came from all directions.</p><p>Up above. Down in front. From behind.</p><p>Axe dived away from the bullets that whizzed by his ears and his ass, and instantly regretted that he hadn\u2019t thought to have guns in his hands already. They\u2019d been taught that. Goddamn it.</p><p>As he rolled across the pitted pavement, he fumbled to get his forties against his palms, but it was like trying to catch tennis balls while you were falling down a crevasse: His coat was flapping around, getting tangled in his arms and slapping him in the face, and his limbs were sloppy and uncoordinated as he tried to find a way to save himself from getting killed.</p><p>Somehow he made it to a shallow doorway in the wall, got his guns up, and then he was assessing whether the fire was a test or the actual enemy. He couldn\u2019t tell. He couldn\u2019t see anything, couldn\u2019t scent much. People were running everywhere. Bullets were still flying. He had no idea who to make a target out of, or what he should do, or what the fuck was going on.</p><p>The chaos was unexpected. So was the grind-to-a-halt-while-faster-than-the-speed-of-light dichotomy: His brain couldn\u2019t seem to decide whether things were in slow motion or going at a dead run\u2014</p> <p>And then a bullet came so close to his face that the tip of his nose felt the burn.</p><p>Fuck this, he thought as he pivoted.</p><p>With a violent thrust, Axe smashed his shoulder into the door, splintering the rotten wood. Just as he was falling inward, Novo streaked by, and he caught her arm, yanking her in with him. Together, the pair of them landed on concrete that had all the give of a morgue slab, arms and legs tangling, a split second of oh-fuck freezing them both.</p><p>Right away, they were back up on the vertical, and just as they had been taught, they went spine-to-spine with guns raised, forming the best defensive unit they could. Axe\u2019s eyes burned as they strained to see something, anything, but the darkness was too thick to penetrate. His ears stepped into the sensory void, however, isolating and droning out the sounds of bullets and bodies moving in the alley, focusing on ...</p><p>There was something dripping over to the left. Novo was breathing as hard as he was. And he could hear the beat of his own heart.</p><p>Wherever they were smelled like old air and twelve kinds of mold, suggesting that the place hadn\u2019t been opened up in a\u2014</p><p>\u201cClick, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>As the soft words were spoken, a gun muzzle made contact with his temple. And given the way Novo gasped, he was pretty sure that she had a forty pressed up tight to her chrome dome, too.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d Axe muttered.</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d the Brother Rhage said without censure. \u201cNeither of you are coming down for First Meal tomorrow morning. You failed your first field test.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FOUR</p><p>Sometimes it was better to just walk away.</p><p>Not that Elise necessarily felt any better about the confrontation with her father. But at least, as she sat up in her bedroom, staring at her reflection in her vanity mirror, there was consolation to be had that things hadn\u2019t gotten even worse.</p><p>Which, considering the stuff she\u2019d said to him ...</p> <p>What came next? Her lighting their house on fire?</p><p>She\u2019d meant every last word, though. None of it had been for show or distraction. And maybe if they\u2019d been a different kind of father and daughter, the hard things she\u2019d laid out would have opened the door to greater closeness, and forgiveness, and a mutual grieving.</p><p>Instead, there had been anger on both sides, and now her father was going to petition the King to make her a sehcluded female. If she\u2019d thought she\u2019d had problems before? Assuming the petition was accepted\u2014and given his station in the glymera, why wouldn\u2019t it be\u2014she would have less than no rights. She would be a physical possession of her father\u2019s, like a lamp or a car. A toaster oven.</p><p>A fricking couch.</p><p>As far as her father was concerned, the issue was closed. She wasn\u2019t going to university anymore, and she was going to accept punishment for lying in the form of that guardianship. Done and dusted.</p> <p>In the background, the details of her room became oh, so glaring, the silk brocade drapes, the canopied bed, the French antiques and the hand-painted wallpaper like a set for a Merchant Ivory film.</p><p>You know, something Keira Knightley would be in, wearing a corset and a cascading hairpiece.</p><p>None of it was Elise\u2019s style. Hell, she didn\u2019t even know what her style was.</p><p>As her cellphone started to ring, she took it out of the coat she still hadn\u2019t bothered to take off yet and looked at who it was.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said as she braced her head in her hand. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m in the middle of training. Are you okay?\u201d Peyton\u2019s voice was hushed, as if her cousin had cupped his hand around his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I can\u2019t really talk now. I\u2019m playing dead in an alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She knew the guy was into some kinky things, but really? \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, in an alley,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI just got killed in a field exercise and I\u2019m waiting for my punishment. Meet me in an hour.\u201d</p><p>As he gave her an address downtown, she shook her head even though he couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. While you\u2019re playing dead, I\u2019m under house arrest. I\u2019m stuck here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Guess two could play at the surprise, surprise! game. \u201cLong story. I can\u2019t get away to see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Just crack a window and ghost out. I\u2019ll see you in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>The connection was cut off, and Elise took the phone away from her ear as if she could will her cousin back on her cell.</p><p>Peyton had been the one to come and tell the family what had happened to Allishon. And although Elise had been forbidden to be in the room or hear any of the details, he had visited her afterward and told her if she needed anything, she could always come to him.</p><p>He\u2019d probably meant that more in terms of dealing with Allishon\u2019s death, but Elise didn\u2019t feel like she had anywhere else to turn.</p><p>When her phone rang again, she answered immediately. \u201cI\u2019m serious, I can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d a male voice said.</p><p>\u201cTroy! Oh, jeez. I, ah, was expecting someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to know ...\u201d Her professor cleared his throat. \u201cYou know, that you got home okay. And I was, I was sorry we were interrupted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re a popular guy.\u201d Elise took a deep breath and really wished she could go back to worrying about something as simple as when they were going to go out. \u201cYou\u2019re bound to be approached in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, are you okay? You sound off? Is it because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome problems. Nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019ve never spoken about your family. I mean, I know you\u2019re not married\u2014but other than that ...\u201d</p><p>He had a nice voice, she thought. And his human accent was exotic in her ear. But it was so hard to switch gears from the very real trouble she had with her father to something as frivolous as dinner.</p><p>Which was clearly where he was headed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know where you\u2019re from,\u201d Troy prompted when she didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI\u2019ve never been able to place your accent. European, I know, but ...\u201d</p><p>As he went quiet again, clearly hoping she\u2019d fill in the details, she said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not from the States, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did you come here?\u201d</p><p>Oh, I was born in Caldwell. Just into a different species from you entirely.</p><p>\u201cAm I prying too much?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just ... my father found out I was going to school and he\u2019s really angry at me. I\u2019ve been sneaking around behind his back, and when I came home tonight, I got caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to get your degree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really. He\u2019s very ...\u201d She tried to think of the human word. \u201cHe\u2019s very traditional. Old school, you know. The only reason I got to go at all was because my mother talked him into it, but she passed during my freshman year and there you have it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am so sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>Elise rubbed her aching head. \u201cI appreciate that.

At the end of the session, you got to experience literal death.</p><p>Or as close to it as you could come while still having a damn heartbeat.</p><p>Axe let out a groan as he lay flat with his legs raised and held off the floor of an abandoned rooming house. Next to him, Novo was in the same pose, back against the cold concrete, legs extended out with heels six inches off the floor, palms down and by the hips. Every muscle, in both of them, was shaking, to the point where Axe\u2019s teeth were knocking together and sweat was pouring off his face.</p> <p>At least they weren\u2019t the only ones getting schooled.</p><p>Everyone had gotten \u201ckilled,\u201d even Craeg.</p><p>The Brother Rhage swung his flashlight away from Axe and Novo, the beam falling over to where Paradise and Peyton were doing push-ups, Marine-style ... before moving farther on to Boone and Craeg, who were rocking sit-ups.</p><p>When it came to stuff like this, the rule was, you went to exhaustion, and no one wanted to no m\u00e1s first. Even as Axe\u2019s body was in a full-on fist of pain, he set his brain free, taking himself back to The Keys, to the scaffolding, to that human female and the audience. He embedded his memory in the particulars, the feel of her under his hands, the taste of her mouth, the driving thrusts of the sex. There was nothing emotional in it; if his last experience before coming to class had been rotating tires on a car, he would have been thinking about wrenches, radials, and hubcaps.</p><p>He remembered everything he could and\u2014</p><p>The blinding light of Rhage\u2019s torch splashed into Axe\u2019s face like acid. \u201cBkdw nbh, koy dwn skfg.\u201d</p> <p>Axe tried to squeeze out a What? but it was like forcing a city bus through a keyhole.</p><p>Rhage bent down and spoke slowly. \u201cYou can stop, son. You\u2019re finished. Everyone else has quit.\u201d</p><p>It was like releasing a rubber band after you pulled the thing tight. His body let go with a corporeal snap!, all parts of him hitting the floor, the back of his skull included. As pain red-lit his brain, he didn\u2019t have the strength to tell his lungs to get pumping. They were either going to or not, and he didn\u2019t particularly care one way or another what the result was.</p><p>In his mind, he had a passing thought that that was not normal. Not healthy. Not right.</p><p>But it was not the first time he\u2019d had such a blas\u00e9 attitude to his own life and death.</p><p>Conversation happened above him, Vishous and Rhage talking at the rest of the class, but Axe was too busy with the re-oxygenation process to follow any of it.</p><p>When he finally sat up, he found that it was only trainees in the tenement. The Brothers had left.</p><p>A lighter flared, and Peyton\u2019s face got washed with orange illumination as he lit up a cigarette. \u201cIt\u2019s one a.m. We need food and a drink. This was a cluster-fuck tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Muttering. Cursing. And then Craeg stuck out a hand to Axe to help him to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYou coming with us?\u201d the guy said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Axe heard himself reply. \u201cWhat the hell.\u201d</p><p>He was tired, he was hungry, and he was poor\u2014and whenever they went out, Peyton insisted on putting the bill on his AmEx. Good enough equation for Axe, especially as this way, he didn\u2019t have to admit to anyone that he survived on ramen noodles when he wasn\u2019t eating in the training center\u2019s break room.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Craeg said at his elbow. \u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to fight now,\u201d Axe muttered.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. This sucked.\u201d</p><p>Click, you\u2019re dead.</p><p>At this rate, the Brotherhood wasn\u2019t going to let them engage the enemy for months. Maybe years.</p><p>Back out in the alley, nobody was talking much, that refrain clearly playing in other people\u2019s heads. At least the cold air felt good, and shit, the snow was really coming down now, the fall so thick the stuff was making it to the ground even in the alleys.</p><p>As they headed over to Commerce Street, Axe replayed the cluster-fuck over and over again, imaging himself with his guns out already, better prepared for the ambush, more ready to fight. Next thing he knew, Peyton\u2019s favorite after-training haunt had somehow materialized in front of him.</p><p>The cigar bar was as pretentious as it sounded, the interior done in English Country Estate with all kinds of leather armchairs and a lot of dark, heavy coffee tables and stools. There were no TV screens, though, no human sports flickering in the corners, and the food was good\u2014not that his noodles were much of a standard. The main negative? The human clientele were such arrogant assholes with their Mercedes and their Range Rovers getting valet-parked, and their women-as-accessories girlfriends, but at least the dipshits were so self-absorbed that they couldn\u2019t care less about the vampires who mixed in with them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Paradise and Novo got a lot of attention.</p><p>And yup, that made the males training with them want to get their weapons back out.</p><p>The ma\u00eetre d\u2019 rushed forward to Peyton and started in with the welcoming act. Their regular seating area had been reserved, and Axe took a pass on the ass-kissing session, walking away from the group to the back, where the emergency exit was.</p><p>Novo sat down with him and he ordered two Scotches, one for each of them, as the others filed in and deep-seated in the stuffed chairs. There was a low table in middle with a humidor and a series of ashtrays, and soon enough, there were various cocktails and then plates of tapas filling the surface up.</p> <p>\u201c... gun range tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Axe rubbed his face. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d Novo repeated, \u201cyou might want to chill on that club before sessions. You\u2019re out of it right now, and you don\u2019t want to look bad on the gun range tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s fucking my head is my shit shab performance tonight.\u201d He swirled the liquor in his glass, coating the ice cubes with a wash of Scotch. \u201cHell, maybe I\u2019d have done better if I had stayed at The Keys awhile longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou going to bring me sometime?\u201d She took a pull off her glass and eased back. \u201cI want to see what it\u2019s all about.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes traveled up and down her body. \u201cYeah, I think you can handle it. Wouldn\u2019t say that about most females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexist much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFemales have better standards than males. But you\u2019re one of us.\u201d</p><p>Novo threw her head back and laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t decide whether to be offended or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I order you another Scotch, will that help you\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was like a car accident in his head. One second, he was cruising along the deserted highway of his normal state as an oversexed, self-shaming guilt-whore ... and the next, all his thoughts, every ounce of cognition, even on his subconscious level, slammed into a five-foot-ten-inch blond female with eyes like an angel, a body right out of heaven, and the unusual combination of a spooked look and a jaw that was forged in iron.</p> <p>Axe straightened in his seat like someone had jumper-cabled his ass to a Chevy, and everything went tunnel with her the light at the end, the glow around her created by his reaction to her presence\u2014</p><p>Peyton got in the way.</p><p>That miserable motherfucker had the colossal nerve to stand up and greet whoever it was with a hug. And then he talked to her, his muscular body blocking Axe\u2019s view, the back of his head making an excellent target for a bullet or the claw of a hammer or maybe even a falling piano as far as Axe was concerned.</p><p>\u201cFYI,\u201d Novo said softly, \u201cshooting him is not going to get my second Scotch faster. Because the waiter\u2019s going to call the police on you before he gets me my drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Axe growled.</p><p>Except then he looked down, and\u2014well, hello there, Mr. Shiny\u2014his gun was in his hand and ready to go.</p><p>Unlike in the alley.</p><p>Great, now his brain decides to catch up with protocol.</p> <p>Muttering under his breath, Axe put the damn thing away, and finished off the liquor in his glass. And then he made a show of trying to get the waiter\u2019s attention\u2014when what he was actually doing was attempting to lean around Peyton\u2019s make-a-better-door-than-a-window routine.</p><p>The problem finally got solved when the SOB stepped aside and started making introductions.</p><p>But then shit got so much worse.</p><p>\u201cThis is my cousin,\u201d Peyton said to everybody, \u201cElise.\u201d</p><p>FIVE</p><p>The way Elise saw it, having already been caught sneaking behind her father\u2019s back, it wasn\u2019t as if she could get in any worse trouble by going out one last time before the sehclusion hammer fell and she was locked in. Besides, Peyton was going to be with his fellow trainees. What could be safer than joining him?</p><p>The bottom line was that he was the only person she could think of to go to. Maybe there was a way out, a way to ... she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cLet me introduce you,\u201d her cousin was saying as he indicated the people sitting in a circle of heavy chairs.</p><p>Elise would have preferred to catch him alone, but she wasn\u2019t going to miss her chance. Besides, they could always step off into a corner together.</p><p>\u201cThis is Craeg\u2014and you know Paradise.\u201d</p><p>Elise lifted her hand to the female. \u201cHi, wow, hello.\u201d</p><p>Paradise was the daughter of the King\u2019s First Advisor, a high-bred descendant of a Founding Family\u2014and yet she had somehow managed to talk her way out of traditional roles and into the Brotherhood\u2019s training program. As a soldier. A fighter.</p><p>Maybe she could give some advice?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Boone, Novo ... and Axe.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded at each of the trainees\u2014until she got to the last one. Then she wasn\u2019t sure what she did.</p><p>Maybe she had a seizure? Or a spontaneous concussion? Because sure enough, she forgot about everything and everybody the instant she met his eyes, with the cigar bar, the humans around them, and even her reason for coming out disappearing as if someone had hit the world with a dry eraser.</p><p>He was extraordinary.</p><p>Or maybe ... extraordinarily dangerous was more like it.</p><p>However she defined the effect of him, she had a sixth sense he was going to change her life.</p><p>The male was sitting outside the dim pool of light that fell from the ceiling, shadows blanketing him as if protecting one of their own. He had dark hair, black hair, that was thick and spiky, and a huge body that was arranged like he could spring forward on an attack in the blink of an eye. The tattoos that ran up half of his neck and piercings that marked his left ear and brow made him seem even more sinister. And then there were his clothes, black and draped over him, suggesting there could be weapons underneath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With his chin dropped to his chest, he was staring at her from under his brows, his pale yellow eyes glowing as they locked on her and her alone.</p><p>Her first cogent thought was that he was a predator.</p><p>Her second ... was that she wanted to be caught.</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d</p> <p>As Peyton said her name and stepped in between them, she shook herself. \u201cSorry, what?\u201d</p><p>Her cousin\u2019s frown suggested he\u2019d noticed the connection, and\u2014no surprise\u2014he didn\u2019t approve. Then again, with the way that male in the corner was looking at her? You didn\u2019t have to be a possessive blood relative to not want any female anywhere near the guy.</p><p>\u201cSit next to Paradise, here,\u201d Peyton said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Boy, it was hot in here, Elise thought as she started to unbutton her coat.</p><p>\u201cElise? Hello?\u201d</p> <p>Shaking herself, she forced a smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d her cousin muttered as he pointed to a padded bench that he\u2019d pulled over.</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>As Elise tried to get her brain back on track, she parked it and glanced at Paradise\u2014whose smile was open and as beautiful as the rest of her was. Which was kind of a surprise. Most females with her sorts of connections were straight-up mean girls.</p><p>\u201cSo Peyton told me what\u2019s going on as we were walking over here.\u201d Paradise tucked her legs under herself and leaned on the arm of her chair. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t tell anyone, I promise. But I get it. I so get it.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head and started to parse through what she was prepared to share and what she wanted to keep to herself. Talking about the pathology around Allishon? Not going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cMy father\u2019s not a bad male, he really isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, of course not. He\u2019s just a traditional one, who\u2019s worried about his daughter in a troubling world. It\u2019s not an issue of good and bad. What it is about is your right to live a life even though you\u2019re a female in a rigid social role.\u201d</p><p>Elise exhaled. \u201cHow did you get into the training program at all? I mean, I\u2019ve heard that they\u2019ll allow females, but ...\u201d</p><p>As she continued to speak, some kind of split-personality thing happened\u2014half of her plugged into the conversation with Paradise, the other part of her right with that male, sensing his body, his presence, his power.</p><p>The effect he had on her was nothing like Troy, she thought. With the human in that library, she\u2019d felt as though she was in front of a banked fire, where you kind of thought, Huh, maybe I\u2019ll sit here and put my palms out and feel the warmth. Or maybe I\u2019ll just stay where I am and admire the view of the flames. Or ... what the hell, let me pick up a book and read for a while.</p><p>A lot of pleasant, non-threatening, but certainly interested, reflection.</p><p>That male in shadows over there? It was more like she was frozen to the bone and starving because she had wandered off a trail in a December snowstorm, and seventeen days later she was still tripping through the drifts, on the verge of collapse, her lungs stinging from a lack of oxygen, her head spinning, her whole body aching ... and there, there on the horizon, was an acres-wide bonfire set by a lightning strike in the forest, the flames eating up the landscape, the blaze overwhelming and terrifying, deadly ...</p><p>But nonetheless the only source of heat with which to warm her tortured, half-dead, frostbitten body.</p> <p>Oh, and actually, add a buffet of her favorite foods right in front of the giant hot mess.</p><p>With, like, four hundred pounds of Lindt chocolate on it.</p><p>And pasta. And champagne.</p><p>Yeah, that male was not any kind of pleasant reflection. Not even a choice, really. He was a compulsion to get to the beacon he was sending out.</p><p>And to hell with the consequences.</p><p>\u201c... talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>Elise kicked her own butt and replugged into Paradise. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father,\u201d the female said. \u201cMy father would absolutely speak with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak to whom? My sire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat better way to try and change his mind? My father worries about me, and he\u2019s from that old-school way of doing things, but he\u2019s evolved his thinking. If anyone can talk your father off the cliff? It\u2019s him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God ... that would be amazing.\u201d Tears made her eyes water. \u201cBut why would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Paradise took Elise\u2019s hand. \u201cBecause I know how hard it is.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected empathy was a breathtaker, and Elise got jammed up on the kindness. It was so hard to battle alone the glymera and its restrictions on females, so impossible to argue with standards that she hadn\u2019t volunteered for and didn\u2019t believe in, but that were, nonetheless, running her life. And it wasn\u2019t until this moment that Elise realized she had given up before she had even started fighting because there had been no hope, short of running away, of altering her father\u2019s legal and social authority over her.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s going to get me declared as sehcluded,\u201d Elise said. \u201cIf he does that, I\u2019m finished. It\u2019s over before it starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is he making the petition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, I think. He\u2019s gone to the Audience House right now\u2014that\u2019s the only reason I could leave to come here.\u201d</p><p>Paradise got her phone out and stood up. \u201cGimme a minute.\u201d</p><p>As the female went in search of a quieter place to make a call, Elise wiped her eyes. And when she took a deep inhale and shifted in her chair, she looked across\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The male was still staring at her, that massive body of his eased back in his seat, his knees spread wide, his drink in one long hand, the other up to his chin, his fingers on his mouth.</p><p>Like maybe he was kissing her in his mind.</p><p>Elise\u2019s body flashed with heat, the blast emanating through her veins in reply to those eyes of his, that erotic way he was lounging, that all-consuming intent he was spotlighting her with. But it was funny. As direct as his stare was and as unmistakable as the erotic tension was? He didn\u2019t make a move to come over and talk to her.</p><p>Even though she was very sure he was imagining them making love\u2014</p> <p>\u201cThis is all going to work out,\u201d Peyton said as he hopped into Paradise\u2019s vacant seat. \u201cIt\u2019s all gonna be fine.\u201d</p><p>Switching gears\u2014badly\u2014Elise met her cousin\u2019s eyes. \u201cAh ... I hope so. And thank you for helping. I didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. Anytime, anywhere, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Peyton puffed on his cigar, releasing clouds of gray smoke that drifted over his head. As he motioned with his hand to a waiter, and then circled the empty glasses on the low table, she had the distinct impression he came here often. Then again, maybe he was just sublimely comfortable and confident in the world.</p><p>Something to aspire to.</p> <p>As he joked with the male Paradise had been holding hands with, and then laughed at something the guy said, Elise couldn\u2019t help measuring her cousin\u2019s face. Peyton was handsome as could be, the kind of guy everyone looked at and wanted to know ... but he\u2019d never been happy\u2014at least not that she\u2019d been able to see. And he certainly wasn\u2019t now. Underneath the snark and the sexy affect, she sensed he wasn\u2019t tracking, an essential detachment separating him from the world.</p><p>He was suffering in silence. Mourning alone. Rattled but pretending everything was normal.</p><p>What had his ties to Allishon been? Of all the people who could have announced her death to the family, why had it been him?</p><p>Had he found her or something?</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cYou know, after Allishon\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awesome, are you kidding me?\u201d He shifted forward and tapped the ash off the fat, glowing end of his cigar. \u201cI\u2019m spectacular.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were empty as he smiled at her, and abruptly, she felt like crying all over again. But if he could be strong, so could she.</p><p>And then Paradise was back and sitting down in the lap of the trainee she\u2019d been holding hands with. \u201cMy father\u2019s going to talk to him right now.\u201d</p><p>Elise closed her eyes in relief. \u201cOh, thank you, thank you so much ... I really hope he can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father has a way about him that really calms people down.\u201d Paradise looked at her male with love in her eyes and smiled. \u201cAnd as traditional as he can be, he knows that that isn\u2019t everything.\u201d</p><p>No, Axe told his libido. No, absolutely not. You are not going to have that female.</p><p>Forget it. Drop it. Walk away.</p><p>F.F.S., it was like he was talking at a recalcitrant dog.</p><p>But what the shits. She wasn\u2019t just \u201cnot his type,\u201d she represented everything he despised about the glymera. He couldn\u2019t stand blondes, for one thing. And yeah, sure, she didn\u2019t have a lot of makeup on, and it wasn\u2019t like she was dressed in a bunch of highbrow, ugly shit that was supposedly \u201con trend\u201d\u2014whatever the fuck that meant. But that accent of hers? Come on, it was so patrician, she made that human Queen of England sound like a beer drinker from the Jersey Shore.</p> <p>And her bone structure was even worse. That face of hers was so refined and perfect, he was very sure that she could trace her bloodline back to the beginning of time. And those eyes? Like sapphires. Those lips? Like rubies. That skin ... like a pearl.</p><p>She was a goddamn jewelry store of beauty. But man, it was so frickin\u2019 easy to fill in the particulars of her life: she was going to live in a mansion in the very best part of town; her bedroom would be Barbie-meets-the-National-Gallery; her father would be all up her ass to mate a suitable male from a Very Good Family; and her biggest worry tonight was what set of diamonds to wear to Last Meal.</p><p>Good thing she had about four hours of deliberation time.</p><p>Phew. What a fucking relief.</p><p>She was exactly what his mother had hoped to become. When she left him an orphan and his father a ruined male.</p><p>So no. He was not having anything to do with that stuck-up, butter-wouldn\u2019t-melt-in-her-mouth, aristocratic breeding machine. Nope. Not going to\u2014</p><p>What would she taste like? an inner voice whispered.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust shut the fuck up\u2014\u201d</p><p>What would she feel like, naked and under him, with her legs spread wide and her sex his for the taking? Would she moan his name? Or would she gasp it\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Novo murmured, \u201cyou could make this easier on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? And please don\u2019t answer that if you don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go over there and speak to her?\u201d</p><p>Axe considered playing stoopid, but what the hell. \u201cNot a good idea. She\u2019d be naked the next minute, and then I\u2019d have to slaughter anyone with a cock who saw her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking animal.\u201d Novo laughed. \u201cBut I like that in a male. And I think so does that female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat female.\u201d Damn it, was he out of booze again? \u201cI think you\u2019re seeing things.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you were any more turned on, you\u2019d be doing something that would get you arrested in a place like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I like The Keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, you need to take me to that club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName the night.\u201d</p> <p>And then he got quiet because Peyton\u2019s cousin was rising to her feet and giving the guy a hug like she was leaving.</p><p>Look at me, Axe commanded in his head. Come on, look at me.</p><p>The female had clearly been brought up correctly and she took the time to acknowledge everyone she had just been introduced to ... including, at last, him.</p><p>A quick flick of her eyes in his direction and then she was lifting her hand in a brief wave, and off she went.</p><p>She walked like something he wanted to mount from behind.</p> <p>Axe went to get up before he was aware of moving, but Peyton shot a live-fire glare at him, a big, fat, don\u2019t-you-fucking-dare coupled with some don\u2019t-even-think-about-it mixed with a whole lot of not-even-in-your-fantasies-asshole. But then saving grace walked up.</p><p>In the form of a set of DDs in a miniskirt so short it was essentially a pair of panties without the crotch. And the human woman was a blonde, Peyton\u2019s favorite.</p><p>All the bad shit and frustration that had happened in training, coupled with the bourbon the guy had been drinking, conspired against good ol\u2019 Pey-pey\u2019s cockblocking, protective instincts\u2014and the next thing you knew, the DDs had taken a load off in Peyton\u2019s lap and her fake-tipped nails were stroking the hair at the base of his neck.</p><p>Cue the buh-bye\u2019s.</p><p>Axe was up and outta there faster than a marksman could lock and load.</p><p>Slipping through the dim interior, he moved like a laser sight through the crowd, slicing his way to the front entrance and out into the cold.</p> <p>Instinctively, he knew she\u2019d gone left.</p><p>And just as instinctively, she stopped at the curb the second he emerged.</p><p>As she turned around to him, a gust of wind caught her hair, feathering it out from her face. With the fat snowflakes falling in a swirl and her coat catching the winter\u2019s breath around her body, she was like something out of a fever dream, both real and illusive.</p><p>Axe walked over to her, aware that he was more like a love-starved virgin than the jaded sex addict he had become ever since he had kicked heroin.</p><p>Her eyes skipped around as if he intimidated her, and she put her hands in her pockets, although, he sensed, not from the cold.</p><p>Axe knew this because he caught her scent: This female, as skittish as she was, was far from indifferent to him.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would come after me,\u201d she said roughly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I knew you\u2019d be waiting.\u201d</p> <p>She kicked up her chin. \u201cI wasn\u2019t waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t rushed out here, you would have.\u201d</p><p>He liked the way her jaw set like he was pissing her off. But then she smiled. \u201cIf you knew I\u2019d wait for you, why did you rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth as if she had expected him to say something else and had prepared a line. Shaking her head, she smiled as she glanced away. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a line from a hair ad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into women\u2019s magazines?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot into women. Or females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>Axe didn\u2019t see how it was helpful to point out that he could be sexually attracted to people and yet have absolutely no other care for them whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cHow do I see you,\u201d he asked on a growl. \u201cName the where and when and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not interested,\u201d she drawled, and stepped off the curb into the road.</p><p>He stayed right on her tail as she crossed the street. And good thing there were no cars coming in either direction\u2014or he might have had to throw them out of his way.</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re not interested, I\u2019d call you on your bullshit. And really, why waste my time with that.\u201d</p><p>On the far side, she wheeled around and put her hands on her hips. \u201cAre you always this arrogant?\u201d</p><p>He leaned into her, and as he inhaled deep into his lungs, he relished the scent of her arousal.</p><p>On a whisper, right next to her ear, he said, \u201cDo you really think something as flimsy as false denial is going to keep me away from you?\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the door to the cigar club flew open and Peyton came out, all pouncing protector and then some.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not denying anything,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cBut my cousin most certainly is going to keep us apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you let him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise,\u201d Peyton snapped from across the street. \u201cGo home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the same male who was helping liberate me from my father,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cElise!\u201d</p><p>As a couple of cars coming and going prevented the guy from crossing the road, she turned away. \u201cHave fun with him.\u201d</p><p>And poof! she was gone, dematerializing into the December night.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d Axe muttered.</p><p>Meanwhile, Peyton played dodgeball with a truck, and then broke into a run to close the distance.</p><p>\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Axe barked at the guy. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch her\u2014\u201d</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The right hook left him spitting blood out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking think about it!\u201d Peyton gritted. \u201cShe is not your kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, because I\u2019m not an aristocrat like you, asshole?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The two of them got right up in it, baring fangs even though they could be seen, grabbing at the front of each other\u2019s jackets.</p><p>Craeg was next out of the club, and Paradise was right with him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a female of worth!\u201d Peyton started to wind up for another strike. \u201cShe\u2019s not like the trash you fuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe caught the male\u2019s forearm and bent it out of the way. \u201cOh, and that human slut on your lap in there was some kind of saint\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer cousin is dead, okay! Allishon was the one Anslam murdered last month\u2014I had to go to Elise\u2019s household and tell them what happened! So no, you can\u2019t fuck her and leave her ruined, which is what you\u2019re going to do. There\u2019s enough pain under that roof already and she deserves better than that! Better than you!\u201d</p><p>Craeg jogged across the street and wasted no time in hooking a hold onto Peyton\u2019s shoulders and dragging the guy back.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d Craeg gritted. \u201cYou two assholes are making a scene.\u201d</p><p>Axe cursed and walked off a little, pacing in the falling snow, his boots making tracks that quickly got him down to concrete. He spit out another mouthful of blood and tried to ignore how badly his knuckles were itching for payback.</p><p>But damn, they\u2019d all heard about the killing. Anslam, the murderer, had been one of the trainees, one of the few to survive the induction night and get accepted into the Brotherhood\u2019s program.</p> <p>No one knew, or could have guessed, that the aristocratic bastard had been brutalizing females and taking pictures of his handiwork on the side.</p><p>Peyton had gone looking for his female cousin after he\u2019d tried to get ahold of her\u2014and from what Axe had been told, the guy had walked in on a bloodbath. No body, though. Turned out she had died at Havers\u2019s clinic, but without identification.</p><p>Paradise had been the one to put it all together, and Anslam had nearly killed her when she\u2019d figured it all out.</p><p>The sadistic bastard had ended up dead in her front foyer.</p><p>What a fucking mess.</p><p>\u201cNot Elise,\u201d Peyton said roughly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you ruin her. And don\u2019t pretend that\u2019s not what will happen. Unless you want to ask her father for permission to mate her properly, stay the fuck away from her.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, like that was ever going to go down. One, because Axe would never ask any sire for that shit. And two, as if a high-bred father like the one she had would let a scrub like him even walk through the front door, much less entertain a mating proposal.</p><p>Hell, Axe wasn\u2019t good enough to vacuum the floor rugs on the guy\u2019s Rolls-Royce.</p><p>But what did it matter, Axe thought as he looked away again. It wasn\u2019t like he was ever going to see her again.</p><p>What was the saying? Ships in the night.</p><p>They were two ships in the night, passing each other, never the twain shall meet again.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll leave her alone.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>The following nightfall, Mary watched from the end of Bitty\u2019s bed as the girl mulled over which coat to wear out. One was a puffy parka that was red and black, a gift from the King that was, as far as Mary could tell, like bubble-wrapping the kid\u2014Rhage had even joked that it was the Gore-Tex equivalent of one of those human hamster balls that people got into and bounced down hills. The other choice was a sedate, navy blue peacoat, the old-fashioned kind with the sailor buttons and the collar you could stand up like Dracula\u2019s.</p> <p>A part of Mary\u2019s heart ached that this was the first time in Bitty\u2019s life that she\u2019d had any kind of decision to make. Before, coming out of poverty, she had been lucky to have anything at all\u2014and the idea the girl had spent so many winters cold was enough to make Mary nauseous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I have to go to the clinic,\u201d the girl said as she put the parka back in her closet.</p><p>Mary had known all along that the wool coat was going to be the choice. Rhage had given the thing to the girl\u2014and Wrath, son of Wrath, sire of Wrath, might have been the King of the entire race, but no one held a candle to Bitty\u2019s father.</p><p>And tonight was going to be scary.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s something wrong?\u201d Bitty said as she came back from the closet.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI don\u2019t. But it\u2019s better to know that for sure rather than simply hope that\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sore, though.\u201d Bitty walked over to the dressing table and sat down in front of the three-part mirror. \u201cAnd all pretrans are small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Boy, Mary hated to bring up the abuse. \u201cThe reality is, though, that your body has been through a lot. It doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t get through your transition and be tall and strong. But what if there\u2019s something we can do now to make sure that happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because of the broken bones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Bitty fell silent, picking up the hairbrush and running it through the long brown waves that fell past her shoulders\u2014even though she\u2019d already brushed them. And Mary gave the kid space, passing the time looking around the room ... and wondering what else they could do to make the otherwise formal surroundings more what a thirteen-year-old girl would be into. Bitty didn\u2019t demand anything, though, and she seemed content.</p><p>There also had been a lot of new purchases lately\u2014and it was hard not to give the little girl the world.</p><p>Hard, too, to stop the frickin\u2019 Brothers from spoiling her rotten. Bitty had arrived at the Brotherhood mansion with two battered suitcases, a doll head, and her old tiger, Mastimon\u2014and within a night or two, her football team\u2019s worth of overprotective pains in the asses, better known as the BABUs (Bad-Ass Big Uncles), had been laying things at her doorway like offerings to an altar. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Actually, Lassiter called the uncle squad Baboons or Buffoons. And then the beatings occurred. But yeah ...</p><p>Oh, and that fallen angel was the worst of the bunch when it came to presents. Just tonight, at First Meal, he\u2019d given her yet another copy of the Deadpool DVD and a sweatshirt that had a red and black rendering of Dory with \u201cWhere\u2019s Francis?\u201d printed on the front.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to go to Havers\u2019s clinic,\u201d Bitty said as she looked at herself in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>Mary closed her eyes, recalling Bitty getting treatment there for what her biological father did to her. \u201cRhage and I are going to be with you the whole time. We aren\u2019t going to leave your side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t Doc Jane do whatever needs to be done at her clinic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but she can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan she come with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey, she has her work to do here. But she\u2019s going to talk to Havers herself after all the tests come back. And so will Dr. Manello and maybe even V.\u201d</p><p>Bitty put the brush down and ran her palm over her hair. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>God, she was so small sitting there, and Mary would have given anything to be the one about to be poked and prodded and X-rayed and imaged. Bitty had been through so much, her poor little body absorbing blows and stress that most adults would have had trouble living through. And the actual experiences had been bad enough. The idea that she was still having to deal with them seemed grossly unfair.</p><p>\u201cI think afterward,\u201d Mary said as she got to her feet, \u201cRhage is going to take the night off and hang out with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me we can have ice cream and watch a movie, if I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>When Bitty didn\u2019t stand up, Mary went over. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d came the whisper. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p> <p>Mary put her hand on the girl\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI swear that I will never leave you.\u201d</p><p>Thank you, Scribe Virgin. And thank you, Rhage. When they\u2019d decided to move forward with the adoption process, she and Rhage had agreed that even if he died first, Mary would stay with Bitty. Of course, they hadn\u2019t told the girl about all that. There just hadn\u2019t been a right time yet.</p><p>Bitty took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>The knock on the door cut her off, and then came Rhage\u2019s deep voice, muffled: \u201cHow\u2019re my females in there? We ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Rhage opened things up and there he was, big and beautiful, his broad shoulders filling the doorway, his preternatural physical perfection the kind of thing Mary still did a double take on every once in a while. With blond hair that was thick and wavy, eyes that were the color of the ocean in the Bahamas, and teeth so white they looked like bathroom tile\u2014even though they\u2019d never been bleached\u2014he was a legend in the race with the females for a good reason.</p><p>He was also totally and completely devoted to her and her alone.</p> <p>It had taken Mary some time to get used to that, to trust it. After all, he could have had anyone or anything he wanted in a mate\u2014someone blond and tall and gorgeous like him. Instead ... he only had eyes for her, a brunette with a nice enough face, and a body that had been rendered infertile thanks to chemo.</p><p>Rhage thought she was a beauty queen, however, and funny, when she was around him and he was staring at her the way he did? She sure as hell felt like one.</p><p>As Bitty burst up and rushed over to him, he got down on one knee so he was closer to her height. And he took her hands, his larger palms engulfing her smaller ones.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to get this over with so we can watch Deadpool again?\u201d</p><p>Mary shook her head. \u201cYou guys are in a serious rut.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018So what\u2019s it gonna be?\u2019 \u201d Bitty quipped. \u201c \u2018Long sullen silence or mean comment?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018You got me in a box here,\u2019 \u201d Rhage shot back.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, yes, yes ...\u201d Bitty curled up her fists and pumped the air as she turned in a little circle.</p><p>\u201cPromise me again,\u201d Mary cut in, \u201cthat you don\u2019t look at the adult parts.\u201d</p><p>Bitty and Rhage both covered their eyes as he replied, \u201cNope. We assume the position and wait till the ugliness passes.\u201d</p><p>Pick your battles, Mary reminded herself. You gotta pick your battles.</p><p>As the three of them headed out of the suite in a clutch, Mary said, \u201cYou know, you could try watching some other things? There are some wonderful documentaries out there on social issues that ...\u201d</p><p>She let the pitch trail off as the two of them turned around and stared at her as if she\u2019d suggested spray-painting obscenities all over the foyer. Or firing Fritz. Or off-loading Rhage\u2019s GTO on eBay for scrap metal.</p><p>\u201cHow are you two not blood relations,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBut at least you might grow out of this, Bitty.\u201d</p><p>The girl came in close and gave one of her hugs, tight and quick. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>As they headed down to the second floor, Rhage said, \u201cBit, you know we\u2019re not leaving you, right? It\u2019s not appropriate for me to be with you the whole time, but Mary will be, and I\u2019ll be in the waiting room or just outside in the corridor\u2014\u201d</p><p>When they emerged out of the stairwell, they stopped on a oner.</p><p>Right outside of the King\u2019s study, there was a group of people waiting: Doc Jane, in her surgical scrubs; Manny, in his white coat; Vishous, dressed for war; and Zsadist, in Adidas, with weapons all over him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, and Lassiter.</p><p>In a hockey mask and football pads.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is a sweet send-off,\u201d Rhage said as he went to clap hands with his Brothers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sending you off.\u201d Lassiter pounded his pads. \u201cWe\u2019re your entourage.\u201d</p> <p>Mary blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Jane smiled and focused on Bit. \u201cWe\u2019re coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that the \u2019rents can\u2019t handle it,\u201d Lassiter volunteered from behind his mask. \u201cBut let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m working on my defensive tackle position and this will be good practice. That pencil-necked nightmare of a doctor gets too pokey and I\u2019ma turn him into a splatter painting.\u201d</p><p>Vishous put both hands up to his face and rubbed hard. Like in his mind, he was throwing a beat-down in the angel\u2019s direction, but he knew he couldn\u2019t draw blood in front of the girl\u2014and the self-control required was killing him.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay home,\u201d V muttered. \u201cYou really can totally f-in\u2019 stay the f home, you f\u2019ed-up mother-f\u2019ing f-twit.\u201d</p> <p>Lassiter clasped his breastplate, and swooned like Julie Andrews. \u201cDon\u2019t you love it when he can\u2019t swear? Warms my cockles\u2014it\u2019s like watching a drunk on roller skates try to play dodgeball in the dark\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zsadist, who rarely spoke, cut the metaphors off. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you three going alone. So we\u2019re coming with you. Some things you need your family for.\u201d</p><p>As Rhage cleared his throat like his emotions were getting the best of him, Mary said roughly, \u201cThank you so much. I really ... we really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>Z stepped forward to Bit, and if you went by appearances alone, any parent would want the Brother as far away from their child as possible: with his tattooed slave bands and his scarred face and his enormous warrior\u2019s body with all those weapons on it, he looked more like an abductor than a loving uncle.</p><p>Without saying a word, he put out his hand.</p><p>And without missing a beat ... the little survivor took the big survivor\u2019s palm.</p> <p>Bitty and Z had always had a special connection. Then again, when you had been forced to endure the cruelty of another for years, there was always going to be a separator between you and the world, no matter how much time had passed or how many good things happened to you since.</p><p>That common ground united the pair of them. And although Mary would have wished for something else to bring them together, she was always glad\u2014especially on a night like tonight\u2014that Bitty had Zsadist in her life.</p><p>As the pair of them hit the grand staircase, it was as if a bell had been rung and the gates to the race opened, the assembled masses following them down to where Fritz was waiting outside with his black Mercedes.</p><p>The great thing about family, Mary mused, was that they showed up.</p><p>When it really mattered, your family, be they blood or by choice, were always where you needed them to be, even though they had busy lives and jobs and children of their own.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lassiter said as he opened the way through the vestibule, \u201cwill anyone slap a puck around with me to pass the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d everybody, including Bitty, shot back.</p><p>\u201cBut I will slap the f-in\u2019 crap out of something else,\u201d V said under his breath.</p> <p>\u201cI love it when you talk dirty to me. Gimme a hug. C\u2019mon, you know you wanna....\u201d</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Elise knew nothing about where she stood: not whether she was able to keep going to school, or if she were stuck in proverbial jail, or even if she still had a roof over her head.</p><p>After she had gone to see Peyton out at the cigar bar, and had the collision-as-meeting encounter with that trainee as she\u2019d been leaving, she\u2019d come home and waited for her father\u2019s return. On the bottom step of the carved staircase right across from the front door. Like a lost child.</p><p>Three hours later, he had walked in, his head down, his shoulders slumped, his spirit as deflated as a fragile balloon.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even looked at her\u2014or even seemed aware that she was in the foyer. He\u2019d just gone directly to his study and closed himself in.</p><p>Well ... good talk, Dad, she\u2019d thought. Breaking all kinds of new ground, aren\u2019t we.</p><p>But really, how could she have expected anything else?</p><p>After an internal debate about the merits of interjecting herself into whatever process he was working through, she\u2019d gone up and gotten into bed. No sleep for her during the day, but that hadn\u2019t just been about her father and the sehclusion petition.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that male ... his tattoos, and his piercings, the way he\u2019d looked at her, what he\u2019d said. She\u2019d spent a lot of time replaying that scene on the sidewalk. In her head? They were still back there in the falling snow arguing, the sexual tension so thick it was like a rope she could pull on.</p><p>It was a shock, given the very real issues she was dealing with in her life, that she had any interest at all in making things even more chaotic. But she wished she\u2019d given him her number. She was, however, glad she hadn\u2019t\u2014because if he did call her? She would see him again, and what a recipe for disaster that would be.</p><p>You didn\u2019t need to know the specifics about a male like that to be fully aware he was a Taylor Swift song waiting to happen.</p><p>Or worse\u2014</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d she said as she stood up from her bed. \u201cEnough with the stewing.\u201d</p><p>Her father would be downstairs in his study by now. So it was time to go face the music, as her mother used to say, and talk with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Elise stepped out of her room, she pulled up short. Her father was just emerging from his suite down the hall, and he paused, too.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cFather, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned away without a word, his hand rising over his shoulder in classic stop fashion. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when,\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>Her father did not respond. He simply kept going, striding down the hall to the formal staircase and disappearing on the descent.</p><p>Short of throwing herself in front of him, she didn\u2019t know how to force him to engage. And even then, he was likely to just Conrail over her.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Maybe it was time to move out. But undoubtedly, he would cut her off, so how would she pay for anything?</p><p>The only reason she was able to go to university now was because of scholarships she\u2019d earned. And they didn\u2019t cover things like room and board.</p> <p>A sudden urge to throw something had her turning her head toward an antique side table. That vase of flowers would be perfect, the thin neck at the top fitting easily in her palm, the weight of the water and the imported roses heavy enough to make her feel like she could do some damage, but not enough to hinder distance.</p><p>Shifting her eyes across the way, she stared at the closed door of the suite where her aunt and uncle stayed.</p><p>Her uncle would be out and about soon, but her aunt was no doubt still sleeping. Usually the female stayed in bed until after Elise got back from uni, rising only long enough to do her hair and makeup before returning to her satin pillows. It was no way to live, but after what had happened to her daughter? And the loss of her son?</p><p>Elise cursed ... and then found herself on the move.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was standing in front of her dead cousin\u2019s door. From a distance, she watched as her hand reached out, clasped the knob, and turned it. When she pushed inside, she caught a whiff of the perfume Allishon had always worn. Poison by Dior\u2014old school, to be sure, but it had fit so well on the female.</p><p>Elise had always thought that if the color purple had had a scent, that fragrance would have been it.</p> <p>Without a sound, she shut herself in and flicked the light switch.</p><p>Illumination bloomed in the room, emanating from the crystal chandelier in the center of the high ceiling. The bed was across the way, strewn with pale blue linens that had white and gold accents, and sporting enough pillows to put a Macy\u2019s display in the shade. The walls were papered with handmade Stark, the French scene of peach-and-yellow birds frolicking between blooming fruit trees something you could see down in the gardens during the good months. On the floor, the carpet was thick and of a cream that was so pale, it was nearly white, and the drapes framing the windows were the pale blue of a summer dress and just as diaphanous.</p><p>The decor was perfect for a young female of worth.</p><p>And yet Allishon\u2019s possessions were the off-notes in the room: a black robe that was part priest, part demon worshipper; a crystal skull on the mantel over the fireplace; books with black and blood-red leather covers scattered in the far corner by a tapestry-covered pallet. There were also chunky black boots that were tall enough to go up over the knee ... a high-heeled shoe without a mate that had a gun for a heel ... black duffel bags filled with God only knew what else.</p><p>It was hard not to see the evidence of her cousin\u2019s other life like potholes in a perfectly paved road. But how judgmental was that.</p><p>\u201cNo way to think,\u201d she groaned as she rubbed her stiff neck.</p><p>The reality, though, was that something evil had come across Allishon\u2019s path as she had searched for herself on the wild side. And that was Felixe\u2019s point, wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Elise frowned as she thought about that trainee with the tattoos. He was everything that her sire was worried about her finding. Except she hadn\u2019t met him at university\u2014and that was her point.</p> <p>\u201cJust as well,\u201d she muttered to the vacant room. \u201cI\u2019m not going to see him again.\u201d</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>The Brotherhood\u2019s training center was a state-of-the-art, hundred-thousand-square-foot bunker of holy-shit-how-is-this-not-the-government\u2013level facilities and equipment. Located underground, and preceded by a gating system of gradually more secure and intimidating G.T.F.O.s, the place was off-limits to vampires, humans, and lessers.</p><p>As well as the trainees who were technically allowed to be in it.</p><p>When the \u201cschool bus\u201d slowed again at yet another checkpoint, Axe could tell by the angle of the descent that they were getting close to the entrance to the facility. The blackout windows next to him didn\u2019t offer much visual, but he imagined the last couple of stop-heres to be like something out of Jurassic Park, all concrete walls that were as tall as the Hoover Dam and topped with miles\u2019 worth of barbed wire.</p><p>For the last month, the trainees had been meeting at designated locations in and around Caldwell and getting on this nothing-yellow-or-schoolish-at-all tank with its bulletproof body plating, thick-as-your-arm windows, and deep bucket seats.</p><p>Yeah, sure, Fritz, the old doggen at the wheel, could have worked for Caldwell Central Schools. But that was about it for comps.</p><p>And what do you know. Tonight\u2019s ride in from a deserted factory in the old industrial part of town had been about twenty-five minutes of Peyton glaring a hole in Axe\u2019s skull.</p><p>Good times, good times.</p><p>Everyone else was minding their own damn business. Novo had her Beats on up in front. Boone was reading\u2014Kierkegaard\u2019s Enten-Eller, whatever the fuck that was. Paradise and Craeg were trading an iPhone back and forth like they were searching for Pok\u00e9Stops on the way and getting bad reception. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Peyton, on the other hand? He apparently had nothing better to do than steam like dog shit laid fresh on a snowbank.</p><p>Axe had done a damn good job of ignoring the glares, however, and he intended to keep up the brick wall for the rest of the night\u2014</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d Peyton snapped.</p><p>As Axe let his head fall against the rest, he knew he should have moved farther back when Mr. Boundaries had sat across the aisle from him. Course that would mean he\u2019d be riding in on the rear bumper.</p> <p>\u201cYou made your point last night,\u201d Axe muttered. \u201cAnd I agreed with you, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, and I\u2019ll repeat myself now.\u201d He turned his head lackadaisically to the male. \u201cI\u2019m not going to touch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you follow Elise out like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh air, man. I needed\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fucking serious\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I have an idea. Let\u2019s not play Emilio Estevez and Judd Nelson circa Maine North High School.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Boone spoke up but didn\u2019t look up from the row ahead. \u201cThe Breakfast Club. Widely considered the best high school film ever made. Filmed at Maine North High School in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 1984. Judd Nelson played the role of the stereotypical degenerate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI,\u201d Axe cut in, \u201cthat\u2019s my role. You\u2019re the wrestler, Pey-pey. The judgmental fuck with the please-daddy complex.\u201d</p><p>Peyton cocked an eyebrow. \u201cHim\u201d\u2014he motioned to Boone\u2014\u201cI\u2019d expect to know that. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been a sex addict my whole life, you know. I used to be a druggie who specialized in nodding out in front of the TV. And will you do us both a favor and drop this shit. I\u2019m not going to bang your pure-as-the-driven-snow cousin. She\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>Okay, fine. He might have spent all day staring at the ceiling, reliving the way she had turned to him on that sidewalk. Looked at him. Spoken to him.</p><p>And yeah, there might have been some palm action. But it had been a case of either he took care of the perma-rection he\u2019d developed or he came to class with a baseball bat in his leathers.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t about her. Nah. That was just a sign he needed to spend more time at The Keys.</p><p>The bus came to a stop, and the ancient butler retracted the partition while opening the door across from his driver\u2019s seat. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived! Have a lovely evening!\u201d</p><p>The doggen said the same thing in the same cheerful voice every night, and as Axe got to his feet and walked down and off before anyone else could, he realized it was kind of a ritual. The verbal equivalent of rubbing a rabbit\u2019s foot for good luck.</p><p>The parking area had a number of vehicles in it, including an RV that was actually a mobile surgical center, a new Hummer that was being bulletproofed, two pickups that sparkled like they were just off the Ford lot, and an earthmover of some CAT variety. There were other levels of graduated asphalt rising upward, but Axe had never bothered with them.</p><p>Even if he\u2019d been allowed to drive in, it wasn\u2019t like he had a car or any prospects of getting one.</p> <p>Nope, no whip for him. In his world, there was no money for anything other than the clothes on his back and the human property taxes on the little house his father had built for a female who had never given a shit about him. Oh, and those ramen noodles. Axe\u2019s electricity had been turned off again and this time, he wasn\u2019t going to bother to pay the bill. He could live in the dark\u2014it was better than crashing at the training center like a homeless human. Besides, gas and sewer were municipal, so he had hot running water, and the fireplaces worked well enough to keep him warm.</p><p>He\u2019d survive.</p><p>As he approached a steel-reinforced door, he didn\u2019t have to wait. It was opened from the inside, the Dhestroyer shoving the heavy weight wide like the thing weighed as much as a sheet of paper.</p><p>\u201cEvenin\u2019,\u201d the Brother Butch said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the first classroom.\u201d</p><p>Axe nodded and walked down the long hall, passing by interrogation rooms and other teaching areas, and then the new lab where they were, literally, blowing shit up.</p><p>The classroom they used was your typical set-up\u2014or at least what he\u2019d seen on the TV during his heroin days. There were two rows of long tables with pairs of seats facing an old-fashioned chalkboard. Overhead lights were banks of fluorescents; the flooring was speckled linoleum.</p><p>No readin\u2019, writin\u2019, and \u2019rithmetic taught here, though.</p><p>Try hand-to-hand-combat theory, military maneuvers, basic first aid, group dynamics.</p><p>Axe sat in the back and\u2014thank you, God\u2014Peyton parked it down in front. The others settled in, ready for the night.</p><p>The Brother Butch closed the door and sat on the desk that was off to the side. He had a Red Sox hat on, a shirt that had a stencil of Big Papi\u2019s face on the front, and set of Adidas track pants in black. Running shoes were Brooks and in a pink and red neon.</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d the Brother said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to review how badly you each performed in that mock attack. Which should take us eight to twelve hours. Then, if there\u2019s time left, we\u2019ll keep going with poisons, focusing on aerosols and contact poisons. But first, I have a job opportunity for someone.\u201d</p><p>Axe frowned.</p><p>Money, he thought, would be good.</p><p>\u201cThe position is one that will require the utmost discretion and tact.\u201d The Brother leveled a deadly stare at the group. \u201cAs well as an intimate knowledge of personal defense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhage absolutely fucking hated Havers\u2019s clinic. Yeah, sure, the underground facility was secure, and even though he didn\u2019t like the guy, no one could argue with the healer\u2019s treatment of his patients. But as Rhage sat in the corridor outside the exam room that Bitty and Mary had been in for, like, a hundred and fifty years, pretty much everything was getting on his nerves.</p><p>First of all, he hated the synthetic \u201cclean\u201d smell, that fake lemon disinfecta-stench burrowing into his sinuses. Hell, it was so bad, he kept imagining all kinds of tiny yellow minions with pickaxes and spray bottles of the shit paying personal attention to his nostril regions.</p><p>Second, the productive hush of everything bugged the fuck out of him, even though it was arguably a good thing. All the soft-soled shoes shuffling along, the quiet voices, the carts of medical supplies and equipment whispering along the hall.</p><p>But the worst thing? He really couldn\u2019t stand the attention he got.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that the nurses were popping their bodices and going grind-on-it all over his junk, but damn, he didn\u2019t need all the lingering glances and the unnecessary multi-walk-bys and the twittering and giggling.</p><p>He\u2019d dealt with versions of this all his life\u2014at least since the split second he\u2019d made it through his transition. And pre-Mary, he\u2019d taken advantage of the sexual attention to the point where he didn\u2019t leave a reputation so much as a religion of fucking in his wake. Post-Mary, though, he had no interest in other females. In fact, he\u2019d begun to think of his face and body like a sweet-ass whip that his brain drove. His core, his soul, his heart, didn\u2019t have anything to do with how he looked.</p><p>And there was the issue.</p><p>When your daughter was on the other side of a thin door, dressed in a frail little hospital gown, her eyes big and wide from current fear and past trauma as her personal space and her body were invaded by third parties, the last thing you wanted was a bunch of people falling all over you because they thought you were Channing Tatum and Chris Hemsworth\u2019s frickin\u2019 love child.</p><p>Maybe he should put a paper bag over his head\u2014</p> <p>As a hand came down on his shoulder, he jumped\u2014and was equally shocked to find Zsadist sitting down next to him on the hard floor of the corridor.</p><p>Across the way, V and Lassiter were still on their feet and arguing, the pair of them face to hockey mask, the brother putting a hand-rolled between his lips\u2014and then whipping it out as if he remembered he couldn\u2019t light up\u2014the angel more than holding his own, talking a mile a minute.</p><p>Rhage didn\u2019t have the energy or the focus to spare on them.</p><p>All he could think about was ...</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just suffered enough,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cGod ... how long have they been in there?\u201d</p><p>Looking into the eyes of his brother, he saw that instead of that stare being yellow, Z\u2019s peepers were jet black.</p> <p>But yeah, Rhage was being pretty annoying. He\u2019d been bitching about the same thing for how long now? No wonder his brother was getting frustrated with him.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Rhage rubbed his face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to shut up over here. Don\u2019t mean to piss you off.\u201d</p><p>Z looked at him like he\u2019d sprouted a horn in the middle of his forehead. \u201cNot you. I just want to dig up that sire of hers and kill him all over again. If Nalla had been abused like that? And had bones full of past breaks?\u201d</p><p>The brother stopped talking at that point. Just as well. Rhage felt like vomiting again.</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s your kids, it\u2019s just a whole different level.\u201d Rhage started to bang his head against the wall, and then worried that it might disturb Bitty and the doctors. \u201cYou know, I wasn\u2019t prepared for this. I mean, I thought the hard part about being a dad was going to be the arguments\u2014like her bringing some knuckle-dragging mouth breather home and expecting me not to slice off his smooth criminals and plant them in the yard. But this? I want to be the one going through it for her. It\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p><p>Z held his stare, solid as a rock, about as far from psychotic as the brother had once been knee-deep in the crazy. \u201cYou are a tremendous father, you know that. You\u2019re the real deal.\u201d</p><p>Rhage looked away fast. Cleared his throat. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m failing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right with her when she needs you most.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, to do that, I\u2019d have to be on that exam table. I\u2019d have to have my body there instead of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible and you know it.\u201d Z cursed softly. \u201cThe hardest thing about being a father is not being able to make everything all right for them. Sometimes the best you can do is just show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be more to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there is and you figure it out, let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You\u2019re the best father I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll call your ass the next time I lie awake wondering how I could have screwed things up worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s different for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy.\u201d When Rhage didn\u2019t fill in the blank, Z didn\u2019t let the unspoken remain silent. \u201cWhy, because Nalla is biologically mine? G\u2019head, say it. \u2019Cuz when you hear that shit come out of your mouth, you\u2019ll realize how stupid it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ... I wonder if I\u2019d be doing something better if ... you know, I were really her sire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like her biological father, you mean? Like the motherfucker who put her on that table? You want to be like him? Yeah, that\u2019s a real improvement over a guy who\u2019s been here in this corridor, looking like he\u2019s going through open-heart surgery without anesthesia \u2019cuz his little girl\u2019s having a hard time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhage rubbed his hair so hard his fingers were fuzzy when he stopped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand. You\u2019re never going to be in my shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my point, though. Whether you had a hand in birthing them or you volunteer to take them in, we\u2019re all in the same shoes.\u201d</p><p>Rhage stared at the closed door in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Z. I\u2019m just ... fucking scared. What if there\u2019s something permanently wrong? That\u2019s what Doc Jane is worried about, you know. She\u2019s worried Bitty\u2019s transition will ruin her arms and legs so badly ... that they\u2019re going to end up having to amputate them.\u201d</p><p>The image of Bitty dancing through the foyer made his eyes sting. She was so active now ... he couldn\u2019t imagine her in a wheelchair that was operated by her blowing into a tube. It just killed him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the ... what the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Z demanded.</p><p>\u201cSomething to do with growth plates. There were breaks that occurred right along\u201d\u2014He motioned to his thighs, his forearms, his calves\u2014\u201cyou know, Bitty\u2019s growth plates, and they healed wrong? So when the change hits her, they\u2019re liable to bust open and be unrepairable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Rhage went back to trying to pull his hair out. \u201cYeah, I should have told her before now, but I just didn\u2019t know how. I told Doc Jane I would. But I\u2019m a fucking coward for both of them. I was hoping ... for good news, I guess, but the longer they\u2019re in there, the more I think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Across the way, the exam room door swung open, and Doc Jane emerged.</p> <p>One look at her face and he knew that the worst case had rolled out in there.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d Rhage gritted as he jumped to his shitkickers. \u201cAnd is there anything we can do?\u201d</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Turtleneck.</p><p>Hours later, as Axe sat silently in the back of the \u201cschool bus,\u201d he tried to think of where in the hell he could get a turtleneck.</p><p>Reaching up to his throat, he massaged the side that he\u2019d had tattooed and wondered if he could find one in his father\u2019s shit. And didn\u2019t that make him want a stiff drink ... or maybe even a syringe full of lights-out.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t been anywhere near his dad\u2019s room since the death.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he said to the blackened window.</p><p>To get out of his head, he looked away from his reflection\u2014and hey, what do you know. Pey-pey had gotten bored of the don\u2019t-touch-my-cousin routine, and was back in his primary mode of staring at Paradise as she sat beside her male.</p><p>No one had had a good time tonight, not that training was ever a party. But yeah, it stung when you were forced to meet your failures head on. What was fun? Seeing Peyton all castrated across the aisle from that female, wishing he could get in her head and help her out, be the savior he felt she needed. You could practically read the thought bubbles floating around.</p><p>Sorry, champ. She had all she required.</p><p>Novo stood up and walked down to Axe, shoving him over so she could take a load off. \u201cI\u2019m going at two a.m. When is your interview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a half hour.\u201d He rubbed his tattoos, thinking they were probably going to work against him. \u201cI gotta hustle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</p> <p>As the female put her palm out, Axe shook it. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess it\u2019s just you and me going for the job.\u201d Her voice took on an edge. \u201cPeyton already has enough money, and far be it from him to let gainful employment get in the way of his smoking up. Boone doesn\u2019t need the cash, either\u2014and Paradise and Craeg are already providing extra security at the Audience House on their nights off.\u201d</p><p>Shit, Axe wasn\u2019t crazy about competing with Novo\u2014he would have much rather gone up against another male, and yeah, guess that made him sexist. Then again, the joke was probably on him. She was just as good at the fighting and the shooting as he was, her strength nearly that of his own, her brains a little ahead of his. She also didn\u2019t look like a serial killer.</p><p>But hey, he would take his piercings out. Bam. Nearly normal.</p><p>He also had zero personal skills. So she could very well beat him in the interview.</p><p>\u201cYou want to have a friendly wager?\u201d Novo drawled.</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gets it? Loser has to pay for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t in a position to buy her a Kit Kat. \u201cHow about winner buys dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, the bus came to a stop and everyone filed off. The night was bitterly cold, and no one lingered to talk. As Axe dematerialized to his father\u2019s cottage, he thought it was weird that he\u2019d never called the little place his \u201cparents\u2019 \u201d\u2014but then again, there had been no \u201cparents\u201d involved with the damn thing. It had been built for his mother, and hadn\u2019t done its job to keep her in the family.</p><p>So the roof and four walls were nothing but a monument to his father\u2019s weakness for a female.</p><p>Going inside, he was glad there was no electricity, no lights to turn on. He couldn\u2019t stand the kitchen, hated looking at it, and he steamed right through the shallow space. The stairs to the second floor were short and steep and he took them two at a time, proceeding to the only open door.</p><p>He kept his father\u2019s room closed off.</p><p>His room was a mattress on the floor, clothes in piles, and not much else. Hell, he didn\u2019t even sleep up here, because the fireplace was downstairs and he had to stay warm. In the spring and summer, though, he\u2019d move back to the second floor\u2014or maybe he wouldn\u2019t. Who cared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Axe went through his own \u201cwardrobe\u201d of muscle shirts, black jeans, and the occasional leather jacket or cloak, although not because he expected a turtleneck to have miraculously appeared courtesy of the Look-More-Normal Fairy Godmother dropping by. It was more because he had to brace himself to go through his father\u2019s stuff.</p><p>Ten minutes and no turtle-for-his-neck later, he was down the hall and opening the door. With no lights on anywhere in the house, the shallow space was nothing but shadows and shades of gray ... kind of like his self-hatred had sucked the color out of everything.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even look at the bed, which was still messy from the last time his father had slept it in two years ago, and he certainly didn\u2019t spare all the pictures of his fucking mother a glance, and no, he didn\u2019t dwell on the layer of dust that covered everything or the fact that one of the windows had sprung from its sash and let in fallen leaves and even some of the snow.</p><p>It seemed colder in the room, his breath condensing in puffs of white.</p> <p>Maybe his father was haunting the place.</p><p>As a shiver went down his spine, Axe marched his ass over to the bureau and went through the things in it with rough, agitated hands. He found what he was looking for in the bottom drawer.</p><p>It seemed so fucking weird to think the thing had been worn and used by the male. And as he shoved the drawer shut, and beat feet out of the room like he was being stalked, he vowed never to go in there again.</p><p>Back in his own space, he stripped off his muscle shirt and pulled on his father\u2019s turtleneck. Heading over to the mirror above his cheap dresser, he leaned in and made sure everything on his throat was covered up.</p><p>Just before he turned away, he reached up and removed, one by one, the black piercings that ran from his lobe up to his cartilage on the same side as his tattoos. Also took out the one on his brow.</p> <p>Next move was to arm himself. Slipping on a shoulder holster, he tucked the pair of forties he\u2019d been given the week before into both sides. The way the Brothers saw it, they were investing time and money into the trainees and the last thing they needed was for anyone in the program to wake up dead because they had shit equipment: Once the class had all been vetted properly at the gun range, the Glocks had been handed out\u2014and although you were not permitted to bring the weapons into the training center, you sure as shit were expected to have \u2019em with you outside of it.</p><p>And use them properly if necessary. Unlike what they\u2019d done the night before.</p><p>Out of the house, didn\u2019t bother to lock the door\u2014after all, there was no electricity to power the alarm, and besides, he didn\u2019t really care about anything under the roof.</p><p>Hell, it\u2019d be a relief if somebody broke in and lit the place on fire. Not that that was likely. He lived in the sticks; his nearest neighbor was a quarter of a mile away and probably took a donkey in to work.</p><p>Axe knew before he even dematerialized to the interview location that the house\u2014or mansion or castle or whatever\u2014was going to be huge. Even poor kids raised outside of the human world knew where the big estates were, and the zip code the place was in?</p><p>Yeah ... okay, he thought as he re-formed.</p> <p>Wow.</p><p>Axe shook his head at the stone structure in front of him. The thing had to be at least three stories high, and the front face of the slate roof alone seemed big as a football field. With about seven hundred black shutters and a front door that was more like the entrance to a parliament or a maybe a municipal library, he couldn\u2019t actually believe a family lived there.</p><p>Then again, it wasn\u2019t just a momma bear, a papa bear, and a baby bear. There were probably dozens of doggen.</p><p>It was exactly the kind of place his father would have been called on to work in.</p><p>Precisely like the sort of fancy home where the male had been killed during the raids.</p><p>Before he blew the job interview before it even started, Axe swallowed his bitterness and hiked it up the snow-covered lawn until he stepped over a low hedge that skirted a circular ring-around and proceeded to a series of steps to the front door.</p><p>There was a huge brass door knocker that was big as his arm, and also a discreet intercom off to one side.</p><p>He was reaching for the button when the heavy weight was opened by\u2014oh, snap\u2014a uniformed butler who looked alarmingly like Sir John Gielgud.</p> <p>In his Arthur years.</p><p>\u201cAre you Axwelle, son of Theirsh?\u201d the male said with perfect diction.</p><p>For some completely unhelpful reason, Axe\u2019s brain coughed out Dudley Moore doing his best drunk impression: You\u2019re a hooker? Jesus ... I forgot! I just thought I was doing great with you!</p><p>\u201cSire?\u201d the butler prompted. \u201cAre you Axwelle?\u201d</p><p>Shaking himself, he almost answered with a Yeah. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, do come in.\u201d The butler backed up and indicated with his hand. \u201cI shall let my master know that you have arrived in a timely fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Something about the guy made him want to be less of a schmo. Fuck that, everything about this whole damn thing made him\u2014</p><p>Axe stopped where he was. Flaring his nostrils, he breathed in as the butler in the penguin suit said a few things and then turned away to walk over to a closed door.</p><p>Wait a minute, Axe thought.</p><p>Pivoting slowly in a circle, he continued to test the scents in the air. The big open reception hall, foyer, whatever the hell it was called, could easily fit three of the houses he lived in and still have room for a bowling alley, a swimming pool, and maybe an ice-skating rink. And the stuff that was placed around the open, cathedral-like space looked really old and really expensive: The floor was white and gray marble and there was, like, crystal shit hanging everywhere and oil paintings mounted on the walls. Oh, and there was a fireplace, but not like the one that kept him warm during the day. Theirs had, like, black marble and gold carvings around it, and the hearth was so big they didn\u2019t have logs so much as tree trunks in there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he couldn\u2019t have cared less about all that.</p><p>What he had caught on the air, after filtering out the woodsy pitch of the crackling fire and the soap of the doggen and a distant aftermath of some kind of meat having been served somewhere on the first floor ... was the scent of that female from last night.</p><p>Peyton\u2019s cousin either had visited here very recently ... or she lived under this roof.</p><p>\u201cMy master will see you now,\u201d the butler said from behind him.</p> <p>Yes, Axe thought as he wheeled around. You\u2019re damn right he will.</p><p>Sometimes nightmares happened in front of you and hurt people you loved, and even though you prayed to wake up ... you knew that there was no alarm clock about to ring, no eyelids to lift, no rollover and reposition about to save you.</p><p>Mary was in one of those loops of suffering now.</p><p>Bitty was lying on an exam table, a white sheet and blanket folded off to the side, her thin, pale limbs reflecting the light from the massive fixture above her. She was so pale, her face was the color of a Kleenex, and she was trembling, a twitchy, wrung-out shell of the vibrant, happy little girl she usually was.</p><p>As Mary stood next to her, the details of the clinical environment, the beeping equipment and the white tile, the stainless-steel everything, the people in blue scrubs and masks, were at once crystal clear and utterly diffused\u2014and as in a dreamscape, the two extremes on the awareness scale alternated, the scene going in and out of focus randomly.</p> <p>She\u2019d known it was going to be hard to get through the night. But she\u2019d assumed that would be because of Bitty\u2019s memories of abuse getting triggered. Or the fact that the girl was having to go back to the very clinic at which she had watched her mother die. Or even due to the claustrophobia of the MRI, the discomfort of the examination, the tedium of waiting for the test results to come in.</p><p>Not. Even. Fucking. Close.</p><p>Each one of Bitty\u2019s major bones was being broken and reset. Even on the leg that had a shin made from a titanium rod. Without anesthesia because she was allergic to it.</p><p>It was indescribable, the horror, the pain, the terror. And it was hard not to rail against God in this moment, cursing whoever was up there for this perfect storm of bad news: growth plates compromised by badly healed breaks; possible amputations after the transition; her being a non-viable candidate for general anesthesia due to her previous reaction to it.</p><p>What little pain relief that could be given didn\u2019t go nearly far enough.</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cYou can do this.\u201d</p> <p>Bitty didn\u2019t seem to comprehend the words. She was lost to the haze of agony, and Mary just wanted to break down in tears herself.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t afford the trip to insanity.</p><p>Mary leaned down even closer. \u201cLast one, okay? This is our last one.\u201d</p><p>Bitty\u2019s eyes opened wide, tears making them luminous, the great purple smudges that had appeared underneath making her seem like she was on the verge of death. \u201cI can\u2019t do it. Please ... make them stop....\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more. I promise you, just one more.\u201d She brushed back the bangs and kissed Bitty\u2019s forehead. \u201cHold my hand. Come on. Squeeze as hard as you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it ... please, Mommy ... help me....\u201d</p><p>Sobs racked the little girl\u2019s body, making the hospital gown seem as if it were caught in a breeze, and Mary began to cry, too, the tears rolling down her cheeks and dropping onto the thin mattress of the table.</p><p>Sniffling, praying for strength, utterly lost, Mary made a mental note that the next time someone looked at her and told her that she had all the answers, she was going to kick them in the ass.</p> <p>\u201cHavers, can you give us ...\u201d</p><p>As she looked up, she found the physician and his two female nurses standing back. And the look he gave her was so full of compassion, it was nearly impossible to reconcile it with what she knew he had done to his sister Marissa.</p><p>But no one had ever faulted him in his profession.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just breathe,\u201d Mary said to Bitty. \u201cCome on ... breathe with me....\u201d</p><p>The MRIs had shown that the girl was at risk of catastrophic deformity when she went through her transition. For vampires, their growth pattern to maturity was compressed into the singular explosion that occurred during their change. It was as if, in the human parallel, a fourteen-year-old became twenty-five physically in a matter of six hours.</p><p>In Bitty\u2019s case, there were a series of subtle, and not so subtle, curves in her long bones because of the previous fractures. And Mary had noticed them, but hadn\u2019t really dwelled on the reasons for them or their implications. The issue was that when that explosive growth happened, those deformities were liable to separate completely, snapping because the force of the expansion would be off-angle.</p><p>The end result? Amputation. Of all or most of her limbs. Because for about six months after transition, the bones in vampires were not capable of fusing breaks.</p><p>The decision had been made to fix them now.</p><p>And Bitty had made the choice. She didn\u2019t want to come back in a month or a year or two years or five years to get it done. Nothing was going to change and there was no reason to have the prospect hanging over her head.</p><p>But this was just too much.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t do this....\u201d</p><p>Mary couldn\u2019t agree more. She couldn\u2019t do this anymore, either. Too much. Tapped out. Over the threshold.</p><p>Yes, there was a larger goal here, but they\u2019d done enough. Hadn\u2019t they? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan R-r-r-r-rhage come in?\u201d Bitty stammered.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Do you want the others?\u201d</p><p>Anything to have this work.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I\u2019m crying.\u201d Bitty sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m not brave....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yes, you are.\u201d Mary blinked back more tears. \u201cSweetheart, you are the bravest person I know.\u201d</p><p>There was a tradition in vampire culture whereby the males of the species were not a part of medical interventions for females\u2014and there were times when Bitty\u2019s modesty had been compromised out of necessity. Now, though? All bets were off.</p><p>Mary wasn\u2019t even going to ask Havers for permission. They needed something else to help the girl finish this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Doc Jane volunteered.</p><p>Rhage came in and Mary couldn\u2019t help it. The second she met his eyes, she choked up so badly, she couldn\u2019t breathe. And typical of a bonded male, he went to her first, hugging her tight, whispering something in her ear the words of which did not register, the strong, steady tone of which meant everything.</p> <p>And then he was all about the little girl, his face losing color as he looked down at Bitty, his hands shaking as he reached out and pulled her into a hug.</p><p>A lot of medical people rushed forward, and Mary tugged him back. \u201cHer arms and leg need casts still. Be careful.\u201d</p><p>Rhage laid the girl back down as if she were made of glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brave,\u201d Bitty moaned up at him.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d he said, brushing her hair back. \u201cYou\u2019re so brave and I\u2019m so proud of you and I love you very much.\u201d</p><p>They talked for a spell, and then there was a pause.</p> <p>As if sensing the time was now, Havers said gently, \u201cJust one last one. And then you\u2019re all finished.\u201d</p><p>Rhage\u2019s brows sank down low, and Mary knew without asking that her hellren\u2019s fangs had descended and the protective part of him was considering ripping the doctor\u2019s throat out. But that was instinct, not logic.</p><p>She stroked Rhage\u2019s arm. \u201cShh, it\u2019s okay. One more and this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more ...\u201d He rubbed his face. \u201cWe can do this.\u201d</p><p>Rhage nodded at Havers, who was looking apprehensive. And then the medical staff stepped up to the table again.</p><p>Bitty\u2019s pelvis was strapped down again and her opposite leg was likewise immobilized. What Havers had to do was grip the thigh and apply pressure until there was a snap. And then he had to pull at the knee until he visualized correct alignment through the skin\u2014something that was relatively clear given how painfully thin and under-muscularized the girl was. An X-ray would be taken to ensure that all was as it needed to be and then the casts would be put on so that the bone regenerated and reconnected itself correctly.</p><p>The break and alignment was so primitive, so brutal, that in the midst of all the high-tech machinery and state-of-the-art everything it seemed below the modern standard of care. But there was an undeniable mechanical side to the body, and this was nuts-and-bolts stuff\u2014and again, Mary had to give Marissa\u2019s brother credit. He\u2019d done this a number of times for his patients before, and he\u2019d been quick, decisive, and gotten it right with each of Bitty\u2019s limbs.</p><p>To give Havers room, Rhage went around to the other side, his tremendous height and girth like the Great Wall of China had suddenly taken up res right beside Bitty. Taking the girl\u2019s hand, he had looked both stricken and strong.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do this,\u201d he said to both her and Mary. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to get through this together and then we go home to movies and ice cream. Right? Before we know it, we\u2019ll be out of here, we\u2019ll be free, and we\u2019re going to set this behind us.\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded and so did Bitty.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Rhage ordered.</p><p>Havers moved the little hospital gown up, exposing a pair of knobby knees that were too big compared to the circumference of the calves and thighs.</p><p>Oh, God, as long as Mary lived, she was going to remember the sight of those blue-gloved hands gripping Bitty\u2019s thigh, squeezing into her meager flesh and\u2014</p><p>Bitty started to scream in pain.</p><p>And no more than a split second later, a brilliant light flashed through the exam room, as bright as an explosion.</p><p>At first, Mary thought the overhead fixtures had gone out, but then her brain made a horrible connection.</p><p>Ripping her eyes away from Havers, she looked at Rhage in horror. \u201cNo, not now!\u201d</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>The beast had been triggered.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Enough was enough, Elise thought as she finally descended to the first floor. After stewing in her cousin\u2019s room for what felt like hours, she knew she was just putting off the inevitable.</p><p>If her father wouldn\u2019t entertain a civil audience with her?</p><p>Then she was going to get uncivil. Because what was truly unacceptable to her, what she refused to live with for one moment longer, was this familial equivalent of a media blackout.</p><p>Besides, what was her father going to do? Turn into a great snarling beast or something?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a surprise to find his study door shut, and as she walked across the foyer, it was impossible not to have an attack of the couldn\u2019t-possibly\u2019s. She had never once interrupted him when he was working on the family investments\u2014but as an image of her beautiful mother came to mind, Elise used it as a battering ram. Even as her upbringing tried to hold her back, she pictured her mahmen and what the female would have done in this situation.</p><p>Elise didn\u2019t even knock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No reason to give him an excuse to deny entrance.</p><p>She just went for it, pushing her way inside\u2014</p><p>That memory of her mother was power-washed out of mind as the tableau at the desk sank in: Her father was at his chair, presiding over the masculine room, his dark suit and tie his informal attire. \u2019Cuz formal was white tie and tails.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the shocker.</p> <p>There was, however, a male sitting across from him, a male who had a pair of bulging shoulders and long, thick-thighed legs that dwarfed not just the seat, but the study as a whole. His hair was dark, shaved up the nape, and his turtleneck and leathers were black. As were the holster and the gun she could see under his arm.</p><p>The male slowly turned around to look at her. But she didn\u2019t need to see his face.</p><p>It was him. From the cigar club.</p><p>Elise\u2019s body roared with heat\u2014and her brain roared with fury. How had father found out she had seen the trainee? Had there been another vampire around when they\u2019d argued at the side of the street? But come on, they hadn\u2019t even had much of a verbal altercation. And Peyton had interrupted\u2014</p><p>Peyton. That son of a bitch.</p> <p>\u201cFather, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is my daughter,\u201d her father interjected. \u201cPlease excuse her interruption. Elise, this is Axwelle.\u201d</p><p>The male she had been thinking about non-stop rose to his feet and towered over her. \u201cPleased to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked back and forth between the two of them as Axwelle bowed at the waist. As an unmated daughter of high blood in the glymera, even though there was a witness, it would have been impermissible for him to offer his hand to shake, much less for her to touch him in any way. And he knew that.</p><p>And it was just as well. Even though she was confused, what she was crystal clear on? The effect of that male on her had only gotten stronger.</p><p>The hours she had spent thinking about him had distilled that initial attraction into a compulsion.</p> <p>But what the hell was he doing here? If her father was upset because she\u2019d met the guy the night before, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have introduced her to Axwelle as if they were strangers.</p><p>Well, they were strangers.</p><p>Elise looked across the desk at her father. He had slumped in his chair, as if he were too tired to adhere to his posture standards.</p><p>\u201cElise\u201d\u2014he indicated the vacant seat next to Axwelle\u2014\u201cdo sit down.\u201d</p><p>She complied instantly, crossing over and lowering herself into the seat. In her peripheral vision, she noticed that Axwelle wasn\u2019t looking at her. His eyes were focused forward on her father.</p><p>Yeah, boy, he was ... okay, she hated the word hot. As if someone you found sexually attractive was like a plate of food out of the oven? But in fact, that was pretty much the first and only thing that came to her mind. That black turtleneck so worked for him. Where had his piercings gone? He had removed them.</p><p>What would his hair feel like? Soft and thick\u2014</p><p>\u201c... and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve brought him here.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking herself, she blurted, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter my discussions with Abalone, the First Advisor, I have come to that perhaps unmistakable, although uncomfortable, conclusion.\u201d</p><p>Great. She had missed on the whole thing. But chances were good that none of whatever he\u2019d said worked in her favor.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think I need to be sehcluded.\u201d Elise crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI think that is a backward way of handling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why I believe a bodyguard is necessary if you\u2019re going to continue to pursue your studies.\u201d</p><p>Cue the screeching tires.</p><p>As she recoiled, her father nodded at Axwelle. \u201cHe is here applying for the position. He is a trainee in the Black Dagger Brotherhood\u2019s program, and comes highly recommended by the King himself. There is another candidate coming in in an hour. A Novo, I believe the name was. He also comes with the very highest of accolades.\u201d</p><p>Bodyguard?</p><p>As in this male would be guarding ... her body?</p><p>Elise swiveled her head in Axwelle\u2019s direction as the implications started to her occur to her\u2014but then she snapped her attention back to her father.</p><p>\u201cWait ... so if he\u2019s with me, you\u2019ll let me attend classes on campus and do my teacher\u2019s assistant job? You\u2019ll allow me to complete my degree?\u201d</p><p>Her father cleared his throat. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ... I ... we ...\u201d She stammered some more. \u201cFather ... what has changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>Felixe closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \u201cThe First Advisor is a male of worth whom I respect greatly. He made me realize ... if he can allow his blooded daughter into the training center program? I can most certainly permit you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise burst up out of the chair and was around the desk in a heartbeat. In her family, physical displays of affection were eschewed in favor of formal interactions such as bows, curtsies, and the very infrequent air kiss on both cheeks. But it was impossible for her not to express herself.</p><p>As she threw her arms around her father, he stiffened even more than usual, although after a moment, he did reach up awkwardly and pat her on the arm. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he said in a rough voice. \u201cYes. Fine. Indeed.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t dismissing her. On the contrary, she had the sense he was equally emotional\u2014it was just they didn\u2019t come from people who had any ability to handle intimacy. For the pair of them, this was the equivalent of embracing, holding on, and sobbing as she apologized for lying and violating his trust and he vowed to try to be the father she needed and deserved, as opposed to the repressive force she was coming to resent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Straightening, Elise pulled her cashmere sweater down and glanced at Axwelle.</p><p>His yellow eyes were on her, his lids low, his expression remote. From her father\u2019s perspective, he no doubt appeared to be intense in a professional way. But she knew better. There was fire in that stare, fire that would consume her.</p><p>If she let it.</p><p>\u201cI think this is great idea,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cThe bodyguard thing.\u201d</p> <p>As Elise spoke, Axe shifted his eyes back to the female\u2019s father. One guaranteed way to lose the job before he even got it? Undress the daughter in your mind right in front of the guy.</p><p>Even a poor kid like him knew that was \u201ctacky.\u201d</p><p>Plus, the truly odd thing, considering the way he typically related to members of the opposite sex, was that he felt as though pulling a leer was just plain wrong. The world was a dangerous place, and this female was extraordinary. Males, human or vampire, coveted things like her. And then there were the slayers.</p><p>She needed protection. Deserved it.</p><p>He was here in a professional capacity, and there was nothing professional about being the very thing he could be hired to keep her safe from.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, dear,\u201d her father said as he shifted in his chair. Like he preferred her to go back around and be at an arm\u2019s length. \u201cAll is well.\u201d</p><p>And that was kind of sad\u2014then again, he\u2019d gotten his fill of parental rejection, hadn\u2019t he. At least she didn\u2019t seem to mind, though, as she returned to the chair beside him.</p><p>\u201cNow, is there anything you should wish to ask of him, Elise?\u201d</p><p>Axe felt her glance over, and damn it, he liked it. He wanted her eyes all over his face, his throat, his naked body. He wanted to be sprawled out in front of her on some bed ... maybe the floor ... fuck it, he\u2019d lie flat on hot coals for her if that turned her on ... and he wanted to have his hand on his cock as he looked in her eyes and begged her to ride him.</p><p>The submission fantasy, with him as the sub, was a new one for him, but what the hell.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like it was actually going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d Axe prompted her.</p><p>\u201cUm ... so I go to SUNY Caldie. I attend class at night and I work with one of my professors as his assistant. Will you be able to ... blend in?\u201d</p><p>Axe could tell she thought the answer was no, but he wasn\u2019t sure she exactly cared. Then again, she had narrowly missed being all but shut indoors for the rest of her life if a sehclusion petition had been filed.</p><p>If he were her, he\u2019d take a hall pass to the university in any form it came: Santa Claus ... asshole in a Batman suit ... him.</p><p>\u201cI will do whatever is necessary,\u201d Axe said\u2014and he directed the response to her sire. \u201cI will be as visible or fade-to-black as required. I will not hesitate to use force, but I will not provoke the humans. And yes, I am prepared to take a bullet for her if I have to. Nothing scares me and I do not run\u2014from anything. Even my own death.\u201d</p><p>Next to him, Elise recoiled, but he couldn\u2019t help her with that. He\u2019d gotten a modified dose of reality last night out in the field, and he knew all too well exactly what her father was worried about.</p><p>Felixe the Younger cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s just fine. That is ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you need,\u201d Axe finished for the male. \u201cThat is what is necessary if you want to protect your daughter. The goal is to let her do her work and make sure she comes home alive every single night. I can give you that peace of mind because when she is in my care, she will be my only priority, above even myself. Nothing and no one will matter except for her.\u201d</p> <p>Felixe exhaled like the elephant that had been sitting on his chest had gotten up for a drink at its water source.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me,\u201d Axe said.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d More of that throat clearing. \u201cThat is just fine, son. Just ... fine.\u201d</p><p>Annnnnnnnd that was when he knew he\u2019d been hired.</p><p>Meanwhile, Elise was quiet and tense next to him, but then she was telling him what her schedule was like\u2014which wasn\u2019t going to be a problem, because now that the trainees were heading out into the field, the Brotherhood\u2019s classes were going to be starting later.</p><p>He listened to it all, and then her father told him what the salary was.</p><p>Holy shit, Axe thought.</p><p>Steak-for-dinner money. Electricity. Repairs to his father\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your family like, son?\u201d the father inquired.</p><p>Axe started to jerk back and caught himself. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for anything personal.</p><p>At least the answer was easy: \u201cMy parents are dead. I have no mate and never will. I have no ties to anything or anybody aside from the training program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose your family in the raids?\u201d Elise asked softly. Like she was having a moment or some shit.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cAll you need to worry about is whether I can keep you alive, and I will. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>As her spine straightened in that chair, he kept his smile to himself. She might be a female, but she was a fighter at her core. And she clearly didn\u2019t like doors shut in her face, literally or figuratively.</p><p>An image of her holding his arms over his head and putting all her weight into keeping him where she wanted him made an erection threaten behind his fly.</p><p>Axe cocked a brow back at her, challenging her to let some of that heat out. But she wouldn\u2019t. Not in front of her father.</p><p>Man, he couldn\u2019t wait for his first night on the job. She was going to give him an earful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And he was, absolutely, hired.</p><p>Even if Axe hadn\u2019t come across as the deadly force her father was looking for, Felixe had wrongly assumed Novo was a guy: There was no way this genteel chauvinist was going to stand for a female guarding his daughter, no matter how spectacular a soldier and professional Novo was. And that was just fucked up.</p><p>But it worked in his favor.</p><p>Because he wanted her\u2014</p> <p>The job, he corrected. He wanted the job.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll be in touch,\u201d Felixe said as he rose to his feet.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Axe murmured to them both. \u201cI think you will be. And I\u2019ll give you my answer right now. I accept the position and I can start whenever you two are ready.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>Complete. Chaos.</p> <p>As the beast broke out of Rhage\u2019s body, triggered by Bitty\u2019s suffering, Mary covered the little girl on the exam table with her own body\u2014although not from any fear that the dragon would hurt her.</p><p>Parts of the ceiling were raining down, chunks of plaster falling from where the great dragon\u2019s head had slammed into the panels. And then that barbed tail was slashing back and forth, splintering cabinets and scattering equipment, smashing into the sink and springing the pipes.</p><p>As a spray of hot water golf-sprinklered all around and lights flickered, Havers and his staff had the exact wrong idea. Instead of freezing, they made themselves targets by bolting around, trying to get to an exit that was blocked by something that might eat them.</p><p>But come on. Like any of them had dealt with this before?</p><p>\u201cStop! Don\u2019t move!\u201d Mary barked.</p><p>And that was when the beast roared.</p> <p>Mary turned her head to try to get one of her ears protected, but she wasn\u2019t going to use her hands. Bitty was so exposed\u2014</p><p>Behind the dragon, the door to the exam room broke open, Zsadist, V, and Lassiter crowding in.</p><p>\u201cClose the door!\u201d Mary yelled. \u201cAnd stay out!\u201d</p><p>Her best shot for this not turning into complete carnage was to make contact with the dragon, soothe it, and keep the thing trained on her and Bitty. As long as she could get and keep its attention, no one was going to get hurt\u2014</p><p>The dragon\u2019s jaw snapped closed. And then the beast seemed to shudder as its reptilian eyes swung around and focused on Bitty. Chuffing noises came out of its throat, and it took a step forward, the clawed foot landing heavy as construction equipment.</p><p>Mary slowly straightened, letting Rhage\u2019s alter ego see the child. \u201cShe\u2019s okay. Come on, investigate for yourself.\u201d</p><p>The massive head of the monster lowered slowly, as if it didn\u2019t want to spook the little girl, and as Mary backed off, the muzzle snuffled over Bitty. Worried sounds of inquiry came out, part nervous purr, part aching chest rattle.</p><p>Bitty lifted her hand up and stroked the purple-scaled cheek. \u201cI\u2019m okay....\u201d</p> <p>Her voice was surprisingly strong, and then she smiled, as if the room wasn\u2019t a wreck, and people weren\u2019t scared to death, and she hadn\u2019t been through torture.</p><p>Mary put her palm on the bulging neck of the beast, feeling the muscle and the power. \u201cIt\u2019s all right ... shh ... that\u2019s right, snuffle over her....\u201d</p><p>Without moving her head or even eyes, she whispered to Havers, \u201cTell me you got the bone reset.\u201d</p><p>In her peripheral vision, she saw the male straighten his hornrimmed glasses, which had gone cockeyed and a half. \u201cI\u2019m s-s-sorry\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bone,\u201d Mary repeated in the same quiet, even tone. \u201cDid you do what you needed to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-y-yes, I believe ... yes. I n-n-n-need an X-ray to confirm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s not try to do that now.\u201d</p><p>The nurses clutched together even tighter, as if they were afraid of their boss challenging that.</p><p>\u201cI ... no,\u201d he said, \u201cI agree it would not be advisable the now. Permit me to inquire\u2014how long ... ah, how long does he ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all depends. But we\u2019re going nowhere until Rhage comes back.\u201d</p><p>Bitty and the beast were still communicating with touch and sound, and as far as Mary was concerned, considering the distress that the girl had been in, the two of them could spend the next six hours together and the rest of the adults in the room were just going to have to suck it up.</p><p>On that note, Mary glanced around and winced. This was going to run into some money, she thought, as she checked out the ruined floor, the battered ceiling, the debris field of glass-front cabinets. But then she looked back at her hellren and her little girl. The beast was a big part of their non-linear, freaky family, and deserved to be counted\u2014</p><p>The door opened a crack, and then Lassiter, in his game gear, stepped inside the room. As he held something out, Mary couldn\u2019t see what it was\u2014</p><p>Wait a minute, was that a Snickers bar?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she blurted as he cautiously approached.</p><p>The beast snapped to attention, its jowls curling up in a snarl at the angel. But Lassiter was undaunted\u2014so not a shocker.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said. \u201cHave a Snickers. You\u2019re not yourself when you\u2019re hangry.\u201d</p><p>There was a heartbeat of a pause. And then she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She had to start laughing. \u201cReally. Really?\u201d</p><p>And it was funny, as Lassiter looked over at her, his expression behind the open grille of the hockey mask was goofy\u2014yet his eyes were anything but. That pupil-less, glowing stare was dead serious, offering her a kind of lifeline through the painful reality that she loved a child who had been horribly mistreated and that was something she was going to have to deal with for the rest of her days. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered to the angel as the beast reached out and sniffed at the brown wrapper.</p><p>\u201cG\u2019head,\u201d Lassiter said to the dragon. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>And what do you know, with a precision that was impressive given the dagger-size of those chompers, Rhage\u2019s alter ego took the tiny little candy bar between its front teeth and munched it down.</p><p>A split second later, there was a poof! and Rhage was naked and shivering on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cAm I good or what!\u201d Lassiter proclaimed. \u201cYeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah.\u201d</p><p>Rhage came back from the far side of Beast World blind, freezing cold, and in an absolute panic. As he flailed around on a floor that seemed slippery, he was petrified there was blood everywhere\u2014but no, he didn\u2019t scent any carnage. What he did smell was electrical burning, plaster, and astringent, and he was dimly aware that he wasn\u2019t nauseous, which was another good indicator that he hadn\u2019t eaten anyone\u2014</p><p>Wait, why did he taste peanut and chocolate? And something plastic-y?</p><p>\u201cMary ...!\u201d he called out into the darkness. \u201cBitty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s okay.\u201d Mary\u2019s voice was close to him and utterly calm. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right....\u201d</p> <p>As her hand smoothed over his forehead and brushed through his hair, he mumbled, \u201cBitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here, Father. The beast just wanted to make sure I was sorted....\u201d</p><p>Rhage exhaled\u2014and then realized he was lying on a bunch of debris. And there was rain hitting his face?</p><p>Oh, God, how in the hell had the beast fit into the exam room? It wasn\u2019t like the damn thing could ratchet down on its size.</p><p>Talking. Footsteps. A light weight being drawn over his lower body. A loud scraping noise like some big piece of a wall or the ceiling or part of a tall cabinet was being moved out of the way. Meanwhile, all he could do was lie there like a planker, drowning in a pool of aches and frustration.</p><p>It fucking sucked.</p> <p>Vishous\u2019s voice came up close. \u201cMy brother, we\u2019re going to put you on a stretcher, okay? Then get you out of here. Fritz is coming in the Mercedes because we can\u2019t fit you in the GTO as easy.\u201d</p><p>Fuck me, Rhage thought. He was so fucking tired of this shit.</p><p>Bitty had needed him, and what had he offered her? A fucking mess. What the fuck had made him feel like he could be a father? He couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cI want to go with him,\u201d Bitty said.</p><p>Doc Jane spoke up. \u201cWe need to set your limbs, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait!\u201d Rhage barked. \u201cI want to wait!\u201d</p><p>Bitty\u2019s voice grew strident. \u201cPut the casts on and we\u2019ll go. But we want to be together.\u201d</p><p>Rhage closed his lids even though it didn\u2019t change how much he couldn\u2019t see. The last thing the girl needed to worry about was him\u2014</p> <p>\u201cYou got it, Bit,\u201d Vishous affirmed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I asked for Fritz to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to take care of my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do.\u201d Vishous was talking in as gentle a way as he ever did. \u201cAnd you got it right, kid. He\u2019ll do better with you.\u201d</p><p>No, Rhage thought. He was supposed to support Bitty.</p><p>This was a total fucking nightmare.</p><p>But at least things moved fairly quickly after that. Havers cleared a path and rolled in a portable X-ray machine, and the image confirmed the thighbone was where it needed to be. Then there was a flour-and-water kind of smell as fiberglass casts were put on both of Bit\u2019s legs and her arms. Rhage refused to leave her, staying on the hard wet floor until everything was dealt with.</p><p>And then they were off.</p><p>Bit had a wheelchair. He was a slab of meat on a gurney. And the grim entourage of Z, V, and Lassiter fell in step behind Mary.</p><p>Talk about the halt and the lame.</p><p>\u201cHey, Rhage?\u201d Lassiter said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cIf your career as a trained killer doesn\u2019t work out? Don\u2019t go into interior design. You don\u2019t have a knack for it.\u201d</p><p>Rhage had to laugh. \u201cYou are such a fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and you\u2019re a good male. Even if you just caused about two hundred grand of damage back there. Don\u2019t worry, I think we can write it off your taxes. You know, as a demolition deduction.\u201d</p><p>There was a squeeze of his shoulder and then Rhage sensed the angel fade back. Taking a deep breath, it was a case of holding it together until he and Mary could get some privacy.</p><p>Then he\u2019d fall apart.</p><p>Onto an elevator. Slow rise. Slight jerk as they came up to the surface.</p><p>The cold, dry air of the night was fantastic in his lungs, but it did nothing to relieve the ache in his chest. And he and Bit both moaned and groaned as they were moved, by other people, into the back of Fritz\u2019s S600 4Matic.</p><p>Which was brutal for Rhage and not just because every joint and straightaway of his body was killing him.</p><p>He wanted to be the one lifting Bitty up and settling her in the back bucket seat. He should have been folding up the wheelchair and putting it in the trunk. He needed to offer support to her as they bumped their way over to the paved road.</p><p>It was he who should be carrying her up to her room when they got to the mansion.</p><p>\u201cRhage?\u201d</p><p>As Mary said his name, he looked in the direction of the front of the sedan. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Or at least those were the words they spoke. What they had actually communicated was: </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhage, I know you\u2019re not doing well. Can you make it home so we can talk about it then? I\u2019m really worried about you and I\u2019d go into it here and now, but I\u2019m aware that you don\u2019t want to do that kind of thing in public.</p><p>Oh, God, Mary, this was horrible. I feel awful. Will you still love me even if I\u2019m the worst father on the face of the earth and I never, ever get any better at it?</p><p>You are not the worst father. We all have limitations, and we all have things that we wish might have gone better. But please remember. Being a dad is a lifelong commitment and you\u2019re just starting out. Don\u2019t generalize, okay?</p><p>As the car started to move, Rhage took a deep breath and\u2014</p> <p>Bitty reached across the seat and took his hand. \u201cThanks for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt meant a lot to me that you came\u2014and that you were in the room with me.\u201d</p><p>Rhage recoiled. \u201cBitty ... no offense, but I made everything worse. I mean, I trashed the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never could have done that last one without you.\u201d Her voice was both shy and lovely. \u201cYou know ... my birth sire? He never did anything like that for me. He never ... he didn\u2019t even want me to go to the clinic. You know, even though I was hurt....\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cSo thank you. You\u2019re the best father ever.\u201d</p> <p>And then her head went down on his shoulder.</p><p>Tears welled into his eyes, stinging them, and making him blink in the midst of his blindness.</p><p>\u201cBitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her little hand and cleared his throat. \u201cYou want ice cream when we get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please. Mint chocolate chip? We can all have some. We\u2019ll get three spoons.\u201d</p> <p>Closing his eyes, he couldn\u2019t believe how powerful Bitty\u2019s forgiveness was. He felt positively resurrected, while at the same time, he couldn\u2019t fathom the generosity. How could this little girl accept him even though he hadn\u2019t been the Gibraltar he\u2019d intended on being?</p><p>He\u2019d been far closer to Godzilla.</p><p>From up in front, he could sense Mary staring at them both. And then his female murmured, because she always said the right thing at the right time, \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful not to have to be perfect to be loved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Rhage replied roughly. \u201cAnd three spoons sounds like heaven to me.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>The call came in to Axe\u2019s Brotherhood-issued cell phone at around four a.m., and he answered it as he sat in front of the fire in his father\u2019s cottage.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Sure as if he had conjured her up out of nowhere, the female he had been thinking about non-stop said, \u201cHi, it\u2019s Elise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I get the job?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cYes, you did. The other bodyguard that came was a female, and my father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould never have hired her. Yeah, I guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm ... is there any way you could come back to the house? My sire would like you to sign some documents and then I thought we could talk a little more about the next couple of nights? I\u2019m not sure we ironed out how many evenings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, okay. All right. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Axe ended the call and sat there with his phone in his hand. And three ... two ... one\u2014</p><p>Sure enough, the call from Peyton came in next. And Axe didn\u2019t bother with a greeting, he just accepted it and kept the phone where it was, down by his thigh.</p><p>Through the tiny little ear speaker, the male went off, his voice all treble. \u201cAre you fucking kidding me? What the hell kind of lies did you tell them? You have no business\u2014none!\u2014guarding my cousin. You are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe put the phone up to his ear. \u201cNot your decision, Peyton. Sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Axe cranked his head around to the front door. \u201cAre you kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen your fucking door!\u201d came the demand.</p><p>Axe ended the connection and got up, his knees cracking. Muttering under his breath, he went over, cranked the knob, and opened up.</p><p>\u201cFYI, I don\u2019t lock this place,\u201d he said in a bored tone. \u201cNext time you come to rant at me, just walk on in.\u201d</p><p>As he pivoted away, he had every faith that Peyton would ride his ass, and surprise!, surprise!, that\u2019s what the aristocrat did, marching through the little room toward the fire.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you can\u2019t turn the heat up?\u201d Peyton snapped. \u201cAnd it\u2019s dark as a cave as well as cold as fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre rich people like you bred to be judgmental? Or does it just happen because of all the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not a fucking game, asshole!\u201d</p><p>Axe pivoted and rolled his eyes at the guy. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m playing Monopoly over here?\u201d</p><p>Peyton got right up in his shit. \u201cTell them you\u2019re not going to do it. Or I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck do you think you are? Coming in here and trying to order me around? You don\u2019t know me, we\u2019re not kin, and what I do on my free time is none of your fucking business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeny that you want her. Go on, lie to my face and tell me that you don\u2019t want her\u2014and then you can piss around a whole lot of bullshit that you\u2019re going to be even halfway professional in this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI, Richie Rich\u201d\u2014Axe jabbed two fingers into the SOB\u2019s chest\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve spent all my life around things I can\u2019t have. So I\u2019m really fucking used to it. And you should feel pretty cocksucking good about that. That\u2019s what you people do, right.

As contact was made, Axe\u2019s head snapped up and over, his brain going loose-cannon in his skull, his vision briefly browning out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking deluded, man,\u201d Peyton spat. \u201cYou\u2019re totally\u2014\u201d</p><p>Twice. In less than twenty-four hours. The douche bag punches him twice.</p> <p>Axe pulled the gun he kept tucked in his waistband out and put it to the guy\u2019s temple so quick, Peyton didn\u2019t have time to step back. \u201cThe safety\u2019s off. And I have nothing to lose. So how \u2019bout we start with you never fucking hitting me again. You got two shots on me. The third will put you in a grave.\u201d</p><p>Peyton blinked. A couple of times. And Axe met him right in the eyes just so the male knew how dead serious he was.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d Axe said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me and Paradise. She\u2019s with her male. She picked him. I\u2019ve never been with her and I never will be. So you just drop that bullshit\u2014and if you don\u2019t call Elise\u2019s father right now, I\u2019ll go over there myself and tell him you\u2019re out. You are not getting into that house\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe moved the gun to the side a thin inch and pulled the trigger. The pop was loud; the impact of the bullet in the wall was louder.</p><p>Peyton shouted and covered his head, dropping to his knees. But Axe was done. Reaching down with his free hand, he grabbed the fuck-twit\u2019s expensive jacket and spun the male up and around, punching him back into the wall by the fireplace so hard the plaster cracked.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to know why it\u2019s so cold in here?\u201d Axe gritted out. \u201cIt\u2019s because I can\u2019t afford heat. And that\u2019s the reason there are no lights on, too. You may have the luxury of not worrying where your next meal or your next Mercedes is coming from, but I\u2019m pinching pennies and eating at the training center as often as I can. You have no right to tell me to do shit\u2014and my not taking a job just so you don\u2019t have to face the fact that your other cousin was recently murdered is not my fucking problem. Oh, and P.S., fuck you\u2014don\u2019t stand there in your fancy loafers while you\u2019re not with the female you want, and maintain for one second that just because I\u2019m poor, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do the same. We can\u2019t help who we\u2019re attracted to, but thoughts are not actions. Even for commoners.\u201d</p><p>Axe punctuated his little speech with another bam into the wall. Then he released his hold and walked off, prowling around the tiny living room with its haphazard furniture and the drapes that were all wilted and the threadbare rugs. As the silence stretched out, he hated the fact that he was ashamed of his father\u2019s house.</p><p>It was yet another betrayal of the male. And more than that, Peyton and his platinum-plated double standards were hardly anything worth living up to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you,\u201d the male said grimly. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re making, I\u2019ll double it. Triple it.\u201d</p><p>Axe twisted around and stared at the guy.</p><p>Peyton put his palms up. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a year\u2019s worth up front. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Axe opened his mouth. Shut it.</p><p>In the end, he just grabbed his leather jacket and walked out of the room for the front door.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Peyton demanded.</p><p>\u201cShut the door behind you. Or don\u2019t. I don\u2019t give a fuck. But if I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m going to have to explain to Elise why I killed you, and I\u2019d rather talk about her class schedule.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s heart was pounding as she paced back and forth over the gray and white marble squares of the foyer\u2019s floor. Her father had left for a meeting across town with her uncle. The butler and staff were working quietly in the rear of the house\u2014which, considering her family\u2019s mansion was over twenty-five thousand square feet in size, meant they were nowhere to be found. And her aunt was upstairs in bed.</p><p>Looking across at the French ormolu clock on the bomb\u00e9 chest by the grand door, she double-checked her watch. Then she turned to the antique mirror next to her and stared at her wavy reflection. The distortion seemed apt. She wasn\u2019t sure what she was doing, what she was going to say.</p><p>Fiddling with the collar of her cashmere sweater, she made sure her wide-legged Donna Karan slacks were smooth over her hips. Her shoes were nothing special, just Tory Burch flats.</p><p>She wished she were in jeans, but her father didn\u2019t approve of them.</p><p>As if the house were a country club with a dress code\u2014</p><p>A rattling sound made her frown. Her phone, which was on vibrate, was going off over by the clock and she rushed to the thing.</p><p>It was Troy\u2014</p><p>Great thunder rolled through the open space, the front door knocker being used by a strong hand.</p><p>As she put the phone back down without answering, she thought, Well, wasn\u2019t that a revealing choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her heart skipped behind her rib cage\u2014and then she jumped as the butler came out of the library.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have it,\u201d she told him with what she hoped was an easy smile. \u201cNot to worry.\u201d</p><p>The doggen shuffled to a halt as if a polite dog fight between his sense of duty and her direct order were jamming his circuits.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Elise said. \u201cDo return to your more important duties.\u201d</p> <p>He hesitated for another moment, his eyes going to the big brass handle as if he had to go through at least a mental projection of doing the deed before he could leave. And then he bowed to her and returned to whatever polishing, dusting, or inspection he\u2019d been performing.</p><p>Elise took a deep breath and opened the heavy door. Bracing herself to look up, she\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d</p><p>Axwelle was still in the clothes that he\u2019d worn to the interview, the turtleneck and simple black slacks just as appealing on him. Hair was still thick and black and cropped. Face remained as rugged and compelling as it had been.</p><p>But he was bleeding.</p> <p>Underneath his left eye, or maybe it was off to the side, there was some kind of cut, the skin broken and leaking. There was a bruise coming up, too, the cheekbone beneath the laceration swelling and turning red.</p><p>\u201cYou told me to come,\u201d he said with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYour eye.\u201d She pointed to the injury. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand up and touched his face, but rather than being alarmed, he merely seemed annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYou got a Kleenex?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTissue? Or toilet paper will work just fine. Point me in the direction of your bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d She grabbed his hand before she knew what she was doing. \u201cLet me take care of it.\u201d</p><p>There was some initial resistance as she shut the door and tried to walk off with him, but then he followed. At least until she got to the foot of the curving staircase.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going upstairs,\u201d she said, pulling on his hand. \u201cI have a first aid kit in my room. And I also have my schedule for next semester up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have it on your phone? And come on, we don\u2019t need to make a big deal about this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d</p> <p>Axwelle stopped short, and the glower that hit his face made his eyes glow. \u201cOf what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. Because I can\u2019t figure out why you don\u2019t want to go upstairs.\u201d</p><p>With a curse under his breath, he took the steps two at a time, and Elise found herself smiling a little as she jogged behind him.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened to your face?\u201d she asked his huge shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFYI, if you\u2019re going to lie to try to get me off the scent, at least make it believable. We\u2019re not heading for a Band-Aid because \u2018nothing\u2019 happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business, how \u2019bout that. And Christ, I\u2019m getting really tired of telling you people that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig house,\u201d he commented as they came to the second floor and he looked at the hall that went off in both directions. \u201cHow many rooms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d She put her hands on her hips. \u201cThat\u2019s your next best?\u201d</p><p>His stare locked on hers, and as he leaned in, his incredible size and power registered\u2014but not in a threatening way.</p><p>More in a way that made her eyes flick down to his mouth for a split second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about it to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to play nurse, that\u2019s fine. But just because you\u2019re insisting on mopping me up, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re due some kind of explanation. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>Elise looked at him for a long moment. They were dangerously close to getting off on a seriously wrong foot. And if she lost him? If he decided to walk out on her?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to give her father an excuse to rethink his decision.</p><p>Answer the damn house question, she told herself. Get on neutral ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how many rooms we have.\u201d She cursed under her breath as she went to the left. \u201cMaybe forty? Fifty? Something like that. My father built it in nineteen ten.\u201d</p><p>She was very aware of him behind her, sensing that body of his. His presence. His aura.</p><p>In fact, she found herself walking differently, her hips moving from side to side more, her shoulders shifting. She had no idea how she knew this ... but she was sure he was measuring the shape of her ass, her thighs. Then again, it was exactly what she did\u2014what she was doing\u2014to him.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my room.\u201d</p><p>Opening the way in, she resisted the urge to Vanna White the exotic objects in the room, like the bed!, the vanity!, this beautiful desk!, the wallpaper!</p><p>What was it about physical attraction that turned even the smartest people into babbling idiots?</p><p>\u201cMy bath is in here.\u201d She indicated the way through the open double doors. Like he might have no frickin\u2019 clue what the marble space was. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the mirror over the double sinks gave her a wide-angle view of him as he stopped in between the doorjambs and proceeded no farther.</p><p>\u201cJust give me something to wipe the blood off.\u201d His eyes moved over the claw-foot tub, the glassed-in shower in the corner, the banks of windows that were dark. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His huge mass and all the black clothes were completely out of place among the pale marble and the crystal and gold accents\u2014and a shiver of thrill went through her. He was standing in a place she was naked in on a regular basis.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure why this occurred to her or even seemed so erotic. But it did.</p><p>Elise pulled a monogrammed hand towel off a gold bar and cranked on the gold faucet. Putting her fingers under the rush, she waited for the water to\u2014</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be warm,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>It seemed silly to argue with him. So she just stood there until the temperature was right, and then wet the terry cloth.</p><p>\u201cJust give it to me,\u201d he demanded as he held out his hand.</p><p>Squeezing the excess free, she went over and put the towel into his palm. \u201cBe careful\u2014whoa! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was obvious. He was trying to scrub off that whole side of his face.</p><p>She grabbed his forearm, and as he recoiled, like she\u2019d surprised him, she took advantage of the reaction and snatched the towel back. Yanking him farther into the bathroom, she pushed him down onto the bench by the tub. Stepping in close, she batted his hands out of the way and went to work properly.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d this happen?\u201d She dabbed with care. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look dirty. Who hit you and is he still alive?\u201d</p><p>Axwelle\u2019s response? A jaw that ground his lower molars into his top ones\u2014like he was having a conversation with someone in his head. Her? Or the person he\u2019d fought with?</p><p>Probably her.</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me, you know.\u201d Elise went over to the sink again and rinsed out the towel. Came back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge.\u201d</p><p>Leaning in still closer, she focused on the laceration. \u201cI think this is going to need stitches. It\u2019s deep and wide? Can you see out of this eye?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Just more of that tightly locked and ever-rotating lower jaw.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Mr. Chatty, let me see what I can cover this with. And then you need to go see Havers. You\u2019re obviously healthy, so you\u2019re going to heal, but this might get infected before it closes itself.\u201d</p><p>Elise patted the area dry with the other end of the towel and went to her cabinets, bending over the center drawers as she pulled them open one by one. The first aid kit was in the last one by the floor.</p><p>Rifling through the Band-Aids and gauze patches, she took one of the big squares out. \u201cThis\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>She shucked the wrapper into the wastepaper basket and headed over to her silent, morose patient.</p><p>\u201cSo, yes, thank you for asking,\u201d she murmured as she got in close again. \u201cI love going to school. I\u2019m really good at it, but just as important, it\u2019s where I get to be myself. No assumptions or restrictions because of where I come from. Nothing but my own actions and words defining who I am. It\u2019s freedom to me.\u201d</p><p>She peeled the backing off the two adhesive ends, pinched the gaping hole in his flesh, and covered the laceration, making sure that the bandage squeezed the wound tight. Crushing the little tabs in her fist, she stepped back. Axwelle was staring straight ahead, as if he hadn\u2019t been able to stand her getting near him.</p><p>Cursing under her breath again, she felt like her chance to keep going to that human university was disappearing in front of her very eyes.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said with exhaustion. \u201cI know you and I are doing the oil-and-water routine here, but I really need this to work. I need to finish my doctorate. It\u2019s years of my life. I mean ... if you don\u2019t want the job, just back out now and let me try to find someone else, okay? Hello? Are you listening to me even in the slightest?\u201d She threw up her hands. \u201cThis is ridiculous. Why did you come here at all?\u201d</p> <p>Maybe she had gotten him wrong. She could have sworn he\u2019d been staring at her because he found her attractive. Maybe it was the other way around\u2014</p><p>Abruptly, his hands gripped his knees and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cAre you stroking out or something?\u201d she demanded. \u201cBecause my medical expertise stops at Band-Aids.\u201d</p><p>When he just stayed where he was, she put her hands on her hips for the third time in his presence. \u201cWill you just tell me what the hell is going on here? Do you need an ambulance? Did they hit you so hard you have a concussion? Whatever it is, you better tell me right now or I\u2019m going to drag you out of this house and leave you to die on my front lawn.\u201d</p><p>His upper lip curled up off his fangs and he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou really are a coward,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBig tough guy like you, but you can\u2019t talk about anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward?\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou think I\u2019m a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do. What\u2019s the other explanation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward, huh. Fine. How\u2019s this for a problem.\u201d</p><p>With that, he rose to his full height, mirrored her pose with his hands on his hips\u2014and just stood there, like that said it all.</p><p>Elise shrugged with a frown. \u201cYes? And? You want to remind me that you\u2019re six-six? Six-seven? Dressed in black? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>Annnnnnnd that was when she saw it.</p><p>It was a very big it. A very ... erect it, straining the front of his pants.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>How\u2019s that for communication, Axe wanted to say.</p><p>Instead, he simply let the female get a good hard gander at his little coward, which was neither little at all nor cowardly in the slightest. In fact, his cock was really damn bold, completely unapologetic, and seemed to be twice the size it usually was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Axe hadn\u2019t been a grower to begin with.</p><p>But fuck him, this was not the way he\u2019d wanted to start out with her\u2014and yeah, you could rewind that empty wish right back to him showing up at her father\u2019s mansion bleeding down his face. The problem was\u2014well, one of his problems was\u2014that he\u2019d been so fucking riffed at Peyton\u2019s criminal sense of entitlement, he hadn\u2019t even thought about any injury\u2014and then this female had taken him up here, where everything smelled like her, and sat him down, and stepped into his personal space and ...</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d gotten hard.</p><p>The entire time she\u2019d been doing her first aid thing, he\u2019d been hoping, praying, to will himself back to flaccidity. No luck. It was like yelling at a pig. You looked like an idiot and the pig didn\u2019t give a shit.</p> <p>So here they were, standing in a bathroom that was like something out of The Devil Wears Prada\u2014 if Miranda Priestly had had a Jacuzzi scene\u2014with him ridiculously aroused and Elise standing in front of him as if she couldn\u2019t decide whether to cover her eyes and run ...</p><p>Or find out what he felt like.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d he muttered as he turned around, rearranged himself, and stalked out into her bedroom.</p><p>Great, all he could stare at was her bed ... and imagine what she would look like naked on it.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t go\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He pivoted on her expensive carpet. \u201cYou need someone else.\u201d</p><p>She kicked up her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t want someone else. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Axe closed his eyes and tried not to read all kinds of bump and grind into that.</p><p>\u201cDid you lose your mate?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head to clear it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mate. Has it been ... a while for you? Or something? And yes, I know that that\u2019s a personal question, but come on,\u201d she muttered dryly, \u201cit\u2019s not like we aren\u2019t already there.\u201d</p> <p>For a second, he thought she had to be fishing for compliments ... but her face was open, her eyes guileless, her affect as honest as a sunrise.</p><p>She literally had no idea why she affected him as she did.</p><p>Without meaning to, he focused on her lips\u2014which had been the original problem for him: While she had been nursing him, doing so much better a job than he had with the cleaning and Band-Aid action, he had made eye-to-mouth contact and been instantly lost in wondering what she would taste like, feel like, be like. And not just with kissing\u2014with everything.</p><p>As in naked bodies and desperate, hungry sex on repeat until they both passed out.</p><p>\u201cThe raids cost a lot of people their family,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt was a hard time for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one needs to tell me that.\u201d</p><p>She went quiet as if she were waiting for him to continue. When he didn\u2019t, she shook her head. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry for whatever losses you had. I know ... what that feels like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy cousin was murdered last month. It\u2019s ... been horrible. Especially as her brother had already been killed in the raids.\u201d</p><p>From out of nowhere, and for no good reason he could think of, a fleeting pain lit off in his chest. \u201cDeath is always horrible. Unless it is your enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know ... much about the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>After all, his head was now completely fucked, a debate raging between his rational side, which felt strongly that having sex with her on the job while at the same time confusing her with the ice-cold aristocrats who had killed his father would be totally unfair ... and his bat-shit crazies, which were maintaining that sleeping with her while being paid for keeping her safe and tarring her with the same brush as those other glymera assholes was utterly logical.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly are you afraid of?\u201d she murmured. \u201cI find myself asking that again.\u201d</p><p>He leveled a glare at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s just what I\u2019m wondering. I mean, there\u2019s nothing to be lost by sharing information and opinions and concerns as a means to a productive end\u2014namely, you and I making it possible for me to go to school. You can ask me anything and I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m not afraid\u2014and I guess I\u2019m trying to reconcile this tough-guy, protective-exterior thing with how incredibly cowardly it is not to express yourself to someone else.\u201d</p><p>Axe blinked.</p><p>Are you kidding me, he thought. Twice in one night?</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise put her arms wide. \u201cAnything. I\u2019m an open book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about rich people that makes you believe you have a right to anything and everything? Not just material shit, but people\u2019s lives, emotions, thoughts. You tell me it\u2019s no big deal to talk about things? That I\u2019m a fucking coward if I don\u2019t reveal stuff about myself on demand?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any conception of my life or what I\u2019ve been through, but unless I choose to give you that access, on your terms, on your timeline, suddenly I\u2019m the one with the defect. You\u2019re a stranger to me. I don\u2019t know you. And I don\u2019t have to get to know you. I don\u2019t owe you any part of me.\u201d</p><p>That shut her up.</p><p>And just as he was congratulating himself for putting her in her place, she pulled the rug out from under him. Again.</p><p>\u201cGod ... you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p><p>She walked across to her vanity, her graceful hand drifting over the silver brushes and the few compacts and lipsticks that were on it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d She looked over her shoulder at him and laughed awkwardly. \u201cAnd to think I\u2019m going for my doctorate in psychology. I should know more about interpersonal relating, right? Guess theory and practicality don\u2019t always go hand in hand. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>Annnnnnnnnd Axe blinked again.</p><p>Fuck. He hadn\u2019t expected her to get his boundary. Much less respect it.</p><p>At a loss, he sat down at the foot of her bed.</p> <p>Running his hand through his hair, he put his elbows on his knees and thought, Yeah, he really needed to get out of here and away from her.</p><p>But instead of leaving, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who\u2019s gotten their doctorate before.\u201d</p><p>All things considered, Elise thought, Axwelle had been right to call her on her shit: The thing that she had forgotten\u2014and this was especially true when it came to new people\u2014was that you had to meet folks where they were. Arousal aside, he\u2019d never given her any indication that he was an open book, and she had pushed him too far because she had ascribed her own characteristics to him.</p><p>But she was encouraged that he hadn\u2019t bolted out her door.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, clearing her throat. \u201cMy studies have been years and years of work. That\u2019s why\u2014well, that\u2019s why I got ahead of myself just now. It\u2019s been a huge investment of time and effort, and if I don\u2019t complete my dissertation, I feel like it\u2019s all been for nothing? And my father can be so hard for me to deal with. The fact that he\u2019s given me this opportunity is a miracle, and I guess ... I just don\u2019t want to lose my shot.\u201d</p> <p>As she fell silent, he cracked his knuckles one by one. \u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing defensive? Why wouldn\u2019t you have been. I put you on the spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Being attracted to you.\u201d</p><p>Elise tried to look calm as her heart skipped in her chest. But Lord help her, she nearly let out a giggle.</p><p>Straightening her spine, she decided to man up. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I can\u2019t help being attracted to you.\u201d As his head whipped up, she rolled her eyes. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s pretty damn obvious.\u201d</p><p>Axwelle cleared his throat. \u201cSo you\u2019re the psych pro. Don\u2019t you think that means we shouldn\u2019t work together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least we know what the issue will be instead of having to discover it.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cOkay, that was a joke. You\u2019re supposed to laugh.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t even chuckle, she\u2014</p><p>The snort he let out was probably one of the most unattractive sounds she\u2019d ever heard in her life, part wounded gopher, part grizzly bear, part old car backfiring. And then he cursed and slapped a palm over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she blurted, \u201cthat is frickin\u2019 adorable.\u201d</p><p>Across the way, on her girlie bed, with its pretty coral bedspread and the framing drapes of fabric that hung from a medallion on the ceiling, the fighter in his black clothes and bandaged face and his kill-ya-soon-as-look-at-ya affect turned the color of a stop sign.</p><p>\u201cI burped. That\u2019s all.\u201d He stretched his back and rolled his shoulder as if he wanted to remind himself he was packed with muscle. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve never done this bodyguarding thing before, so I don\u2019t know what to expect with any of it. I think the question for you is, are you willing to bet your life on me? \u2019Cuz that\u2019s what it all comes down to. We could go a hundred nights without anything happening, but it just takes one where something does. And then you\u2019re not screwed\u2014either in a sexual or a bad luck sense\u2014you\u2019re fucking dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you doubt yourself?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou want the honest truth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways.\u201d She held up her forefinger. \u201cI want to go on record right now and say this loud and clear. I always want the truth from you. That\u2019s more important to me than anything else\u2014for reasons that you\u2019ll no doubt come to understand.\u201d</p><p>He cracked those knuckles again. Rolled his other shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think my attraction works for us\u2014I mean, you. It increases my protective nature and will make me more lethal. I\u2019m not bonded to you, and I won\u2019t ever be, but I am male, and in fact, I\u2019m so much more raw than the overbred pansies you\u2019re used to dealing with. So, yeah, anyone tries to so much as brush the ends of your hair with their elbow, and I will kill them four times over before I light their corpse on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that something to put on a Valentine\u2019s Day card.\u201d Except he probably had a point. \u201cAnd listen, I firmly believe we aren\u2019t what we think, we\u2019re what we do. You and I will keep things professional on a physical level and all will be well.\u201d</p><p>Axwelle got to his feet in a rush. \u201cOkay, text me when you need me tomorrow. I can work until one a.m., but then I have training.\u201d He nodded, in a way that made it seem as if they had shaken hands, and then he went for her door. \u201cI\u2019ll show myself out\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so my schedule\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me know.\u201d</p><p>Boy, he\u2019d had it with the conversating, hadn\u2019t he.</p><p>\u201cWe can do this, you know,\u201d she told his strong back. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d He opened the door wide. \u201cLet\u2019s hope at the end of it, however long it lasts, you feel the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I need your cell phone?\u201d</p><p>He spoke the digits over his shoulder like an afterthought and then he kept on going through the jambs without seeming to care whether or not she caught them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he did care.</p><p>Underneath all that hard-as-nails exterior, he wasn\u2019t as blas\u00e9 as he wanted her to believe. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have sat down and talked to her at all.</p><p>Heading over to the bank of windows that overlooked the front of the mansion, she pulled back the lacy privacy curtain and waited. A moment later, Axwelle emerged from the grand entrance, marching off down the slate walkway.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCome on ... you know you want to.\u201d</p> <p>In the back of her mind, she was oh-so-aware that self-righteous speeches about professionalism and self-control to the contrary, a part of her really wanted the male to pull a John Cusack on the front lawn.</p><p>Which was nuts.</p><p>And not as in clinically insane.</p><p>More as in a road she shouldn\u2019t go down, given their circumstances.</p><p>The good news? As he continued to stride away from her house, he clearly wasn\u2019t going to\u2014</p> <p>Axwelle stopped about fifteen feet past the third lantern on the walkway ... and he stayed where he was for the longest time. Years, it seemed. Just before she was going to either give up or go down to see if that head injury she\u2019d asked about had finally decided to make an appearance ... he pivoted on one boot and glanced back.</p><p>His chin lifted as if his eyes were traveling up to the second floor.</p><p>With a squeak, Elise jerked back out of sight and let the curtain fall into place once more.</p><p>Her heart thundered behind her sternum and a hot flush made her take off her cashmere sweater like it was a medieval hair shirt.</p><p>As she turned away, she looked over at the sunken impression in the duvet where he\u2019d sat on her bed. From out of nowhere, she wanted to go over and run her hand over the spot.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I doing?\u201d she said into the silence of her bedroom.</p> <p>THIRTEEN</p><p>The funny thing about watching a movie marathon while you couldn\u2019t see anything was how much you could in fact picture.</p><p>Of course, in Rhage\u2019s case, he had essentially memorized Die Hard from the moment John McClane got the advice about taking off his shoes on the plane, all the way until his wife hit that obnoxious newsman right in the piehole.</p><p>\u201cHow you doing, Bit?\u201d he said.</p><p>Hours before, he and Bitty and Mary had taken up res in the reclining leather ass palaces of the mansion\u2019s movie theater for two reasons: one, Bitty was more comfortable sitting up with her legs extending out; and two, the never-ending parade of cinematic distraction, which he\u2019d curated from his repertoire of greatness, had been exactly what they\u2019d all needed to cleanse their mental and emotional palates. They\u2019d seen Deadpool first, of course.</p><p>One had to keep current, dontcha know.</p><p>And then it had been The Devil Wears Prada, out of deference to Mary, who, in spite of her preference for valid Palme d\u2019Or stuff, loved Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly. After that, they\u2019d gone back to the ass-kicking with Guardians of the Galaxy\u2014Bit loved Zoe Saldana in that one\u2014and finally, Central Intelligence.</p><p>The Rock was probably one of the few humans who you\u2019d want at your side in a fight.</p> <p>Rhage had had to end with an oldie but goodie, though. Plus it had been at least three weeks since he\u2019d seen Hans Gruber fall off Nakatomi Plaza, and it was Christmas.</p><p>#seasonallyappropriate</p><p>\u201cBit? You okay?\u201d When there was still no answer, Rhage turned his head in the other direction. \u201cIs she out?\u201d he asked Mary.</p><p>When there was no reply on that side either, he smiled and felt around. He found Mary\u2019s hand first, and as he took it, his mate snuffled and curled in his direction, one of her legs crossing over his, her sigh as she fell back into deep sleep one of total contentment. Then he located Bit\u2019s much smaller version of same, and just as with Mary, the little girl turned to him, her head coming to rest against his bicep, her hair falling forward to tickle his forearm.</p><p>Rhage smiled and resumed not watching the movie.</p><p>Even though he couldn\u2019t see anything, he felt strong as an ox, big as a mountain, deadly as a cobra\u2014you name the he-man metaphor and he was rocking that shit.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t chauvinistic to want to protect your females. It was appropriate, and not because they couldn\u2019t be smart and protect themselves. Females were simply more important than males and always would be, and in the very deepest part of his marrow, he was proud to be in service as a mate and a father to them.</p><p>God, he felt so totally whole, his shellan and his daughter bookending him, giving him all his strength and purpose, stabilizing him even though he hadn\u2019t been aware of feeling wobbly.</p><p>Funny, the experience was a little like falling in love: a revelation that made everything more beautiful, more precious.</p><p>Right on cue, as if fate were determined to give him A Moment, his sight slowly returned, the flickering of the screen, the contours of the seats and the dark theater ... his beautiful females ... coming into a soft focus.</p><p>Like his view of life had taken on a Merchant Ivory filter.</p><p>And to think, without his Mary, he wouldn\u2019t even know what that was.</p><p>Dearest Virgin Scribe, though, it pained him to see those casts, the reminder of Bit\u2019s suffering and his spectacular flame-out taking him back to a place he didn\u2019t want to be. But he did smile. Bitty had insisted the leg casts be blue and the arm casts silver, for his bloodline\u2019s colors. And everyone in the house had written on them with a black Sharpie, the signatures and messages blurring together, the King\u2019s overlapped by a doggen\u2019s, brother sharing space with Nalla\u2019s scribble, even Boo and George adding a paw print thanks to an ink pad that had been brought up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bit was fine now, he told himself. Safe here with him and Mary and the other members of the household.</p><p>It was all going to be\u2014</p><p>Just as Argyle was getting down in the back of the eighties-era limo, head nodding next to the teddy bear, Rhage saw that he and his family weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>Lassiter was over on the left, leaning back against the fabric-covered wall, the light from the film moving over his face like flame from a fire.</p> <p>His blond-and-black hair was down around his shoulders, the simple muscle shirt and track pants the kind of thing that a normal person would wear\u2014which meant they should have been completely outside of the fallen angel\u2019s wardrobe hangers.</p><p>Even from across the way, and in spite of both the dimness and Rhage\u2019s iffy eyesight, it was very obvious Lassiter\u2019s expression was grim.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t even looking at the movie.</p><p>And that made Rhage wish for the inconceivable.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re here because there\u2019s a Beaches joke you want to share,\u201d Rhage said roughly. \u201cOr maybe \u2019cuz you got a Little Mermaid sleeping bag for me?\u201d</p> <p>Lassiter stayed silent for what felt like a year, but was probably little more than a heartbeat or two.</p><p>Which, considering Rhage\u2019s ticker was on a broken field run in his chest, was a helluva commentary on the whole time-is-relative thing.</p><p>\u201cI want you to remember what I told you,\u201d the angel said ... in a voice that made Walter Cronkite sound like a falsetto with his nuts in a vise. \u201cKeep your faith. It\u2019s all going to work out.\u201d</p><p>Rhage\u2019s eyes snapped back to the casts. \u201cHavers told us the reset bones would heal in about six weeks. And after that ... I mean, the transition is scary for everybody, but her growth spurt should be tolerated. Even if there has to be some physical therapy afterward, or an operation, at that point, she has different anesthesia and painkiller options and\u2014\u201d</p><p>When he glanced back, the angel was gone.</p><p>Frowning, Rhage twisted himself around.</p> <p>Lassiter wasn\u2019t walking to the exit; it was as if he\u2019d never been in the theater.</p><p>\u201cRhage? You okay?\u201d</p><p>As Mary spoke up in a groggy voice, he cranked back so he was facing the movie. Opening his mouth, he\u2014</p><p>Shut it again. Shook his head. Tried once more. \u201cAh, yeah. I\u2019m fine. Hey ... ah, did you see Lassiter just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo? There\u2019s no one in here but us?\u201d</p><p>Rhage blinked and pulled an optical sweep of the dark space. Was he even seeing this? Or had he imagined everything....</p><p>Was he still blind, and was he dreaming?</p><p>\u201cAh ... okay. Yeah. Sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want me to get you something to eat?\u201d His Mary Madonna leaned up his chest to smooth his hair back. \u201cYou don\u2019t look well. Should I get Doc Jane?\u201d</p><p>All Rhage could do was stare at her beautiful face. In the history of the world, there might have been females who other people thought were extraordinary beauties, whose bone structure and curve of the lip, whose eyes and brows, equated in the minds of third parties to earth-shattering attractiveness.</p><p>Nefertiti had nothing on his shellan as far as he was concerned.</p><p>To him, Mary was the gold standard that made all others base metals.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting Doc Jane right now\u2014\u201d</p><p>As she went to get off the recliner, he caught her hand and gently tugged her back to him. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Just been a long night and day. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>The distraction worked as she looked at her watch\u2014which was his yellow gold Rolex President and about the size of a car on her slender wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s seven o\u2019clock. Are you sure you don\u2019t need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything I need is right here.\u201d He moved in and kissed her lips. \u201cAnd good, that means in another twelve hours, I should be ready for First Meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening right now. That would be seven at night. So, really, how about food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m tight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhage, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He resettled into the recliner. \u201cNothing. Just a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Yup. It had to be a dream.</p><p>Lassiter without neon zebra stripes and an Olivia Newton-John \u201cLet\u2019s Get Physical\u201d headband in silver and hot pink?</p><p>Figment of his imagination. Abso.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Mary asked softly.</p><p>As he nodded, he was relieved when she eased back with him and put her head on his shoulder once again. Across his pecs, she looked at Bit, checking on the little girl and brushing a lock of that deep brown hair back.</p><p>\u201cSo brave,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe bravest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that was awful last night at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean before or after they broke our daughter\u2019s arms and legs again. Or ... wait, when I put a sunroof in something that was underground?\u201d He scrubbed his face, and then took her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we got through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I.\u201d But then she smiled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes a family, though. We persevere. We come out the other side of whatever it is stronger. The laughter and the fun, the good times, are wonderful and part of life\u2019s great joys. But the hard stuff ... the challenges you just squeak by, the reentry into normal life that shakes your capsule and steals your oxygen and makes you think it\u2019s all going to be over in a flaming wreck? That\u2019s how you get the ties that bind.\u201d</p><p>Rhage thought about his brothers. His King. The other people in this house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then of his Mary and Bit.</p><p>Blinking quick, he kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou always know just what to say.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her cheek against him and pressed her lips to his sternum. Then she looked at the big-as-a-drive-in screen in front of them. \u201cSo ... is Die Hard your favorite movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think so.\u201d He squeezed her hand. \u201cEither this or The Godfather. Shoot ... I really like The Wrath of Khan. And then there\u2019s Ryan Reynolds setting the new standard. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like ice cream flavors\u2014too many to choose from and depends on my mood, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmm-hmm.

He was in the clothes he\u2019d been wearing when he\u2019d gone up there, and he was sitting where he\u2019d actually parked it at the end of her bed. The double doors into that bath of hers were wide open, and everything was as it had been in terms of furniture and decor\u2014but it was all so hazy, like there was a smoke machine in the corner coughing out wafts of white fog.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see Elise, but he could hear her voice. She was talking to him from her bath, her voice coming and going out of earshot as if somebody was adjusting the volume on the world and had a bad hand tremor.</p><p>He was aware of being seriously aroused.</p><p>Really. Fucking. Hard.</p><p>And that was before she came into the jambs of the arched doorway.</p> <p>Elise was incredibly, spectacularly naked, not one stitch of clothing keeping his eyes from her skin\u2014and yet the specifics of her body were lost to him, that haze airbrushing out her breasts, the plane of her stomach, her clefted sex.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me?\u201d she said in a distorted voice.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes, fuck yes ... I ache....\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me.\u201d</p><p>Spreading his knees wide, he put his hand on his sex and squeezed. \u201cSo bad ... I\u2019m dying....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you ...,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>Elise came to him like a summer breeze, walking across the fancy rug with a graceful stride that had him moaning in the back of his throat. And then she was in front of him, and he was reaching out to touch her, to caress her warm, vital skin. As he pulled her in between his legs, her scent filled his nose and his cock roared, his fangs descending in his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cElise ...\u201d</p><p>Looking up at her, he moved his hands to her upper arms, urging her to kiss him. But the more he tried to get her to lean down and let him take her lips, the more she slipped from his grasp, her body becoming ether as she disappeared before his very eyes\u2014</p><p>The alarm went off next to his head like a gunshot, the shrill electronic beeping goosing him in the ass as he jumped up and panted.</p><p>The fire was long dead, not even embers remaining, and the cottage\u2019s living room was cold as the inside of a refrigerator. He\u2019d crashed in the clothes he\u2019d been wearing after he\u2019d left Elise\u2019s, only a leather jacket pulled over his torso holding any of his body heat in.</p><p>His joints were stiff.</p><p>And what do you know, they weren\u2019t the only thing.</p><p>Rearranging himself, because it was either hands down the pants or he was walking like Quasimodo, he went up to the bathroom on the second floor and cranked on the hot water. Backing out, and shutting the door so that shit would warm up in there, he got a change of clothes, remembering everything from the socks to the combat boots\u2014and then only started to strip when he was locked in with the humidity.</p><p>The first thing you learned about living in upstate New York during the winter with no heat was that you made sure you had what you needed before you got yourself wet. A dripping trip back to your room for a forgotten whatever was like cozying up to an electrical fence.</p><p>As shower stalls went, the one he stepped into naked was approximately the size of a salt shaker, its narrow plastic walls\u2014which were about as structurally reliable as a Barbie playhouse\u2019s\u2014offering shocks of cold if you didn\u2019t watch where you stood. The water was bliss, though, and he lifted his face to the roasty-toasty rush, letting it fall down his shoulders and his chest, his back and his ass.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long to find the soap.</p><p>And where he went with it wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>But his erection was killing him and it was getting worse instead of better as the caressing sensation of the spray got magnified and modified in his head, his faulty gray matter translating it into Elise\u2019s hands, lips, tongue.</p><p>He was thick and heavy in his own palm, hard and unyielding as he gripped himself, and on the first stroke, he saw Elise\u2019s face clear as day in his mind. And yeah, he told himself he should feel guilty for this, and he did. There was something nasty about jerking off to her when they had both drawn the line the night before.</p><p>His need for an orgasm was so strong, though, it wasn\u2019t going to be denied.</p><p>Leaning to the side, Axe got a pump going and had to put his head into his bicep, his fangs scoring his own flesh as he went faster and faster. Heat roared through him along with more images of that female from the cigar bar and even her father\u2019s study.</p><p>Which was so wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But good luck trying to stop a speeding train with nothing except hand motions.</p><p>Hardy-har-har.</p><p>The pleasure was razor sharp, nearly unbearable and impossible to deny at the same time\u2014and the release, when it racked through him, bent his spine back so hard, he hit his head on the rear shower wall.</p><p>He said her name. Loudly.</p> <p>And he couldn\u2019t stop after it was through.</p><p>Before Axe could even recover, the tide was rising again, his hand continuing to work himself out, the sensations surging until his teeth were gritted, and his neck was straining, and his entire body was clenching up....</p><p>Wonder what Axwelle was doing? Elise thought as she stepped out of her shower and wrapped herself in a towel.</p><p>The heated marble floor turned the sparkling-white bath mat into a toasty foot pad, and she took her time drying off, wrapping her hair up, and drawing on her thick terry-cloth robe. Aware of an excitement bubbling under her skin, she put on leggings and a different cashmere sweater that was blue as the ocean; then not only hit the blow-dryer, but also the curling iron.</p><p>She even threw a little eyeliner and mascara on at her vanity.</p> <p>About a half hour later, she was wearing her coat and backpack and heading out of her room, spring-in-her-stepping it down the corridor\u2014</p><p>When she came up to her cousin\u2019s closed door, she hesitated. And wondered whether or not a bodyguard would have helped Allishon. Would being guarded by a soldier have kept her alive?</p><p>The answer to that would be easier if Elise knew what had killed the female.</p><p>There was no time to get into a cognitive lock about all that, though. She hurried down to the first floor and all but tiptoed past the open door to her father\u2019s study in case he decided to recant the whole with-my-blessing thing. But then she remembered. It was Wednesday night. He had his long-standing bridge tournament.</p><p>Just as well.</p><p>Outside, the night was unseasonably warm, the kind of thing that made her think that the humans with their climate-change theories might be onto something.</p> <p>And Axe was right where he\u2019d texted he would be, standing just outside the circle of illumination of the second lantern down the walkway.</p><p>She went toward him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came for me.\u201d</p><p>He coughed a couple of times and shifted his weight in his boots. \u201cYeah. I said I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this. Right to the library. I sent your phone the link to the address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where we\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>It took a little longer than usual for her to dematerialize ... because he had clearly just showered and he\u2019d come with his hair wet, the soap he\u2019d used tinting the night air with something spicy and delicious.</p><p>God, he smelled amazing.</p> <p>With an inner curse, she forced herself to focus and was off, re-forming miles from her house, in the shadows next to the library\u2019s main entrance. Axe traveled right with her, his massive body materializing next to hers a split second later.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going in over here,\u201d she said needlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be staying back, but not out of range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014wait, why are you here?\u201d She waved her hand around. \u201cI mean, what should I tell my professor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have to tell the old guy anything? It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike people aren\u2019t going to notice you?\u201d She laughed a little. \u201cYou\u2019re about as invisible as a semi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you have to explain anything.\u201d</p><p>As she looked up at his intractable face, she respected how unconcerned he was with what others thought.

So what do you need me to help with tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ... um ...\u201d</p><p>Elise made a show of fishing into her backpack for her red pens and notepad. \u201cI think we were close to your being done? If that\u2019s true, maybe we can talk about my concluding chapter? And then I think I\u2019m ready for a final review of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>When Troy continued to stammer, she glanced up to see what was wrong.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He was wide-eyed and pale as he looked up at Axe.</p><p>Who was standing over the human like he was measuring her professor for a death shroud.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p> <p>What the hell kind of professor is this, Axe thought as he loomed over the human waste of space with the hipster clothes, the full head of hair, and the come-hither-you-college-coed eyes.</p><p>Professors were supposed to be old, bushy-browed, tweed-wearing anachronisms, the kind of males where, even on a deserted island with the fate of the race in jeopardy, no female would ever look twice at them, much less consider procreating with them without a loaded gun to the head.</p><p>Oh, and then top off all the totally-not-old-and-elbow-padded with the fact that the miserable bastard had been staring at Elise like she was the single most gorgeous female on the planet?</p><p>Which, fine. Was true.</p><p>But still.</p><p>He needed to kill the bastard right here, right now\u2014</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Elise said quickly. \u201cThis is my, ah, he\u2019s my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBodyguard,\u201d Axe snapped. \u201cI\u2019m here to keep punks away from her.\u201d</p><p>And how\u2019d you like a demonstration, you pencil-necked psychology- spouting whatever-the-fuck. How \u2019bout I break both your thighbones and use the splintered end of one of them to clean my teeth\u2014after I rip your throat out with my canines\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is Axe,\u201d Elise cut in as she shot him a glare. \u201cHe\u2019s just here to make my father feel comfortable. I am well aware there are no real threats against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... ah ...\u201d Mr. Professor pulled at the collar of his shirt. \u201cSo, um, actually, there have been a number of shootings on college campuses in the last couple of years. I, ah, I can see how ... um ... that would be distressing to a father....\u201d</p><p>Distressing?</p><p>This guy actually used the word distressing.</p><p>Yeah, you want distressing, Axe thought, how about I hang you out a third-floor window from your cute little pair of Merrells until you scream like a soprano and your libido falls out of the top of your head\u2014</p> <p>\u201cAxe,\u201d Elise hissed as she jumped out of her chair. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing him by the elbow, she smiled with determination at James Franco\u2013 lite. \u201cWill you excuse us for a moment. We\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Axe was more than happy to follow her, because he had a few things to say, too.</p><p>She frog-marched him back farther into the stacks and shoved him against a line-up of books on the American Revolution.</p><p>With a jab, she shoved her finger in his face. \u201cLose the attitude or you can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he ground out. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s dating a human. If you\u2019d been up front with me in the first place about why you wanted to come here, I would have appreciated it. Especially after your holier-than-thou \u2018honesty is all I want from you\u2019 bullshit. Or, wait, maybe you\u2019re like your cousin Peyton and believe commoners like me are so second class, there actually is no hypocrisy when you lie to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not dating Troy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy. His name is Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? It\u2019s a perfectly nice name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not touching that one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass! And there is nothing going on between us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. I saw the way he looked at you. And this ...\u201d He motioned around her face. \u201cWith the hair and the makeup? It\u2019s all for him, isn\u2019t it. You got yourself dolled up for your little boyfriend, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not! And he\u2019s not my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that honesty, sweetheart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you did not just \u2018sweetheart\u2019 me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call you, \u2018Professor?\u2019 \u2019Cuz that title\u2019s already taken by Troy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were growling! You were standing over him and growling!\u201d</p><p>Okay, that got through to him. And she was not finished. Leaning in so close that she was practically rock-climbing up his chest, she nailed him with that forefinger again.</p><p>\u201cYou were about two inches and one giant testosterone surge away from baring your fangs and killing him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not!\u201d</p><p>They were both screaming at each other\u2014at stage-whisper volume. Which was ridiculous, but at least they were alone back here.</p><p>\u201cShow me,\u201d she spat.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his upper lip like he was a horse and cranked it up over his head. \u201cSee!\u201d More with that damn finger. \u201cYour canines are totally descended\u2014and let me tell you, the last thing in the world I need is for my bodyguard to rip the throat out of the very reason I\u2019m bothering to put up with his sorry ass!

You were quite articulate about it all.\u201d</p><p>As she arched a superior, pure-as-the-driven-snow brow at him, Axe seriously wanted to shoot something. Maybe her. Maybe himself.

We\u2019re just another commodity to be bartered back and forth over\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is absolutely not true!\u201d</p><p>Before he could stop himself, Axe sneered, \u201cOh, really? Well, would you like to know how my father died in the raids? I\u2019d be just goddamned thrilled to tell you, given that you\u2019re all about the fucking talking. My father is dead because the aristocrats he was working for locked all of the staff and the carpenters out of the safe room. So when the slayers came, the riff-raff were all slaughtered, even though there was plenty of room for them. They pounded on the fucking door, begged to be allowed in, but your people let them die. That\u2019s how my only family was killed. And that\u2019s the exact same attitude that makes your fuck-twit of a cousin think he can buy me off and allows you to preach honesty while you\u2019re blowing smoke up my ass about what you\u2019re doing with your professor over there.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, tense silence.</p> <p>And then Elise cleared her throat. \u201cI am sincerely sorry for your loss. That is an unbelievable tragedy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed with a harsh curse. \u201cDid your fancy psych degree give you those two sentences on a card to memorize during your Grief Seminar? Or was it your Placating the Lower Class survey course.\u201d</p><p>Elise crossed her arms over her chest and just stared at him. And the longer she did, the more he felt like turning away from her and leaving.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t really sure why he stayed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to work,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right. And it\u2019s probably the only thing we\u2019re ever going to agree on.\u201d</p><p>As she turned her head away from him, he had to ignore how perfect her profile was. But then she opened her mouth again ... and laid him out flat on the floor.</p><p>Even though she didn\u2019t make any physical contact with him.</p> <p>\u201cThe makeup was for you. Not him. And congratulations, you\u2019re fired. Hope you enjoy wallowing in your misogyny and self-righteous prejudice. Clearly, you get a lot out of both.\u201d</p><p>On that note, she lifted her chin and waltzed off. Like she owned the place. Naturally\u2014</p><p>Wait. What had she just said about the makeup?????</p><p>As Elise marched away from Asswell\u2014Axwelle, she corrected in her head\u2014she couldn\u2019t figure out who she was more pissed off at.</p><p>Which, considering how badly he\u2019d behaved, was really saying something.</p><p>The award for Biggest Douche Bag on the Planet was a toss-up between him and Peyton. Him, because he was so outrageously offensive she really wanted to call on what little self-defense she knew and knee him in the balls\u2014on the theory that the ranting and raving he\u2019d thrown around back there could only be improved upon with the addition of a helium voice. And Peyton, because it was so completely inappropriate for her cousin to try and buy off anyone, much less a fellow trainee doing a job for somebody else.</p><p>Although, really, it wasn\u2019t like it was going to work\u2014</p><p>Axe materialized right in front of her, so much out of thin air that she yelped and jumped back.</p><p>And then she realized what he\u2019d done. In a human place.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d She glanced around to see if anyone had caught the ghosting. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that in here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the books are going to have an opinion?\u201d But he shook his head and cursed. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay. I\u2019m really ... sorry.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes without flinching, and he had the grace to seem seriously sincere. \u201cI\u2019m not good at ...\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to finish. And when he honestly seemed to struggle, she debated just leaving him where he stood. \u2019Cuz he deserved it.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole relating thing. I\u2019m not a social creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.

And as it turned into a serious stretch of quiet, she wasn\u2019t going to help him out. Either he proved, right here and now, that he was more than a hotheaded thug with poor impulse control and the aforementioned self-righteous misogyny, or she was going to find another solution.</p><p>Hell, maybe Peyton would do the job.</p><p>And yes, she was going to have a happy little conversation with him, too.</p><p>Axe\u2019s eyes focused on something over her left shoulder. And when he finally spoke, his voice was flat. \u201cI need this job, okay? I have to find work. So I\u2019d ... appreciate ... a little leeway when it comes to social graces.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed in a tight burst. \u201cA little leeway? You need, like, a football field on that. Maybe more. You are one of the most offensive people I have ever met.\u201d</p><p>He shifted in his boots, something she was beginning to recognize he did when he really wanted to leave but was making himself stay.</p><p>\u201cThis is on you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to help you here. If you\u2019ve got something more to tell me, get on with it. Otherwise, I\u2019m going to get my things and leave.\u201d</p><p>Axe looked around, and then he muttered, \u201cI live alone, okay? And the training program isn\u2019t about making friends, it\u2019s about life-and-death\u2014which doesn\u2019t exactly play to my interpersonal strengths. Unless it\u2019s killing. And yeah, you just saw what that looks like. So I don\u2019t really know how to make conversation. But I am sorry, all right?\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head slowly while meeting his stare. \u201cI can\u2019t have you getting aggressive with Troy. Yes, I\u2019m aware he finds me attractive, but we\u2019ve never been anything but professional with each other.\u201d</p> <p>She judicially edited out the details about their momentary lapse the night before. But she didn\u2019t feel guilty about that even with Axe having thrown the honesty thing back in her face.</p><p>Okay ... maybe she did.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be tantamount to invisible.\u201d She put her palm out. \u201cAnd before you go there, that isn\u2019t because you\u2019re a commoner. That\u2019s what bodyguards do. Or ... well, from what I\u2019ve seen in movies, that\u2019s what they do. I have real work to do here, and I\u2019ve already had to justify my efforts to my father. I owed the explanation to him. I do not owe it to you.\u201d</p><p>Axe nodded. \u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, she took a deep breath, and then indicated the space between them, moving her hand back and forth. \u201cWe\u2019re not walking this stretch again together. Am I clear? We\u2019re done with this. If you can\u2019t be up front without being abusive, and you can\u2019t do this job without being out of control, I\u2019m walking away and not looking back. Again, not because I think I\u2019m better than you on account of my bloodline, but because I don\u2019t deserve to have some male going ape-gorilla and pounding his chest in front of me all the time. I will not have this discussion again.\u201d</p> <p>Axe blinked a couple of times.</p><p>And then the strangest thing happened. Or at least ... she thought it did.</p><p>The right corner of his mouth seemed to lift ever so slightly, and not in a mocking way. More as if she had impressed him and the respect he had for her had been the last thing he\u2019d ever expected to feel around a female aristocrat.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d He stuck his hand out. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry we had to run over the ground rules twice. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Elise released the tension in her shoulders and accepted what he offered, shaking his much larger palm. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>When they dropped the contact, she leaned to the side and looked around his huge shoulder. \u201cShoot. Now, we have to try and smooth this over with Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow that doesn\u2019t inspire confidence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>As Axe headed back to where her professor was still sitting, Elise rolled her eyes and cursed under her breath. And then ran off behind him.</p><p>This was like Groundhog Day, she thought. With Jason-damn-Statham instead of Bill Murray ...</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>As Axe headed back for the professor, it was amazing how much less he wanted to kill the guy. In fact, as he came up to that table with its banks of papers, he didn\u2019t even feel like hurting the human. Mostly.</p><p>The man bun had to go, though\u2014and in fact, Axe did have a nice serrated hunting knife on him that could do the deed. Somehow, though, he doubted that was within the scope of his professional duties.</p><p>Troy shrank back in his seat, but that didn\u2019t last. Axe reached into the man\u2019s brain and erased the short-term memories of the aggression that had been thrown the guy\u2019s way. And then Axe stuck out his hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Axe. I\u2019m Elise\u2019s bodyguard. I don\u2019t want to interrupt you two, so I\u2019ll just camp out\u201d\u2014he glanced around\u2014\u201cover there in that chair. You do your thing, I\u2019ll do mine, and we\u2019ll get along just fine.\u201d</p><p>Provided you keep your hands off of my girl, he tacked on.</p><p>Not that Elise was his.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>The human winced and rubbed his temple like something hurt up there, but he got to his feet and shook Axe\u2019s palm. \u201cPleased to meet you. You can\u2019t be too careful these days\u2014remember that shooting down near Manhattan last month? And then there was another out West in California.\u201d</p><p>Axe nodded. \u201cYou got it. Dangerous times. So I\u2019ll just be over there. You guys get to work.\u201d</p><p>As he walked over to a low-slung chair that had almost as much padding as a piece of toast, he was very aware of Elise looking at him like he\u2019d sprouted a horn in his forehead\u2014and he couldn\u2019t resist arching a brow at her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Parking his ass, he steepled his fingers and watched her.</p><p>\u2019Cuz that\u2019s what bodyguards did, right?</p><p>But he also kept an eye on everything else, too. Without moving his head, he constantly scanned where they were, tracking the movements of the few-and-far-between students who wandered around like zombies, all hollow-eyed and worn out. A skeleton crew of staff were on duty, too, and he ID\u2019d them based on their age demographic and the fact that they didn\u2019t look like they\u2019d been living off of coffee and vending-machine dinners.</p><p>The library was so quiet that even though Troy and Elise spoke softly, he heard their convo just fine. Lot of discussion about passages in the final papers. Debates about certain students\u2019 trajectories at the university. Questions about whether something had been plagiarized or properly cited.</p> <p>Whatever that meant.</p><p>Man, Elise was so smart, he was intimidated. She threw around terms he didn\u2019t recognize the way a pro tennis player covered a Grand Slam volley. And then it came to her desertion ... distillation ... dissertation?\u2014and everything was ratcheted up even higher on the IQ scale.</p><p>Her thesaurus ... theory? ... thesis? ... was about bipolar treatment in adolescents and whether or not kids could appropriately be diagnosed with the mental disorder during puberty. Whatever that was. And how they should be treated, both pharmacologically speaking, and in terms of talk and art therapy.</p><p>Big stuff, and Troy was clearly impressed.</p><p>When Axe checked his watch a little later, he was surprised to find that three hours had passed and the pair of them were starting to pack up. Axe got to his feet and stretched, but kept his distance because he wanted to show her that he wasn\u2019t a wild animal\u2014and it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying, anyway.</p> <p>And yup, he knew Troy was getting ready for some kind of ask because the guy started looking over at Axe, his eyes jumping around like he was a kid about to put his hand in the cookie jar.</p><p>Axe glanced at Elise. The female had looked over in his direction a number of times, and he had to admit, he enjoyed the attention. At the start of the night, it had clearly been because she was wondering whether he was going to fuck off the new-leaf routine and pounce on her little human buddy\u2014but later, he got the impression it was something else entirely.</p><p>Which again, made him warm up even more to good ol\u2019 Troy.</p><p>When there was an awkward pause, Axe smiled at them both. \u201cAnything you want to say to her can be said in front of me. I\u2019ll take it to my grave.\u201d</p><p>Elise had to give Axe credit. He\u2019d not only backed off, he\u2019d functioned with perfect professionalism, staying out of the way, but keeping close enough so that if anyone approached the table or tried to do something, he could respond in an instant.</p><p>It gave her a lot of hope.</p> <p>What was difficult? Hell, nearly impossible?</p><p>The feel of those eyes of his on her. For some reason, his yellow stare made her feel more alive, her skin prickling with sensation even though he wasn\u2019t touching her, the urge to check and see if he was still looking at her a constant, underground buzz in her head.</p><p>\u201cSo ...\u201d Troy glanced back at Axe. \u201cAh ...\u201d</p><p>Of course, Axe telling the man he was free to speak had helped override the awkward sooooooo much.</p><p>Not.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she prompted Troy. \u201cI mean, if this is about Christmas, I told you, I\u2019m totally fine to work. We\u2019ll just have to meet somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d Another glance at Axe\u2014who was standing right there, a little smile on his face like he was enjoying how antsy Troy was. \u201cI think we\u2019re done with the finals, though. And your dissertation is about ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m feeling good about it.\u201d</p> <p>Troy cleared his throat. \u201cAre you prepared to help me with my winter-break seminar, still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You want to plan that out tomorrow? When do the classes start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ...\u201d The human took out his cell phone and fiddled with it. \u201cJanuary third. I have thirty students signed up, almost all non-trad professionals in the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>As she zipped shut her backpack, he blurted, \u201cHow\u2019d you like to have dinner with me tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Elise jerked her head up. Blinked. Tried to process the invitation.</p><p>Which was nuts. She\u2019d been well aware of where things were headed the night before. Funny, though, meeting Axe had changed so much. Too much.</p><p>And she refused to look in the male\u2019s direction.</p><p>Then again, she didn\u2019t need actual eye contact to get a load of the arrogant pleasure on his face: He was assuming she was going to turn Troy down, and he was going to be happy about it.</p><p>You better slow your roll, buddy, she thought with uncharacteristic rancor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, Troy.\u201d She formed a smile with her lips. \u201cThat would be great. But it needs to be after eight? Is that too late?\u201d</p><p>The fact that Axe bug-eyed gave her a gotcha in the center of her chest. Not that she was proud of it.</p><p>God, what was she doing here?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s perfect.\u201d Troy grinned in a way that made his eyes glimmer. \u201cWould you like me to pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ... it\u2019s probably best for me to meet you. Where were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>As they discussed alternatives\u2014seafood was out for her, he liked Thai, she preferred Chinese, how about that Brazilian steakhouse, Ignacio\u2019s, fantastic-it\u2019s-a-date\u2014she kept her peripheral vision on Axe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was not happy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Elise drew on her coat and one-strapped her backpack. \u201cAnd thank you again. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>Troy had a dimple on one side. Who knew, she thought as she pivoted and started walking off.</p> <p>Axe was silent as they left the building. But he didn\u2019t need to say anything for her to know what their next argument was going to be about.</p><p>Out on the lawn, she turned to him and put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou\u2019re not coming with us.\u201d</p><p>That brow of his went up. \u201cTo where? Ohhhhhh, on your date. Yes, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, let me get this straight. You want me to be professional, except when you don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would like some privacy. And we\u2019re not going to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think your father would want you covered on a date with a human? I\u2019m very sure he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Okay, that sounded lame even to her own ears. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cOkay. As you wish.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh, right, he was going to agree with her on this one.</p><p>And as she waited for more to come at her, for the electric sparks to keep flying between them, she prickled with heat, roared with awareness, watched that full lower lip of his in anticipation of it moving again.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back. I have to go to training now, and I need to change into combat clothes.\u201d</p><p>Wait ... what?</p><p>Axe motioned forth. \u201cAfter you, m\u2019lady.\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. And then told herself that it was insane to be disappointed they weren\u2019t going to keep fighting.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something else to say to me?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she muttered as she closed her eyes ... and willed herself back home.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>The following evening, Mary tried to make sure that Bitty was all set in the billiards room. But even after providing the girl with a bowl full of freshly popped and buttered popcorn, a bag of Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies, a ginger ale, a bottle of water, the remote to the huge TV over the fireplace, copies of Cosmo for Girls, the National Enquirer, two weeks of People, and a partridge in a pear tree ... she still felt as though she were leaving Bit in the wilderness alone in a snowstorm.</p> <p>Which was nuts.</p><p>But that was a mom for you.</p><p>Sitting down on the sofa by the twin leg casts, she stroked Bitty\u2019s soft-socked foot. \u201cYou sure you\u2019ll be all right?\u201d</p><p>The smile she got back was easy and happy. \u201cOh, yes, very much so. Bella and Nalla are coming down after Nalla\u2019s bath. And Lassiter promised he would come watch Saved by the Bell with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good soul, that angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also told me he was going to color my hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidding.\u201d Bitty smiled even further. \u201cI couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>Mary clutched the front of her silk blouse. \u201cJeez, you\u2019ll give me a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather came by, too. He said he was going to get off work early and make me a special Last Meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at the Audience House tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he not in the field because of what happened at the clinic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs a little more recovery time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The girl got quiet. \u201cI worry....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Mary switched to the other foot, massaging the little toes in their cushion of fleece. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if something happened to him? I mean, I know the beast protects him, but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s specially trained, honey. His equipment is the best. He doesn\u2019t take any undue risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never lie to you.\u201d Mary frowned. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to stay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other kids need you. I get to be with you during the day.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re so beautiful, Mary thought as she stood up. \u201cYou can always call me.\u201d She took her cell phone out of her purse and waved it back and forth. \u201cThis is always with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Have a good night, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Mary closed her eyes briefly. Boy, that was one word she just couldn\u2019t believe was being applied to her. And right up with shellan, it was her absolute favorite.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon. Call me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Just as she was leaving, Lassiter came into the room, his blond-and-black hair nearly down to his ass, his white robing like something out of Animal House\u2019s toga party.</p><p>Dropping her voice, she said, \u201cTell me you are not coloring that girl\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>The angel assumed an innocent look. \u201cShe likes pink, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLassiter, are you serious? You need to talk to us before you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong with her having pink hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either. The issue I have is what you\u2019re going to have to do to get it that color. Bald is not going to work for me, okay? And if you melt that child\u2019s hair off her scalp, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a deity, Rhage will find a way to kill you. She\u2019s already got casts on her arms and legs, she doesn\u2019t need to lose her hair on top of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot for long,\u201d Lassiter murmured.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe casts.\u201d</p><p>Mary looked back at Bitty. The girl seemed perfectly content, reclining back and reading a magazine.</p> <p>\u201cSix weeks seems like forever,\u201d Mary whispered. \u201cBut you\u2019re right. It isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The angel put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice reached her at her heart and eased the ache there sure as if he had given her a Tylenol for a sprained ankle.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving her side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lassiter,\u201d she said without looking away from her daughter.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Mary glanced back at him. \u201cDid you just quote Harrison Ford to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Leia. And it\u2019s also true. Go on, Mother, she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Mary gave the angel a quick hug and then she left the mansion, going out through the vestibule to the Volvo station wagon she used. As she was getting in, her phone went off and she dumped half her purse out trying to get to the thing in case Bitty needed\u2014</p><p>It was a text from Rhage.</p><p>Can\u2019t wait till coast is clear today. Meet me in tub?</p> <p>Mary laughed. \u201cCoast is clear\u201d was the code phrase they used for making love. And it was funny, ever since Bitty had come into their lives, the sex had gotten even better because it had to be planned, snuck in, kept a secret.</p><p>It\u2019s a date, she texted back. But I\u2019ll fill the Jacuzzi so the level is right.</p><p>Nobody wanted a repeat of the deluge that had happened the last time they\u2019d tried to have sex in a bubble bath. Besides, Lassiter had already purchased all of the Little Mermaid merch in the United States. And where the hell would he get a second stuffed tarpon the size of a Volkswagen?</p><p>Then again, that was a question best left unanswered.</p><p>Mary was still smiling when she pulled up to Safe Place about twenty minutes later. As she headed in through the garage, the feeling that all was right in her world was like having sunshine pouring down over her body, her step light as a breeze, a little tune humming up and out of her throat.</p><p>\u201cHey, everyone,\u201d she said to the group making gingerbread men in kitchen. \u201cOh, this smells amazing in here.\u201d</p><p>She greeted a couple of the kids and their mahmens, glad that the human Christmas tradition she had passed on was being put to good use.</p><p>\u201cNice work,\u201d she murmured to one little guy who was covering his cookie with enough frosting to put a red and green blitz on half of Caldwell.</p> <p>The stairs to the second floor were in the front of the rambling house, and she was still humming as she ascended to the top landing. Her office was not far from Marissa\u2019s, but when she put her head into her boss\u2019s work space, the female wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>It felt really good to prioritize in her mind the work for the night: the reports she wanted to finish up, the meeting with the intake supervisor, and then the community meal right before she would go back home.</p><p>So much easier than dealing with the trauma of what had gone down at Havers\u2019s clinic.</p><p>She was behind her desk, answering email, talking on the phone, about to transition into her report-writing mind-set, when she realized she hadn\u2019t kept up with tradition.</p><p>\u201c... think that is a really healthy solution,\u201d she said to the female on the line. \u201cYour being close to your family is a good thing. You need extra help and support during this transitional period.\u201d</p><p>The survivor she was speaking with had been in the house for about eight months, the victim of an abusive boyfriend who had threatened to kill her when she\u2019d told him she was finally leaving him after twenty-two years. Fortunately, she had had Safe Place to come to and be protected in as she had gradually unpacked all the damage from decades of abuse.</p><p>Now she was out on her own, and as for the boyfriend?</p><p>He was doing better, too.</p><p>Although that wasn\u2019t a result of personal introspection and growth. That was because Butch and Rhage had paid him a visit one evening right before dawn.</p><p>Mary hadn\u2019t asked a lot of questions. Actually, there had been only one: Was the bastard still breathing? When that had been answered in the affirmative, that was all she\u2019d needed to know\u2014and it went without saying that the male wasn\u2019t going to be bothering his ex anymore. Not if he wanted to keep his arms, legs, head, and testicles where they were supposed to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always here for you,\u201d Mary said, meaning every word. \u201cOkay, great. I\u2019ll look forward to it. Bye, now.\u201d</p><p>As she hung up, she opened Facebook on her computer and signed in to the closed group for vampires only. She hadn\u2019t checked the night before, and her buoyant mood meant, for once, she didn\u2019t have a stomach ache as she went through the postings that had absolutely nothing to do with Bitty in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cNailed it,\u201d she said as she went to\u2014</p><p>She had almost signed out when she noticed the red-flagged number 1 by the messenger icon.</p><p>For some stupid reason, she looked around the room. Like maybe the person it was actually intended for might materialize behind her desk or maybe walk through her open door.</p><p>Mary had never gotten a message before on her account. She wasn\u2019t a frequent FB user at all. In fact ... the only post she had ever made had been the one asking if anybody was familiar with Bitty\u2019s family\u2014specifically that uncle the girl had talked about right after her mother had passed. The one who had supposedly been imminently coming for her, in spite of the fact that her mahmen had never mentioned him or given any forwarding address for any family whatsoever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The one whose name Bitty wasn\u2019t even sure of ...

And wow ... you look ... amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Oh, God. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>Troy had left his hair down, the curling lengths just touching the shoulders of his wool peacoat. His pants were cream corduroys and he had his Merrells on. The scarf he had artfully tied around his neck was red.</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t Axe. And that should have been a good thing.</p><p>Holding the door open, he indicated the way in with a gallant hand. \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Inside, the scents were heavenly and thick, and her stomach rumbled in approval and impatience. She hadn\u2019t eaten much since the night before. Too distracted.</p><p>Not with Troy.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>The hostess was a beautiful young human with dark eyes and hair that was out of a Garnier Fructis ad, and after she took one look at Troy, she didn\u2019t bother sparing a glance at Elise. \u201cDo you have a reservation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. For Troy? Somewhere by a window?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight away.\u201d</p><p>Taking two menus, the woman sashayed through the completely empty restaurant. Well, almost completely empty. There was an older human couple on the far side, a group of three way in the back ... and one other couple.</p><p>\u201cWith it being almost Christmas,\u201d the hostess said, \u201cwe\u2019re having a light night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Elise murmured as she sat down and accepted her menu. \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting paid. That\u2019s all I care about. Your server will be right with you.\u201d</p><p>The hostess walked off, glancing over her shoulder to see if Troy was watching her go. He wasn\u2019t. He was smiling at Elise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad we\u2019re finally doing this.\u201d He drew a hand through his hair. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you and I talked about what ... you know, if something comes of it ... I, ah, I think your switching to a different T.A. position makes sense. I wasn\u2019t going to be on your doctoral committee anyway because of my advising you, so that\u2019s also taken care of.\u201d</p><p>He had texted her late in the afternoon and brought up the whole professor/student thing, and Elise had agreed with him on every point\u2014while knowing, the entire time they were going back and forth, that they were never going to be in a relationship.</p><p>There was way too much Axe in her head.</p><p>Not that she was going to end up with him, either.</p><p>\u201cThis is not to pressure you,\u201d Troy rushed in, putting his palms up. \u201cI\u2019m not taking for granted this is going anywhere. I\u2019m just glad I\u2019ve got a shot.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled and opened up the heavy menu, because she wasn\u2019t sure what she should say to that. \u201cOh, look at all these choices.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was basic, granted. But the reality she couldn\u2019t escape was that she\u2019d spent all day thinking about Axe, remembering the way he\u2019d met her eyes, that little half smile he\u2019d sported when she\u2019d called him out, the sound of his voice.</p><p>The way his body had lounged in that chair in the library\u2014</p><p>Stop it.</p><p>She\u2019d already wasted an entire day\u2019s sleep on the guy. She wasn\u2019t going to disrespect Troy by ignoring him in favor of a male who wasn\u2019t even with them. Especially because what she really needed to be doing was figuring out how to let the human down gently.</p><p>What a great first date. Crap.</p><p>And P.S., she was never, ever going to give another person a hard time about opening up and expressing themselves.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to have?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSteak.\u201d As she looked up, Troy laughed. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably ... steak.\u201d</p><p>This time, they both chuckled, and it was amazing how easy it was. Sitting across from Troy, looking into his kind eyes and his handsome face, she wasn\u2019t jumpy or insecure. Wasn\u2019t spoiling for a fight. Wasn\u2019t thinking things that belonged in an erotic novel.</p><p>Being around her bodyguard, on the other hand?</p><p>\u201cElise?\u201d Troy prompted as their waiter came up to the table. \u201cWould you like a glass of wine?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she blurted, even though she didn\u2019t drink. \u201cWhite, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have red.\u201d</p><p>The man in the black and white uniform nodded. \u201cAnd may I suggest for an appetizer the blah-blah-blah ...\u201d</p><p>As whatever he was saying went in one ear and out the other, Elise shifted in the banquette seat and stretched her back. Fidgeted with her skirt. Her left shoe.</p> <p>And then she realized the men were both looking at her as if they expected her to yea or nay something. \u201cWell, yes, that sounds lovely.\u201d</p><p>God only knew what she was going to end up with, but like it mattered? Trying to focus on Troy, she let him start talking, his hands and face growing animated from the story he was telling. But it was as if she couldn\u2019t hear him, even though he was right across the table from her.</p><p>Boy, it was hot in here.</p><p>Pulling at the collar of her blouse, she realized she\u2019d forgotten to take her coat off. That was it. She was having a hot flash because not only did she still have on a couple of yards of wool, they were flame-grilling steaks across the way, and\u2014</p><p>Wait a minute.</p> <p>With a feeling of dread, she leaned out around Troy and looked down to the very far back of the restaurant.</p><p>Right by the emergency exit, at a table for two, a lone figure dressed in black was sitting in the very dimmest part of the place, nothing but a glass of water in front of him.</p><p>Axe\u2019s eyes glowed in the darkness.</p><p>As he lifted that glass in salute to her.</p><p>Son of a bitch\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d Troy said with surprise.</p> <p>Oh, God, had she said that out loud?</p><p>Axe sat back and silently counted down how long it took Elise to make an excuse to use the ladies\u2019 room and head his way with her hair on fire.</p><p>Ten ... nine ... eight ...</p><p>Bingo, he thought to himself as she got up and came steaming in his direction.</p><p>As she arrived at his table of two for one, he was glad in a perverse way that he\u2019d gotten under her skin. He\u2019d hated seeing her walk in with that human, sit down with him, and laugh at whatever joke he was sending her way.</p><p>Especially looking like this, with her hair down and her skirt up above her knees.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>\u201cHaving dinner.\u201d He indicated his knife and fork, and put up the napkin he\u2019d laid in his lap. \u201cGuess what I\u2019m having? Steak. It\u2019s going to be steak.\u201d</p> <p>Hell, he should order the stuff raw just so he could tear it apart with his fangs.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Is there a law of physics I\u2019m not aware of? You know, I learned how to blow up cars this week and also how to make a grenade out of a can of Coke, a toothbrush, four inches of duct tape, and a Little Debbie snack cake. But there was nothing about why I can\u2019t be where I want to be at mealtimes. Do enlighten me, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Need. To. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine, I lied about the grenade. I can assure you, however, that I\u2019m having my dinner here.\u201d He pointed to the table. \u201cRight here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessional? I\u2019m not on the clock. So being here is not outside of the scope of my duties because it is not within them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are insane.\u201d</p><p>Axe cut the shit and just stared up at her. \u201cAnd you are ... seriously beautiful tonight.\u201d</p><p>That stopped her in her tracks. And he took the opportunity to linger on her full lips, and her sweet, creamy throat, and the curve of her breasts ... and those legs that were covered in black tights that did nothing to hide her smooth calves and dainty ankles.</p><p>\u201cYou are so beautiful right now,\u201d he murmured, refocusing on her lips. \u201cAnd I know that tonight it\u2019s all for him. That\u2019s okay. I accept that. But the least that you can do as I sit here and watch you with that man is leave me in peace to enjoy the sight of you. It is all I have.\u201d</p><p>Elise crossed her arms over her chest. Dropped them. Looked around.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cSo you thought of me, too,\u201d he said, well aware that he was seducing her with the tone of voice he was using. \u201cWere you up all day, twisting and turning in those fancy sheets, imagining me on you ... in you.\u201d</p><p>As she gasped, he leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ll pretend all you want. If that\u2019s what it takes for us to work together. I\u2019ll never talk about this ...\u201d He motioned between them. \u201c... thing between us again. I\u2019ll be a good boy who keeps his hands to himself\u2014his fantasies, too. But in this moment, honest is as honest does\u2014and in my head, I\u2019m making love to you. Right on that table over there, right in front of him to prove I can.\u201d</p><p>Axe deliberately raked her body with his eyes, and he left nothing out of his expression: The gnawing hunger, the bottomless pit of need, the rabid, animal lust\u2014he let it all show.</p><p>And God help them both, she was supposed to run.</p><p>She was supposed to give him another highly logical speech, that intellectual equivalent of a \u201cfuck off\u201d of hers that was so much classier than he deserved.</p><p>She was supposed to fire him.</p><p>Then storm off.</p><p>Elise didn\u2019t do any of that.</p><p>Instead ... she bloomed right before him, her body responding in a rush that magnified her natural scent into a bouquet that made him hard as a fucking rock under the table.</p><p>In a low growl, he said, \u201cGo back to him.

And when she looked back at him, he said, \u201cTake your time. I like how much the anticipation hurts.\u201d</p><p>NINETEEN</p> <p>Historically, back in the Old Country, it had been part of the normal functioning of life for the King to hold audiences with his subjects, ruling on everything from property disputes and petitions for sehclusion to noble matings, rythes, and even murders and other crimes.</p><p>However, when Wrath had refused to ascend to the throne for, oh, a couple of centuries, the practice fell by the wayside. All that had changed recently, though, and now the tradition was back in full swing, the audiences being conducted out of the Federal-style mansion Darius had lived in before he\u2019d been blown up in his BMW by the enemy: Every night, Monday through Friday, members of the race came to the great Blind King and sought his advice, counsel, declarations, and blessings.</p><p>And tonight\u2019s docket was full, Rhage thought as he opened the double doors to the dining room yet again and let out a hellren with his shellan and new baby son. The couple were commoners, dressed in clean but unfancy clothes, their miracle wrapped up in a humble swaddling blanket. Ordinarily, Rhage would have nodded and just let them go, but now he really looked at the family, and even rushed forward to open the heavy main door for them.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of them,\u201d he said to the male.</p><p>The guy seemed flustered to be spoken to at all by a brother, and as he stammered, Rhage put a hand on the guy\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, my Lord, yes,\u201d he said with a bow. \u201cI shall lay down my life for them both.\u201d</p><p>Rhage smiled at the female and the young, but he made no move to touch them\u2014certainly not the female, definitely not the baby. That would have broken protocol: Even though he was at the top of the food chain socially and accorded all kinds of honor and respect, it would have been inconceivable in the Old Country for a newborn and its mother to have contact with a male, even in a formal setting, during the first year of life.</p><p>It was funny, ever since they had started up with the audiences again, Rhage and the brothers had fallen into the Old Ways again. It just felt right.</p><p>Especially in this case, now that Rhage knew firsthand what it was like to be a dad.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations again,\u201d he said to the couple as he stood to the side and watched them go off into the cold.</p><p>The female\u2019s father was waiting for them in the driveway in a ten-year-old Honda Accord, and the way the guy jumped out and beamed at the young family, you\u2019d have sworn he was driving a Rolls-Royce.</p> <p>Rhage gave the grandfather a wave, which floored the male and caused him to bow so fast he nearly fell over\u2014and then Hollywood shut the door to keep the winter breeze from sucking all the warmth out of the foyer.</p><p>\u201cLast night\u2019s good weather was just a chimera, huh,\u201d he said to the receptionist.</p><p>Paradise\u2019s second cousin, Beline, looked up from her computer. \u201cI know, right? Don\u2019t tell anyone, but under my desk, I\u2019ve taken my heels off and put fleece socks on.\u201d</p><p>Rhage nodded to the fire, which had gone down a lot since he\u2019d stoked it an hour ago. \u201cYou want me to throw some more wood on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d She smiled and pushed up her glasses. \u201cIt\u2019s just my feet.\u201d</p><p>There were two people in the waiting room, but there was another wave coming in.</p><p>On a lot of levels, he\u2019d rather be in the field, or beating the crap out of the trainees, but he never was at full capacity right after the beast made an appearance, and it was better for him to pull this admin shift now.</p><p>After all, every brother had to put in time here, fulfilling their duty as personal guard to Wrath. Between humans, lessers, and members of the glymera linking up with the Band of Bastards, they didn\u2019t take any chances with the King\u2019s life: There were always a minimum of two members of the Brotherhood on site with Wrath. Tonight, it was he and Vishous, which was always fun.</p> <p>Mostly because the pair of them could do good cop/bad cop. Or rather, V could sit there with his icy eyes and his hands rolled, making the civilians shit themselves in their pants, and Rhage could be a yo-ho-ho, Steve Harvey\u2013 on\u2013 Family Feud grin-and-greeter.</p><p>Striding back to what had been the dining room, Rhage stood in between the carved jambs and waited as Saxton reviewed a couple of documents with Wrath down at the far end by the flap door into the kitchen. Saxton was frickin\u2019 amazing, keeping all the paperwork and documentation straight as well as making sure that the Old Laws were consulted when appropriate.</p><p>The set-up for the private meetings was simple and very non-thronal: just two armchairs facing each other in front of the fire, one for the King and one for his subjects\u2014although there were other seats off to the side to be pulled in as needed. Whichever brothers were on stayed at a discreet distance, with Saxton at a desk that was halfway in between. There was a rolling cart of coffee, tea, and sodas, along with cookies and other kinds of snacks\u2014</p><p>A blast of cold air whipped into the foyer behind him, and Rhage turned with a smile at whoever ... it ...</p><p>... was ...</p><p>Rhage\u2019s heart didn\u2019t so much stop ... as die in his chest.</p><p>The male who had come in was young and healthy, heavily muscled, but not obviously weaponed, as if he were a manual laborer of some kind as opposed to a fighter. His clothes were so well washed that his jeans fell from his hips like drapes, and his jacket was way too light for December. Construction boots were well worn. No jewelry. Nothing in his hands. No strange scents on him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All of that was incidental to what had driven a stake right through Rhage\u2019s sternum.</p><p>The face ... was Bitty\u2019s.</p><p>The male\u2019s face had the same nose and cheeks, the same jaw and mouth, the features simply passed through a filter of masculinity and age. And then there was the hair\u2014his hair was the exact shade of brown and the precise thickness even though it was shorter.</p><p>The eyes were a carbon copy, too.</p> <p>The male didn\u2019t look Rhage\u2019s way, but instead, went to the reception desk, one hand lifting up to his temples as if he usually wore a hat and was reflexively trying to take it off.</p><p>Fast footsteps approached from behind Rhage, but he didn\u2019t pay them any mind, at least not until V appeared with a gun out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck\u2019s wrong?\u201d the brother demanded.</p><p>Rhage tried to answer. Well, he guessed he did. Something was coming out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d V demanded, looking all around and seeing nothing wrong. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p> <p>It was at that moment that the male, who was clearly a relative of Bitty\u2019s, glanced up from the reception desk, as if he had heard Vishous\u2019s voice. And the second V saw what he was doing, the brother cursed long and low.</p><p>Rhage\u2019s phone began to ring, but he didn\u2019t even think of answering it.</p><p>In slow motion, he took step after step toward the male.</p><p>Whoever the guy was, he had refocused on the receptionist and was speaking in a quiet voice with a commoner\u2019s accent\u2014but then he stopped and turned as Rhage halted in front of him.</p><p>Rhage said nothing as he stared into those eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the male said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an appointment. I wasn\u2019t sure where to go. I can leave. I\u2019ll just leave\u2014I gave her my number. I\u2019m not looking for any trouble.\u201d</p> <p>The male lifted his fists up as if he were ready to defend himself, even against a brother\u2014but it was clear he would prefer not to have to: His stare was level without being aggressive, his affect calm and watchful as his stance widened, and he settled his weight.</p><p>It was the classic preparation of someone used to fighting, who was also not an instigator.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Rhage asked, grimly aware that people were coming around them. V, Saxton ... even Wrath himself.</p><p>Don\u2019t say it, Rhage prayed. Don\u2019t say it, dontsayit\u2014</p><p>\u201cRuhn. My name is Ruhn. My sister died about two months ago. I\u2019m here for my niece, Lizabitte.\u201d</p><p>Mary put her phone down again and lifted her hands to her face. As she stared at the computer screen, reading and rereading the short PM, she was screaming in her head even as she remained silent.</p><p>\u201cRhage ...,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh, God ...\u201d</p><p>Back with the phone. Calling him again. Voice mail for the fourth time.</p> <p>He had to be in with the King, but God! why now\u2014</p><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cBreathe and relax.\u201d</p><p>This could be anything. Someone who was playing a practical joke\u2014who just happened to have the name that Bitty had used. Somebody who had heard Mary was mated to a Brother and wanted to take advantage of that by posing as Bitty\u2019s uncle\u2014even though ... well, she hadn\u2019t identified herself as a foster parent.</p><p>Or maybe it was a total mistake, a message for somebody else entirely.</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cuz that was likely.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Rhage.\u201d</p><p>Her hands were shaking so badly that she fumbled the cell phone, and had to bend over and fish around the dark foot-well of the desk to find the thing.</p><p>The downward repositioning was kind of handy, really, considering she was seriously thinking about throwing up.</p><p>Righting herself, she looked\u2014</p><p>Marissa was in the open doorway of her office and her boss seemed like she had seen a ghost. Great. Did the universe have a BOGO on potentially life-shattering events tonight?</p><p>\u201cMary.\u201d</p><p>The instant she heard the grim tone of voice, Mary clamped her molars together and thought, Nope, not a two-for-one. This was about her. This was about the private message.</p><p>Or that Rhage had been hurt or killed.</p><p>Mary got to her feet. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get to the Audience House right now. A young male has shown up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says he\u2019s Bitty\u2019s uncle.\u201d</p><p>Marissa came in. \u201cDid Rhage call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I ... it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Mary reached for her coat. Dropped it as she had the phone. Took two tries to pick the thing up. Then couldn\u2019t get her arm through the sleeve.</p><p>\u201cZsadist is outside.\u201d Marissa helped her with the sleeves and then pulled the lapels to order as if Mary were a child. \u201cHe\u2019s going to drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Marissa handed Mary her purse. Her phone. Put her red scarf around her neck and tied it in a loose knot. \u201cHe\u2019s going to take you.\u201d</p><p>Marissa stepped back so Mary could go out first.</p><p>But Mary didn\u2019t move. Somehow, the messages from her brain to her feet were getting lost in the pathways of her gray matter, the command to left-and-right it out of her office, to the stairs, and down to the front door scattering like autumn leaves in a cold north wind.</p><p>Her family. Her precious little family.</p><p>Her and Rhage, now with Bitty.</p><p>Or maybe ... not with Bitty.</p><p>\u201cI just want to go back,\u201d she heard herself whisper through sudden tears. \u201cI want to run the night back, I want a reverse lever, a way to back up. I want to be at home during the day, watching movies and sleeping with them both.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was emotions, not logic, speaking, of course.

Mary had no right to rob the little girl of her blood relatives.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d She covered her mouth with her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t do this....\u201d</p><p>Marissa hugged her close and she clung to her friend.

Rhage ... is at the Audience House.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t answering the phone. The uncle or whatever had shown up at the Audience House.</p><p>Mary broke into a run for the stairs, her formerly paralyzed legs putting a rush to the descent.</p><p>As she hit the front door with Marissa now racing behind her, her tears were flowing fast, streaking off her face. She didn\u2019t pay them any mind. She tore across the lawn, feeling nothing of the cold, or the fact that her purse was slapping against her hip, or that she had her phone locked in a death grip in her other hand.</p> <p>Z was right by Rhage\u2019s GTO, his skull-trimmed hair and his scarred face glowing in the darkness like a destination.</p><p>He opened the passenger door for her, and when she jumped in and couldn\u2019t work the seat belt, he reached inside, even though he hated being close to people, and clicked the tab into place. A split second later, he was behind the wheel and roaring the engine to life.</p><p>The tires skidded out on the pavement as he floored the accelerator, the powerful engine fishtailing the rear end before rubber tread found purchase and they exploded forward.</p><p>As they sped off, Mary was panting, panting so hard, panting\u2014until she was dizzy and had to lean forward and brace her hands against the dashboard.</p><p>Even though they had had Bitty for such a short time, the girl was like a part of Mary\u2019s body, and not an arm or a leg. More like an organ you couldn\u2019t live without. The heart. The brain. The soul. Only in this case, no transplants.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t do this\u2014</p> <p>Zsadist covered her hand with one of his, and stayed like that, relinquishing his hold only when he had to shift. And the sense of his strength was the only thing that kept her from screaming out loud until she shattered the windshield in front of her.</p><p>She was going to remember this car ride for the rest of her life.</p><p>Tragically.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>\u201cZ\u2019s bringing her in,\u201d someone said.</p><p>Rhage wasn\u2019t tracking much. He was vaguely aware that he was in Darius\u2019s kitchen, sitting at a table that was big enough to handle eight or maybe ten people, but had only one at it.</p><p>One rocked and shocked, braced-for-disaster, sorry son of a bitch.</p><p>\u201cMary,\u201d he said in a cracked voice. \u201cShe was calling me....\u201d</p> <p>Wrath\u2019s face got right up in his as the King sat down next to him. Through those wraparounds, Rhage could feel the power and the support of his brother and his ruler. \u201cZ has her in your car. They\u2019re gonna be here very soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is ...\u201d What had he meant to say?</p><p>The back door to the kitchen opened, another blast of cold air rushing in\u2014just as it had out front some twenty minutes ago.</p><p>The instant he caught his Mary\u2019s scent, he burst up out of his chair and wrenched around. \u201cMary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhage\u2014\u201d</p><p>They met somewhere by the stove, and he held her so hard, he didn\u2019t think she could breathe.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he murmured as he scented her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s okay....\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. He didn\u2019t know that at all. But as she shivered against him, he doubted she was hearing much.</p><p>Damn it, life was in a hurricane again, the pillars of his pathetic existence bending so far from the winds and lashing rain, they were bound to snap, the structures on his beach slapping their doors as their roofs disintegrated shingle by shingle, the windows shattering\u2014</p><p>Not that he was being dramatic or anything.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>He drew Mary over to the table and eased her into the seat next to the King.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the ... where is he?\u201d Mary asked.</p><p>\u201cV. V is talking to him.\u201d Rhage rubbed his temples, aware that he had a thumper of a headache. \u201cThey, ah, they went into the library behind the\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter. You know where the room is.\u201d</p><p>Why the fuck was he babbling about the floor plan?</p><p>Wrath spoke up. \u201cVishous is taking down the male\u2019s information and will verify it with Saxton\u2019s help. I think it\u2019s better that the two of you sit tight and don\u2019t meet or speak with him until we\u2019ve got that shit sorted.\u201d</p><p>As kindly as the words were spoken, it wasn\u2019t a request. But Rhage wasn\u2019t going to fight the edict. Separate was better in this case.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Mary said in a hollow voice. \u201cWe have a conflict of ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterest,\u201d Rhage filled in.</p><p>Sitting down as well, he took Mary\u2019s hand and felt her squeeze in return ... and then no one said a thing.</p><p>From time to time, he looked around at the sparkling countertops, the Viking stove with its eight gas burners, the refrigerator. As it was night, the windows over the sink ... by the table they were at ... across the way ... were nothing but black panes separated by bright white slats. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow long do you think this will take?\u201d Rhage asked no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cWe just have to wait,\u201d Mary whispered. \u201cThe answer is already written, we just have to find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over at her, he hated the pain that had sucked the color out of her face and dilated her pupils and was making her hands shake.</p><p>He would have taken a bullet for her.</p> <p>In fact, he felt as though he had. Too bad they\u2019d both ended up getting shot.</p><p>Rhage checked the watch he\u2019d recently bought for himself, the one that was a match to the Rolex President he\u2019d given her when they had first gotten together.</p><p>Shit, he didn\u2019t know whether he wanted Vishous to come right away or hours from now.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d Mary whispered.

What did he look like.\u201d</p><p>It was a while before Rhage could reply, and when he did, it was just one word.</p> <p>\u201cHer. He looked ... exactly like Bitty.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>Axe was in hell. And he ate up the pain.</p><p>As he sat in his far-off corner of the restaurant, he watched Elise smile at the human man. Tilt her head as if her professor were saying something that particularly interested her. Motion with her hands. Laugh.</p><p>She looked into the other man\u2019s eyes. Clinked her wineglass with his. Took a piece of food from his plate to try.</p><p>And the whole time, she was so exquisitely beautiful, the flickering candle on the table playing over her face and throat, her shoulders and her hair.</p> <p>He hated that she was with someone else. Detested that they were sharing a meal\u2014which felt more intimate than the sex he had on a regular basis. Was downright violent about the thoughts that man was undoubtedly having in his head.</p><p>But he loved to hurt. The jealousy was an agony that left him deliciously crippled, and he opened himself up to the pain of being on the outside looking in.</p><p>Even though he barely knew her, he loved her in this moment. She was the conduit to the vein of torture, and as physically attractive as he found her, the power she had over him turned her into a goddess.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for anything else?\u201d the waiter asked him.</p><p>Axe shook his head. \u201cJust the check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>The leather folio was put at his elbow and the guy marched off. Not that Axe blamed the human. All Axe had had was water and dinner rolls\u2014before rocking the house by ordering a coffee.</p><p>The total was five dollars. He left the only ten-dollar bill he had and thought, Hey, fifty percent tip. Check him out, a high-rolling motherfucker.</p> <p>As he took another sip from his water glass, he enjoyed an uncharacteristic, unwelcomed moment of introspection: while Elise laughed again, he was vaguely aware that where he was at was really bad juju.</p><p>In her own, almost innocent, way, she was rocking his world. Bringing him to his knees. Demanding all his attention without even being aware that she was asking anything of him.</p><p>And in response, he was going to be making a demand of her. The second he got her alone.</p><p>She was not going to deny him, either.</p><p>Over at Elise\u2019s table, the check arrived, and after it was paid, the pair of them got up\u2014which was Axe\u2019s cue to sneak out the fire escape behind him. As he pushed the bar, no alarm sounded, and the fresh air made him realize how much the place smelled like steak.</p><p>His body was humming, so the cold didn\u2019t register at all, and he stayed in the shadows of the single-story building as he walked around to the front, his boots crunching over the frosted ground. The entrance to the restaurant had an awning with no side panels, a thick mat running down the pavement underneath it like the poor relation of a movie premiere\u2019s red carpet.</p><p>The happy fucking couple came out a moment later, and Troy put his arm around Elise\u2019s waist as they went down the three shallow steps to the runner.</p><p>And didn\u2019t that make his fangs descend in a rush. But he stayed right where he was.</p><p>A gust of wind caught Elise\u2019s hair, sweeping it in the professor\u2019s direction, the ends of the tendrils feathering across his shoulder.</p><p>She laughed as she regathered the errant strands, put the length in a twist, and tucked it into the collar of her coat. And then they kept chatting. It was easy to get the gist. The human motioned to the parking lot as if to offer to take her home. She shook her head. He motioned to the cars once more. She put her hand on his forearm and shook her head again.</p><p>She was telling him an artful lie about why he couldn\u2019t drive her home.</p><p>Axe smiled, flashing all his teeth in the dark. Nah, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere with good ol\u2019, man-bunned Troy. And she knew right where Axe was, his position upwind of her carrying the scent of his arousal right into her nose even as the human remained clueless of his presence.</p><p>Those rats without tails were so easy.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t get a first-date kiss. Nope.</p><p>It was pretty clear when Troy was thinking about going in for one. But Elise stepped back and put her hands in the pockets of her coat. And the man respected the boundary, lifting his hand in goodbye.</p><p>Which saved his fucking life.</p><p>Elise stood under the awning in the wind as the guy got into a perfectly respectful Subaru and backed out of his spot. Then he pulled up to the awning, put the window down, and tossed something off with a grin. She laughed. Waved.</p><p>Buh-bye, human.</p><p>Elise waited until the taillights made a left out of the parking lot and headed down the main road beyond.</p><p>Then she turned to him.</p><p>She came to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Axe let her do the walking, staying where he\u2019d planted his boots.</p><p>When she was standing in front of him, he purred deep in his throat. \u201cHow was dinner,\u201d he asked in a growl. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted, her breath coming hard. \u201cHe was good company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking about him. How was the steak.\u201d</p> <p>With that, he reached out and locked his hand on the back of her neck. Pulling her up against him, he arched his hips into her so she felt exactly what he was about.</p><p>Elise gasped, her eyes closing as she went limp.</p><p>He pushed her against the building and held her there with his body as he freed her hair, the gusts whipping it around him. Planting his palms on the cold stone on either side of her head, he leaned in and put his mouth right at her ear.</p><p>\u201cSo how was he ...,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>Before she could answer, he took her earlobe between his lips and sucked on it, ending with a nip from his fang.</p> <p>\u201cHmm?\u201d He extended his tongue and licked at her. \u201cHow was he?\u201d</p><p>Her reply was her hands coming up to his shoulders and latching on so hard he could feel her nails through the leather of his jacket. Oh ... fuck, he wanted to be naked and have her do that, so that she left little half-moons of blood in his flesh. And then he wanted her to bite him hard at his throat and take from his vein.</p><p>Axe ran his lips over her jawline and then hovered a millimeter from her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re not answering the question, Elise.\u201d</p><p>She was panting as hard as he was, her body his for the taking, her sex fully aroused for him. And you want to talk about satisfaction? That Mr. Perfect human in his precious little Merrells and his scarf, who\u2019d gotten to sit across from her at dinner, and charm her with his wit and his intellectual savvy, was never going to get this kind of reaction out of her.</p><p>Never. Fucking. Ever.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see him again?\u201d he drawled. \u201cBecause I think you should.\u201d</p> <p>She recoiled at that, pulling away. \u201cWhat ...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to watch you with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it hurts. Now, give me what I want,\u201d he growled as he closed the distance between their mouths and kissed her hard.</p><p>The bar counter in the club was long, crowded and noisy, and a total waste of time\u2014except for the alcohol. And as Novo motioned for the bartender to bring her another Scotch, she looked down the stretch of men and women, the lot of them crowding in like they were cows at a trough.</p><p>She would have been seriously disdainful of them.</p><p>But for the fact that she was one of the herd.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the server said. \u201cOn the house.\u201d</p> <p>The guy was tall, on the thin side for what she liked in males, but the shaved head, tattoos across his chest, and gauges in his ears were right up her alley.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She saluted him with the squat glass. \u201cWhat time do you get off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>She walked off, heading back for a place she didn\u2019t want to be and couldn\u2019t get away from.</p><p>As usual, Peyton had engineered the meet-up at Ice Blue, a techno club he couldn\u2019t seem to live without. And also as usual, he\u2019d gotten them a seating pit in the VIP section, behind a velvet rope that kept out the riffraff.</p><p>As she came up to the bouncer, he let her in. \u201cBack so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot my drink. I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a confused look, but she left him to chew on the reasons why she might have gone independent, when there was top-shelf bottle service in Peyton\u2019s velvet-seated sunken sex pit.</p><p>Not that there was any sex going on.</p><p>Boone was nursing the same Grey Goose and cranberry he\u2019d started the night off with, his eyes scanning the human crowd with a detachment akin to an entomologist in his lab. Paradise and Craeg were relaxed and not in big hurry to come or go\u2014which was what happened when two people were free to bang anytime they wanted. And Peyton? He was hanging with a couple versions of himself, the defensively heterosexual males dressed in expensive, tight-legged suits.</p><p>That collection of arched brows, laconic hand motions, and airs of entitlement were denser than their saturated colognes.</p><p>Definitely not her kind.</p><p>Resettling next to Boone, she crossed her legs and leaned back in the slick, padded wraparound. Why in the hell anyone would put greased-pig fabric on something drunk people were supposed to sit on was a mystery. Then again, like Peyton, this particular club was more about appearances than anything else. The wait line had been like tryouts for The Bachelor\u2014not that they\u2019d had to bother with it thanks to Peyton\u2014and there had been a Manhattan dealership\u2019s worth of Mercedes in the lot out back, and if she saw one more Scott Disick wannabe hitting on a fake tan with DDs, she was going to\u2014</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>She was boring herself with her own internal conversation. So why didn\u2019t she leave?</p><p>The answer to that was just across the shallow, carpeted pit. And of course, Peyton wasn\u2019t looking at her.</p><p>No, Peyton was leaning forward, and looking around one of his silk-suited buddies\u2014and in spite of the fact that he was wearing his blue-tinted glasses, and even with the laser beams spearing through the fogged-out air, it was obvious who he was staring at.</p><p>Obvious what he wanted.</p><p>Paradise.</p><p>And the longer Novo watched the male look at their fellow trainee, the more Novo had to own up to the fact that that obsession was part of the fucker\u2019s appeal. After all, he was everything she didn\u2019t find attractive, and yet she always ended up knowing when he came into a room and when he left it. Knew what clothes he was wearing. How he was fighting. What mood he was in, and whether he was eating or drinking, and anytime he was on his phone. She noticed when he\u2019d had his hair cut and when it was getting shaggy. When he was injured, tired, or hadn\u2019t slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knew when he banged human women in the bathroom at the end of a club night.</p><p>It was like he was some kind of homing beacon\u2014except the damn thing kept calling her to a house she didn\u2019t want to even enter, much less move in to.</p><p>So, yeah, with him rocking his full-scale addiction to Paradise, his elusiveness had to be the explanation for the attraction.</p><p>Had to be\u2014</p> <p>Paradise sat forward and said something to Peyton ... and he fucking loved whatever it was, throwing his head back, laughing like the female was a cross between Louis C.K. and a resurrected George Carlin.</p><p>Novo drank half of her Scotch.</p><p>When she brought her head back to level, Peyton was standing in front of her. \u201cHey, we\u2019re gonna go. See you in class tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>He clapped her on the shoulder and walked right by, the three look-alike friends in his wake like water-skiers behind a flashy boat.</p><p>Boone got up and stretched. \u201cI better head, too. Have a good night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going as well.\u201d Paradise smiled as she took Craeg\u2019s hand. \u201cEnjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Annnnnd then there was one.</p><p>One advantage to being totally self-sufficient and independent was you didn\u2019t care if you were left alone. But for some reason, tonight, it dawned on her that none of them would have done a toilet flush like that to Paradise.</p><p>Not that Novo resented the female or thought the object of Peyton\u2019s affection was weak. It just seemed ... weird. Or something.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>Novo stared past all the empty seats to the humans that mingled on the far side of the sunken area. There were probably three hundred guys she could fuck if she wanted, including Mr. Four a.m., the bartender. Just as many women if she were in that kind of mood, too.</p> <p>Too bad not one of them seemed appealing\u2014</p><p>Peyton popped into her line of sight from out of nowhere\u2014to the point where she wondered if he wasn\u2019t a hologram created by her brain.</p><p>\u201cForgot my phone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, so this was real\u2014because a hologram wouldn\u2019t have to justify its existence.</p><p>But instead of going over to the sofa where he\u2019d been, he stayed where he was.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Novo drawled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking a load off.\u201d She indicated the seating area. \u201cI would think that\u2019s self-evident.\u201d</p> <p>When his stare drifted down her body, she narrowed her eyes. \u201cThe question more is ... what are you doing here, Peyton?\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Elise had the hard building at her back and Axwelle\u2019s even harder body at her front, and there was no place she\u2019d rather be.</p><p>Especially as he started to kiss her.</p><p>He was just as hungry and demanding as she\u2019d fantasized, his mouth crushing hers, his hands rough, his erotic greed the kind of thing she knew would make a meal out of her\u2014and oh, God, she went with it, arching her breasts into his chest, holding on to his shoulders, giving herself up to him.</p><p>The kiss was everything that she\u2019d thought it would be and more, the cold December night disappearing, consumed by the heat between them.</p><p>But what the hell had he said to her? About wanting her to see Troy again?</p><p>She pushed at him until the contact was broken. \u201cI don\u2019t understand....\u201d</p><p>Axe cupped her face in his big palms and rolled his hips against her, his massive erection stroking at her belly because he was so much taller than she was. \u201cWhy are we stopping to talk here?\u201d</p><p>Good question. If slightly offensive.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want me to go out with Troy again?\u201d</p><p>She had spent the meal forcing herself to focus on the human, follow his conversation, ask the right questions at appropriate moments, laugh when she was supposed to. But the entire time, she had been completely distracted by Axe sitting down in the far corner of the mostly empty steakhouse, his looming presence like the most beautiful thundercloud she\u2019d ever seen off in the distance.</p><p>Heading for her.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she prompted him. \u201cIf it pains you so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it turns me on.\u201d</p><p>Axe dropped his head and kissed her again, his lips soft as velvet, his tongue bold and demanding. And holy crap did she want him, her breasts aching for his hands, that mouth of his, her sex lighting up between her legs, her\u2014</p><p>Elise forced herself out of his hold. And walked around a little to clear her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to see him again, I\u2019m not going to use him. I want you to want me for myself. If I\u2019m not enough without some kinky, subversive game involved, that\u2019s fine\u2014I\u2019m certainly not going to try to entice you by playing hard to get right under your nose.\u201d</p><p>As Axe smiled, his fangs were fully descended. \u201cOkay.

She refused to be derailed as she grabbed his muscled forearm and dragged his wrist right to her mouth. Forming a seal with her lips, she sucked on him, his taste the strongest intoxicant she\u2019d ever known, the rush going through her making her dizzy.</p><p>\u201cOh ... yeah,\u201d he groaned. \u201cShit ... yeah.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly, there was an unexpected shift in the power dynamic\u2014him collapsing against the building, his knees seeming to buckle, as she became the aggressor and he her prey.</p><p>And the entire time she took from him, she stared at the straining length behind his fly.</p><p>That was what she wanted, she decided as she looked at his erection.</p><p>And he was not going to deny her.</p><p>\u201cI came back for my phone.\u201d</p><p>As Peyton repeated the very words he\u2019d spoken to her, Novo smiled a little. \u201cYou said that already.

Go figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nursed what was left of her Scotch. \u201cWhere are your three friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelfish.\u201d She deliberately recrossed her leather-clad legs and rubbed her thighs, one atop the other. She hated the way her core warmed for him. \u201cYou\u2019re a real shit, Peyton, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get a drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about going to my place.\u201d</p><p>Novo cocked a brow. \u201cYour father\u2019s mansion, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I gotta place. It\u2019s a suite at the Sterling. I crash there sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cNo Super Eight for the likes of you. And tell me, if I go back to this suite with you, what are we going to do there?\u201d</p><p>His eyes went from her mouth to her breasts to her thighs ... and then took their sweet time returning to her face. \u201cWhatever we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking me right now in your mind, Peyton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cBack in that fancy hotel room of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a suite, not a room. And no. I\u2019m picturing you bent over that sofa right now, your leathers off, my tongue in your sex as you come against my face. Then I fuck you with my cock.\u201d</p><p>The bolt of electricity that went through her was the good news and the bad news: The last thing she wanted was to feel that way anywhere around someone like him.</p><p>Nature didn\u2019t care about that shit, though, did it.</p><p>\u201cDoes that turn you on,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She finished her Scotch, put it aside, and slowly got to her feet. Meeting him right in the eye, because she was as tall as he was, she said, \u201cBut I have an even better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>Tilting toward him, she put her hand between his legs and relished the way he sucked in a hard breath as if she\u2019d surprised the fuck out of him. Stroking him through his fine, perfectly tailored slacks, she was of half a mind to make him come for her in the midst of the crowd.</p><p>But no, he didn\u2019t deserve the release. Not after he\u2019d spent all night staring at someone else. Wanting someone else. Wishing he were with ... somebody else.</p><p>Running a fang up the side of his neck, she whispered in his ear, \u201cI think you should go to that suite of yours, take off all your clothes ... and imagine Paradise like that as you squeeze a couple off.\u201d She dropped her hold on him and stepped back, narrowing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I ever play substitute for another female. You want that, there\u2019s two hundred human women in here who\u2019ll take your sperm donation.\u201d</p><p>With that, she walked away. And didn\u2019t look back.</p><p>Part of that was because she didn\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction. But mostly it was because she would die before she let him know how much he\u2019d hurt her just now.</p><p>No one, male or female, was going to see that.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>\u201cOh ... my God ... how exquisite is this?\u201d</p><p>As Axe shut the back door of the cottage, he gritted his teeth. He should have brought Elise in through the front door so she didn\u2019t see the kitchen in the moonlight.</p><p>Too late. And clearly she wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied with a quick walk-through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nope. Instead of following his lead directly to the archway, she went across to the carved patterns of leaves around the windows and trailed her fingertips over the wood that his father had spent hours and hours whittling and smoothing and finishing.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d she breathed. \u201cThis is incredible.... I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>In the silvery blue illumination, her hair shimmered like an aura as if she were an angel fallen to earth.</p><p>Too bad all the things he wanted to do to her body were right out of a demon\u2019s playbook.</p> <p>And shit, he could sense his blood in her\u2014and he fucking loved it.</p><p>As she linked her arms and shivered, he said gruffly, \u201cThe furnace is broken. I\u2019m getting it fixed next week. Come this way to the fireplace.\u201d</p><p>She still didn\u2019t follow him. \u201cSeriously, who did all this woodworking?\u201d</p><p>She went over to the wooden table with its pine-backed chairs that had ivy leaves for slats.</p><p>\u201cMy father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Your sire did this? Oh, my God, he was an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome this way.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted and went to the cabinetry. \u201cHow long did it take him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold. I\u2019m going to go build a fire for us.\u201d</p><p>Walking out of the kitchen, he yanked his leather jacket off and tossed it on a random chair. And yeah, the dilapidated state of everything weighed on him\u2014that and the fact that there was no heat, no lighting, no food in the place. Where he lived wasn\u2019t just a far cry from the palace she crashed in\u2014this hovel wasn\u2019t even on the level of an ordinary house for your average commoner.</p><p>Crouching down by the fireplace, he grabbed the poker that he\u2019d propped up on the brick and shoved the ashes out of the way. Then he crushed up some newspaper, put some sticks that he\u2019d collected from the yard the night before over it, and laid a single hardwood log on top.</p> <p>He\u2019d sold one of his father\u2019s carved figurines on eBay for four hundred bucks back in the fall, and he\u2019d used the money to buy a cord of mixed hardwood that was enough to get him well into the winter. And yeah, maybe he could have pawned a couple more of the woodland animals and birds in the cellar to get the lights on, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to part with any of them.</p><p>Even though he despised each and every one.</p><p>The box of matches was kept in a metal container, and he popped the lid, snagged a stick, and flicked the head into flame with his thumbnail.</p><p>The newspaper curled away from the heat before allowing itself to be consumed, and then snapping and cracking escorted waves of chalky smoke up the flue.</p><p>He knew the instant she appeared in the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dump. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was going to say it\u2019s homey.\u201d As he barked out a laugh, she walked around, touching the stuffed chair and the padded sofa, the faded material on both making him cringe. \u201cMaybe it could use a brooming, but this is a perfect little nest of a house. It\u2019s kind of a surprise.\u201d</p> <p>He turned back to the fire, nursing it, encouraging it.</p><p>Just like he was going to do to her sex in a matter of minutes.</p><p>\u201cI hate the place.\u201d</p><p>Axe got to his feet, his knees cracking, the erection raging in his pants getting squeezed. He didn\u2019t rearrange the thing. He wanted her to be the one to do that.</p><p>Oh, yeah ... the firelight on her was even better than the moonlight had been.</p><p>She frowned as she looked at the pallet in front of the flames.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you were coming here. This is where I have to sleep to keep warm.\u201d</p><p>Her face relaxed. \u201cYou better get that furnace fixed so you can go back to your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Axe pointed to the floor right at his feet. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She moved across the shallow, glowing space like a dream, the flickering orange light making her beauty mysterious and inaccessible even as she got so close he could count her eyelashes.</p><p>Reaching out, he brushed her hair back, tilted her head ... and covered her mouth with his. Licking into her, he swept a palm down her shoulder and onto the small of her back\u2014before bringing her into him with a hard jerk.</p><p>Greedy, he was so goddamn greedy ... and he\u2019d intended to start slow.</p><p>But that went out the fucking window quick.</p><p>Next thing he knew, he was shedding her coat for her, yanking her blouse out of the skirt, getting to the warm skin at her waist. Images of her with that human male made him rough, but she didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>She was just as hard on him, dragging her hands through his hair, straining against his body, scoring his nape.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d he groaned. \u201cYou lie down, female....\u201d</p><p>Lifting her into his arms, he knelt and put her on what little softness he had to offer.</p><p>Too damn bad it was bedding and nothing else.</p><p>With an undulation of her body that nearly made him come, she brought her arms over her head and arched as he straddled her thighs. One by one, he freed the fancy buttons of her blouse.</p><p>It seemed like a crime to rip everything apart.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these made of?\u201d he said in a voice so low it was nearly inaudible.</p><p>\u201cMother-of-pearl,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>They had nothing on her luminous skin.</p><p>As he slowly parted the two halves of silk, everything came to a crashing halt, all that hurry, hurry pulling up short as he hissed at the sight of her and clamped his teeth together. Her breasts were hidden behind lacy white cups, and the innocence and sexuality that combined together so perfectly was hotter than all the anonymous, extreme fucking he\u2019d been doing for years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMay I?\u201d he heard himself ask.</p><p>Which was weird. But he felt close to a religious experience here as he loomed over her: it seemed unforgivable to enter any part of the temple without her express permission.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d she said.</p><p>With hands that only shook a little, she arched up again and reached behind her back ... and then the cups went loose, her hardened nipples tenting them.</p> <p>\u201cOh ... fuck.\u201d Was that him talking? He didn\u2019t know. He was out of his goddamn mind. \u201cElise ...\u201d</p><p>You want to talk about torture. Watching her remove one strap and then the other while keeping the bra in place made the heartbeat in his cock go triple time.</p><p>And then she cast the barrier aside.</p><p>She was perfect. Just ... perfect.</p><p>Dipping his head, he led with his tongue and licked at her nipples before sucking her in, one after another. It felt so fucking right to be crouched over her like this, worshiping her with his mouth, his body on the knife-edge of losing control, his blood pounding in his veins.</p> <p>He felt so alive, but not in that manic way he usually did when he was in the middle of fucking.</p><p>As he nuzzled at her breasts, he had to rearrange his erection in his pants\u2014it was either that or start singing the high notes. And then he went for the fastening at the back of her skirt, and she helped him by rolling her hips to the side. Yes, he wanted to tear the thing off her pelvis, preferably with his teeth, but again, he wasn\u2019t going to ... and not just because she needed something to go home in.</p><p>Patience had its rewards.</p><p>As he suckled on her and made her moan, he took off her skirt, hose, and panties at the same time, sweeping them down her long, long legs.</p><p>Then he sat back.</p><p>Under his hot gaze, she brought her arms up over her head once more and moved for him, stretching, twisting, the firelight bathing her skin with illumination that was like a hundred of his hands over her flesh. And oh, how the reality of her flesh was better than his dream: Her breasts with their straining nipples, and the flat plane of her stomach, and her bare sex, and her creamy thighs, were all blowing the doors off the hypothetical version his subconscious had coughed up the other day.</p> <p>Moving his hands down her from collarbone to hip, he caressed her body ... and then followed the path with his mouth\u2014stopping at her belly button.</p><p>Looking up her body, past her spectacular breasts, he found her lips parted as she panted and stared down at him, her eyes wide and wondrous as if she had never felt like this before.</p><p>Peyton\u2019s voice came into his head: Because you\u2019re going to fuck her and leave her ruined.</p><p>Axe shoved the words and the tone out of his head, intending to go down on her until she knew exactly how beautiful he thought she was. And then he would ...</p><p>No. Actually, he wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t going to complete this act. He wasn\u2019t going to end with him inside of her.</p><p>He was just going to pleasure her with his mouth and his tongue and then he was going to ...</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>Axe sat back, even though pulling away from her was like peeling off layers of his own skin with his fangs.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered. And then she smiled. \u201cDo I get to see you now?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer her, she frowned and sat up.</p><p>God, the way her breasts hung, so full and ready for him\u2014it nearly distracted him enough that he could keep going.</p><p>Nearly.</p><p>\u201cAxwelle?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face. \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you, ah ... can you not call me Axwelle ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly my mother ever called me Axwelle. And I hate that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want to be thinking about your mahmen during a time like this.\u201d</p><p>The lift to her lips faded as he didn\u2019t say anything more. And then she pulled her blouse over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cI think I know what you\u2019re worried about,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cDo you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his and held steady. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Well, guess that was what gob-smacked looked like on Axe.</p><p>As Elise waited for him to put into words whatever he was thinking, she found herself shaking her head. \u201cYou know ... it actually feels really good to just tell someone that.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his face and then looked away, to the fire. In the flickering light, the tattoos up that one side of his neck seemed to move over his skin. He seemed ... dangerous. Sexy. And very removed from her, all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cI thought you would be relieved.\u201d Elise frowned. \u201cAnd I mean, come on, it\u2019s not like you wouldn\u2019t have found out if we did have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything less of you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t? Then you have a strange way of showing it.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head decisively. \u201cNah, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want honesty, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pulled one of the two loose blankets across her lower body and crossed her arms over her shirt-draped breasts. \u201cWhatever it is, I want to know.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something under his breath. Then spoke quickly. \u201cI want to know who the male was ... so I can go and kill him.\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. And then connected the dots. \u201cOh, my God, it wasn\u2019t like that. At all. I wanted it to happen\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuck, now I really feel like murdering the motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>Elise broke out in a laugh, and when he glared at her, she put her palms up. \u201cI\u2019m not making fun of you, honest. I\u2019m just ... I\u2019m giddy with relief that you don\u2019t think less of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. At all. I\u2019m jealous as shit, but I don\u2019t judge you.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cSo who was he?\u201d</p><p>Shifting her gaze to the fire, Elise opened up her memory banks. \u201cHe was a male who I fed from. It was all witnessed, of course. But one night\u2014I\u2019m not even sure why\u2014I decided I just wanted to know what it was like. The whole ... experience.\u201d</p> <p>Axe started to growl. And then cleared his throat to cut off the noise. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>She had to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m complimented.\u201d For that, she got a grunt. \u201cAnyway, I went to find him, at his penthouse apartment downtown. I made an excuse and snuck out of the house. He was in the glymera, of course, and a friend of my father\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Now she frowned. \u201cHe was surprised, but he didn\u2019t tell me no. I was very young, my mother had recently passed after a failed birthing. There was ... so much sadness in my house, I think I just wanted to escape it. We had sex, I wouldn\u2019t even call it making love. To me, it was only a lot of body parts interacting, I can\u2019t say as I really enjoyed it.\u201d</p><p>As she fell silent, she could feel his burning eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cFinish the story,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not over, is it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elise took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a little different from other high-born females, you know? I mean, nothing like my cousin Allishon\u2014I\u2019m not reckless or anything. I just wasn\u2019t into festivals and dances and events. One evening, no more than a week or so later, my father asked me to join him at a dance and the male was there ... with his shellan. I never thought he was mated, you know? It never dawned on me to ask. I mean, in the aristocracy, there are so few males to go around for feedings, and as long as there are witnesses when you take a vein, there is no sex to worry about. But I felt awful as I looked her in the eye. And he clearly hadn\u2019t told her. He ignored me the whole night, which was appropriate, and the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. Not because I was emotionally attached to him, but because I had used him, and he had let me ... and together, we betrayed her.\u201d She exhaled long and slow. \u201cHe was killed in the raids ... so was she. They were childless. My regrets live on, though, and always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a fucking letch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pretty sure he had done the same thing with other females he was feeding. Otherwise ... why the penthouse? It wasn\u2019t where he lived or stayed with her during the day, you know? It was all just so messy\u2014and the reason I started to focus on psychology. I wanted to understand how people\u2019s emotions work, and we vampires are not so different from humans in that regard. For example ... like, you know what was really nasty of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe she was speaking so freely, but Axe\u2019s silent, non-judgmental listening was unheard of in her world. \u201cAfter I met his shellan, there was a part of me that was relieved he was mated\u2014because then he wouldn\u2019t say anything. I had kind of worried about that. After just losing my mahmen, I didn\u2019t want to lose my father, too, on account of my not being mateable. Can you imagine how selfish that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds more like self-preservation to me. And you know ... whoever you mate is going to be the luckiest male on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>For some reason, the way he said that hurt\u2014probably because he was clearly indicating her future hellren wasn\u2019t going to be him. But that was crazy on so many levels.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m never getting hitched.\u201d When he frowned at her, she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone telling me what I can and can\u2019t do. I\u2019ve had enough of that from my father\u2014I mean, everything in the house is his way, his preference, what he can handle within his rigid system of social expectations. Which isn\u2019t much. I want to be on my own, and I\u2019m going to figure out a way to do it. I\u2019m going to finish my degree and find a place in the world\u2014no clue what it\u2019s going to be, but I\u2019m going to get my own money so I can move out and then ...\u201d She laughed in an awkward burst. \u201cAnd yes, my father is going to disinherit me, and I\u2019ll be dead to the glymera and my bloodline. But it\u2019s going to be worth it....\u201d</p><p>Wow, she\u2019d never even articulated the plan to herself, much less someone else.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she went on, \u201csome dream, huh? Nothing like a little self-destruction to spice things up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s self-destructive.\u201d Axe stared into her eyes. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He splayed his hands out and then curled them into fists. Then cracked the knuckles one by one. \u201cThis is going to sound stupid.\u201d</p><p>She waited. \u201cWhat will?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that you want to be on your own even if it costs you everything? It makes me trust you.\u201d He shrugged as if he were trying to downplay what he was saying. \u201cIt makes me believe what you said, that you aren\u2019t like the rich people who killed my father. Because those types? Never would have walked away from their lifestyle\u2014and before you say that I\u2019m generalizing, maybe I am, but if you can\u2019t find it in yourself to extend decency to commoners in a life-and-death situation?

What they did to him, how he died, isn\u2019t the half of it.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t surprised as he hand-and-footed it over to the fire and put more logs on the flames.</p><p>\u201cI think I should probably go,\u201d Elise murmured as he spent an excessive amount of time nursing the hearth.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Abruptly, he looked over his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>But the mood had shifted and there was no going back to where they had been. She believed him, though, when he said he still\u2014</p><p>\u201cCan I see you tomorrow night?\u201d he asked without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cYes. Where?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d He poked at the burning logs, a shower of sparks raining down on his bare forearm, not that he seemed to care. \u201cI have a long training session tomorrow. I won\u2019t get off until late, but you said you weren\u2019t going into the library or anything, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know. Probably four? We\u2019ll still have some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here then. I can just wait for you? If you trust me here alone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d trust you with my life.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he said that absently really made her believe that he meant it. And that warmed her through and through, more than the fire did.</p> <p>\u201cThen we have a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is,\u201d he drawled. \u201cWhat else would you call it?\u201d She started to get dressed, stumbling when it came to getting her bra hooked. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to be the first to say, I can\u2019t wait to see you again.\u201d</p><p>When she was finally back in what she\u2019d been wearing, she stood up with her coat. \u201cGood day, Axe. If you think of me, you can text me, you know. No pressure. I just want to put that out there because I think you might not even if you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>He got to his feet, and as he stretched his back, there were a series of snaps and pops\u2014and yes, she admired his muscles under the tight T-shirt he had on. \u201cLet me walk you out.\u201d</p><p>They were silent as they left the room\u2014but he caught her and redirected her to the front door, not the one off the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be cold,\u201d she said as she stepped out into the night and he followed.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>And indeed, he stood strong against the frigid wind, unbending, magnificent.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, in the training. I imagine it can be hard.\u201d</p><p>He made a noise in the back of his throat that could have been anything from a Yup to a Whatever.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then ...,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>For some reason, the darkened windows of the little cottage made the homey place seem as cold and empty as space itself.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to leave him there all by himself.</p><p>But what choice did she have?</p><p>\u201cWell, good day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before she stepped off the stoop, he grabbed for her and brought her in against him. But he didn\u2019t kiss her. He just cradled her close to his chest, holding her tightly. And oh, she held him back.</p><p>She got the impression it had been a very long time since he had hugged anyone. She also knew that he didn\u2019t want to let her go.</p><p>The embrace was, she would reflect later, even better than any promise of mind-blowing sex.</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>Axe stood on the front steps of his father\u2019s cottage for the longest time after Elise dematerialized. Under his skull, his brain was bucking like a bronco, what he and Elise had shared so outside of the norm of where he usually went with females\u2014hell, with anyone\u2014that he felt rattled down to his marrow.</p><p>It had been so long since he\u2019d connected with another person.</p><p>And yeah, he didn\u2019t like what he was feeling now\u2014the things she\u2019d told him about herself sticking around in his thoughts, processing and re-reprocessing, calling up all kinds of emotions he could really fucking do without. It was so bad that the only thing he could think of to do was go and find a fight somewhere. He knew how to fight. Knew what to do, how to strike, how to avoid getting hit\u2014hell, he\u2019d known that before he\u2019d gone into the training program.</p><p>Whatever had happened in front of his fire back there?</p><p>No fucking clue how to handle it. Or its aftermath.</p><p>It was easier when he\u2019d just seen Elise as a becky to fuck. Now? She was a person.</p><p>When he finally headed back inside, his stomach rumbled with hunger, but there was nothing to eat, and besides, he was used to an empty gut. As he shut the door, he intended to go take a shower and then crash, but he didn\u2019t get that far. For some insane reason, he was drawn to the kitchen, to the door in the far corner, to the creaky old stairs that took him down into the basement.</p><p>He fucking hated the basement.</p><p>When he got to the bottom of the steep steps, he put his hand out into the pitch-darkness for the lantern on the hook. Cranking up the glowing kerosene wick, he almost hoped it wouldn\u2019t come alive\u2014</p><p>The illumination was yellow like the fire, fixed like the moonlight.</p><p>And the ghosts of the past came alive as he looked at his father\u2019s workshop.</p><p>Breathing deep, he could still smell the wood chips and the sawdust that carpeted the dirt floor like honey-colored snow.</p><p>Even though nothing new had been made down here in over two years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holding the lantern out, he went over to the tall table with its scarred top and its countless tools and the drawings that had been tacked to the bare wall studs behind it. There were blocks of wood that would never see an artistic form and then figurines that were half-whittled, the rabbits, birds, squirrels, and flowers looking as if they were struggling to pull free of their squares.</p><p>There was also an extensive shelving system across the way, where his father had lined up his finished products. It was like a woodland scene, the winsome creatures frolicking together in a miniature forest, the fauna crouching, rolling over, running, climbing, sitting pretty, among tiny, intricate trees and perfectly carved rocks.</p><p>Axe hated to see what his father had been able to do.</p><p>The skill was that of a master, the end results the kind of thing that belonged in museums or under the protective, nurturing care of collectors.</p> <p>And yet they were sitting here in the basement.</p><p>He wanted to light it all on fire. Just burn it all.</p><p>It was too fucking pathetic that the male had stayed down here all day, every day, making this shit because he was hoping a female who had left him for a better offer might be impressed when she came back.</p><p>But see, Axe had always wanted to say, she ain\u2019t coming back.</p><p>And he\u2019d been right.</p> <p>His father had been such a gentle male\u2014an uneducated one, but a gentle soul for sure. And commensurate with his nature, he hadn\u2019t dealt with the betrayal by drinking and getting violent, by turning into a man-whore, by abusing the little boy who had been left behind with him. Instead, he had simply faded away, becoming a ghost that drifted in and out of the rooms and ended up haunting this space down here.</p><p>Axe had hated him for the weakness.</p><p>And yeah, a part of him still did.</p><p>But the tragedy that night of the raids had fucked all that righteous anger up\u2014adding a watershed of self-hatred and guilt on top of the psychotic sundae he\u2019d already been carrying around with him 24/7.</p><p>God, why the hell was he down here?</p><p>Well, that was a no-duh if he\u2019d ever seen one.</p> <p>Axe ignored the fact that he stumbled a little as he headed back for the stairs, and he took the lantern up with him, leaving it at the top by the door into the kitchen.</p><p>Needing something, anything, to focus on aside from his precious little fucking feelings, he went back to his leather jacket and got out his phone. Except he wasn\u2019t sure exactly who he was going to call or text.</p><p>Not Elise, that much he knew.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get to his nearly empty contact list, though.</p><p>Somebody had left him a voice mail, and it wasn\u2019t a number he recognized.</p><p>As he played the message, he frowned\u2014but two words in, and he knew who it was.</p><p>Good evening, Axwelle. This is Elise\u2019s sire. There is an additional service you could provide me, and I would be most grateful if you would call upon me tomorrow eve, an hour after sundown. I shall look forward to your presence. Thank you.</p><p>What the hell was this about?</p> <p>From out of nowhere, the hum of his addiction started to vibrate, that thing he had always thought of as part cancer, part dragon, standing up on its hindquarters and starting to roar.</p><p>The good news? At least he wasn\u2019t thinking about Elise. The bad news?</p><p>Once that hum started talking to him? It would rise and rise until he had to deal with it ... and there was only one way that had worked for him now that he\u2019d quit heroin\u2014</p><p>The phone went off in his hand, the electronic pattern of sound loud as the pop! of a gun in the quiet house.</p><p>He answered before the second ring was over. \u201cNovo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>As background noise made her hard to hear, he frowned and turned up the volume with his thumb. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt a club. You know that Euro-trash one Peyton goes to all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He took the phone away from his ear and checked what time it was. Also noted that he was running out of battery life. Shit, he\u2019d forgotten to charge the damn thing in the restaurant\u2014when you lived without electricity, you learned to vampire volts when you could and recharge your stuff everywhere.</p><p>When his fellow trainee didn\u2019t say anything further, he frowned. \u201cYou drunk and need a pickup? \u2019Cuz you know I don\u2019t have wheels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I need to ask you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to fuck?\u201d</p><p>Axe popped his brows. And for a split second, he entertained the idea of the female coming over and the pair of them hardcoring it all over the fucking house, breaking furniture, slamming into walls, letting the fire die because their body heat was more than enough to keep them warm.</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes,\u201d she drawled in a low, sexy voice that should have been better than an actual hand down his pants.</p><p>Keeping the phone to his ear, he walked over to the fireplace, bent down, and picked up the blanket Elise had wrapped around herself. As he put it to his nose, he breathed deep.</p><p>And missed her so much he dropped the damn thing like he\u2019d been burned by it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t shit where I eat, Novo,\u201d he heard himself say.</p><p>The come-on went out of her voice immediately. \u201cThanks for suggesting sex with me would be excrementally awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get emotionally attached,\u201d she muttered dryly. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He thought of the asshole Peyton and the dumb-ass\u2019s little Paradise obsession. \u201cWe got enough fucked-up dynamics in the group already, though, and someone would find out. That shit\u2019s hard to hide even if you do it vanilla.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine.

It\u2019s guest night. You\u2019ll find what you\u2019re looking for there. I know I always do.\u201d</p> <p>TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>It was five hours before Vishous came back into the Audience House\u2019s kitchen. And Rhage couldn\u2019t decide whether he was glad the initial interview of the uncle was over ... or shit terrified to find out the results.</p><p>As V sat down at the table with all of them, he was clearly tired, his hair plastered back off his forehead like he\u2019d been pulling his hands through it, the tattoos at his temple glowing in contrast to skin that was too pale, his gloved hand shaking a little as he lit a hand-rolled and took a deep drag.</p><p>Rhage took the teacup he\u2019d been drinking hot chocolate out of off its saucer and pushed the little porcelain plate in his brother\u2019s direction. So the guy had an ashtray.</p><p>Then he sat back, took Mary\u2019s hand, and waited some more.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t a surprise that Vishous took his time before he spoke, and even Z came over and sat down.</p><p>\u201cSo here\u2019s what we got.\u201d V tapped his cig over the saucer even though there was no ash at the end. Then he pointed to the thing. \u201cThank you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Rhage murmured.</p><p>Fucking hell, he almost didn\u2019t want to hear it. Mary, on the other hand, was leaning forward, obviously prepared to deal with whatever the news was.</p><p>He drew from her fighting spirit. \u2019Cuz at the moment, he was feeling pretty fucking ball-less.</p><p>\u201cSo Ruhn gave me all the details he knows about Bitty\u2019s mother. The names of their sire and mahmen. When and where she was born. Where she lived and who with before she came to Caldwell. How she met that asshole she mated. What he knew of what happened after she came here.\u201d The brother took another inhale and released more of that Turkish smoke. \u201cHe also told me about where he\u2019s been living, what he\u2019s been doing, who he\u2019s been associating with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does he do?\u201d Mary asked roughly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a manual laborer. He lives in South Carolina. He works on a big estate down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bloodline?\u201d Wrath demanded. Like the King was prepared to go and seize the estate as if they were back in the Old Country. \u201cAnd did the stories make sense?\u201d</p><p>V put his palm up even though Wrath couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to tell you your royal business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to anyway,\u201d Wrath muttered.</p><p>V focused on Mary, as if he recognized that she was the one who was going to care most about the process. \u201cThe most reasonable and responsible thing for me to do is go down there myself and verify everything. I have addresses, contacts\u2014including the family he\u2019s worked for. I have all the details of his life up until now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you,\u201d Rhage said, and started to get to his feet.</p><p>Except now he was the one getting palmed. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fuck I\u2019m going to let someone else get to the bottom of this shit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mary said. \u201cYou have a conflict of interest. So do I. This needs to be done by a disinterested third party.\u201d</p><p>Rhage eased back down into the seat. The idea of sidelining an investigation like that made him want to pound his forehead into the table until the thing splintered and then powdered into sawdust\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d Wrath announced. \u201cLet me talk to him. I\u2019ll know whether he\u2019s telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>V shook his head. \u201cWith regard to the facts as the guy sees them, sure. But it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Rhage was aware of the beast surging under skin, the stress juicing him up. \u201cIf he\u2019s a lying piece of shit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe issue is his fitness,\u201d Mary cut in. \u201cFitness to be a parent\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage released his shellan\u2019s hand, curled up a double\u2019s worth of fists, and slammed them into the table, splitting the heavy oak boards down the center. \u201cWe\u2019re her parents! We\u2019re her fucking parents!\u201d</p><p>As he leaped up, Mary went with him, catching one of his arms and hanging all her weight off it. \u201cRhage, you need to relax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her father! You\u2019re her mother\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mary lost her hold on him and then he was pulling a RHONJ and flipping the table, sending his brothers and the King jumping back as china and glassware went airborne and then shattered all over the place.</p><p>\u201cThis is fucking bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Immediately, his brothers were on him, Z catching him from behind and cranking him into a neck hold, Butch coming from out of nowhere\u2014when had he gotten to the house?\u2014and grabbing him around the waist from the side, Mary trying to get in his face so he would focus on her.</p><p>The only thing that kept the beast still inside him was the fact that it had gotten out the night before. If that shit hadn\u2019t gone down at the clinic, he would have trashed the whole back wing of Darius\u2019s old mansion.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t take her away!\u201d he screamed at no one and everybody. \u201cWe just got her! He can\u2019t take her\u2014he\u2019s a fucking stranger\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhage,\u201d Mary got directly in front of him, jumping up to catch his eye. \u201cRhage, we have to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Latching onto her wide, sad stare, he moaned, \u201cShe\u2019s ours ... she\u2019s ours ... this stranger can\u2019t take her away\u2014she\u2019s ours....\u201d</p><p>He was babbling, he knew he was babbling, but it was like someone had uncorked the bottom of his brain and every boogeyman fear he\u2019d had about Bitty\u2019s future was funneling down and out his mouth.</p><p>Mary let him go for a time, but then she took the reins. \u201cRhage. The reality is that we knew we had to get through this six-month waiting period. And Bitty ... she talked about an uncle. We need ... as hard as this is, we have to see this through.

Think about it\u2014if we\u2019d made it through to the final adoption, we wouldn\u2019t want anyone showing up at some point in the future with rights. This is the reason why we give notice and wait to see if anybody responds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being so logical\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m breaking in half right with you, Rhage. Just because I\u2019m trying to keep it together doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not bleeding on the inside.\u201d</p> <p>As he went limp, his brothers loosened their holds and he pulled Mary against him. Looking over her head, he watched V stab out his hand-rolled in the sink and immediately light another one.</p><p>After a long silence, Rhage said to Vishous, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the one? To go down there and ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d V sucked so hard on the end of that cig, he nearly consumed the entire thing on a oner. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the right fucker to do it. Not only did I conduct the interview, but out of all of us, I\u2019m the one most likely to remain neutral.\u201d</p><p>True, Rhage thought. V was the smartest among them. The most logical. The most unlikely to be affected by emotion.</p><p>Goddamn it, how the fuck were they in this situation.</p><p>In a brutal series of mental snapshots, he saw Bitty in the movie theater with him and Mary, her arms and legs in those casts. Then he remembered teaching her to drive around the courtyard and up and down the hill ... and helping her make her bed in the early evenings ... and their ice cream breaks and the bad dreams that he\u2019d woken her up from ... and Mary smiling at their little girl....</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d he asked as Butch and Z started to pick up chairs and debris. \u201cIt will take how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least two nights, maybe three. But everyone will see me when I\u2019m down there. Either because of my status or because I\u2019ll put a gun to their head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo coercion,\u201d Mary warned grimly. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014we can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake Phury with you,\u201d Wrath announced. \u201cHe has a way about him. He\u2019s a good foil for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d V nodded once. \u201cAs you wish, my Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave tomorrow?\u201d Rhage demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, right after I finish this cigarette. I already spoke to Jane, and I have a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2014\u201d Rhage started.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d V cut in. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare thank me. This is a fucking nightmare and I hate it. I hate everything about this. But goddamn it, I\u2019m going to do this right, no matter the outcome.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause and Rhage watched V\u2019s eyes focus on some point about two feet in front of his face. It was clear the brother was already prioritizing things, making lists, thinking of what he had to accomplish.</p><p>Then Rhage looked around at the mess he\u2019d made in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhere is the uncle now?\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>V talked through an exhale. \u201cI put him up in a bolt-hole here in Caldie. He didn\u2019t want to accept the digs, but I told him it was nonnegotiable. I can\u2019t disclose where he is\u2014there really can\u2019t be any contact between the three of you right now. Lot of emotion.\u201d</p><p>Rhage went over and righted the mangled table with Z\u2019s help. The thing no longer sat square on the floor, one leg twisted and bent at an angle, the top cracked, one plank missing from where he\u2019d punched it. He wanted to move the heavy expanse back into position, to have them all sit around it again, to return things to normal, but there was no future in that.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him ...\u201d Mary cleared her throat. \u201cDid you tell him about us?\u201d</p><p>V leaned against the wall and ran his black-gloved hand over his goatee. \u201cI told him that Bitty was with a well-qualified and well-vetted foster family who was keeping her safe. I did not share any identifying information or mention the formal adoption. Unless he\u2019s got a legal claim, there\u2019s no reason to go into your private information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s ...\u201d Mary rubbed her face. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>Rhage got quiet, freezing in the process of picking up the chair he\u2019d been in from where it had ended up across the room.</p><p>V just shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m going to find that out.\u201d</p><p>Mary and Rhage took the GTO back to the mansion, the two of them quiet for most of the ride, their hands nonetheless linked except for when he had to shift. During the last leg of the journey, Mary stared out her window, the trees on the shoulder of the rural road a blur in the night, the moon overhead so bright that the headlights were unnecessary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be when we see her,\u201d Rhage said. \u201cI mean, you know, how to be normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d decided it made no sense to tell her about the male showing up. What if he turned out to be a faker? How cruel would that be? And yet ... how were they going to pretend to Bitty that everything was fine and nothing unusual was going on?</p><p>That was going to require acting skills far out of her league.</p> <p>Mary\u2019s stomach ache, which had begun riiiiiight after she had read that private message back in her office, got even worse as they started up the mansion\u2019s drive, the ascent seeming to compress the unprocessed omelet and bagel, which she\u2019d had at First Meal hours before, into a cement block.</p><p>As the great gray manse came into view, with its gargoyles and its countless windows and its towering, monolithic mass, she felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cTake your time parking,\u201d she muttered as Rhage slowed to go around the winterized fountain in the center of the courtyard. \u201cGod ...\u201d</p><p>He eased in between Qhuinn\u2019s second Hummer and V\u2019s new R8. Turned off the engine and the lights. Even undid his seat belt. But neither of them made a move to get out. They just stared ahead, at the rolling, snow-dusted lawn that dipped down to the edge of the forest ... at the drop to the valley below ... at the show of stars above.</p><p>There was so much ugliness that she felt prepared to deal with. And by that, she didn\u2019t mean that she was excited to see tragedy or disease or loss up close and personal. But she at least had frames of reference for all of that.</p> <p>This?</p><p>Well, life was just full of surprises, wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>And all things considered, she would have rather learned what winning the lottery was like. Or maybe try going around the world. Or becoming president of the United States.</p><p>But not this bungee cord of learning she wasn\u2019t ever going to be a mom. And then finding out she was. And then having all of that taken away.</p><p>Potentially taken away, she reminded herself.</p><p>Plus on top of that, Bitty was in a damn wheelchair, still recovering from what they\u2019d had to do to her at Havers\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go see her.\u201d</p><p>They got out together and reunited at the trunk of the muscle car, Rhage putting his arm around her shoulders. As they came up to the fountain, she was sad that it had been all drained and tarped up: The gentle fall of the sparkling water was something she had come to associate with home. But winter in upstate New York did not offer the kind of climate where you wanted exposed exterior pipes to be full of H2O, even if the system was running.</p><p>The main entrance to the Brotherhood mansion looked like a cathedral\u2019s front door, a pile of broad stone steps leading up to a portal made all the more regal because of the carvings that graced its jambs. Rhage led the way into the vestibule, and then they put their faces in front of the camera and waited for someone, likely Fritz, to allow them entrance.</p><p>The whole time, an inner voice was screaming that she couldn\u2019t do this, she couldn\u2019t meet Bitty\u2019s eyes without being honest, she couldn\u2019t lie by omission, she couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cGood evening, master and mistress,\u201d the ancient butler said with a smile as he pulled the heavy door wide. \u201cHow fare thee?\u201d</p><p>Like I\u2019ve been shot through the heart, Fritz, thank you....</p><p>Mary stepped over the threshold. Frowned. Looked around.</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t understand the sound she was hearing. Laughter, yes. And it was Bitty\u2014but why was it accompanied by\u2014</p> <p>A water balloon flew right in front of Mary\u2019s face, and it was a case of duck or get soaked. And then Bitty was right on its tail, running full tilt out of the dining room, her hair streaming behind her, her shirt wet, one red and one blue water balloon in her hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Rhage barked as he marched inside.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom! Hello, Father!\u201d</p><p>The little girl kept right on going into the billiards room. And yup, what do you know, Lassiter was on her, a yellow balloon high over his shoulder\u2014at least until he threw it at the girl, catching her solidly in the back. The squealing sound was all delight\u2014and then Bitty twisted around without missing a beat and nailed Lassiter full in the face.</p><p>Perfect aim.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the point.</p><p>As the wet bomb went off, drenching the angel\u2019s face and all of his blond-and-black hair, Rhage grabbed on to the male and ripped him right off his feet, landing him back-flat on the ground\u2014and then he double-palmed him by the neck like he was prepared to choke the life out of the immortal.</p><p>Or ... something like that. Whatever.</p><p>Mary rushed over. \u201cRhage\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to her! Where are her casts!\u201d</p><p>But then the mom in her made Mary switch gears. \u201cYeah, what the hell! She\u2019s not supposed to be out of them for six weeks! And not even walking!\u201d</p><p>Lassiter tried to answer, but his crushed windpipe wouldn\u2019t let any air out. Bitty was the one who solved the mystery.</p><p>\u201cHe healed my arms and legs! Don\u2019t hurt him! He made them better\u2014honest! Don\u2019t hurt him, Father.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Rhage released Lassiter and then fell back on his butt as if he realized the show of violence might have triggered memories.</p><p>But Bitty didn\u2019t seem worried about that. \u201cSee?\u201d She hopped from one foot to another. Spun around with her arms out. Laughed in a happy giggle. \u201cAll better!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Mary watched the show and then looked at the angel, she had a passing thought that she was kind of done with surprises for the night. \u201cWhat ... what did you do to her?\u201d</p><p>Bitty spoke up for her buddy again. On account of the coughing and the gasping. \u201cHe just sent sunshine to my arms and legs. He put his hand over the casts, without even touching them, and there was this heat ... and then, I don\u2019t know, nothing hurt at all. We sawed off the fiberglass in the garage. That was the coolest part.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now Mary was light-headed\u2014and she had to take a load off on the floor. \u201cYou did what with a saw?\u201d</p><p>When Lassiter finally lifted his head, he was red-faced, but no longer doing an impression of a rescued swimmer. \u201cI didn\u2019t like her suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee?\u201d Bitty said. \u201cSo don\u2019t be mad at him.\u201d</p><p>Mary shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did you let them break her bones,\u201d Rhage snapped. \u201cIf you could do something like this, why the hell did you stand by while she was tortured in that exam room.\u201d</p><p>Lassiter sat all the way up, his oddly colored, pupil-less eyes not shying from Rhage\u2019s hard stare in the slightest. \u201cIt is not my job to affect destiny. That I cannot change without exacting proper balance, and sometimes the cost for the gift is worse than not giving it in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Mary thought of the bargain that Rhage had made for her to live, before the Scribe Virgin had learned she couldn\u2019t have children; the one where, for her cancer to have been cured, he would have had to never, ever see her or talk to her again, in spite of the fact that they were in love.</p> <p>Balance was the way of the universe. \u201cBut\u201d\u2014the fallen angel held up his forefinger\u2014\u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t cushion the fall of fate\u2019s dominoes. If you get what I mean. Easing the pain without changing the course? That I can do.\u201d</p><p>Bitty smiled. \u201cAnd I\u2019d much rather be running around now as opposed to six weeks from now. Besides, those casts were itchy already. And bathing? Ugh.\u201d</p><p>Mary found herself blinking back tears as she squeezed Lassiter\u2019s forearm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Rhage breathed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And shit, I shouldn\u2019t have said \u2018shit.\u2019 Fuck. I mean ... damn it.\u201d</p><p>As her hellren skidded to a halt with the cursing, Mary felt like breaking down\u2014and Bitty clearly sensed it, bending low with a hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I know you guys worry.\u201d Bitty smiled as she tugged Rhage to his feet. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go have Last Meal\u2014and before you tell me to clean up the mess, Fritz doesn\u2019t let us.\u201d</p> <p>Right on cue, a whirring started to fill the foyer.</p><p>\u201cHe loves his wet vac,\u201d Lassiter said. \u201cDon\u2019t that sound dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in front of my kid it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Rhage muttered.</p><p>Everybody turned to the butler, who, sure enough, had fired up the canister-and-vacuum combination and was cheerfully sucking up the splashes on the mosaic floor in his formal black and white uniform. He paused and looked concerned.</p><p>Turning the wand off, he inquired, \u201cDoes anyone require aught? Last Meal is going to be served in ten minutes. Perhaps a libation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, Fritz,\u201d Rhage said, sounding exhausted. \u201cBut thanks, man.\u201d</p><p>The doggen bowed deeply and then resumed his sucking. Which, Lassiter was right, did sound dirty.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Father, you\u2019ve got to be hungry.\u201d Bitty pulled at Rhage\u2019s arm. \u201cRight, Mom?\u201d</p> <p>God, that hurt. Those names ... were like broken glass in her heart.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI imagine he should be eating something right now.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean he wanted to, however. And yet Rhage could not deny the little girl, and the two of them went off for the dining room, a tiny sprite who had her mobility back skipping next to a mountain of a male who was walking like he was half dead.</p><p>Mary jumped when a hand to help her off the floor appeared in front of her face. Lassiter was back up on his Nikes and staring down at her from his great height with a somber expression.</p><p>Abruptly, the fact that the butler was wet-vac\u2019ing up the remnants of a water balloon fight became crystal clear, largely because the grand and colorful foyer\u2014with its malachite and red marble columns and its three-story-high painted ceiling and its grand fireplace and great stairway\u2014was exactly where you didn\u2019t ever want to have one.</p><p>Meeting the eyes of the angel, she said, \u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Fritz was going to love the wet vac?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat her uncle was going to show up and that Rhage and I were coming home a mess. You knew the distraction was going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he made a pshaw motion with the hand she had yet to take. \u201cI\u2019m not that smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you couldn\u2019t stand to see her in pain any more than the rest of us could.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, Lassiter sank down onto his haunches next to her. Reaching out to her face, he brushed one side of it with his right hand and the other with his left.</p><p>Then he made a pair of fists and squeezed hard enough to make all the veins pop up in his heavy forearms. A second later, he unfurled his hands. In the center of both his palms, there was a faceted diamond, the two gemstones reflecting the light around them with rainbow flashes.</p><p>\u201cA mother\u2019s tears,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo hard ... so beautiful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not her mother,\u201d Mary choked out. \u201cOh, God ...

I can feel it. The uncle ... is real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so.\u201d Lassiter stood up again. \u201cBut why don\u2019t I keep these just in case, \u2019kay?\u201d</p> <p>He strolled off, hair dripping, clothes a mess, all that gold jewelry he wore like part of the sun stuck with him even when he was indoors.</p><p>Mary looked at the archway through which Rhage and Bitty had disappeared.</p><p>When she felt like she could walk that far ... she got up ... and did.</p><p>TWENTY-SIX</p><p>The following evening, Elise was in her bathroom, blow-drying her hair, when her phone started shimmying across the marble counter.</p> <p>She went for the thing so fast, she nearly fumbled her Conair right onto the floor.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Axe.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she said as she turned off the dryer.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of hello is that?\u201d the male voice demanded over the connection.</p><p>\u201cThe kind you give somebody who takes this long to call back.\u201d</p><p>Peyton, son of Peythone, cursed softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been busy. But I\u2019m all yours now. You okay?\u201d</p> <p>She turned away from the mirror and leaned her butt against the counter. It was hot in her fuzzy pink bathrobe, but she was keeping the thing on: Even though they weren\u2019t FaceTiming, it didn\u2019t seem right to be naked while she talked to her cousin.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you try and buy off Axe?\u201d</p><p>There was a silence. \u201cSo this is about your new bodyguard, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was really insulting to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme ask you a question, here. Exactly who do you think is guarding you? Do you know anything about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a leading question? If it is, just answer it already, will you. I don\u2019t want to play games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, your family has already lost so much\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me. I\u2019m living in this house, okay? Like I don\u2019t know how much people are hurting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, and I was the one who had to look Allishon\u2019s parents in the eye when I told them she was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we really competing over my cousin\u2019s death here? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise ...\u201d There was a long muttering. \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I feel safe around Axe. He\u2019s been nothing but a gentlemale to me. And I don\u2019t appreciate you disrespecting him by trying to bribe him over something that is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m your third cousin. That\u2019s it.\u201d As silence stretched out, she was beyond frustrated. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He cursed. \u201cI gotta go. I have to get ready for class\u2014you want me to tell your boy you said hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being like this? And he\u2019s not my boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with him. You\u2019re going to need it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to do this. You either tell me what you\u2019re really worried about or you cop to being an ass because you\u2019re being overprotective. Those are your two options, Peyton. What you do not get to do is play this smoke-and-mirrors game, and then huff off like you\u2019re being offended by my behavior.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.

Cousin thing aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not asking you to, so there\u2019s also that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019m being overprotective and I have no right to be. There.\u201d</p><p>Elise exhaled and smiled a little. \u201cYou\u2019re a pain in the ass, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I am told.\u201d Peyton exhaled. \u201cLook, I know people like us don\u2019t talk about these things, but that shit with Allishon is still with me. I can\u2019t ... I can\u2019t get it out of my mind. And yes, I realize it\u2019s making me a little psychotic. I just ... I\u2019m not sleeping, I\u2019m\u2014my head\u2019s all fucked.

I would love to help or understand or ... just finally know what happened.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cPeyton? You still there? Hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw what was done to her. I saw ... the violence that killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Peyton ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who found her.

But then ... no, that wasn\u2019t it.</p><p>Putting the phone down, she looked around, but come on. It wasn\u2019t like someone was lurking in a darkened corner\u2014in her all-white marble bathroom that had all its overhead lights on.</p> <p>Leaving her phone behind, she went out into her bedroom. Glanced in all the corners, of which none were dark because she had all the lights on in there as well.</p><p>Except she wasn\u2019t exactly scared.</p><p>More like pricklingly aware\u2014</p><p>\u201cAxe?\u201d she said out loud.</p><p>Even though Elise was in her pink bathrobe, she padded out into the hall. Followed the instinct down to the main staircase. Proceeded to the first floor\u2014</p><p>Fresh air. Someone had just come into the house.</p> <p>And ... Axe\u2019s scent. It had been he who had been let in. Moreover, thanks to the blood she\u2019d taken from him the night before, she knew precisely where he was.</p><p>Snapping her head to the left, she saw that her father\u2019s study was closed up.</p><p>Making no sound at all, she whispered over the marble floor to the parlor that was located behind his private work space. Inside, the peach-and-silver loveliness of the wallpaper and the drapes was lost on her as she went to a built-in shelving expanse that had a scalloped top and Herend figurines of roosters and waterfowl and other birds of all kinds on its levels.</p><p>The release was hidden on the right at shoulder height, the kind of thing you couldn\u2019t see and wouldn\u2019t guess at\u2014and when she toggled it, the entire unit, built some hundred and fifty years before, unhinged from the wall and slid soundlessly to the side.</p><p>Stepping into the hidden passageway, she pulled an old-fashioned metal cord with a wooden handle on the end ... and back the shelves went, moving so seamlessly that the priceless porcelain collection wasn\u2019t disturbed in the slightest.</p><p>The space was cramped and dank, but not cold, and there was enough light from the seams of the molding high above that she made her way forward about five feet ... to a set of wooden steps that led up the back of a wall.</p><p>She was careful as put her slippers on the slatted wood. She didn\u2019t weigh a ton, but she was worried about creaking sounds giving her away. Once on the highest step, she reached up to a slide that was roughly at eye level.</p><p>When she moved it aside, she could see out into her father\u2019s study, visualizing the fire across the way, the desk, her father\u2019s figure ... and Axe, who was sitting across the desk from her sire.</p> <p>Yes, she was staring out of the \u201ceyes\u201d of a portrait. Just like in the movies.</p><p>Her mother had cut the holes in the painting herself\u2014and her father had nearly fainted. But oh, her mahmen had been able to get away with things like that with him.</p><p>She\u2019d been the only one who could.</p><p>If Elise was careful not to breathe heavily, and if she concentrated on drowning out the sounds in the ductwork and the soft whistle of a breeze in the rafters, she could hear them speaking.</p><p>Her father was just sitting down, which would make sense. Clearly she had become aware of Axe\u2019s presence the instant he\u2019d entered her home.</p><p>And by extrapolation, he would soon guess where she was\u2014</p><p>Sure enough, he frowned and looked across directly at her. His expression was one of almost annoyance, as if he couldn\u2019t figure out why the hell he\u2019d been distracted by a two-hundred-year-old portrait of some old vampire in formal dress.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d her father said as he pulled his cuff links into proper position under the sleeves of his navy blue suit jacket. \u201cI gather that your first evening with my daughter went satisfactorily.\u201d</p><p>Cue a quick image of her naked, stretched out in front of Axe\u2019s fire, his mouth and hands\u2014</p><p>Okay, that needed to stop right now.</p><p>Axe glanced at her father. Looked back at the portrait. Refocused. \u201cShe came home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that I am most grateful.\u201d Her father smiled, and seemed sincere. \u201cShe is my heart. She reminds me so much of her mother. A fiery spirit, a fierce intellect, afraid of so little. That is also why I worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why you hired me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Felixe cleared his throat. \u201cOn that note, I should like to expand your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never put her under sehclusion. She would not do well with that. And I am aware that she must leave the house for other reasons than her studies from time to time. Mayhap for a festival or a get-together of females of her station.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right ... because she was really looking to go out and have her nails done with a bunch of get-mated-obsessed Barbies?</p><p>She\u2019d much rather save the money, keep her toenails to herself, and read through her dissertation paper one more time.</p><p>\u201cI should like her to find a suitor.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned. Oh, hell no.</p><p>\u201cDo you have one in mind?\u201d Axe asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are a number of appropriate males whose families are looking for them to settle down. She is of age and then some. It is time, but I am certain if I state that I support the prospect in any way, she shall rebel. So I am in a very difficult situation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware that she left the house last night.

Even when she\u2019s not in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tell me where she goes. I will pay you, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Axe shifted in the chair, crossing his legs, ankle on knee. He glanced over to the painting again. Looked back. \u201cI have training. I can\u2019t be with her twenty-four/seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a GPS program installed in her phone. My butler is rather electronically adept. He can monitor where she goes and provide you with coordinates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut again, what if I\u2019m in class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could investigate where she goes afterward. On your time off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You don\u2019t want her under sehclusion, but you want to know where she goes, and if I can\u2019t be there, you want me to pretend to be a P.I. and figure out what she was doing and with who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Felixe smiled with relief. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, Father, she thought. And of course Axe was going to do it. He\u2019d maintained he needed the job, and more money was always better\u2014</p><p>Axe got to his feet. \u201cSorry. That\u2019s not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d her father said.</p><p>What? she thought.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m good with being her bodyguard. But sneaking around behind her back and reporting to you what she does, just so you can use it against her, isn\u2019t my thing. If you\u2019re so concerned with what she\u2019s doing and who she\u2019s seeing, you need to ask her yourself. Your daughter is one of the most up-front people I\u2019ve ever met. She\u2019ll tell you. She\u2019s honest like that, even if it\u2019s a hard discussion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut ... I\u2019ll pay you more. I can pay you double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You people ...\u201d Axe glanced in Elise\u2019s direction one last time. \u201cI have to go. Training starts in an hour and I have to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d reconsider.\u201d Felixe seemed deflated. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t. You need to talk with your daughter, not treat her like she\u2019s the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only want what\u2019s best for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who\u2019s going to know what that is, though, it\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>As Axe let himself out, Elise shut the slide and hopped off the steps. Gathering her robe, she raced for the hidden shelving.</p><p>Back at the Brotherhood mansion, in his and Mary\u2019s new bathroom, Rhage checked his pair of forties and made sure the clips were full. Then he put both of his black daggers into his holster, handles down, and verified his backup ammo.</p> <p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said to the reflection in the mirror over the sinks.</p><p>Funny, that this human holiday was about the birth of a savior, and yet here he was, going out into the field, on the search for death.</p><p>And yeah, he looked like a killer, especially as he pulled on a leather duster and covered up his blond hair with a black skullcap.</p><p>Then again, he could have been in a pink bathrobe and fuzzy slippers and his eyes would have given him away.</p><p>Turning from himself, he went out into the bedroom beyond. When they had moved up to the third floor only two months ago, it had felt like home immediately because Bitty had been with them. Now the suite seemed like a hotel room, something that was lovely, but transitory.</p><p>If the girl left them, they were not staying here.</p><p>In fact, he would never again go up to the third floor.</p><p>Leaving their room, he went next door, and stopped in between the jambs. Mary and Bitty were sitting on the girl\u2019s bed, the pair of them in sweats, Bitty\u2019s hair still damp from the shower. Mary was brushing the long lengths, starting at the ends and working her way up, as Bitty chatted along about the Christmas party that Beth and Butch were organizing for the end of the evening.</p><p>\u201cAnd so this big fat guy in a red velvet suit comes down the chimney?\u201d the girl said.</p><p>\u201cYes. He leaves presents under the tree, and in the morning, everyone opens their stockings and packages. You eat too much at four in the afternoon. Watch football and fall asleep. Wake up at nine o\u2019clock. Feel peckish. Eat more. Go to bed and pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that is Father\u2019s kind of holiday! But we should have done it at dawn this morning, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to fit the schedule to what worked for the most people.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, there had been plans in place for weeks now, but with that male showing up at the Audience House? No one had been in the mood for celebrating. Rhage and Mary had insisted the gathering go forward, though.</p><p>Maybe it would be another good distraction along the lines of Lassiter\u2019s little miracle/balloon fight/perfectly timed show of excitement for the little girl.</p><p>Bitty went on to ask questions about Mary growing up, and Mary answered everything in the same way she was brushing that hair ... slowly, gently ... as if she were never going to have a chance to do it again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Father! Hi!\u201d</p><p>As Bitty turned to him, her face was so open, her smile so genuine ... that he wanted to lose it all over again. But he didn\u2019t. He walked in, as if it were any other night, and murmured something, smiled, patted Bitty\u2019s shoulder, kissed Mary on the mouth, said his goodbyes.</p><p>Bitty seemed worried.</p><p>Mary was resigned and sad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to stay with them. He needed to go.</p><p>The beast may have stayed in its cage of flesh last night, but that wasn\u2019t going to last with all the high-flying tension\u2014so he had to find a fight to burn the edge off. It was going to be his only salvation.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Bitty said as he took his leave.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he whispered over his shoulder.</p> <p>Instead of going to the prearranged meeting spot and joining Z and Butch and the trainees for orientation, Rhage went straight to the alleys west of Caldie\u2019s financial district, proceeding directly into the heart of the field, to the pavement and shadows he had stalked for how long now?</p><p>The night was as cold as the previous one, but there was a humidity in the air that spoke of coming snow. The humans would like that. They would find it \u201cseasonal\u201d for their holiday.</p><p>There was no one wandering the stretch of deserted buildings he chose to hunt, nothing to mark the street but the burnt-out shell of an old sedan, a rotting couch, and a series of scrawny dead trees in the cracked sidewalk.</p><p>No Christmas trees twinkling in the windows. No ho-ho-ho\u2019s from partygoers. No carols, no sleigh bells, no reindeer, no presents.</p><p>Breathing in deep, he felt a great burn inside his chest ... and it was as if he were back to square one.</p> <p>Ever since Mary had come into his life for good, he had enjoyed the killing because thanks to the Scribe Virgin\u2019s good old breeding program, he had been designed since conception to protect and defend his race. But there had been none of this old-school desperation, this twitchy unhappiness, this ... sad sense ... that he was not a master of his destiny but subjugated to it because of his curse\u2014</p><p>Cranking around, he tilted his nose up. Inhaled again.</p><p>Let out a growl.</p><p>Lessers were fewer and farther between now than ever, and there had been sightings, by others in the Brotherhood, of a very different kind of foe.</p><p>They were trying to determine who and what it was. Sea changes like that in the war were rarely good news\u2014and clear evidence that the Omega was thinking again.</p><p>But the stench of baby powder that rushed up to greet him now?</p> <p>It was like the one wish he\u2019d needed to come true had been granted.</p><p>Well, the one other than Bitty staying where she belonged.</p><p>Baring his fangs, Rhage went on the hunt.</p><p>TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>The only way that meeting could have been more offensive, Axe decided, was if Elise\u2019s father had suggested his daughter was dealing drugs on the side. Into prostitution after dark. Leading a second life taking candy from babies and kicking puppies.</p><p>Unbelievable, he thought as he let himself out the big fancy-ass door and strode away from the mansion\u2014</p><p>About twenty feet off to the left, standing in the freezing cold wind in\u2014wait, was that a pink fuzzy bathrobe?\u2014Elise was like an apparition. Except she was oh, so very much alive, her hair swirling in the gusts, her scent filling his nose, her presence warming the night to tropical temperatures.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you d\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t get any further than that. She ran up to him and threw herself into his arms, holding him around the neck and squeezing for all she was worth.</p><p>\u201cWait, what are you doing?\u201d Or something like that. \u201cElise, you can\u2019t be seen like this.\u201d</p><p>Holding her up off the ground, he strode behind a big maple tree so that the trunk would give them some privacy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d he demanded as he lowered her down. \u201cYou\u2019ll end up getting pneumonia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just needed to thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cIt was you. You were behind that painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you were in the house. I just didn\u2019t know why. I heard what you told my father ... thank you.\u201d</p><p>Axe wanted to say the right thing. Or hell, say anything. But the way she was staring up at him with those shining eyes, her hair all clean and fragrant, her body under that robe something that he could remember every single inch of ...</p><p>He cupped her face and rubbed her cheek with his thumb. \u201cI dreamed about you. All day long.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled more widely. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you dream of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>Tilting his head, he bent down and kissed her, working her lips with his own, wrapping his arms around her, pulling her close. The winter wind danced around them, snowflakes starting to fall, the dark velvet heavens above seeming to encourage lovers everywhere.</p><p>When he finally edged back, he massaged her shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for this night to be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on the pads of his chest, massaging. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stay here anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause trouble for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>God, he couldn\u2019t get enough of her face, her throat, the feel of her waist under his palms. She was like a drug he needed another hit from, and the fact that that made him want to run in the opposite direction was ironic, given how he\u2019d embraced heroin and cocaine. Sex. Violence.</p><p>But the screaming voice telling him to get the hell away from her and never look back was countered, punch for punch, by an even stronger need to be close and stay close.</p><p>From out of nowhere, an image of those figurines of his father\u2019s came to mind.</p><p>Axe stepped away abruptly. Missed the contact immediately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Felt his head get even more scrambled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe safe out there?\u201d she whispered as she tucked her arms around herself.</p><p>Nodding, he took one last look at her ... and then dematerialized to the meeting place west and south of where her family\u2019s estate was.</p> <p>As he re-formed, a gust that made his sinuses hum hit him right in the face and he breathed deeply. All his life, he had had great success pushing emotions down deep and putting a cap on them. And he did the same now, banishing any feelings or thoughts about Elise.</p><p>Too bad he could still taste her.</p><p>Peyton was the next to show up, and as they faced off, Axe was ready for a fight, prepared to start shit if he had to to get things going.</p><p>But Craeg and Paradise arrived and stepped between them.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d Craeg said. \u201cNot doing this. Waste of time, waste of effort\u2014and out here in the real world, a dangerous goddamn distraction. What the hell is wrong with you two?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Axe said without looking away. \u201cAbsolutely fucking nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Craeg didn\u2019t move. \u201cAnd you, Peyton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no problems.\u201d</p><p>Paradise hooked an arm through Pey-pey\u2019s elbow and pivoted him around. \u201cSo you were going to tell me about that female you went back to in the club last night, remember? Was she hot?\u201d</p><p>Classic reroute move, and pretty fucking pathetic that it was required. But Mr. and Mrs. Training Program were right. The group of them were headed back out into the field tonight. None of that classroom work. No sparring in the gym.</p><p>Real guns and fun, as the Brothers called it.</p> <p>Last thing anyone needed was interpersonal drama that got somebody dropped.</p><p>Into a grave.</p><p>Elise was floating on air as she went up the back staff stairs. The last thing she wanted was to be caught in her bathrobe, smelling of the night air and the male she had just kissed out in the front yard.</p><p>Funny, she had wanted exactly this tingling enticement when she had thought about being with Troy only nights ago. She had wanted this exact blossoming, even though she hadn\u2019t really known what it was. She had been searching, and she had been found. And it was beautiful.</p><p>Her bubble of happiness did not persist.</p><p>She reached the second floor and was padding quietly down the carpeted hall, going past the closed doors of the guest suites and her father\u2019s quarters, when she neared an open portal into a black room.</p><p>The voice of her uncle was distant, even though he had to be standing just inside the darkness. \u201c... this eve? Mayhap I shall have a meal set upon a quiet table for the two of us?\u201d</p><p>The response from her aunt was so quiet, Elise couldn\u2019t hear the words.</p> <p>\u201cWell ...,\u201d her uncle murmured. \u201cYes, I shall come back then. Mayhap at some other, later time. I think there is\u2014what? ... Yes. I know you do not sleep....\u201d</p><p>Elise crossed her arms around herself and walked quickly past him with her head down and her eyes on the carpet. But her uncle must have heard her or sensed her because just as she came up to their room, he wheeled around into the light.</p><p>His face was that of a skull, his skin gray from stress and suffering, his eyes hollow. \u201cElise,\u201d he said in a dead tone. \u201cHow fare thee this eve?\u201d</p><p>She bowed and likewise used the Old Language. \u201cI am well, mine uncle. And you?\u201d</p><p>It was the customary response to the customary question that did not, in fact, request an honest reckoning of her state, but was more a polite gesture, as someone would utter \u201cBless you\u201d after a sneeze.</p><p>\u201cI am well. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>And then the door was closed.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t really seen her aunt since the tragedy, and could only guess the shape the female must be in.</p><p>Elise continued on to her own room, where she changed into comfy yoga pants and a fleece pullover her father did not approve of. A quick check of the clock suggested she had waaaaay too many hours before she was going to sneak out.</p><p>Leaving her phone behind, of course.</p><p>Thank you, Father.</p><p>Taking a seat at her French desk, there were scholarly articles to read and that draft lesson plan Troy had sent over early in the afternoon for the January seminar. But her mind was scattered and inefficient, snippets of Axe\u2019s conversation with her sire, her phone call with Peyton\u2014and then the kiss on the lawn ... as well as what she had just witnessed down the hall\u2014jamming up her thought processes.</p><p>For some reason, she found herself back out in the hall ... in front of Allishon\u2019s room.</p><p>This time, she went right in, but then she stalled out, unsure what she was doing, what she was looking for. After a moment, she proceeded over to the walk-in closet because there was nowhere else to go, really.</p><p>Shutting herself in, she looked around as the motion-activated lights came on. The lineup of hanging clothes was messy and there were piles of discarded things all over the floor.</p><p>God, it still smelled like Allishon and her signature perfume.</p><p>And the wardrobe of shirts and skirts and jeans and boots and high heels was nothing Elise would ever have worn, everything tight, short, leathered, studded, ripped on purpose. Where Elise followed the rules, Allishon had entirely resisted any kind of social expectation.</p><p>The classic good girl/bad girl dichotomy.</p><p>Clinically speaking, it wasn\u2019t a mystery why nobody was talking about the death. Her father felt guilty and maybe a little superior that his young, the \u201cconservative\u201d female, had been the one to survive; his brother was distraught and bitter that his daughter, the one who had been so resistant and hard to deal with, had come to the very end everybody had tried to scare her away from; and her aunt was likely suicidal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meanwhile, Elise was trying to live her own life in the morass, trapped between sorrow and a yearning for independence.</p><p>What a mess.</p><p>On that note ...</p><p>She picked up a black blouse that was held together by safety pins and not much else and put it on a vacant hanger. And then she did the same with a flannel shirt that was mostly shredded. And a bodysuit that was black and had a blood-splatter pattern on the front like its wearer had been shot in the chest.</p> <p>She wasn\u2019t sure why she was cleaning up\u2014actually, that was bullcrap, she knew precisely why. She wanted to help her family and she could think of no other way to make even a marginal improvement. Her father couldn\u2019t stand her even offering him a hug. Her uncle would not look at her. Her aunt wasn\u2019t getting out of that bed of hers ... not unless it was into her early grave.</p><p>This was all she had.</p><p>At some point\u2014later this year, maybe next year, maybe a decade from now\u2014someone was going to come in and box up these things, relegating them perhaps to the basement or the attic, as, in aristocratic families, nothing was ever given away or resold. It was considered bad luck.</p><p>Maybe they would burn it all somewhere on the property.</p><p>But at least if she did this, whoever it was wasn\u2019t going to see the mess.</p> <p>Thinking back to what Peyton had said, she could only shake her head. Her father had always made it seem as if a human had killed Allishon. But to find out it was another vampire?</p><p>What the hell had happened?</p><p>TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>With Novo\u2019s and Boone\u2019s arrivals in the fairly well-lit alley, the training class was complete\u2014and shortly thereafter, a vehicle the size of a bank turned in at the far end. It was the Brotherhood\u2019s mobile surgical unit, and as it came to a stop, Axe assumed that this was it. Playtime was over.</p><p>The Brother Butch, a.k.a. the Dhestroyer, stepped out from the front passenger side. \u201cNo more training runs.\u201d</p><p>Yup.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a trial or a test.\u201d The Brother reached back in and brought out a duffel that was nearly the size of a bodyguard. \u201cI\u2019m going to be swapping out your ammo. These are hollow-tipped bullets with a little extra kick to them.\u201d</p><p>Boone, the class hand popper, naturally couldn\u2019t let that go. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater from the Scribe Virgin\u2019s Sanctuary. Or what had been her Sanctuary.\u201d Butch shut the door, banged his fist into the RV, and the thing trundled off. When it was out of sight, he dropped the bag and unzipped it. \u201cCome on, move it.\u201d</p><p>Boone was first in line, kicking both clips out of the butts of his forties and exchanging them for new slides.</p><p>\u201cGimme what\u2019s on your belt, too,\u201d Butch demanded.</p><p>More swapping. And then Craeg, Paradise, Novo ... Axe was the last one to do it, getting his new bullets and falling in line with the others. There were no humans around, not walking, stumbling, or even driving by in cars; whether that was on account of that holiday with the holly and the candy canes or the frigid temperatures, Axe didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean they were alone.</p><p>Zsadist was standing about ten feet away, his scarred face and pit-black eyes the kind of thing that made even Axe\u2019s bowels get a little loose. Tohrment was beside the Brother. And so were John Matthew, Blaylock, and Qhuinn.</p> <p>Holy shit, Axe thought. They weren\u2019t fucking kidding about this.</p><p>Butch spoke up again. \u201cWe\u2019re getting close to the end of the war. That means lessers are becoming hard to find and easier to kill because the only ones left are brand-new recruits. Last field session for you all, things went tits up, so we are pairing you up with a Brother or a fighter. In concert with your mentor, you will go out in a grid pattern running west to east. Do not vary unless you engage, and then only as necessary. You and your mentor will both signal everyone else upon engagement. When a signal is received, we all will converge, returning to our search patterns only after an assessment of the engaged situation occurs. Do not go rogue. Do not think on your own. Do not get dead. Any questions? And may I remind you bunch of idiots that this is not a drill. Now is the time to back off and get the fuck out if you\u2019re going to. Any moment after this will be considered desertion and reason for dismissal from the program. I\u2019d rather you bail now, not fuck us in the middle of a mission.\u201d</p><p>No one flaked. No one wasted any time with dumb-ass questions.</p><p>They were as prepared as much as any bunch of newbs could be.</p><p>And each one of them had known this night was coming.</p><p>\u201cAxe,\u201d Butch said, \u201cyou\u2019re with me. Paradise, you go with Tohr. Z gets Boone. Craeg is with John Matthew. Peyton, you\u2019re with Qhuinn. Blay is functioning as a scout for this mission, going out on the rooftops ahead of us all. Keep your guns up, your eyes peeled, and your phones live.\u201d</p><p>Nobody said anything as the pairs linked up, with him falling in line with Butch as each team got assigned a street. The plan was for everyone to proceed through their given territory until the neighborhood started to improve, approximately thirty blocks up. Then the entire system would move six streets to the north, away from downtown\u2014because the war tended to steer clear from the skyscrapers due to the exterior security cameras and internal security teams in all that expensive real estate.</p><p>Security shit meant humans potentially all over the fuck, and nobody needed that.</p><p>It was the only rule of engagement that both the Brotherhood and the Lessening Society adhered to: no human interaction, if at all possible. And if you did interact? You cleaned that up quick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Axe and Butch were the farthest out of the pairings, the two of them setting off at a jog because Butch, as a half-breed, was not able to dematerialize\u2014not that that really mattered. As the Brother was of the King\u2019s own bloodline, he was bulldog strong, his shitkickers covering the pavement at a fast run that Axe had to keep up with.</p><p>When they came to Fifth Street, Butch palmed both his guns. Axe did the same.</p><p>\u201cWe go down this side, son,\u201d the Brother said in his Boston accent. \u201cBe wicked fuckin\u2019 careful.\u201d</p><p>Together, they strode forward in a flanking position, sticking to the fronts of the brick buildings\u2014which was to say they were pretty much sitting ducks. But Axe kept his eyes on the windows across the street, covering Butch as the Brother provided the same service for him: Both of them were looking for any flashes or figures moving around in the windows of the law offices, social service agencies, philanthropic organizations....</p> <p>This was the nicest of the real estate they were going to see.</p><p>And yup, the denigration and depression of monetary values started up pretty damn quick. Soon, the five-and six-story walk-ups were displaying signs of age and decomposition, front stoops exhibiting cracked steps like teeth that were on the verge of falling out, paint jobs flaking off, and, even farther on, missing windows beginning to make appearances.</p><p>Now, he was tromping across a slushy debris field of trash, hubcaps, random beer cans and booze bottles, parts of engines, fuck only knew what else. But he didn\u2019t give a shit. He had good treads on his combat boots, sure footing, and razor-sharp instincts that were firing like cannons. In fact, his whole body was humming, his blood crackling through his veins, his trigger fingers ready to party.</p><p>And all the time, his eyes scanned the buildings across the way and then flicked to what was ahead of him and then returned to those fucking rooflines and dirty glass panes.</p><p>To say he fell into a rhythm was not accurate. There was no rhythm to be had when you were aware that you might have to start either shooting or bleeding at any fucking moment. But he was definitely in a zone\u2014</p> <p>He caught the scent first.</p><p>Just as he was crossing a thin alley opening, a gust brought something that smelled like three-day-old roadkill topped with fake vanilla icing and baby powder.</p><p>He knew better than to stop, even though his feet faltered. Instead, he jumped across the opening and back-flatted it against the far corner of the next abandoned building. With a short whistle, he got Butch\u2019s attention\u2014and he didn\u2019t need to explain what it was.</p><p>The Brother was already on it, reversing so that he was on the far side of the urban aperture.</p><p>Axe was aware of his heart pounding, but he kept his breathing slow and steady. If he started panting, it was going to decrease the accuracy of his hearing and that was not going to help.</p><p>Finally, he was going to engage with the enemy\u2014</p> <p>Shit, he thought as he caught another scent on the breeze.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>There was vampire blood down there.</p><p>At that very moment, his phone went off in his sleeve and he popped his elbow up, reading the screen that showed through the clear pocket retrofitted onto his combat jacket.</p><p>Fuck, Qhuinn and Peyton had engaged.</p><p>Almost immediately, another text came through. So had Tohr and Paradise. And John Matthew and Craeg.</p><p>It was a cluster-fuck.</p><p>And as he realized that Rhage wasn\u2019t among them, he thought ... fucking hell, what if the Brother was down there fighting alone?</p> <p>Deep in Allishon\u2019s closet, Elise had worked herself all the way around the space, and what she left in her wake was Macy\u2019s display-worthy, the garments tidy and orderly on the rods, even if some were wrinkled or so deliberately tattered that they barely had enough to hold themselves together on the hangers. She\u2019d also sorted the things on the carpet, putting the bags and shoes in a lineup according to type and color.</p><p>As she stepped back to measure her success, she frowned. There seemed to be a wad of something in the far corner, so she got on her knees and pulled the ... it was a bundle of cloth, like a large, loose bag, or a\u2014no, it was a black cloak. That smelled like\u2014</p><p>Oh, yeah, no. Cigarettes, alcohol, other things.</p><p>Elise folded the thing on the floor and was about to put it back when she leaned down and looked into the corner again.</p><p>There was something else there.</p><p>Reaching forward, she really had to stretch her arm back\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>A box. Metal, by the cool feel of it.</p><p>She tried to pull the thing out, but it weighed a great deal. Two hands. She needed two hands, and she grunted.</p><p>It turned out to be one of those lockbox, mini-safe things, the kind with the heavy reinforced sides and top. There was a keyed entry to it, and when she tried the latch on a whim, she didn\u2019t expect\u2014</p><p>Except it did open: With enough pressure, the top half cracked and then started to come fully up. She stopped her hands from following through, however.</p><p>Falling back on her butt, she moved the lockbox between her legs and thought about what she was doing. This was maybe private ... something that Allishon\u2019s parents should see first. Yet as she tried to picture bringing anything of their daughter\u2019s to them, she knew that was never going to go well\u2014and though she had mixed feelings, she did peek inside.</p><p>Just a bunch of folded-up papers, legal-size. That was it.</p><p>Taking them out, she flattened the bundle. It was a real estate contract. For the lease of ... what looked like a condo. That was downtown, going by the address of a numbered street? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was that where Allishon had gone all those nights and days she hadn\u2019t come home\u2014</p><p>\u201cWe rented that for her.\u201d</p><p>With a gasp, Elise wrenched around.</p><p>Her aunt was standing in the closet\u2019s archway, and dear Lord ... the female looked as if she had been in a car accident\u2014or maybe one involving a motorcycle with her as the cyclist: her hair, once always coiffed and sprayed into a beautiful fall onto her shoulders, was a ragged mess, with roots showing that were two shades darker than the streaky California blond so popular in the glymera. And instead of a fashionable little Escada suit or St. John knit, with plenty of pearls at her throat and on her ears, she was in a stained, wrinkled nightgown that once had been made of silk but now seemed to have more in common with a crumpled paper napkin.</p> <p>Her eyes were wide and crazy.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t looking at Elise, however. She was staring at the order of the hangers.</p><p>\u201cDid you do this?\u201d the female asked in a wobbly voice.</p><p>And as she came in a little farther, her steps were equally unsteady.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Elise fumbled with the paperwork to get it back in the box and shut the lid. \u201cI just ... I didn\u2019t know what I could do to help.\u201d</p> <p>And yeah, eavesdropping had been so frickin\u2019 laudable.</p><p>\u201cHer things ...\u201d A frail hand reached out and brushed the clothing Elise had put to rights. \u201cGod, how I hated these clothes of hers.\u201d</p><p>Elise pushed the safe back where it had been and got to her feet. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come in here\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019ve done ... a better job than I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my business to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe leased her that apartment because we couldn\u2019t stand to have her coming and going here all hours of the night. Disheveled. Drunk. Drugged up. The stench of sex on her.\u201d</p> <p>An inner Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, started to go off in Elise\u2019s head. As did a refrain of Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>This was not what she had imagined when it came to talking.</p><p>Her aunt\u2019s gnarled hand gripped and twisted one of the short skirts. \u201cHer father felt certain that the banishment would be the corrective action for all her disobedience. That she would get out there, realize her folly, and snap out of the behavior.\u201d The laugh was madness personified. \u201cInstead, she lived more on her own terms than ever before. I couldn\u2019t reach her. He barely tried. And all the time she got worse. She enjoyed torturing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuntie, perhaps you should speak with Uncle\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hated her.\u201d The female snapped the skirt free of its clips and threw it to the carpet. \u201cAnd I hate her even more in her death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mean that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do. She was a filthy whore, then and always. She got what she deserved\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her mother,\u201d Elise blurted. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d</p> <p>Her aunt moved down and made a fist out of one of the safety-pinned blouses. Ripping it off the rod, the hanger popped free and ricocheted right into her face. Not that she seemed to notice.</p><p>\u201cLook what she\u2019s done to us! After we lost our son, we now have a murdered daughter! Who was found bloodied and half-dead in front of a domestic abuse house! How could she have embarrassed us like that!\u201d</p><p>All Elise could do was stare into that ashen, emaciated face as her aunt began to tear the closet apart.</p><p>She was the reason for the disorder\u2014not Allishon. She was the one who had trashed the clothes\u2014and she was going to do it again, right here and right now.</p><p>Abruptly, Elise wanted to cry. The idea that social expectations had so completely ruined any even biological connection between mother and daughter was just ... unfathomable.</p><p>And yet she never would have guessed at the splintering. Before the death, everything had been kept under wraps, her aunt and uncle showing up dressed beautifully and smiling at events, ever the perfect couple ... as their daughter had self-destructed after her brother\u2019s death, first by inches, and then by yards ... until the fracturing of the family unit had become obvious to the other people in this house.</p><p>The others in society.</p><p>\u201cWe are not welcomed anymore,\u201d her aunt gritted out as she pulled more and more off the rods, throwing the clothes down, trampling over them with her bare feet. \u201cWe are invited nowhere! We are outcasts and it is her fault!\u201d</p><p>Elise swallowed hard and eyed the escape.</p><p>She was fairly certain she was going to throw up.</p><p>\u201cHave I shocked you with my honesty,\u201d her aunt sneered. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Elise whispered. \u201cNot a ghost. I\u2019m looking at a version of evil that I never expected to see in my own family.\u201d</p><p>Stumbling by, she shoved her corpse of an aunt out of the way and ran not just out of Allishon\u2019s room, but the mansion itself.</p><p>Out on the front lawn, she braced her hands on her knees, leaned over ... and dry-heaved in the bushes.</p><p>And then she kept running down the drive, not even caring she had nowhere to go.</p><p>TWENTY-NINE</p><p>As Butch signaled for go-time, Axe and the Brother entered a cramped service lane behind the abandoned buildings, Axe falling in tight behind and sticking with the warrior as they efficiently progressed down toward God only knew what.</p><p>Fucking hell, it was darker than he\u2019d thought, although Axe recognized that this was because he had no goddamn clue what was going to happen and it was reflexive to think that illumination would put him in a better defensive position. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sounds of fighting soon echoed in the distance and got more intense, as did the scents of spilled blood ... both of vampire and slayer.</p><p>The first of the writhing lessers showed up about eight blocks from where they\u2019d rerouted, and Butch barely paused as they went by the damn thing. He merely unsheathed a black dagger, lifted it over his head, and stabbed the undead right in the chest, the pop!-and-smoke show the first time Axe had ever seen it done.</p><p>No dwelling on the shit, though: the reality that he could get shot in the head at any second kept Axe focused on what was living and not what was being sent back to the Omega.</p><p>Farther down, black stains that gleamed like spilled oil showed up on the worn pavement ... and then came the red splatters on the brick walls of the walkups\u2014</p> <p>Gunshots went off.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Rat-a-tat-ata-ta\u2014</p><p>With a burst forward, they redoubled their speed until they got to yet another alley-artery, skidding around the corner and dropping into shooting position, Butch facing forward, Axe facing the other direction at the guy\u2019s six.</p><p>Axe shot a quick glance over his shoulder\u2014oh, hell, he was never going to forget the image of the cluster-fuck going down about fifty feet away.</p><p>Rhage was in the center of three lessers, all of which had knives\u2014and the Brother was fighting them without weapons in his hands, in spite of the fact that he had daggers strapped right to his chest.</p> <p>There was also the clear indication, if that red waterfall down his left arm was anything to go by, that he had been shot at least once, probably more.</p><p>It was as if he\u2019d had red paint poured all over him\u2014</p><p>A lesser came running around the same corner Axe and Butch had just ridden hard, and thank fuck for training. Instead of wasting a crucial nanosecond thinking Holy fuck!, Axe went beast with his guns, hitting those triggers\u2014</p><p>Jammed. Both of them.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>Butch started shooting in the direction of the fight, trying to pick off the slayers without hitting Rhage\u2014which was proving impossible because the Brother was still trying to fight even while bleeding out.</p> <p>\u201cDagger!\u201d Axe shouted. \u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Again, the training worked. Butch glanced behind for a second, knew there was no choice but for Axe to engage in tight quarters, and the Brother took out an actual black dagger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t showboat! Get the fucking job done!\u201d</p><p>With that, he flipped the weapon back and Axe caught it on the down arc, leaping forward and going right for the slayer\u2019s chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss.</p><p>That fucking black blade went right where it needed to, like there was a homing device in the forged steel.</p><p>There was no celebrating, though.</p><p>A stray bullet, either on a ricochet from Butch\u2019s gun or from one of the two new slayers who\u2019d suddenly shown up in the alley, caught Axe in the thigh, the blaze of pain as if someone had taken a red-hot fireplace poker and jammed it into his upper leg.</p> <p>And then yet another slayer came around the corner.</p><p>No time to think.</p><p>Axe leaped on the fucker, taking the soulless human down to the pavement and rolling him over. But the bastard was smart, or really into survival, because he managed to grab on to Axe\u2019s fresh wound and squeeze.</p><p>Axe\u2019s vision went in and out, his switchboard momentarily overrun with so much electrical impulse that it went on the fritz.</p><p>But then he got pissed. Clamping a hand on the lesser\u2019s throat, he had a snapshot of bared human teeth with those weird flat-tipped canines of theirs, and the tattoo of a tear under one brown eye, and shaggy hair that looked like it hadn\u2019t been cut in a month.</p><p>And then he lifted that dagger over his shoulder, just as Butch had done, and stabbed it right through the frontal lobe, driving the blade through the skull and into the cake of gray matter behind the bone.</p><p>Seizures. The slayer went full-tilt boogie, that grip on Axe\u2019s thigh flipping free, the arms slapping against the asphalt like he was clapping for a show, the legs kicking as if he were swimming.</p><p>Axe rolled off and retched from the pain. But then he went to get the dagger back from where it was flag-poling right above the slayer\u2019s eyebrow\u2014</p><p>It was stuck. There was no getting the weapon out.</p><p>He\u2019d driven it so hard, he\u2019d crushed the skull and buried the tip in fucking pavement.</p><p>Jumping to his feet, he staggered, and figured, Fuck it, at least the slayer wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>There was no more conscious thought.</p><p>His eyes provided him with an instant assessment of the state of the battle: Butch was now involved in hand-to-hand maneuvers, fighting for control of the gun he had been using with a slayer who looked like a defensive end for the New England Patriots ... while Rhage was sinking to his knees in the center of the alley, the fighting not so much going out of him as leaking out, his blood pooling under him to such an extent that there were puddles getting splashed.</p><p>With a battle cry, Axe lunged forward, taking three running leaps even with his gunshot wound.</p><p>He attacked the first lesser he came to, jumping on its back, going bullrider-squeeze with his thighs and locking hold on its ears with his hands. Then he snapped that head so far to the right, the ligaments and tendons on the left side broke free of the neck skin.</p><p>On to the next.</p><p>Leaving the body to fall where it did, he burst forward\u2014just as a slayer coiled up a chain and went to get Rhage around the throat. Yeah, fuck that shit. With a quick jerk, Axe outed his smaller hunting knife, and tackled the lesser to the side.</p><p>Talk about your fucking Jason-maneuvers. He stabbed so fast and so hard and so many times, he didn\u2019t just incapacitate the bastard, he tenderized it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then he scrambled to get to the last one. Scrambled so hard.</p><p>It had a knife. A long, serrated blade that could do a lot of damage, especially to a Brother who was clearly on the verge of losing consciousness: Rhage\u2019s hands were flopping and slapping instead of strategically hitting, his balance all wonky, his skin as white as the snow.</p><p>Axe slipped and fell. Went down hard. Landed badly.</p><p>As he snowplowed, his leathers protected him from dermabrasion ... but did nothing to save him from another gunshot wound\u2014which arrived in a now-familiar strip of pain on one of his shoulders. And something stabbed him, too, maybe?</p> <p>But then Rhage collapsed and nothing else mattered. The mighty Brother went down first on one palm, then the next, and the math was tragic as Axe made the assessment that the slayer with the knife was going to hop around, come at Rhage from behind, and slit his throat, finishing the job.</p><p>No roar this time. Axe was losing strength of his own.</p><p>Instead, Axe just got the fuck up, even though his vision flickered again, and he bolted forward, not so much running as falling and scrambling\u2014</p><p>Something was buzzing around his head\u2014why were there flies out at the end of December? What the fuck?</p><p>And God, his body suddenly weighed twice as much.</p> <p>Fuck, he smelled so much blood.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. Reaching Rhage, he grabbed the Brother\u2019s hair, and put every ounce of power left in him into wrenching Rhage out of the way of the arc of that swinging lesser blade\u2014</p><p>Axe was the one who took the knife.</p><p>And it went deep into him. Right between his ribs on the side.</p><p>He gasped, his eyes lifting to the sky. And then suddenly everything went slo-mo and numb. The world was falling\u2014no, it was probably him, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>What was with the flies?</p> <p>Boom! He landed hard again\u2014not that he felt it through the numb-blanket he was wrapped in; he just assumed he did because he bounced, the buildings around him going up and down until gravity won against the laws of basketballs and falling bodies that offered no resistance.</p><p>Exhale.</p><p>He tasted copper. Gurgling. He heard a horrible gurgling ... and figured it meant he was drowning in his own blood.</p><p>The last thing he saw as he passed out was Rhage rolling over and staring at him, as if the Brother was as surprised as Axe was.</p><p>Rhage opened his mouth and said something, his bloodied hand reaching out for Axe as if offering him something to hold on to.</p><p>Axe tried to move his arm in response.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>He was gone.</p> <p>THIRTY</p><p>The heart of a warrior.</p><p>Rhage had never seen anything like it. Or certainly never expected it out of a trainee. He himself had been going down, the reality of war reminding him that battles were like Mother Nature: No matter how strong and well-trained and well-equipped you were, every once in a while, the tide could turn against you, and if it did, you could get in over your head in a heartbeat.</p><p>And that was what had happened.</p><p>Too much blood loss. Too many opponents. Too arrogant in assuming he could handle his shit when half of his mind was back home with Bitty and Mary, and the entirety of his soul was in pain.</p><p>And he should have used his fucking weapons.</p><p>The tide had turned so quick, too. His legs had started to go jelly, and then he\u2019d realized he was going to go to ground\u2014and soon thereafter it was over, a father\u2019s promise of safety to his daughter turned into a lie: He was going to get swarmed and they were going to kill him\u2014and even the beast couldn\u2019t help him. He\u2019d expected the great dragon to come out, and it nearly did\u2014but just as the transformation was about to happen, he\u2019d gotten the arterial wound and his blood pressure had started to tank, and all bets had been off.</p><p>Still, the beast had saved him once in that condition, though ... not tonight, however.</p><p>Not tonight.</p><p>But then Axe had come from out of nowhere, attacking the first of too many lessers by daggering it in the chest. The trainee had then gone for the next, stabbing its skull into the asphalt\u2014only to get counterattacked from behind, a huge slayer leaping onto his back and lashing Axe\u2019s face and shoulders with a length of chain.</p><p>There had been no stopping the trainee, though. Hell, Axe hadn\u2019t seemed to even notice what was on top of him: Even bleeding, stabbed in places, shot in the leg, and with a lesser riding him like a horse, the male had been unrelenting, lurching to Rhage and ultimately taking the knife that had been meant for Rhage\u2019s throat in his own side.</p><p>Down the male had gone, like a great oak in the forest.</p><p>And now Rhage was reaching for the trainee, extending a hand across the pavement as the snow started to fall on both of their bleeding bodies.</p><p>So brave.</p><p>Axe\u2019s unfocused eyes shifted in his direction, their stares meeting. Blood was coming out of Axe\u2019s mouth and was all over his chest.</p><p>Thank you, son ..., Rhage mouthed. Thank you ...</p><p>All at once, people came running, all kinds of Brothers and then Manny with the surgical RV and still other folks. There was immediate surgical intervention, right on the ground, for both him and Axe, and Rhage refused to lose consciousness. Just wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>In spite of the fact that his body was cold and numb and his eyesight was blurry and his heart was square dancing behind his sternum, he refused to let go of reality.</p><p>He was afraid he wasn\u2019t going to come back.</p><p>The view of what they were doing to Axe got blocked as Manny started to work on the bleed on Rhage\u2019s shoulder, and Rhage looked up to the sky. The snow that was coming down from the heavens landed on his lashes and melted, and he pictured Mary and Bitty, their heads together, the pair of them smiling at him as if they were in a snow globe. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two Chosen arrived, and when a wrist was slit and placed against his mouth, he did what he had to in order to survive.</p><p>He hoped Axe was doing the same.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want that kid\u2019s death on his conscience....</p><p>Sometime later, he was loaded onto a gurney.

Okay, \u201casked\u201d was more like it, given how weak his voice was.</p><p>He was rolled over to the guy.

You really think that\u2019s an option? I just field-treated you with about a hundred and fifty stitches\u2014and I\u2019m going to have to fine-tune that back at the training center.

Decorated with red velvet swaths and gold balls and red and gold lights that twinkled in silence, it was the tradition that she, Beth, John Matthew, Butch, and Manny had all grown up with, a reminder of things past, a centering and grounding that helped her connect the two parts of her life story, the before and the after.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many presents under there,\u201d Bitty said as she came in with a refill on her cocoa. \u201cI have extra marshmallows, by the way? I\u2019ll share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks, but mine are still holding up.\u201d</p><p>Mary patted the cushion next to her and it seemed like the most natural thing in the world for Bitty to come over and snuggle close, the girl tucking those Lassiter-healed legs under her bottom.</p><p>\u201cI better hit the songs again,\u201d Mary said as she reached for the remote to the surround sound. \u201cI love Bing Crosby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhhh ... \u2018Winter Wonderland,\u2019 \u201d Bitty murmured, \u201cI think this is my favorite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Father will watch Home Alone again when he gets off work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you can take that to the bank.\u201d</p><p>There was a period of quiet between them, the soft chatter of the fire and the old-fashioned Christmas music the only sounds that filled the cozy room.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d Mary took a sip of her hot chocolate and marveled how, even with so much being wrong, the warm drink was still delicious. \u201cIs there something you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Annnnnd now what was in her mug tasted like dishwater. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know there\u2019s something wrong. You and Father are not acting right. Did I do something bad? Do you not want to adopt me?\u201d</p><p>Mary sat up so fast she nearly cocoa\u2019d the couch. \u201cGod, no, never, we want you always and forever.\u201d</p><p>The girl stared across at the tree. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent. Bitty, look at me. Please.\u201d Those beautiful eyes swung up. \u201cDon\u2019t ever doubt how much we love you. No matter what happens, that is one thing you will never have to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Mary hesitated. She didn\u2019t want to lie, but at the same time, the stuff about that male was not the kind of news that she wanted to share without Rhage being with them\u2014and even more to the point, she still didn\u2019t know what to say about the \u201cuncle\u201d who\u2019d turned up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of fast footsteps made the hair on the back of her neck stand up: In the mansion, that noise coming in your direction was not something you ever wanted to hear when your hellren was out in the field.</p><p>When John Matthew appeared in the doorway, she got to her feet as she saw his ashen face. \u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Bitty said with alarm. \u201cFather\u2014what happened to my father?\u201d</p><p>John Matthew started signing, and Bitty just got more agitated. \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay ...\u201d Mary reached out for the little girl. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. He just got injured, but they\u2019re bringing him in and I\u2019m going to go see him\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, too\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Bitty crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cAm I a member of this family or not?\u201d</p><p>Mary swallowed an abrupt lump in her throat. \u201cYou may not like what you see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was with me when I was at Havers\u2019s.

Then together, they hustled to follow John Matthew out into the foyer, around the base of the grand staircase, and down into the underground tunnel to the training center.</p> <p>As they rushed along, passing beneath the blocks of fluorescent lights in the ceiling, she and Bitty stayed linked, their strides falling into the same gait because Mary shortened her stride a little and Bitty lengthened hers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Mom,\u201d the girl said softly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was,\u201d Mary whispered as she wiped her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m just so glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-ONE</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not staying here.\u201d</p><p>Axe made a move to sit up in the hospital bed, and the chorus of whatthefuckdoyouthinkyouredoing from just about every single bone, sinew, stretch of skin, and muscle was so loud, he couldn\u2019t hear Dr. Manello\u2019s no doubt highly reasonable explanation as to why he had to chill.</p> <p>\u201cNope.\u201d Axe started to go for the IV in his arm. \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Manello snapped a hard grip on Axe\u2019s wrist. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking this out if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, kid, I want to remind you that I operated on you, in a fucking alley, about an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lips are blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy body, my choice.\u201d</p><p>As they bickered back and forth, the stark decor of the hospital room and the reclinable bed he was in irritated the hell out of him. As did the johnny he was wearing. The fact that his feet were bare. And also the idea that he might get trapped here during the day.</p> <p>Actually, pretty much everything irritated him.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d At least the surgeon let go of his arm as the guy spoke. \u201cThat\u2019s your comeback. Your body, your choice?\u201d</p><p>Wait, was that what he had said? He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was a good one.\u201d Axe shook his head. \u201cAnd come on, I fed from a Chosen back there. Within six hours, everything will be healed up. Inside and out. I have no broken bones, you yourself said I didn\u2019t have a concussion, and I saved the life of a member of the Black Dagger Brotherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe that gives you carte blanche to AMA yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t know what AMA is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst. Medical. Advice. Asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that would be AMAA, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making me want to hit you in the thigh, FYI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat rhymes, and isn\u2019t there a hypothetical oath or something you human doctors take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHippocratic. And hypothetically, you could leave here and have a complication in the next three hours where you could need to be opened up again, but there you\u2019ll be, at home with your thumb up your ass, bleeding out for no good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thumb has never been near that area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should try it. It might stimulate your brain to work right.\u201d</p><p>Axe couldn\u2019t help it. He started to laugh, and then Dr. Manello followed along\u2014at least until Axe ended up coughing and grabbing for his side where he\u2019d been stabbed.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Dr. Manello said grimly.</p><p>\u201cJust sore.\u201d Axe took a deep breath and mostly hid his wince. \u201cLook, Doc, just let me go. I\u2019ll catch the shuttle out and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to dematerialize.\u201d</p><p>Shit. The guy was probably right.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell you got at home?\u201d Dr. Manello demanded. \u201cA cat? Some kind of house-eating dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want my own bed.\u201d Even though he slept on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.\u201d</p><p>As Dr. Manello leaned back against the wall, the guy frowned as if someone who spoke a different language than he did was about to drop an anvil on his foot\u2014and he had to figure out how to tell them no, please don\u2019t do that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to leave,\u201d the surgeon muttered.</p><p>\u201cEven if I have to walk all the way home.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause. And then Dr. Manello said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll drive you in the surgical unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, shit, Doc, I can\u2019t ask you to do that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my other option, you hardheaded pain in the ass. You\u2019re just going to limp out of here, hide on that fucking bus if you have to, and then get out somewhere in Caldie\u2014only to discover when you\u2019ve been left there that you can\u2019t walk much at all and you die an overcooked pancake from sun exposure.

And I like females recently, so you\u2019re not my type.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon was laughing as he headed for the door. \u201cGimme ten minutes to get organized.

We do this right, on my terms, clear?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClear.\u201d</p><p>Just as the human opened the door, Axe said gruffly, \u201cCan I see Rhage. You know, before I leave.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Manello looked over his shoulder. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s been asking for you. And you can take your time in there\u2014you\u2019re going in in a wheelchair. Oh, and shut the fuck up with the complaining on that, will you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t bitched about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p> <p>As the door eased shut, Axe thought, Well, at least the guy seemed to get him.</p><p>And what do you know, after he was \u201cunplugged\u201d and had shifted his bare feet to the floor, standing up turned out to be reallllllly tricky.</p><p>Turned out that surgeon had had a point about him not being able to go far.</p><p>Ehlena, his nurse, was patient as he grunted and shifted himself from the bed down to the wheelchair, and then she pushed him two doors closer to the exit and knocked.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d a female voice said.</p><p>The nurse opened things up and Axe rolled himself in. The tableau over at the hospital bed was totally Norman Rockwell, Rhage on his back looking like death warmed over, his loving shellan and his dark-haired daughter by his side.</p> <p>And it was funny, even though Axe didn\u2019t believe in the nuclear anything, unless it was a bomb ... the three of them together made him a little sentimental. After all, it was the kind of thing anyone would want\u2014because he could tell the family was close, Rhage holding the little girl\u2019s hand, and Mary, who Axe had met in passing once or twice, with her arm around their daughter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mean to interrupt private time,\u201d Axe muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\u2014Rhage motioned forward\u2014\u201ccome here....\u201d</p><p>Axe wheeled over as close as he could and thought, Fuck it. He put the brake on, struggled to get out of the chair, and used the handrails of the bed to hold himself up.</p><p>Wow. Nauseous.</p><p>\u201cThank you, son,\u201d Rhage said hoarsely. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Man, those eyes were so blue, they almost looked fake. And they shone with tears unshed.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s good. I\u2019m just glad, you know....\u201d Fuck, wait, what the hell, was he tearing up, too? \u201cLook, I got to go\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Rhage caught his arm in a shockingly tight grip, and repeated, \u201cThank you. For saving my life. And do us both a favor and don\u2019t try to pretend you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re the only reason I\u2019m alive right now.\u201d</p><p>Axe just stood there like a planker. He had no idea what the hell to do.</p><p>Mary broke the silence, speaking up from the other side, her voice wavering. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to repay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t want anything, ma\u2019am.\u201d Axe looked up, way up, in an attempt to create more surface area for his welling eyeballs. \u201cI better go. I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re releasing you?\u201d Rhage asked. \u201cNo offense, son, but you don\u2019t look well enough to be breathing on your own, much less going home unsupervised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>The Brother laughed. \u201cYou sound just like one of us.\u201d</p><p>There was another moment of quiet, during which Axe desperately tried to keep from leaking.</p><p>\u201cCome here, son.\u201d</p><p>Rhage grunted as he sat up, and for some stupid, insane, inane reason ... Axe leaned down with a groan. As the two embraced, Axe heard himself say, \u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t gotten there on time? That\u2019s what I ... that\u2019s what I keep replaying in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t, though? You\u2019d have died and it would have been my fault.\u201d</p><p>Rhage let go and collapsed back against the raised half of the bed. \u201cNo, it would have been mine. We\u2019ll go into it later, but trust me, as someone who knows that pattern of thought well? It\u2019s the definition of stupidity to beat yourself up over something that fate decided was going to happen or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d the Brother exhaled roughly, \u201cI\u2019d like to tell you war gets easier. It doesn\u2019t. But you do get used to how awful it is. That much I can promise you. And hey, check it. You\u2019re starting out on a win.

Tent pole.\u201d</p><p>Axe laughed and eased back down into the wheelchair ... which was both a relief and as painful as Rhage\u2019s pain-in-the-ass point\u2014literally.</p><p>And damn it, you\u2019d think his thigh would appreciate not having to carry any weight? Why was it doing that heartbeat thing again?</p><p>\u201cNo class tomorrow night,\u201d Rhage said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, listen, is it true no one else got hurt, just you and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were some other brief engagements, but no one saw real action. The other slayers just ran off? It was as if they were afraid of getting sent home. I think the Omega\u2019s in some kind of flux.

Again, I\u2019ll say, trust me.\u201d</p> <p>Axe nodded at the two females and then started rolling himself back from the bed so he could K-turn and\u2014</p><p>The little girl came around and stood in front of him. She was so tiny and frail looking, with wrists that seemed no bigger than one of his fingers and shoulders that were barely wider than the span of his palm.

Kind of like you would if someone said, Hey, how\u2019d you like to hold this snapping turtle? Or ... How about you volunteer for malaria? Or the all-popular, How about you jump into this alligator-infested cesspool?</p><p>With pork chops tied around your neck and a rib roast shoved down your\u2014</p><p>Axe frowned. Mary and Rhage both seemed like somebody had died all of a sudden. What the hell?</p><p>Jeez, he didn\u2019t want to offend them.</p><p>He glanced back at the tiny female. \u201cAh ... um, yeah. Sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>The kid was on him the next moment, her surprisingly strong hold taking his breath away. Reaching up, he patted her bird-like shoulder blades.</p><p>And then froze as she whispered in his ear, \u201cHe saved my life. I wish I could do what you did for him someday.\u201d</p> <p>She broke away from him just as quickly as she\u2019d come at him, and it was weird. In the center of his chest, he felt this bizarre kernel of ... he didn\u2019t know what it was. But it was warm and seemed like the complete opposite of the freezing-cold self-hatred he usually carried around behind his sternum.</p><p>The kid went back to her parents. And before shit got even more too-much-emotion than it already was, Axe gave the family one last wave\u2014and then the little girl had to come over again and open the door for him because he had no idea how to get out of the room without help.</p><p>Dr. Manello was outside in the corridor. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>The pair of them ambulated together, the good doctor on his feet in some kind of fancy loafers, him in his ass cruiser that had wheels that squeaked on the polished floor.</p><p>For the trip to the cottage, Dr. Manello made him ride in the back of the RV, in the surgical bay, because the front of the thing didn\u2019t have tinted windows.</p><p>And Axe was more than fine without knowing the precise location of the training center.</p><p>It gave him time to think.</p><p>For some reason, that shit Rhage said was sticking in his head.</p><p>It\u2019s the definition of stupidity to beat yourself up over something that fate decided was going to happen or not.</p><p>Axe groaned and rubbed his eyes. God, he was tired\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Axe jumped\u2014and promptly cursed as his body lit up with agony, all of his pain receptors simultaneously firing.</p><p>Dr. Manello was in the back of the RV, standing over the wheelchair. \u201cYou want me to help get you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Axe gritted his teeth and put his palms on the padded armrests. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>The surgeon stepped back, those keen, miss-nothing eyes of his checking for all kinds of organ and structural failures as Axe managed to haul himself up onto his two feet.</p><p>\u201cYou can keep the johnny and the slippers. Hell, take the wheelchair\u2014please.\u201d</p><p>Axe grunted as he shuffled to the rear doors. \u201cLike they\u2019re door prizes? And yeah, I\u2019m leaving the chair.\u201d</p><p>As the surgeon hopped around with admirable ease and opened the rear doors, Axe felt like he was a hundred and eighty thousand years old. But he managed to get himself to the ground with only a little help ... and then he was doing the old man over to\u2014</p><p>Why was there smoke coming out of the cottage\u2019s chimney?</p><p>It was only three in the morning?</p><p>Shoving all of his owies aside, he focused on who was in his house\u2014yup, it was his Elise.</p><p>Not that she was his.</p><p>Guess she had decided to come early\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou got this?\u201d the surgeon asked, puffs of white breath leaving his mouth in the cold. \u201cYou want me to help you get settled in there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, thanks, Doc.\u201d Axe looked at the human and put out his palm. \u201cI owe you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup, you do. But the service with a smile is free. Just make sure you come see me first thing at nightfall, \u2019kay? I know there isn\u2019t class, but we\u2019ve got to take those stitches out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>After they clapped hands, the surgeon shut his mobile unit back up, and took off while Axe headed for the front door.</p> <p>Crap. He could have used a minute to brush his hair and his teeth before he saw Elise. And then there were all the bandages....</p><p>Ha, and she thought that cut by his eye had been a thing.</p><p>At least she couldn\u2019t accuse him of not keeping things between them spicy. Or at the very least ... surprising.</p><p>THIRTY-TWO</p><p>Emotions were tricky little devils.</p> <p>A lot of the time, Elise knew, when you had something happen that was upsetting, shocking, or disorienting, you got through whatever it was\u2014the confrontation, the abuse, the bad news, the accident that was your fault or maybe someone else\u2019s\u2014and came out the other side feeling relieved it was over.</p><p>But then the stewing started.</p><p>As she sat in front of the fire that she had set hours ago in Axe\u2019s hearth, she stared at the yellow and orange flames and replayed her aunt\u2019s \u201cmaternal\u201d monologue over and over again. God ... it was as if her brain had grooves in it and her thoughts were the stuck needle on the record.</p><p>Even after having broken-and-entered into this house that was not hers\u2014granted, the front door had not been locked\u2014and in spite of sitting here, in the very place Axe and she had nearly made love the night before, all she could see and hear was what had happened in that closet\u2014</p><p>The sound of an engine outside the little house had her leaping to her feet, and for a moment, she panicked, thinking her father had somehow found out where she was\u2014but then she sensed Axe\u2019s presence, the blood he had given her once again a homing beacon she was so glad to have.</p><p>Except what if he were angry that she\u2019d come so early? It must be three? Three-thirty? Which was less of a problem than the fact that she\u2019d arrived here just before midnight.</p> <p>Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t be\u2014</p><p>The door swung wide, and as Axe lurched in, she clapped a palm over her mouth so she wouldn\u2019t scream. Throwing out a hand blindly, she caught herself against the hearth\u2019s warm face.</p><p>Axe was dressed in a hospital johnny, his bare legs plugged into a pair of slippers. He was walking as if he were in great pain, and there were bandages visible on his biceps and his shoulder\u2014undoubtedly in other places, too.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. His face was lashed with scars, as if he had gotten too close to a series of knives or maybe barbed wire.</p><p>He stopped as he saw her reaction. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God ...\u201d She ran to him with her arms out, and then pulled up short. \u201cWhere aren\u2019t you hurt? What happened!\u201d</p><p>Before he could stop her, she stepped to his side and put a supporting arm around his waist. \u201cLean on me.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when he did. And that scared her almost as much as the sight of his face did.</p> <p>\u201cCome by the fire.\u201d She said this even though she was heading in that direction. \u201cDid you break out of the hospital? How did they let you leave?\u201d</p><p>Over at the pallet, she helped him ease down, the firelight licking over him, hopefully giving him warmth. And as soon as he was even partially settled, she jumped up and rushed over to close the door.</p><p>\u201cMay I bring you anything?\u201d she said as she returned and crouched beside him.</p><p>All he did was look up at her, his eyes softening, the strain in his face relaxing. \u201cI have everything I need right here.\u201d</p><p>As he reached up to stroke her cheek, she met him more than halfway so he wouldn\u2019t have to work for the contact.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Axe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His fingertips drifted over her jaw, her throat. \u201cAnd nothing hurts anymore.\u201d</p><p>She looked down his body and cursed. The johnny\u2019s hem had risen up, and there was a thick bandage around his thigh. Also, a bulge under his opposite arm, right where his ribs were. And oh, dear Lord, that face.</p><p>\u201cAm I that ugly?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNever. Not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can say it. You like the truth, remember?\u201d</p><p>All Elise could do was shake her head, because her eyes were watering and her hands had started to tremble and everything seemed to crash down on her at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he murmured. \u201cCome here, lie beside me.\u201d</p><p>Elise stretched out and propped herself up on her elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell me what happened, are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>But he clammed up. And simply stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI wish there was something I could do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet my toothbrush, toothpaste, and a cup of water from upstairs? I\u2019d love to brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>For a second, she thought he was kidding. And then she smiled because it did make her feel useful.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d she said as she sat up.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019ll tell you after I floss.\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked. And then shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not ... you\u2019re not coming on to me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it offend you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed in a burst. \u201cNo, not at all.

Not even close.\u201d</p><p>It was amazing how a change in scenery could perk a male up.</p><p>When Elise came back downstairs and knelt by him with the requested minty-fresh delivery system and a glass of rinse-out, you want to talk about a morphine drip? Only without the opiate and no tubing? He felt absolutely no pain whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I get this set for you?\u201d she said, holding up the brush and the tube.</p><p>When he nodded, she got to work, her head angling down, her hair, which had been pulled back in a ponytail, slipping off her shoulder and hanging forward as she concentrated on getting a line of Crest on his bristles.</p><p>Okay, that sounded dirty.</p><p>Then again, in his current mood, he could take anything as innocent as popping the top on the tube or rolling from the bottom or even her taking his brush firmly in hand, and turn it into full-tilt XXX\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to do this?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Axe looked down his body, and answered in his head, Lift up my gown and straddle me after you get naked. Then ride me like the bull I am.</p><p>Wow. The romance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold my head up. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hissed and let the deadweight at the top of his spine fall back to the ground. \u201cDamn it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s smile appeared right over him. \u201cOpen wide.\u201d</p><p>As he complied, the cool, refreshing flavor was completely overshadowed by her scent, her beauty, his need. She ended up rinsing the toothbrush out in the water over and over, getting the paste from his mouth that way\u2014and if the end result was a little gritty, at least he didn\u2019t taste old blood.</p> <p>And neither would she.</p><p>Elise moved the glass and the brush to the side and pulled the sleeve of her simple fleece down over the heel of her palm so she could wipe his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I too banged up to kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>She leaned back over him, but he stopped her. \u201cWill you free your hair?\u201d</p><p>Something about that memory of it whipping around the human male outside the steakhouse was still with him, and he wanted to own that stretch of wonder and magic that some other chump had had with her, take it away from the human, stamp it as his.</p><p>Plus he loved the smell of her shampoo.</p> <p>As she pulled the band free and returned to him, soft waves framed his face ... and then her lips were brushing his and he was using all his strength to rest his hands on her upper arms.</p><p>\u201cYou can lay on me,\u201d he said into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stabbed in the side, no big deal\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jerked up. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe waved his hand back and forth. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see.\u201d</p><p>Hmmmmmm. If she stripped him, she\u2019d get a really good picture of how bad it had been. On the other hand, hello. Nakey.</p><p>His conscience spoke up. \u201cAh, I\u2019m not wearing anything under this. I mean, like ... nothing.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grew hooded. \u201cThat\u2019s all right with me.\u201d</p><p>Axe\u2019s hips rolled at that sexy tone of hers. \u201cThen cut the damn thing off me. There are scissors in the kitchen. By the stove.\u201d</p><p>The sound of her walking through the little house, just as when she\u2019d gone upstairs, made him realize how empty it usually was\u2014and also how quiet everything was here in the sticks: Out in this rural part of Caldwell, there was no ambient noise from late-night city traffic, no extra light from buildings or streetlights, no neighbors too close.</p><p>Funny, he had never had much of an opinion about the property before ... but he liked the solitude.</p><p>Especially with her around.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she said as she came back in and got down on her knees next to him. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to start at the bottom.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught and then started to pump. \u201cElise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked as she moved down to the hem with the blades.</p><p>\u201cYou realize I\u2019m ...\u201d</p><p>It was funny that a male like him, who\u2019d done just about every sexual thing that was physically possible, often in front of crowds of people, was suddenly pulling the shy-guy routine. But the difference was, he wanted Elise to like the way he looked. In the other situations, he hadn\u2019t given a shit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re what,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hard,\u201d he moaned. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it was the least sexy thing in the world to have a hospital patient say that to a female ... to have some battered, bunged-up, stitched-together Frankenstein of a guy tell you that the one part of him that wasn\u2019t bruised was ready and rearing to go.</p><p>But for whatever reason, she didn\u2019t care about all the oh-so-uglies.</p><p>Her smile was one for the ages.</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m going to have to do something about that, aren\u2019t I,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His cock twitched like it was doing sit-ups as she went to work, the silver scissors shiny and reflecting the firelight, the blades flashing as she started to cut. Right at the center of the gown.</p><p>The slicing sound of those two sharp halves coming together over and over again so close to his erection made him nearly orgasm. And then she was right where the action was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She ran those scissors directly up the length of his erection.</p><p>Grabbing on to the blankets, fisting them hard, Axe kicked his head back, gritted his teeth, and groaned, \u201cI\u2019m coming\u2014oh, fuck ...\u201d</p><p>The release was stronger than any he had been having down at that sex club, the sensations so crisp and clean, they were just like those blades, slicing through his body.</p><p>But he was worried what she would think of him.

He was naked, vulnerable from the injuries, and so fucking hot for her that she could violate him twelve different ways to Sunday and he would have begged her for more, harder, again, again, again, oh, please, Elise, take me again....</p><p>Her hands were like water passing over his skin as her tongue licked at his mouth and penetrated him, taking him while she gave of herself. And then she was kissing down his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are these tattoos?\u201d she asked as her lips brushed over his jugular. His collarbone. \u201cOnly one side? Your earrings and piercings as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo halves,\u201d he mumbled as he arched his lower body, his erection heavy and hot as it lay on his lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cOf you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and tried to answer. \u201cWho I am ... who I wish I were.\u201d</p><p>She paused. \u201cWho do you wish you were?\u201d</p><p>For a second, the mood was threatened, cracks appearing in the heat and lust.

In every way possible.</p><p>Except there was no dwelling on that\u2014Elise proceeded to be reallllllly good to him, her mouth traveling down his torso, until it lingered at the head of his cock. Oh, fuck, her eyes were staring up his chest at him, and then she extended her tongue and tasted his tip. As he cursed out loud and jerked, she sucked him in\u2014</p><p>A blaze of pain, in a place males generally didn\u2019t tolerate discomfort well, made him jump and make things worse.</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d he barked as her teeth caught him again. \u201cNo, no\u2014don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d She sat up in a panic, his arousal still wrapped by her palm. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before\u2014I forgot I had fangs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it\u2014\u201d</p><p>All at once, the absurdity in the sexual situation hit them both, and he wasn\u2019t sure who started laughing first, but soon, they were both roaring.</p><p>It was so good to be free of pain and emptiness, to feel instead not only pleasure ... but happiness.</p><p>It had been so very long for him.</p><p>Not since his mother had left and not looked back.</p><p>THIRTY-THREE</p><p>Elise couldn\u2019t believe how crazy it was that she was acting like some kind of seductress\u2014when in reality, she\u2019d only had sex once, it hadn\u2019t been very good, and she\u2019d certainly never tried to give anyone a ... you know.</p><p>God, she was so repressed, she couldn\u2019t even say the words in her head.</p><p>Blow.

Faster ... faster ...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come\u2014\u201d He groaned and went rigid\u2014but also tried to push her away.</p><p>No, she was going to see this through.</p><p>As he barked out a curse, she took all of his orgasm, which seemed to drive him mad with passion, his convulsions and the response in her mouth as erotic an experience as she could ever imagine.</p><p>When it was all over, he went limp\u2014to such a degree, his limbs banged into the floor.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you taste,\u201d she said as she licked her lips.</p><p>And that made his erection flare in her hand.</p><p>\u201cClimb up on me,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cI want to be inside you\u2014climb up.\u201d</p><p>For a split second, Elise wondered, was she really going to do this?</p><p>The extent of his injuries scared her. If that was what could happen when he went out to fight, every single night, how long before he did not come home?</p><p>On that logic, though, she should do this because she could lose him at any moment.</p><p>And then she thought of herself, of the years she had spent on the sidelines of life, of her behaving according to values that had been imposed on her, rather than ones she had generated from her own core beliefs.</p><p>Right now? A beautiful male who had been nothing but kind and understanding\u2014and supportive of her even against her father\u2014wanted to be with her. And she was unattached, attracted to him, and in the privacy of a sacred space.</p><p>It simply didn\u2019t make sense to say no. Especially because she wanted him so badly.</p><p>Elise stripped off her fleece and the long-sleeved shirt she had on underneath. Ditched her bra and stood up.</p><p>And then she moved slower, because Axe was watching her with those rapt eyes of his, clearly memorizing every nuance of her body. Down went her yoga pants, past her thighs, her knees, and then she was kicking them free ... and standing over him wearing only a pair of white panties.</p><p>\u201cTurn for me?\u201d Axe said in a tone that was so close to a begging.</p><p>Rising up on the balls of her feet, she pivoted around, showing him her backside. That was when she hooked her thumbs into her underwear and took it to the floor, bending her body while keeping her legs locked so she showed him exactly what she knew he wanted to see.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t have to say a word of approval. His pumping purr and those volcanic eyes told her everything she wanted to know.</p><p>Elise stepped over him, straddling his hips. The firelight on her skin, the heaviness in her breasts, the curling urge between her legs, made her feel powerful and commanding\u2014and she was glad it was happening like this.</p><p>This was going to be incredible.</p><p>Because she and Axe were going to make it that way.</p><p>Kneeling down, she put her hands on either side of his head and kissed him, over and over again, aware of how open her core was above his sex, how ready she was, how perfect this felt. And as they continued to move their mouths against each other, the warmth of his body rose up to her, and his palms stroked her thighs, her waist, cupped her breasts. When she couldn\u2019t stand the anticipation a moment longer, she was the one who stood his erection up and she was the one in control as she brushed him against her sex, stroking herself with the head she\u2019d sucked.</p><p>They both cursed.</p><p>And then she gingerly angled him into the right place, and lowered herself onto him. The sensation of stretching and filling wasn\u2019t painful at all\u2014and she was glad she had lost her virginity before so that the discomfort was out of the way and she could enjoy all parts of this.</p><p>Friction.</p><p>Using the small of her back and her hips, she began to ride him, and he helped her, countering her thrusts with those of his own, a momentum getting started. Her breasts swayed and her breath caught and the firelight turned everything into slow motion\u2014or maybe that was her brain.</p><p>The oncoming release was like a train inside her body, gathering speed, the pleasure compounding on itself, radiating from her sex. And all the time they kissed and locked eyes and\u2014</p><p>Her orgasm came first and unexpectedly, like a rubber band snapping, only there was no sting of pain, just a bursting and a welling and round after round of pleasuring contractions that she wanted to get lost in forever. And then Axe was thrusting up hard, going even deeper, a kicking taking over just as it had in her mouth.</p><p>After that? After it was all finished?</p><p>After the heat started to fade?</p><p>He started it up all over again.</p><p>It was the best sex of his life.</p><p>Absolutely mind blowing, Axe decided much, much later, when Elise was finally stretched out on his chest, their bodies sated, their erotic needs on the back-off, at least for the next hour or so.</p><p>Running his fingertips up and down her spine, he loved the smooth feel of her skin, and the weight of her body, and the scent of her sex. He could have stayed right where they were for the rest of his sorry-ass life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he knew it was getting close to dawn.</p><p>\u201cElise? You awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmm?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cAs much as this kills me, it\u2019s got to be almost six a.m. You better go home.\u201d</p> <p>She lifted her head off his pec. Her eyes were sleepy in the dying firelight, her lips swollen from his kisses, her cheeks still flushed.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay here, too. But do you think that\u2019ll help your situation? It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned and became very quiet for a while. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I came early, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by much. Besides, you\u2019re welcome anytime, all the time. I never lock up. Just come in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got here before midnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He passed his palm up and over her shoulder. \u201cAnd again, I don\u2019t give a shit. Move in if you want.\u201d</p><p>Holy fuck, did he just say that?</p><p>\u201cI was upset. And I had nowhere else to go.\u201d</p><p>All at once, his protective male instincts fired up, his fangs descending, his body going back on the alert in spite of its injuries. \u201cWhat happened? And who do I need to kill.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was only partially kidding on that last one.</p> <p>At least she smiled a little. But it didn\u2019t last. \u201cI, ah ... well, I told you that my cousin was killed? You remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I went into her room. After you left? I didn\u2019t really plan on it, it just kinda ... it was where I ended up. And I went into her closet\u2014I was cleaning things up in there. It was such a mess. Such a mess ... clothes everywhere, shoes ...\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything further, he stroked her shoulder. \u201cTalk to me, Elise. And know it goes in the vault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I trust you. It\u2019s just ... so ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know from ugly. I\u2019m not scared of it.\u201d</p><p>Her breath left her on a shudder. \u201cMy cousin, Allishon, and I? We weren\u2019t alike at all. I mean ... the polite word for her was promiscuous. Her clothes weren\u2019t like mine. She didn\u2019t think like me. She didn\u2019t behave as I did\u2014and she reveled in being the wild one. She was beautiful and out of control, and I always had the feeling that she enjoyed sticking it to her parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked that road,\u201d he said remotely. \u201cIt\u2019s good for nobody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe if there had been more time? I don\u2019t know. Maybe she would have changed.\u201d Elise exhaled in a rush. \u201cAnyway, I was in her closet\u2014and I was cleaning up the mess. My aunt came in and surprised me\u2014I mean, I haven\u2019t seen her since the night Peyton came to tell them about the murder. She looked ... so bad. Sickly. Horrific. As if she had aged a thousand years, been starved and beaten.\u201d</p><p>Axe repositioned them, rolling over onto his side and cradling her face-to-face. \u201cWas she grateful for what you were doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d Elise\u2019s eyes got a faraway look to them. \u201cShe said ... the most hateful things about her daughter. It was all about image and the family\u2019s position in the glymera. She was angry and bitter about the fact that there was shame upon her. She was upset that she wasn\u2019t getting invited ... to parties. It was the most extraordinarily selfish display I\u2019d ever seen\u2014and I just keep thinking, Well, of course Allishon acted the way she did. With a mahmen like that?\u201d</p><p>Axe ground his molars as anger choked him. \u201cSelfish mothers are the worst. That shit\u2019ll do a number on you.\u201d</p><p>Like, oh, say, a female who would desert her hellren and child for the money of the glymera. Yup. Read that book, saw the movie, bought the T-shirt, the insulated coffee mug, and the Blu-ray. Poster over his bed, too.</p><p>But he kept quiet about all that. They were focusing on Elise, and damn him, he really wanted to listen to what she was saying.</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cI was so upset after I left her that I ran downstairs and out of the house ... and I threw up on the front lawn. And then I just kept going, down to the bottom of the hill, out onto the road.\u201d</p><p>He imagined her careening through the night, her heart breaking, no one in her family understanding where she was at or really even caring.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you came here. And I wish I had known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for not being mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Peyton to tell me what happened to Allishon. I\u2019m meeting him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Axe had to regulate a spike of unease. Because that bastard had better STFU on the subject of bodyguards.</p><p>\u201cI have to find out the truth.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI need to know and I\u2019m not sure I understand why that\u2019s so important. The death isn\u2019t reversible, nothing will change by my knowing what transpired. But my brain can\u2019t let it go and I\u2019m not going to fight it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re just going after the series of events because you can\u2019t get the real answers you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike ...\u201d Axe cleared his throat. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t ask your father what he really feels about the death. Maybe there are other things you\u2019d like to know about him. What he thinks about your mother\u2019s passing. What he worries about night to night. Maybe he\u2019s unreachable.\u201d Axe thought about his own father down in the cellar with those blocks of wood. \u201cMaybe you want to know what he actually feels about you. But you know that\u2019s never going to happen. You\u2019re never going to be close. He\u2019s always going to be focused elsewhere. And the shitty thing is, though ... that just because you\u2019re aware of all that, doesn\u2019t mean the searching goes away. And you can only sit with that for so long before you go crazy.\u201d He shifted his eyes from Elise ... but then refocused on her and shrugged. \u201cSo you\u2019re looking for facts as a way to get close to him, because that\u2019s what people do. They go to the wrong places for things they can\u2019t get in the right ones.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she just stared at him, he felt like a royal idiot.</p><p>She was getting her Ph.D. in psychology for fuck\u2019s sake.

Until she prompted, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Axe kissed her, but then moved back. \u201cYou probably should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right. If I\u2019m going to spend the night with you, I want it to be on honest terms. And that is not going to happen over the phone with my father\u2014and not just because I left that GPS-riddled cell of mine at home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he kicks you out, you can stay here with me. And I\u2019m only half joking about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very sweet.\u201d</p><p>The snort he let out was an ugly sound, the kind of thing that he tried to keep down, but couldn\u2019t catch. And yes, she laughed at him\u2014which made him resent the noise less.</p><p>But then Elise sat up and, tragically, began putting her clothes on. When she was back in order, she knelt down and pulled one of the blankets over his nakedness.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay here alone? I\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf what we just did together didn\u2019t kill me, I guarantee you I\u2019ll make it to sunset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him and then went over to the fire, restoking it for him.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d She smiled at him over her shoulder as she poked at the logs she\u2019d added. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking hotter than what\u2019s going on in that hearth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to ask when I\u2019m going to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got an easy answer for that. Four a.m. tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better believe it.\u201d He wadded an old sofa pillow up under his head. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re home safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Where\u2019s your phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... shit. I have no idea. Probably back at the training center with what was left of my clothes. And I don\u2019t have a landline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell ... I\u2019ll be fine. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, long pause.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he told her. \u201cSo I know you\u2019re safe before the sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded and then she was gone, the front door closing behind her quietly.</p><p>In the wake of her departure, he thought, God ... the house was so empty.</p><p>THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>The following evening, as Elise got dressed to go to see Peyton, her thoughts were on Axe, not either of her cousins. She was worried about him having been okay through the day. How his wounds were doing. Whether he\u2019d let the fire go out and turned himself into a Popsicle.</p><p>He had to get that heating system at the cottage fixed. The weather was going to get a whole lot worse before it improved. In, like, May.</p><p>The problem was, it felt a little too stalkerish for her to just show up at his house and be all, Hey!, just wanted to see if you\u2019re still breathing! Besides, in the middle of their sexual marathon, he\u2019d mentioned that he had to get his stitches out at the clinic, and surely if he failed to turn up there, someone would go looking for him.</p><p>Right?</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d she said as she left her room\u2014with her phone and its GPS tracker going strong.</p><p>She had skipped First Meal. There was just no way she could sit between her father and her uncle and make small talk, not only considering what she had done with Axe, but also in light of what she\u2019d seen in her aunt the night before: Even with all her schooling and self-actualization, she wasn\u2019t capable of shelving that much emotion.</p><p>Maybe she was her sire\u2019s daughter after all, not wanting to share.</p><p>Down on the first floor, she knocked on the closed door to her father\u2019s study. When she heard his greeting, she opened it and went in. He was at his desk, in one of his suits, looking like a posed Dunhill model.</p><p>For an ad in Life magazine, circa 1942.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Father.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his paperwork. \u201cOh, hello, dearest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, I\u2019m going over to see Peyton, son of Peythone? His sire and his mahmen will both be there. The purpose is to discuss Paradise\u2019s birthday party? It is coming up and he and I will be planning a small event, at his home, in her honor?\u201d</p><p>For the first time in so long, Felixe actually smiled. Really, truly smiled. To the point where he even had to put his gold pen down on the blotter. \u201cOh, darling, I think that is marvelous. I think that is just splendid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would be pleased.\u201d With effort, she kept the judgment out of her voice. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how long it will take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do enjoy yourself. I shall see you at dawn, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father.\u201d</p><p>With a brief bow, she exited, the center of her chest aching because she would have loved to have had that reaction from him to her studies, her work, her real plans. But no, he was happy she was throwing a party.</p><p>She told herself it was just his way, his generation, all he knew. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But it hurt to be minimized.</p><p>Outside, she realized she forgot a coat, but it didn\u2019t matter. Closing her eyes, she coasted off the estate, riding a surge of relief across the cold air.</p><p>Peyton\u2019s mansion was not far away, and every bit as grand as the one she lived in, just of a different style. His family\u2019s manse was a Tudor, with all kinds of cupolas and angles and fun rooms inside\u2014not that she was all that familiar with the place.</p><p>As she approached the front door, it was opened by a butler who wore the same uniform as the head doggen at her house.</p> <p>\u201cMistress, welcome. Master Peyton is up in his room. He requests that you wait in the library for his arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d she said as she followed along into a huge room filled with leather-bound volumes, heavy, medieval furniture, and enormous brass chandeliers.</p><p>With all the tapestries and the oil paintings and the way footsteps echoed on the gray slate floor, it was like something out of Harry Potter, just sans the owls and the wizard wands.</p><p>How anyone felt at home in it was a mystery, but then, the glymera cared more about impressions than comfort. And it was impressive.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for something to drink?\u201d the butler asked her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d The butler bowed low and backed out of the room. \u201cHe shan\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Before she could even pick a spot to sit, her phone went off, and she answered it on the first ring with a frown. \u201cPeyton? I\u2019m downstairs. What? Ah ... yeah, no, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care.... Sure. Where ...? Okay, right.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, Elise went across to a second set of oak doors and slipped out. Tracking the hallways through the back of the house, she found the pantry, got the bag of Doritos her cousin had asked for, and hurried up the staff stairs to the second floor. After ducking into a laundry room for a maid to pass, she jogged down\u2014</p><p>Peyton was hanging out his door, one arm locked on the jamb, the other swinging free as he waved at her. \u201cHey, girl!\u201d</p><p>He had no shirt on, satin PJ bottoms, and the mental functioning of a microwave oven.</p> <p>Great. Just what she\u2019d had in mind, damn it.</p><p>\u201cPeyton,\u201d she muttered as she came up to him. \u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery. And stoned. And wait ... I think I did some cocaine about two hours ago? But the buzz has mostly worn off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here is your sodium delivery system.\u201d She handed the bag over and glared at him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. We\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that going to happen. You\u2019re slurring your speech so much, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re speaking French. Or is it Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more likely to spill if I\u2019m drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re drinking, you mean. As in out of your glass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, Elise. Gimme a break, will you. You think this is going to be easy for me?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she crossed her arms. But then cursed and stepped around him, entering his suite. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t need to be intoxicated to talk about things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and a bag of chips will get you lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he muttered as he shut his door.</p><p>His room was the size of a football stadium, it seemed, with a sitting area kitted out with sofas and chairs like a living room, a TV with a screen as big as a movie theater\u2019s, and a bed that, naturally, was king-size but round. The decor was done by Grey Goose\u2014as in bottles of vodka. Which were empty\u2014oh, no, wait, over there by the open bathroom, there were eight fresh, unopened ones.</p><p>And of course, you could do laps in his Jacuzzi, she thought as she looked into the marble expanse. Who knew those kinds of tubs came in Olympic-swimming-pool?</p><p>\u201cWill you do me a favor and put a shirt on?\u201d she said as she turned back to him.</p><p>Peyton had stretched out on his bed, and crossed his feet at the ankles, his hooded eyes the kind of thing that might have set a female\u2019s pulse racing a little\u2014if they didn\u2019t know Axe.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t been with Axe.</p><p>Weren\u2019t going to be with Axe again soon.</p><p>Nothing compared to her tattooed male.</p><p>\u201cWant to join me?\u201d Peyton drawled, running his hand in a circle on the monogrammed duvet. His pillows were monogrammed, too, as was the great canopy of cloth that hung from a gold crown on the high ceiling.</p><p>But the grandeur made sense. He was the equivalent of a prince, the high-bred son of a Founding Family, the heir to great wealth, one of the race\u2019s most eligible bachelors.</p><p>And he was also a looker, what with that blond hair and those blue eyes that were the stuff of fantasies.</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me no?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not used to no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cSo did your bodyguard call you up and brag about what he did last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did not\u2014and I\u2019m going to do you a favor right now and tell you to shut up about him. If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, then I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention anything? I find that hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned. She was not interested in playing hide-and-seek with a drunk for information, but if it was about Axe? \u201cSo what did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved the life of a Brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSingle-handedly.\u201d Peyton\u2019s eyes drifted to the TV screen across the way and the football game that was on it. \u201cReal live hero stuff. The Brother Rhage, literally, would not be alive tonight if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Axe, even after having been shot himself, managed to put his own body in the way of a knife\u2014while a lesser was on his back, beating him with a steel whip.\u201d</p><p>The world spun around and Elise threw out a hand to steady herself. When there was nothing to catch her fall, she stumbled over to the foot of that palace bed of his and sat down.</p><p>\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d Peyton said softly, his eyes getting a faraway look to them. \u201cI saw it happen. We were stationed on different streets, but there were suddenly slayers everywhere. I followed mine right to the alley Axe was fighting in\u2014just as he got himself stabbed. I thought ... I really thought Axe was dead, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say a thing,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Peyton reached over to the bedside table and picked up a tumbler that was full of ice and something fizzy. He took a long drink, emptying a good quarter of the thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything close to that.\u201d Peyton took another drink. \u201cMaybe he is the right male for your job, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has been ...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cPerfectly professional. Were you hurt last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No one else was seriously, either. It was like Axe took all of our injuries at once.\u201d</p><p>Peyton fell silent and so did she ... while across the way, that football game played on, humans in the stands dressed in blue-and-orange and red-and-white.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked numbly. \u201cOn the screen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Iron Bowl from \u2019thirteen. Auburn\u2013\u2019Bama. Auburn wins with a one-hundred-and-nine-yard kick back run. War Damn Eagle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue. It\u2019s the Auburn fight song. Our vet, who is human, went to school there? So that\u2019s how I started rooting for them about twenty years ago. Habits, you know.\u201d</p><p>Peyton finished his drink, then added, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Axe didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he cares about showing off.\u201d</p> <p>Peyton laughed. \u201cYeah, he doesn\u2019t give a shit about much.\u201d Abruptly, the male grew serious. \u201cSo you want to know about Allishon, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said after a long moment. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>It really wasn\u2019t rocket science.</p><p>As Axe leaned into the mirror over the sink in his bathroom, he wiped the condensation from the shower off the glass with his forearm and then picked up the pair of fingernail scissors he\u2019d found in the cabinet. Twisting around, he got his torso at the right angle and went to work.</p><p>Pushing the small, sharp-tipped blades under each one of the shit ton of sutures, he went snip, snip, snip ... then he used a pair of tweezers to get the knots of thread out. Repeated on his thigh. Checked to make sure he didn\u2019t have any others anywhere. Nope. Clean. And everything had healed so well, the scars were nearly invisible. By dawn, no one would ever know he\u2019d been hurt.</p><p>His body wasn\u2019t stiff, either. Eyesight and hearing were perfect. No headaches, muscle pulls, joint discomfort.</p><p>That Chosen blood was a thing.</p> <p>Well, that and the fact that after Elise had left, he\u2019d passed out\u2014and shit, had he dreamed of her, vivid, erotic fantasies playing in his mind to the point where, when he finally woke up, he reached out as if she were beside him.</p><p>And what do you know, for the first time in recorded history, he had no interest in going to The Keys. What he was actually into was getting back home in time to see Elise at four a.m. But he\u2019d promised to take Novo out\u2014and while they were at the sex club, he was going to put her up for membership so that she didn\u2019t have to ask him anymore.</p><p>She was a female who could really use a place like that.</p><p>And who knows. Maybe he was transitioning out of that phase in his life\u2014</p><p>Axe stopped himself, a low-level anxiety threatening to break through and ruin his fantasy of what the night was going to be like.</p><p>God, for some reason, he saw those figurines of his father\u2019s, those impotent little exercises in mourning.</p><p>With how much he was becoming attached to Elise already, was he just going to end up like his pops? In ruins when the relationship ended ... likely because Elise recognized where she properly belonged.</p><p>In the glymera, with her kind.</p><p>Shit, he\u2019d known her for how long? Fuck ... five nights? And he\u2019d seen her for the first time six nights ago?</p><p>Refusing to meet his own eyes in the mirror, he double-checked that the now-sutureless wound on his thigh wasn\u2019t bleeding. Inspected the stabbing area. And got in the shower.</p><p>Ten minutes later, he was dressed in black with his cloak and his skull mask on. Dematerializing to the west, he re-formed in a vacant parking lot that was about a three-minute walk from the club. Novo was already where they\u2019d agreed to meet.</p><p>And holy fuck.</p><p>That just about covered it: The female was in a black latex bodysuit that fit every curve and straightaway she had, a fringe belt hanging off her tight hips, her breasts looking like a million bucks, her legs long as highways. Her black hair was braided and her thigh-high boots were spiked, and she looked like exactly the kind of badass she was.</p><p>Her mask was not on, however, and her eyes went on a travel up and down his body. Not sexually, though. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re alive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Axe walked up to her. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? To do this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat.\u201d</p><p>Novo\u2019s arms shot out and she gave him a stiff, hard hug that ended almost as soon as it began. And as he cleared his throat from some kind of non-sexual feeling, he thought, Well, what do you know. Poor folks have something in common with rich ones: He had absolutely no interest in talking with Novo about the night before, and not because he didn\u2019t like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you survived,\u201d she said, as gruffly as if she were a male. \u201cAnd I\u2019m impressed as hell at what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Now let\u2019s drop it. You\u2019re clearly good to go tonight, not that I expected anything less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p> <p>Novo put her own mask over her face, the featureless panels for her eyes and the black mesh for her mouth leaving her with an alien vibe.</p><p>Axe walked off, his black combat boots eating up the pavement, Novo moving beside him with the same deadly grace she always did. As they went along, an ambulance rushed by with its lights bubbling, its driver pumping a siren as the vehicle came up to an intersection with a light. Then there was a snowplow, one of the ginormous muni ones that were orange and had a dump truck\u2019s worth of salt in the back. And then they saw two humans, a pair of males, hustling down the opposite side of the street like they\u2019d just scored drugs and were in a hurry to get their fixes.</p><p>The Keys, from the outside, was nothing but an urban garage, its front building flat, uninteresting, and seemingly not that big. Bullshit. The club was actually a series of connected facilities, all engineered to flow one into another through a series of covered passways.</p><p>There was only one entrance, but there were multiple exits, always before the next section.</p><p>Shit got more hardcore the further you went in.</p><p>No wait line for him. As he approached the guards\u2014who were dressed as if they were patrons, just with something red on somewhere\u2014he flashed his superior key, and they nodded him and Novo right in.</p> <p>Moody music. Smoke machines. Purple lasers shooting through the darkness.</p><p>A crowd of mostly humans with masks and latex and leather clothes milling around. Women in Lucite boxes, their poses contorted so their sexes were offered to whoever wanted them in whatever way they chose. Men strapped facedown, ass-up, to the floor. Glory holes. Pits of naked bodies twisting and turning, limbs upon limbs. Suspensions. Lashing and lickings.</p><p>And this was only the beginning.</p><p>Axe just kept walking forward slowly, the crowd parting for him, getting out of his way. Which suggested that humans had better senses than vampires gave them credit for: These rats without tails may not have known exactly why he was different and not to be fucked with, but they were careful around him.</p><p>As they entered the next building, the beat of the music changed, the bass line becoming all-pervasive, like hot steam being pumped into a cold room.</p><p>The men liked Novo. So did the women.</p><p>Novo, on the other hand, was hard to judge. She seemed to float above it all, that faceless mask of hers panning left and right.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d he asked over that heavy bass.</p> <p>With any other female, and also most males, Axe would have cautioned them that what was coming was going to make these introductory rooms seem tame. But he didn\u2019t worry about her.</p><p>\u201cAnything that isn\u2019t blond and male,\u201d she replied in a voice that was synthesized.</p><p>Axe smiled. \u201cReally, you don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t go any further with it, he just shrugged and continued onward. As he progressed, there were a couple of regulars he recognized, either from their masks or their bodies\u2014and he was looking for one in particular.</p><p>\u201cI want you to meet somebody,\u201d he said as they transitioned into another dim room that had more moans than music.</p><p>Bodies were writhing in a pit in the center, a naked woman getting covered by men, her cries of ecstasy triumphant even though she was the one being consumed.</p><p>\u201cI want to meet somebody, too,\u201d Novo said in that electronic voice of hers.</p><p>\u201cNot for sex. You\u2019re going to apply for membership.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re prepared to vouch for me\u2014\u201d With lightning-quick reflexes, Novo spun around, caught a masked male by the throat, and pile-drove him back against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the woman in the pit, asshole,\u201d she bit out. \u201cYou touch my ass one more time and I\u2019m going to rip your hand off and feed it to you. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>As the idiot nodded like a bobblehead, Axe hung around and waited to see if she was going to castrate the SOB on principle.</p><p>And when one of the staff closed in, Axe cut the intervention off. \u201cNon-consensual, repeated. And she\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>Axe had watched that human male ride up on Novo a couple of times as they\u2019d gone along, but it hadn\u2019t been for him to have an opinion. The main rule of the club was, Everything Goes. Although the second rule was just as important: Consent Required.</p><p>Axe would have gotten involved if he\u2019d known she hadn\u2019t been into it.</p><p>The staff nodded. \u201cRoger that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want to put her up for membership. Her name\u2019s Novo.\u201d</p><p>All humans who worked for the owner were called Staff. No first or last names, ever. And the only reason you knew who they were was the way they approached you and the fact that they always had something red on. Well, and he recognized their scents after having been a member for the last couple of years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGimme ten,\u201d the staff said. \u201cKeep going and I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>By this time, Novo was letting the aggressor resume breathing, dropping her arm and falling back in.</p><p>\u201cYou done here?\u201d Axe asked.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p> <p>They kept going, entering the next room, and the one after that ... until they eventually got to the Cathedral. With its tall ceiling and mounted, altar-like formation high above the floor, this was where the public displays happened\u2014and where he had fucked that human woman almost a week ago.</p><p>There was an event happening now, a male suspended up high, two other males taking turns with him\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou were better six nights ago,\u201d a Scottish accent said.</p><p>Axe turned to the male who had addressed him. The human was six-six, maybe six-eight, wearing leathers and not much else, his pierced nipples glinting in the low light, the tattoos running down his arms and across his chest representing classic album covers, everything from the Sex Pistols to G N\u2019 R to the Ramones and MCR. His mask was classic Grim Reaper stuff and he was wearing a pair of New Rocks that were the biggest Axe had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cAnd you lasted longer, too, mate.\u201d</p> <p>With that, the human moved on, which was kind of a bummer. Axe had liked the guy\u2019s vibe.</p><p>\u201cSo you went up there?\u201d Novo asked. \u201cTied up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t the one on the rack.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cFigures. I don\u2019t see you as the submissive type.\u201d</p><p>Neither did he. Which was why he found being powerless with Elise\u2014and getting off on it like he did\u2014such a surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want a blond,\u201d he asked to change the subject.</p> <p>\u201cI hate rich blond assholes.\u201d</p><p>Axe stopped and looked at her. \u201cPeyton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, not a fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not his type anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, he\u2019s not mine.\u201d</p><p>Novo resumed her stride, her shoulders tense, her back ramrod straight, her affect one where she seemed to be grabbing someone by the balls\u2014at least in her head.</p><p>Axe fell in step with her. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted him\u2014\u201d</p><p>She spun around, and in spite of the covers over her eyes, he could feel the burn coming right at him. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you do. Come on, like I give a fuck?\u201d</p><p>Novo got up in his face. \u201cI\u2019m glad you brought me here. But don\u2019t try to be my shrink, k? It\u2019s not going to work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy be so defensive? You think I\u2019m going to go second grade on you and start skipping around the class, singing the kissing song or some shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Axe. Back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know about him and Paradise, huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t. If he were any more into that female, he\u2019d be inside her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Craeg would slaughter him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least Peyton counts as grass-fed organic meat with the way he smokes up.\u201d She looked away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not into him\u2014so there\u2019s that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Axe put his palms out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say anything.\u201d</p><p>Novo looked up at the sex that was going on at the altar. \u201cSo you did that, huh? I was unaware you were into public displays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was, then.\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly what she was doing, demanding inside his head because he had momentarily gotten into hers. \u201cJust burning off energy. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made an impression on the crowd, obvi.\u201d</p><p>A member of the staff came up to them, a different guy from the one he\u2019d spoken to. \u201cYou Novo?\u201d</p><p>Novo squared her jaw and met the human male straight in the eye through her mask. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want in, you and your sponsor come with me now.\u201d</p><p>Novo glanced at Axe. \u201cYou\u2019re seriously putting me up?\u201d When he nodded, she shrugged. \u201cGood, and thanks.\u201d</p><p>The two of them fell in line behind Staff, and as they moved through the crowd, Novo said under her breath, \u201cAnd you know the management. Impressive.\u201d</p><p>Axe just shrugged again. \u201cI aim to please.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>As Rhage and Mary sat in front of the Christmas tree in the library, with all its twinkle and glimmer and unopened gifts, Rhage was mourning the loss of what he had hoped would become of his shellan\u2019s favorite human holiday. He had had such a wonderful time planned for their little family, all those presents they\u2019d been collecting ever since Bitty had come to stay with them finally being unwrapped by the girl and enjoyed.</p><p>There was so much that Bit needed, and more than that, so much Rhage had wanted to give her.</p><p>And he\u2019d also put some surprises under there for his Mary. Not that she would approve.</p><p>His shellan was a minimalist\u2014or maybe it was a necess-isist. She didn\u2019t like fancy jewelry or cars or clothes. She liked her Kindle and the books she got on it ... all of which had no pictures and little tiny writing and words he had never heard before in them. She didn\u2019t collect anything, she preferred to wear her shoes until they fell apart, and her handbags were functional, not a fashion expression.</p><p>Guess that was what happened when you became fully actualized as a person: You didn\u2019t have to worry about being defined by anything other than exactly who and what you were. No binge eating or drinking or gambling. No sexual dysfunction. No credit card debt for things you couldn\u2019t afford but were determined to have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was beautiful\u2014and frustrating if you wanted to shower your mate with presents.</p><p>With Bitty\u2019s arrival, though? He had been looking forward to a new receptacle for his gifty exuberance.</p><p>Nothing had been touched under the tree, however.</p><p>Even though Christmas night had come and gone, the presents remained unopened, not just his and Mary\u2019s and Bitty\u2019s, but the whole household\u2019s. The gifts were just sitting there, a visible representation of joy that had been rerouted into fear and sadness.</p> <p>Hell, if those precisely wrapped boxes and their sloppy, gloriously misshapen compatriots had been fruit, they would have been decayed and fly-ridden, their previously perfect paper skins and satin bows eroded into rot.</p><p>\u201cShe loves Nalla,\u201d Mary commented.</p><p>There was only one \u201cshe\u201d between them. No need for a proper noun.</p><p>\u201cShe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBella appreciates the help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd Bitty is earning a little money.\u201d</p><p>They were each speaking in flat tones, not because they didn\u2019t care, but because they desperately wished they were free to care\u2014</p><p>The scent of Turkish tobacco was the first clue. The heavy falls of shitkickers heading their way was the second.</p><p>Both he and his Mary jerked off the cushions. And Rhage knew that for the rest of his life, he was going to remember that paneled door swinging open and the birthed son of the Scribe Virgin striding in.</p><p>Vishous was back from South Carolina early.</p><p>And what do you know, it was impossible to read that goateed, tattooed face. Mostly because the brother was drinking Grey Goose right out of a bottle.</p> <p>V kicked the door shut behind him and came right over. As he sat across from them, he replaced the vodka at his lips with a hand-rolled\u2014which at least gave Rhage a little more surface area to try and tea-leaf the Brother\u2019s expression.</p><p>No luck, but given that those diamond eyes were sharp as knives and not meeting his?</p><p>Yeah, he knew where this was going before V opened his piehole.</p><p>\u201cHe checks out,\u201d the Brother said. \u201cHis whole story.\u201d</p><p>It seemed kind of symbolic that Vishous was blocking the view of the presents under the tree, the Brother\u2019s big body a physical manifestation of the reality that the gift of Bitty in their lives was being seriously road-blocked.</p><p>V continued after another swig from the bottle. \u201cWho he says he is. Where he\u2019s from. Who his parents were\u2014Bitty\u2019s grandparents\u2014and the fact that they\u2019re both dead. I also met with people at his household of employment\u2014he\u2019s worked there for decades, reliable, good employee, never a slacker. Lives alone on the estate, keeps to himself. Widely known in the community that his sister, Bitty\u2019s mom, disappeared up North with a bad guy against the wishes of her family.\u201d He glanced at Mary. \u201cNobody knew about Bitty\u2019s existence until you posted what you did on Facebook, and it took time for word to filter to him because he\u2019s not online at all.\u201d</p><p>Rhage could feel the tension in Mary\u2019s body increase with each sentence, sure as if she were being pounded on by fists. On his side, he wanted to roar, but who exactly was he going to yell at? V, the messenger? Bitty\u2019s uncle?</p><p>Who had done nothing wrong except come forward when he learned his niece was out in the world alone as an orphan?</p> <p>The Christmas tree?</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cuz all that tinsel was really going to give a shit.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>V sat forward and tapped his ash, his black-gloved hand a badass contrast to the delicate and lovely Herm\u00e8s ashtray. \u201cI asked Ruhn to come down to South Carolina and meet me late last night. He did. He took me personally to his house, even though his employer had already let me in. He was willing to introduce me to anybody and everyone. He\u2019s well liked, if, again, a loner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut is he ready to take care of her?\u201d Mary blurted. \u201cA child is ...\u201d</p><p>As she trailed off, she put her head in her hands. \u201cOh, what am I saying. Blood trumps everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to the fitness thing,\u201d V said. \u201cThat\u2019s way above my pay grade. So Marissa is\u2014\u201d</p><p>A knock on the library door made Rhage jump, but it was just Marissa coming in, the female walking over, hugging Mary, sitting with V, talking about some kind of plan for assessing something or another and deciding ... whatever the fuck.</p><p>In Rhage\u2019s mind, he retreated far, far away, his eyes shifting back over to the Christmas tree and lingering on the way the lights twinkled in the deep green branches, and how the shiny foil of some of the presents reflected the golden flicker of the fire.</p><p>\u201c... Rhage?\u201d Mary prompted.</p><p>He shook himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with everything? That we go to the Audience House and meet him there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sure.\u201d</p><p>Everybody stared at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any questions?\u201d Mary said gently.</p><p>Rhage refocused on the gifts. \u201cCan I still give Bit what I got her for Christmas before she goes?\u201d</p><p>One hour later, Mary and Rhage pulled into the Audience House\u2019s driveway and eased on around to the back garages. As Mary tried to collect her thoughts, Rhage parked the GTO, turned off the powerful engine and the headlights ... and then together they sat there, staring at the row of hedges that he had nosed the muscle car into.</p><p>I have no idea how to do this, Mary decided.</p><p>For the entire trip from the Brotherhood\u2019s mountain to town, she had been searching for some emotional footing, some perspective, some ... anything ... to carry herself through looking Bitty\u2019s rightful next of kin in the eye and not completely breaking down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So far she had come up with nothing.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Rhage said.</p><p>There was the temptation to try to be strong for him because she knew he was hurting as much as she was. But honesty won out over a lie.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked across at him. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>And that was the best and only foot forward there was, wasn\u2019t it: The simple words they shared were a vow on both their parts to get through this together, a reaffirmation that just as they had been side by side going into the joy of having Bitty in their lives, they would likewise go through the pain of losing her side by side.</p><p>Together, they got out and shut the doors, and Mary lifted up the fleece she was wearing and retucked her turtleneck into her waistband. As if somehow having a smooth presentation would impact anything at all.</p> <p>Hell, Ruhn didn\u2019t have to like them or approve of them. The male wasn\u2019t vetting them in any way.</p><p>No, he was just going to take their daughter away\u2014</p><p>Mary stopped herself right there on that one.</p><p>As Rhage held open the back kitchen door, she walked in and reminded herself that Bitty only felt like their daughter. Legally, that was simply not the case. And in a classic head-wins-over-the-heart situation, reality wasn\u2019t going to vote with emotion.</p><p>V had already dematerialized over and was waiting for them at the table Rhage had done such a number on. \u201cMarissa\u2019s in there with him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mary said.</p> <p>When Rhage faltered, she took his big hand. \u201cWe\u2019re ready when he is.\u201d</p><p>Vishous nodded and got to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll come back when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>Cue an awkward period of waiting ... which Rhage spent prowling around from cupboard to cupboard, taking out bags of potato chips, boxes of cookies, loaves of bread, jars of pickles. He always ended up putting whatever it was back after an inspection, as if he wanted to nervous-eat, but his stomach wasn\u2019t finding anything appealing.</p><p>Or even tolerable.</p><p>After God only knew how long, V put his head in through the flap door across the way. \u201cThey\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Talk about the longest walk of her life. As she and Rhage went past the pantry, and out into the foyer, and then around the base of the stairs and down a little hall, it seemed to take forever\u2014and Mary was good with that.</p><p>They were entering the new reality as soon as they saw that other male.</p><p>As they came up to the library doors, both sides were closed and V knocked once. When Marissa answered, the Brother opened things up ... and Mary found herself blinking a lot and staring at the floor.</p> <p>And then somehow, she was in the room.</p><p>As with the Brotherhood house, there was a fire crackling and first editions on the shelves ... and nicely arranged furniture ... even a plate of cookies and some tea sitting on a low coffee table. No Christmas tree, though. No hand-wrapped presents. No Bing Crosby playing.</p><p>And there he was.</p><p>Her first impression of Bitty\u2019s uncle was that he was just as nervous as they were. His foot was tapping and his arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes bounced back and forth between her and Rhage.</p><p>Her second thought was that he was big. Much bigger than she would have imagined, given Bitty\u2019s size and Annalye\u2019s relatively delicate build. In his clean blue jeans and red and blue flannel shirt, he took up almost all of the sofa he was on, and not because he was fat. He was covered in muscle, clearly a field worker of some kind.</p><p>His hair was dark, just like Bitty\u2019s. His eyes were some flavor of pale brown. Skin was the tone of Rhage\u2019s. Face was ... yes, there were clear echoes of Bitty\u2019s features there.</p><p>Marissa stood up from the chair next to the male. \u201cI\u2019m going to make introductions.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn got to his feet, and yup, he was very tall. And he wiped his palms on his thighs repeatedly as names were traded.</p><p>He offered his hand only to Rhage\u2014which was a measure of respect and showed an awareness of vampire etiquette. Given that she and Rhage were mated, it would have been entirely inappropriate for Ruhn to touch her without express invitation by either her or her hellren.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d he said in a low, soft voice.</p><p>Rhage reached out, and as they shook, Ruhn bowed deeply.</p><p>Then he turned to her and did the same, just without the palm-to-palm contact.</p><p>Mary glanced at Rhage. His face was remote, but his eyes were not so much narrowed with aggression ... as sad with unhappiness.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should all sit down and get comfortable?\u201d Marissa said, indicating various chairs and sofas. \u201cTea, anyone?\u201d</p><p>The female was obviously falling back on her finely bred manners, and it was helpful, filling the silence as Mary nodded about the offer of Earl Grey because she needed something to do with her hands.</p><p>Vishous stayed standing in the far corner, a menacing presence that was a reminder that the rest of the house was empty, all the appointments with the King rescheduled just so they could have this neutral space. He alone was here on guard.</p><p>But you know, he was more than enough to feel safe\u2014</p><p>Except abruptly Mary noticed a figure outside on the back terrace. Z, going by the skull trim. And ... wait, was that\u2014yes, that was Butch at another window on the other side.</p><p>Undoubtedly, other members of the Brotherhood were elsewhere, remaining unseen\u2014and she drew strength from having family with her and Rhage.</p><p>\u201cSo we all know why we\u2019re here.\u201d Marissa leaned forward with an admirably steady hand, passing a full teacup to Mary. \u201cPerhaps someone would like to say what\u2019s on their mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everybody looked at her, including the uncle. Which gave her an idea that maybe Ruhn was not unfamiliar with what she did for a living.</p><p>Mary cleared her throat and decided to cut through the bullshit. \u201cBitty is our primary concern. Her health, well-being, and happiness is the only thing we care about\u2014but of course, we respect your bloodline tie.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn looked down at his hands. They were heavily callused, the forearms exposed by those rolled-up sleeves, veined and thick with muscle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet her.\u201d His voice was soft, quiet ... totally unaggressive. \u201cMy sister ... it\u2019s hard for me to believe she\u2019s gone. And seeing Lizabitte would be ...\u201d</p> <p>As he trailed off, Mary frowned. It was a surprise to feel compassion for the male.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I let my sister down.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cLiving with that is a curse ... I mean, I tried to find her when she came up here. But I didn\u2019t have many resources\u2014I still don\u2019t, and she disappeared with that male. I knew he was going to kill her. We all did.\u201d He cleared his throat, and his tone deepened, grew stronger. \u201cLizabitte is the only part of my sister left\u2014and doing right by that young is fulfilling the duty I failed at to Annalye.\u201d</p><p>Mary swallowed hard as Ruhn met her straight in the eye, and concluded, \u201cThere is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for that young.\u201d</p><p>THIRTY-SIX</p><p>Peyton didn\u2019t stop talking. And as Elise sat at the foot of his bed and listened, the picture that emerged of her cousin\u2019s alternate life was both overwhelming and not a surprise.</p> <p>\u201cWait, so what is this club?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s downtown, it\u2019s called The Keys. I\u2019ve never been to it. The shit that goes on there is not my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Allishon was a member of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She used to go there when she, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe what? When did she go?\u201d</p><p>Peyton\u2019s baby blues gave her a don\u2019t-be-daft stare, but when he saw that she honestly didn\u2019t get what he was saying, he shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cShe should have been more like you.\u201d</p><p>Elise winced, thinking that, given where she was headed at the end of the evening, she doubted she was half the paragon of virtue Peyton was giving her credit for.</p><p>\u201cWhy did she go there?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cLook, Allishon was always on the hunt for something new.\u201d Peyton reached for yet another Grey Goose bottle and poured some more into his tall glass. The ice cubes had melted long ago, but he hadn\u2019t seemed to notice\u2014or maybe he just didn\u2019t care. \u201cShe was always searching. And a lot of the time, she found it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she was drinking and doing drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd having sex.\u201d He cursed as if he didn\u2019t want to go into it all. \u201cShe was fucking in public. With lots of different humans in lots of different ways. It was what she got off on\u2014the real hardcore shit. And that club is where it happens in Caldie. She went there a lot.\u201d</p><p>Elise couldn\u2019t help but recoil at the thought of a place like that. Nothing she could handle, that was for sure.</p><p>No, she was into monogamy. With Axe, specifically.</p> <p>But she didn\u2019t judge, and again, she\u2019d known that Allishon had different tastes than she did: \u201cSo ... she went there, and someone found her and hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnslam found her and killed her, you mean.\u201d</p><p>Elise covered her mouth, her eyes popping wide. \u201cWait, Anslam\u2014as in, hold on, our Anslam?\u201d She\u2019d known the male all her life. \u201cBut he was in the training program, wasn\u2019t he? I heard he died during a mission. That\u2019s what my father told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what happened.\u201d Peyton stared across at the football game. \u201cNot even close. You sure you want me to go into this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnslam was ... hurting women and females ... and taking their photographs while doing it. He hooked up with Allishon at some point, I don\u2019t know when, exactly\u2014neither of them said anything to me. And you know, clearly, something went down between them....\u201d Peyton trailed off, his head lowering, his voice going so soft, she could barely hear what he was saying. \u201cI went to her apartment downtown after no one had heard from her for several nights. That\u2019s when I found ... how badly she\u2019d been hurt. What had been done to her.\u201d</p><p>At that point, he choked up, and Elise had to force herself to give him space to get control of his emotions\u2014she had the sense that if she tried to console him or hug him, he was going to pull out of whatever he was remembering.</p><p>Peyton cleared his throat. \u201cThere was a lot of blood. On the sheets\u2014I mean, the bed was stained with it. There were footprints of the stuff across the carpet, and the red smudges of handprints on the sliding glass door to the terrace. She didn\u2019t die in the apartment, however. Somehow, she was able to dematerialize out of there. She was found on the lawn of Safe Place, that domestic violence shelter? She was in bad shape. They didn\u2019t know who she was\u2014took her to Havers. She passed there. But again ... until I went to her apartment nights later, they didn\u2019t know who she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. She must have been in so much pain.\u201d</p><p>Elise closed her eyes. \u201cAnd it must have been very hard for you to find all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he clipped out.</p><p>Of course, he said this as he was pouring more liquor down his throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d Peyton continued, \u201csee, one of those photographs fell out of Anslam\u2019s pack on the bus to the training center and Paradise found it. She was the one who put the whole thing together\u2014and Anslam tweaked to the fact that she knew too much. He went to her house and attacked her\u2014nearly killed her, too. But she and Craeg took care of business. He died in her foyer. When they found even more photographs on him, it all ... came together.\u201d</p><p>Elise rubbed her eyes. \u201cMy father ... when you came over that night, what did you tell him and my aunt and uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fucking painful. Her parents were ... frozen. I\u2019ll never forget it\u2014they didn\u2019t show any ... they were just emotionless. It was the shock. Clearly. Your father was the one who cried. Later, the Brotherhood visited them, after the rest of what happened came out. \u2019Cuz when I told them she had died, we didn\u2019t know who had done it yet.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s eyes teared up, as she pictured her father emotional.</p> <p>\u201cI think her parents blamed Allishon,\u201d Peyton muttered. \u201cLike it was her fault for getting herself killed. And you know ... I felt like she was murdered all over again, with that attitude of theirs. I mean, someone offed her because they didn\u2019t recognize her rights and humanity, but then putting it all on her? You do that all over again. And Christ, it\u2019s her own parents.\u201d</p><p>As they both fell silent, it was as if a pall settled in the suite.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was better not to speak of this,\u201d Peyton muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I disagree completely.\u201d She got to her feet and stalked around until she was right in front of the huge screen. Different teams were playing football now, the uniforms red and black and blue and white. \u201cI think we need to talk about it. Not just as a family, but as a community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is the Fade ceremony?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there is going to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to be buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was cremated. But I think that\u2019s as far as it\u2019s going to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still pray for her,\u201d Peyton murmured, holding his glass up. \u201cBlessings upon her soul, may she rest unto the Fade, that kind of shit. Usually when I\u2019m drunk, which has been most of the time lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about speaking to a therapist?\u201d Elise said as she turned back to him. \u201cThis is a lot to hold in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNFW\u2014I\u2019m going into the business of war. If I can\u2019t handle blood and death, I might as well get out now\u2014and I\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re talking about a family member\u2019s death here. It wasn\u2019t the enemy.\u201d</p><p>Peyton just shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you need someone, I\u2019m always here.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in an absent way. \u201cYou know ... I\u2019m proud of you, Dr. Elise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d She blushed. \u201cAnd by the way, I don\u2019t have my doctorate yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need one. Actually a friend of mine recently taught me that females are just as good as males.\u201d</p><p>As that smile of his faded, she got the impression he was sad. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one special.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a lie, Elise thought. But she respected the boundary.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you ... I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since he joined The Keys, Axe sat back and watched the action from the sidelines.</p><p>Novo was still in with Staff: Axe had left her alone in the interview room after giving the boys in red a synopsis of the human story she had concocted as a cover. Which made him think ... he didn\u2019t even know how old she was, who her people were, what her background actually was. He had his suspicions that a lot of it hadn\u2019t been great.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t because she liked the same kind of sex he did.</p><p>Or the sex he\u2019d used to be into.</p><p>The truth was, though, you could be perfectly well-adjusted and still like the fucking that happened here. That was what people outside of this lifestyle or whatever you wanted to call it didn\u2019t understand. Yeah, there were folks running from shit. And folks who were fucked in the head. And maybe a couple of sociopaths. But the vast majority of members were good to go.</p><p>Hell, Tinder wasn\u2019t any different. eHarmony. Blind dates, office set-ups, bar-crawl meetings. You name it, you were going to find a mix of good and bad\u2014</p><p>A woman with bared breasts and a long leather skirt swanned by, her white hair piled up high on her head, her steampunk headgear making her look like the twenty-first century had gotten into a cage match with Victorian England\u2014and the remnants of the conflict had fallen all over her face.</p><p>She paused in front of him. Her nipples were covered thanks to two metal disks that were held in place by piercings, a delicate chain running between the tips.</p><p>Axe had been with her a number of times, once at the altar, then in other situations. He didn\u2019t know her name or her number. But he was well familiar with her sex.</p><p>On any other night, he would have gone somewhere with her.</p><p>But now, he was just counting down the minutes until he was meeting Elise\u2014and no one here, or anywhere else on the planet, was going to come close to what was waiting for him at the end of the evening.</p><p>He shook his head and she nodded and moved on.</p><p>\u201cNot your type?\u201d Novo drawled.</p><p>Axe looked over. The female had emerged from the back, and he hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d returned. \u201cYou want to go hang for a while? Or call it a night and come back?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If he remembered the way new membership worked, you had to wait awhile before you were approved.

After all, even if Ruhn had had money, there was no way he lived in as safe a house or environment as Rhage and Mary did.</p><p>Because, hello, the two of them bunked in with the First Family.</p><p>And Ruhn was single, not very educated, and had no experience with kids of any age.</p><p>So, yeah, Rhage had come into this library ready to fight.</p><p>But instead ... he found himself sitting across from what appeared to be a tragically calm, respectful, and reasonable male. And wishing the entire time that he could find fault with something\u2014anything\u2014about Bitty\u2019s uncle.</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d Marissa said gently\u2014there had been a lot of gentle prompts from the likes of her. \u201cI think the next step ... is for you, Ruhn, to meet Bitty.\u201d</p><p>Rhage bared his fangs and then quickly hid the flash of dental art.</p><p>Mary spoke up. \u201cHow do you suggest we proceed with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it should be supervised, but not by either of you,\u201d Marissa murmured. \u201cI just believe it\u2019s best for the two of them to have an introduction where Bitty\u2019s allegiances are not divided. She\u2019s going to want to align with you and Rhage out of loyalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has she been with you?\u201d Ruhn asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo months,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Rhage opened his mouth and spoke up before he could think. \u201cBut it feels like a lifetime. We love her like she\u2019s our own, and she feels the same about us and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mary elbowed him in the side.</p><p>And helllllo, sound of crickets.</p><p>\u201cNo one is doubting your love,\u201d Marissa said. Again, gently.</p><p>Rhage burst up and marched around. \u201cWell, good. Because it\u2019s there and it\u2019s going nowhere.\u201d He glared at Ruhn. \u201cAnd even if you take her away from us, we\u2019re still going to love her. She\u2019s still going to be in our hearts and our heads. Just so we\u2019re clear, you leave with her and go back to wherever the fuck you\u2019re from? There is not going to be a night that she\u201d\u2014he pointed to Mary\u2014\u201cand I aren\u2019t going to think about her, wonder how she\u2019s doing, worry about her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRhage,\u201d Mary said. \u201cRhage, calm down\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of the guy. \u201cAnd I want you to remember this. If you ever hurt her\u2014\u201d</p><p>V closed in, grabbing Rhage\u2019s biceps. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s roll back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I will field-dress you while you\u2019re still alive and eat your heart out of your chest\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a sharp whistle, and all of a sudden, Z and Butch were both in the room, coming in through the French doors. As they got in front of and behind him, he realized he\u2019d been wrong. He\u2019d assumed they were there to prevent an outside attack.</p><p>With those doors unlocked as they had been? Clearly, folks had been a little more concerned with an inside killing, with him as the aggressor.</p><p>And Rhage had to give Ruhn some credit. Instead of shrinking back in the sofa like a pussy ... or going on a preemptive strike ...</p><p>The male simply rose to his full height and sank into a defensive stance.</p><p>Just as he had two nights ago.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the goddamn fucking uncle said as Rhage felt himself being moved out of range. \u201cHe can hit me if he wants.\u201d</p><p>That stopped everyone in the room.</p><p>V looked at the guy. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mention you had a fucking death wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I want it in his file that he has very poor risk assessment,\u201d Vishous muttered dryly.</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d Rhage demanded. \u201cI\u2019m not going to light him up. I\u2019m just telling it like it is.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly, that was not very persuasive, as his brother-bodysuit stuck with him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you feel that way,\u201d Ruhn said, \u201cbecause it means you\u2019ve treated her well while you\u2019ve had her. Which is more than her sire ever did.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, why did the SOB always say the right thing?</p><p>Mary cleared her throat. \u201cI think I would like Rhage and I to be the ones to tell Bitty. I want to make sure this is framed correctly. I don\u2019t want her to feel as though she is being wrong or bad if she wants to see him, be with him ... go with him.\u201d She focused on Ruhn. \u201cYou, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Ruhn\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t shift from Rhage. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really what\u2019s good for her.\u201d Mary pushed her hair back behind her ears. \u201cAnd that\u2019s all that matters. On that note, we should probably get going. Rhage and I should go tell her in person and then ... first thing tomorrow night? And this is neutral but safe territory\u2014if we can put off the King\u2019s appointments for another evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done,\u201d V declared.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Ruhn said as he reached into his pocket. \u201cBut, um, can you give her this for me? You can read it first, of course. It\u2019s just ... I wanted to introduce myself. I can\u2019t read or write, so I dictated it.\u201d</p><p>Something must have changed in Rhage\u2019s body, because suddenly he was on his own again, the holds on him released\u2014not that his brothers went very far.</p> <p>Mary\u2019s hand shook as she took what turned out to be a couple of pages of lined paper that had been ripped out of a spiral notebook, the frayed edges fluffing up one side of the otherwise neat square.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be happy to give this to her,\u201d his shellan murmured.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, you can read it. There\u2019s nothing much to it. It\u2019s not, like, well written or anything. I just wanted her to know who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the last page is, just, you know, nothing special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>Things kind of petered out at that point, Ruhn sitting back down and staring into the fire. Mary coming to stand next to Rhage, her arm linking through his.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other thing,\u201d V announced as he addressed the uncle. \u201cThe King wants to meet you. Before you can see Bitty, you will be required to sit in his presence.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn nodded slowly. \u201cAll right. Whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>But the guy was obviously not looking forward to it. Because he had something to hide? Rhage wondered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be in on that,\u201d Rhage said. \u201cI will be in on that audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrath wants it private.\u201d V shook his head. \u201cAnd by that, he meant without you or Mary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really should be just between the two of them.\u201d Mary stroked his arm. \u201cWhen will that meeting occur? We should wait to speak to her until it happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can sit in if he wants.\u201d Ruhn shrugged as all eyes swung back his way. \u201cI have nothing to hide. I mean, I\u2019m just a nobody, and I\u2019m used to my lack of status. No reason to have airs if you\u2019ve got nothing to back them up with, and if all you\u2019ve done is live a simple, honest life? That\u2019s the kind of thing you can explain even to a King, with a straight back and a level eye\u2014no matter who else is in the room with you.\u201d</p> <p>Rhage blinked. And then had a horrible thought.</p><p>Fuck, under other circumstances, he might have liked the guy.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate that, Ruhn.\u201d Again, Marissa with her gentle way was easing things. \u201cBut it is better if it\u2019s just you and Wrath. And a guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrath said he could come here now,\u201d somebody interjected.</p><p>\u201cThen we should go.\u201d Mary looked at Rhage. \u201cLet\u2019s just go, all right? And we\u2019ll hang out somewhere and wait for word about the meeting with Wrath before we head home.\u201d</p><p>Someone said something\u2014Marissa. And then Mary was talking. After that, people started nodding like there was some kind of consensus happening.</p><p>Then it was time to leave\u2014and Rhage put his arm around Mary\u2019s waist as they walked to the double doors. They paused as Z did the duty of letting them out.</p><p>Just as Rhage was stepping from the room, he glanced over his shoulder. Ruhn was still sitting on that sofa in front of the fire, the mostly untouched tea service in front of him, his hands lying on his thighs, his eyes unfocused.</p><p>He was nervous. But he wasn\u2019t backing away.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>Next thing Rhage knew, he was behind the wheel of the GTO, the engine was on, and the heater was going.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get something to eat?\u201d he asked, even though he wasn\u2019t hungry.</p><p>\u201cSure. Let\u2019s go to that twenty-four-hour diner you like. The one with all the different kinds of pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Annnnnd so, some ten minutes later, he was parking between a heavy-duty pickup truck and a BMW. Snow was swirling in the air again, but not heavily\u2014as if maybe the clouds above had separation anxiety and were reluctant to let their flakes fly.</p><p>The All-Nighter, as the place was called, was your standard diner, with a blinking sign outside and a row of bar stools at the counter inside. There was an annex that had tables, and waitresses who were bored and hostile, and a loyal clientele of which he was a member. On the menu? Free coffee, pie that was to die for, and breakfast around the clock\u2014as well as a Reuben that could make you see God every time you bit down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His normal table was in the back by the emergency exit, and the waitress who worked the night shift jerked her head in that direction.</p><p>Which was her way of saying, Hey, good to see you again. Your favorite spot\u2019s open, and I\u2019ll bring you your coffee ASAP. Oh, and glad you brought the wife with you this time.</p><p>Given everything that was going on, the lack of cheerful interaction was a serious bene.</p><p>He and Mary took their seats. Coffee was served in heavy mugs. Rhage got the banana cream, Boston cream, and a slice of apple. Mary got a second fork for sampling.</p> <p>Before he dug in, he put his phone right out on the Formica tabletop. Just in case, you know, reception was bad in the pocket of his leather jacket.</p><p>They sat in silence, that cell with its unlit screen between them like a fucking black hole in space, sucking all matter and energy into it.</p><p>Mary sipped her coffee. Left that fork where it was on the folded-up paper napkin. From time to time, she looked around at the mostly empty tables.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I like about this place?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe pie?\u201d he said between bites. Which were all texture, no taste tonight.</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes. But it\u2019s so bright in here. Usually, at night, everything is dim. I never really noticed this until I came to live with you and started doing the night-is-day, day-is-night thing. Like, for some reason, humans tend to make the insides of all restaurants dim after sundown. Here, though, it reminds me of what it\u2019s like to be out during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you resent the changes?\u201d he asked, wiping his mouth. \u201cYou know ... in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Her eyes swung over to his. \u201cI have you, and that makes everything better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this situation with Bitty, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could make that any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo right.\u201d</p> <p>He pushed the banana cream plate away with half the slice still on it. He didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d ordered the damn thing. He wasn\u2019t a big fan of bananas, and even with the crunch of the graham cracker crust, there was a uniformity of texture between the custard and the cream that kind of made him gag.</p><p>It was the reason he couldn\u2019t do key lime. Or chocolate mousse ...</p><p>God, he was really hurting, wasn\u2019t he. If he was debating desserts in his head.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t like that?\u201d Mary remarked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. But I thought I\u2019d try something new.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cuz this was a night to expand your horizons. Or maybe try out the theory that there was a keep-your-daughter god who required you to override your gag reflex as tribute.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been here to eat so many times,\u201d he said as he pulled the apple in for a landing. \u201cFor years and years. And I never thought it was going to be part of our story, you know?\u201d</p><p>Because sure as hell, he was going to remember exactly where they were sitting now and what he was eating and how Mary looked until he was dead.</p> <p>\u201cI know exactly how you feel,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>As he set to work on his number two, he looked around at the other people, the two over there by the window, the three spaced out evenly on stools at the counter.</p><p>Who the fuck knew what was going on in their lives, good or bad. After all, there was a tendency to assume that the anonymity of strangers translated into calm, clear slates for their lives, but that was just bullshit. Everyone had drama. You just didn\u2019t know what it was if you didn\u2019t know them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they say about life?\u201d he muttered. \u201cNobody gets out of this alive?\u201d</p><p>Bing!</p><p>They both jumped, him dropping his fork on his plate, her splashing coffee out of her mug.</p><p>He leaned into his phone, entered his code, which was Mary\u2019s birthday, and waited for the cell to cough up the text. \u201cWrath says it\u2019s a go. We can proceed.\u201d</p><p>They both straightened and sat there for a moment.</p><p>Then, without words, he took two twenties out of his wallet, she mopped up what she\u2019d spilled, and then they were making their way to the exit.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to do this, he thought as they stepped outside.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to look that little girl in the eye and tell her to go meet her uncle.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to ever let her go.</p><p>In the GTO, he turned to Mary. \u201cI love you. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep thinking I\u2019m going to wake up, and take a shuddering breath ... and become crazy-relieved that this was all a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Rhage paused to give reality a chance to hop on that train.</p><p>When nothing changed, no alarm went off, no elbow from Mary nudged him awake ... he cursed, started the engine, and headed out.</p><p>To have an impossible, lose-lose conversation with his daughter.</p><p>THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>\u201cSo where are you going?\u201d Peyton asked from his reclining pose on his bed.</p><p>As Elise felt a flush hit her face, she hoped he was too drunk to notice.</p><p>\u201cI just want to clear my head.\u201d She took her phone out of her pocket. \u201cSo you\u2019ll answer this if my father calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing Axe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now.\u201d It was the closest she could get to any truth. \u201cI\u2019m not going into the university tonight. I really need to get my head straight and that is not going to happen if I go back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll ask again. Where are you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not sure. But I\u2019ll be safe, promise.\u201d</p><p>Peyton raised a forefinger. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going that it\u2019s especially important to have your phone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot if it has a GPS tracking program in it that your father had installed. Not if you don\u2019t want to get peppered with questions the instant you get home. Not when you simply want to take a deep breath and not get in trouble for it.\u201d</p><p>Peyton sat up off his pillows and then got to his feet. As he walked over to a table that ran along the back of the sofa, he weaved like there was a stiff breeze blowing around him.</p><p>\u201cTake mine, then. The code is oh-four-one-one. It\u2019s only so you have something on you\u2014and I\u2019m not naive. I won\u2019t push you, but you\u2019re obvi not going home at dawn. Just be safe, okay?

It\u2019s called warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. I swear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me regret this,\u201d he muttered as he opened a window for her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Elise gave him her own code and put his phone in the pocket of her coat. Then, with a quick hug and a final wave, she ghosted out of his suite, leaving him to his human football games and his bird vodka ... and the shadows that haunted him.</p> <p>Talk about not going far. She rematerialized out in the gardens of his estate, just so she could do what she had said and breathe a little. Snow was swirling around, not really getting organized into a proper fall, and the wind was bitter. As she looked over her shoulder at the Tudor mansion, she could see Peyton moving around in his bathroom, his blond hair catching the lights, his bare torso so powerful, she thought for a moment that he didn\u2019t look like an aristocrat anymore. He looked like a soldier.</p><p>Burrowing into her coat, she knew it was too early to go to Axe\u2019s. He\u2019d told her the door was always open, but ...</p><p>When the idea came to her, she didn\u2019t immediately dematerialize. After thinking things through, however, she ghosted out ...</p><p>... and re-formed downtown, at the foot of a fancy high-rise.</p><p>Stepping back so that she was in the middle of the empty street, she counted the floors. The address on those papers she\u2019d found in Allishon\u2019s closet had listed an apartment number of 1403.</p><p>\u201cDid you forget your key?\u201d</p> <p>Elise glanced to the left. A human female with an open face and an easy manner was on the sidewalk in front of the entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to see my cousin,\u201d Elise said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t answering the buzzer. She\u2019s on the fourteenth floor?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was into honesty\u2014but technically it was true: Allishon wasn\u2019t going to be answering anything, ever again.</p><p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d The woman started for the door. \u201cYou can ride my coattails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Elise followed her into the lobby and made small talk by the elevator, and then on the ascent. The female got off on the fifth floor and Elise made the rest of the trip by herself. When the ding! announced she was on the right level, she got off and looked both ways. A little placard with apartment numbers on it pointed her to the left and she walked down the carpeted hall, passing countless doors.</p><p>When she got to the right one, she raised her hand to knock, but then dropped her arm\u2014because, really? Reaching out, she tried the doorknob, and of course, it was locked.</p><p>Well, this was a great plan.</p> <p>Placing her hand on the painted panels, she just stood there, replaying what Peyton had told her. In a sad way, she felt closer to her murdered cousin than ever before\u2014even though it was too late for them to have a relationship.</p><p>God ... she really wanted to get into this apartment, she thought.</p><p>And yes, Axe was correct. She was looking for a connection to her father, to her family, in the only avenues that were open to her. It was an imperfect quest, to be sure. But she wasn\u2019t going to stop.</p><p>Not until she had gone down every path\u2014</p><p>As Peyton\u2019s phone went off in her pocket, she frowned and took it out. It was Peyton from her own cell.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said as she accepted the call.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend called.\u201d Peyton exhaled like he was smoking up. \u201cYou could have just told me.\u201d</p><p>Axe had called? \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy. Your boyfriend? I told him you were out, that I was your cousin, and I asked if I could take a message. He wants you to call him. Guess he\u2019s been trying to get ahold of you. Elise, what the hell are you doing ... that is not a vampire name.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say we were dating, though, did he. Because we\u2019re not. He\u2019s my professor and I\u2019m his teaching assistant. I have no intention of ever getting involved with him. He\u2019s the reason I need Axe.\u201d</p><p>Well, one of them. And the only one she could bring up in mixed company.</p><p>Hell, to anybody.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful,\u201d Peyton said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cAlways. Now, will you please stop smoking and drinking and start sobering up? At this point, you\u2019re going to need a month to get back to normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo right. Have a good night\u2014but call me if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>As she hung up, her surroundings suddenly became clear to her. She was alone, in the human world, in a place where her cousin had been murdered.</p><p>The hall with all of the doors had seemed perfectly safe, but as the elevator dinged and a human male stepped free, Elise suddenly felt unsure of herself. If he decided to attack her with a weapon? Would anyone help her? And no one knew where she was other than Peyton\u2014and going by the way he\u2019d slurred his words, he was about two puffs away from passing out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise put the phone up to her ear and made like she was speaking to someone. \u201cOh, really? And then what happened?\u201d</p><p>Walking onward, she kept her eyes on the carpet and the human who was approaching her in her peripheral vision. He didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in her presence.</p><p>One benefit to wearing jeans and a long, puffy coat was that her body was totally hidden.</p><p>Still, she tensed up as they passed ... but he simply kept about his way and so did she.</p> <p>And then she was on the elevator, going down.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait to get to Axe\u2019s place.</p><p>Rhage was not in a big hurry to get home. But the distance from the diner to the Brotherhood mansion didn\u2019t change, and he was, as always, a very efficient driver.</p><p>Too soon, he and Mary were walking into the foyer.</p><p>Going by the laughter, they knew where Bitty was ... and they found her in the billiards room. Bella was on the sofa, and their girl was playing hide-and-seek with Nalla among the pool tables.</p> <p>Bit was so carefree, darting from one place to another, moving quickly, but not so fast that Nalla couldn\u2019t catch her and feel the triumph of winning from time to time. For clothes, the toddler was wearing a jumper with a big strawberry on it, her yellow eyes sparkling like sunshine, and Bitty had on one of Mary\u2019s blue fleeces, the thing so big, it flopped around her arms and torso.</p><p>As he and Mary watched the playing, the scent of their sorrow was so thick, his nose filled with the acrid burn of it\u2014and Bella must have caught the stinging smell, because she looked around sharply.</p><p>Her face went from hopeful to resigned.</p><p>\u201cGirls,\u201d the female said as she got to her feet. \u201cI, ah, I think it\u2019s time for Nalla\u2019s bath. And Bitty, your parents need to talk to\u2014ah ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d the girl said as she saw them. \u201cHow are\u2014\u201d</p><p>She frowned. Straightened from her tickling crouch. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I don\u2019t have to go back to Havers\u2019s, do I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, honey.\u201d Mary walked forward and gave Bella a brief hug. \u201cBut we need to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rhage nodded at Z\u2019s shellan as Bella scooped up her young and disappeared with sadness. \u201cNot at all. You want to sit down with us, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>And then the three of them were on the leather sofa that faced the big TV, Bitty in the middle. On the screen over the fireplace, an episode of Seinfeld was muted. It was the one with Kramer\u2019s Junior Mint ending up in the surgical patient. One of Rhage\u2019s favorites.</p><p>He felt like smashing the television to pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhat is going on? You\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>Rhage cleared his throat and looked at Bit. When he came up with a big, fat nothing, he had to get to his feet and pace around. It was either that or find a baseball bat for that redeco job.</p> <p>Mary picked up the slack, like she always did, and he hated the way he let her down. But her voice was admirably steady.</p><p>\u201cHoney, do you remember ... when you were talking about your uncle?\u201d his shellan said. \u201cYou know, right after your mahmen went unto the Fade. You told me he was coming for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t really think he would.\u201d The girl\u2019s beautiful brown eyes went back and forth from Mary, who was beside her, to Rhage, who was making a lap around the nearest pool table. \u201cI\u2019d never met him. I was just ... hoping someone wanted me. And then you two did and everything is okay now. I have my home.\u201d</p><p>Mary took a deep breath.</p><p>And when she stalled, Rhage knew he needed to man up; he couldn\u2019t leave this all for Mary to handle. Walking over, he knelt down in front of the girl.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, he contacted us. See, Mary tried to find him for you before you came to live with us, because it was the right thing to do. When there were no responses, we were sad for you, but happy for us.\u201d</p><p>Bitty frowned and edged back from him. \u201cWait ... he\u2019s here. He\u2019s alive?\u201d</p><p>Mary nodded. \u201cHe is and we just met him. He seems very nice and very sincere. And he\u2019s really interested in meeting you.\u201d</p><p>That frown on the girl\u2019s face became deeper and she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to. I want to live here with you guys, and the Brothers and Lassiter. Nalla, L.W., and Boo and George. This is my home.\u201d</p><p>Rhage rubbed his face. \u201cHe\u2019s your family, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitty,\u201d Mary started. \u201cHe\u2019s your mother\u2019s brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bitty burst up from the sofa and wheeled around on the both of them. \u201cThis is because of my arms and legs, isn\u2019t it. You guys don\u2019t want to deal with a kid who might be a cripple after their transition. You don\u2019t want me anymore because I\u2019m broken\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all!\u201d</p><p>But the girl wasn\u2019t hearing either one of them. \u201cYou want me to go away! Fine! Just throw me out!\u201d</p><p>With that, Bitty ran out of the room. And damn it, he and Mary were right on her tail, scrambling in her wake as she hit the foyer and kept on going.</p><p>\u201cBitty, stop!\u201d Mary said as they all headed for the grand staircase and started a frantic ascent. \u201cBitty, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on\u2014\u201d</p><p>The girl stopped halfway up and turned around again. \u201cYou don\u2019t love me\u2014you never loved me! You don\u2019t care\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rhage\u2019s voice thundered out of him, exploding so loudly, it nearly shook the house: \u201cLizabitte! You will not address your mahmen in that tone of voice!\u201d</p><p>Hellllllllllllllo, inner father, he thought numbly.</p><p>And yup, that shut everyone up. Froze the females where they were, too.</p><p>Even made some poor doggen outside of Wrath\u2019s study drop her duster and duck for cover.</p> <p>And apparently, he wasn\u2019t done laying down the hammer.</p><p>He took the steps two at a time until he was on Bitty\u2019s stair, and leaned down so that they were eye to eye. \u201cI understand you\u2019re upset. We\u2019re upset, too. This was not part of the plan we had for any of our lives\u2014but this is where all four of us are at. He seems like a nice male and he is your blood and you should meet him. I don\u2019t blame you for being emotional, and Mary and I are going to support you through all of this. But I will not have you ever thinking that we don\u2019t love you like you were our own. You are not defective. You are perfect and smart and a blessing to everyone who knows you. And we will love you forever.\u201d</p><p>There were so many other things he could say: You\u2019re the only child we\u2019ll ever have. I am dying on these steps just like my Mary is. We are going to be nothing without you.</p><p>But that was grown-up stuff. Things that he and Mary were going to have to work through.</p><p>They were not Bitty\u2019s problem and he was not going to make them her concern.</p> <p>Abruptly, the little girl burst into tears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you guys....\u201d</p><p>Mary wrapped her arms around Bitty. And Rhage wrapped his arms around both of his females.</p><p>As a unit, they sat down in the middle of the grand staircase ... and cried.</p><p>THIRTY-NINE</p><p>Axe ended up leaving Novo at The Keys after she found a likely candidate\u2014in fact, it was that human woman Axe had been with a number of times, the one with the nipple piercings and the Cruella de Vil hair. Knowing that his fellow trainee was in good hands\u2014namely, her own\u2014he nodded at her, pointed to the exit, and got a nod in return.</p><p>For the first time in recorded history, it was a relief to get home\u2014and damn, he was in a hurry to get clean. The second he walked in the front door, he dumped his black cloak on the back of a chair, and went directly to the shower.</p> <p>Even though he hadn\u2019t had sex or even touched anyone, he wanted to scrub every inch of his body before he saw Elise.</p><p>The hot water and all the soap was a godsend, and he spent a lot of time with his head back under the spray, the delicious rush pouring down over his face and his chest. He was just about to step out when he sensed he was no longer alone in the cottage. Sure enough, a soft knock sounded out.</p><p>He started to smile. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said through the closed panels. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you downstairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t reach my back.\u201d He pushed the shower curtain aside. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d</p><p>The door opened little by little, and then there she was, her lovely face peeking around the corner, her blond hair down, her cheeks flushed from the cold ... or maybe she was thinking about the same kinds of things he was.</p><p>Axe\u2019s erection was instantaneous, and he kept himself facing her as it rose.</p><p>Even though there was hardly any light, he could tell where her eyes went\u2014and stayed.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like what you see?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYes....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come in here. The water is warm.\u201d</p><p>Elise stepped in and shut things closed behind herself. In the cramped, steamy space, she took off her sweater and her shirt. Peeled those jeans down her long legs. Lost her bra ... then her panties.</p><p>As he moved back for her to join him, she lifted her lips so he could kiss them at the same time she put her hands on him.</p><p>And not as in on his shoulders or his biceps, his stomach or even his ass.</p><p>Axe arched so hard, he threw his head into the back wall of the shower. \u201cFuck\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I care?\u201d</p><p>With a guttural sound, he kissed her, his hips jerking as her grip restrengthened, the sex surging between them, going from a low-level burn to a solar flare in a split second. And he was not gentle with her. Desperation made his hands rough as he yanked her against him, and his mouth was brutal on hers, and his need went out of control.</p><p>But dearest Virgin Scribe, she matched his desperation with a starvation of her own.</p><p>\u201cI want you so bad,\u201d he groaned against her lips.</p><p>\u201cSo take me now.\u201d</p><p>Even though her thighs were slick from the warm water, he grabbed them and popped her up, fitting her around his hips. Then he found her core with his fingers\u2014she was so ready for him\u2014and oh, yeah, she took charge, reaching between their bodies, taking his erection and\u2014</p><p>He cursed again as he found home. She gasped his name.</p><p>And then he pumped furiously into her, banging her against the shower wall, going in deep. She took everything he had to give her, holding on to his shoulders and squeezing her legs around his pelvis as tightly as she could.</p><p>Axe gritted his teeth as the smooth, hot hold of her got to him on all his levels. But he wasn\u2019t orgasming first. He wasn\u2019t going to go before she did, because how she felt was more important than what was going on for him. And soon enough, she started bucking against him, her head kicking back, her arms clenching.</p><p>Her sex tightening against him.</p><p>Holy hell, she was milking him so well that he let himself go flying, too, releasing into her, filling her up, her wet hair whipping him in the face, his body feeling like she was surrounding him all over even though they were connected in only one place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A really fucking important place, granted.</p><p>When the first wave was over, Axe eased her down from him until her feet caught her weight and she was standing on her own.</p><p>Smoothing her wet hair back, he cradled her face in his palms. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered as he kissed her in a much more civilized way. \u201cSo I\u2019m glad you came\u2014I mean ... you know ... are here to ... shit. I\u2019m just happy to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p> <p>Her smile was a little shy, and he loved the contrast between how hot she was and how demure she could be.</p><p>As he went after her again, he took his time with the kisses, lingering at her mouth, plying her with his lips, licking at her with his tongue. The steam boiling up around them was like a soft summer breeze, the winter\u2019s cold breath\u2014like any other reality aside from the two of them\u2014locked out of this sacred space.</p><p>Her breasts were just as perfect as he remembered, and as he lowered himself to his knees, he came up right at her nipples, sucking at them as he kneaded her ass ... and then dipped his hands between her legs.</p><p>She cried out his name as he touched her, her fingers dragging through his wet hair as that warm spray continued to fall all around them.</p><p>When he put one of her legs up onto his shoulder, she fell back into the corner of the shower, gasping and going on a shiver as he nuzzled his way into her sex. With a pumping growl, he lapped at her, teasing her, penetrating her with his tongue, and she ended up bracing her palms against the walls, holding herself upright thanks to the tension he was creating in her.</p> <p>Axe was in heaven.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t intend to return to earth anytime soon.</p><p>As Elise looked down past her breasts and her stomach, it was an erotic shock to see the huge male crammed into the bottom of the shower stall, his hot eyes staring up at her, his tongue licking free of her core, flashing pink before he went back in again\u2014</p><p>Another orgasm racked her body and she ground down on his mouth, working herself against him.</p><p>In response, he came at her with even greater intensity.</p><p>He was possessed and possessing her ... and the erotic pleasure was almost too much for her to handle, the sensations ricocheting through her body, her brain sizzling, her senses on fire.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Sometime later, much later, after he put her up on his hips again and they had more crazy, wild sex, the water started to go cold and that was when they got out together. Axe only had one towel and he attended to her first, drying her off with gentle hands\u2014and as he cared for her body, his face showed a tenderness that all those tattoos and piercings seemed to suggest he would never show to anyone.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s go down by the fire before you have to leave. We need to make sure your hair is dry so you don\u2019t get pneumonia.\u201d</p><p>He made a quick pass over his own body with the totally damp terry cloth and then he told her to wait and left her in the bath. A moment later, he came back with a clean blanket and wrapped her up.</p><p>Scooping her into his heavy arms, Axe carried her down the stairs as if she weighed nothing, and as he set her before the fire, she saw that he had restocked it first so that she would be warm.</p><p>\u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to go,\u201d he said as he stretched out next to her on the blankets.</p><p>Okay, wow ... he was so very naked. Really, very naked ... and even though they had just hooked up in twelve hundred different ways, all she wanted to do was ogle the way his sex lay on his thick thigh muscle.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Shifting her eyes to his, Elise shook her head. \u201cI left my phone at Peyton\u2019s. He\u2019s going to take care of it if my father calls me\u2014and my sire is thrilled about where I supposedly am and what I\u2019m doing, trust me. He thinks we\u2019re planning Paradise\u2019s birthday party.\u201d</p><p>When Axe grew silent, unease rippled through her. \u201cUnless you want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe kissed her into silence. \u201cI don\u2019t want you ever to go.\u201d</p><p>Well ... didn\u2019t that warm her even more than the fire did. Too bad the admission didn\u2019t seem to strike the same chord in him.</p><p>As his eyes went to the fire and his jaw got hard, she touched his face. Ran her fingertips down the tattoos on his neck. Traced over his shoulder.</p><p>Trying to recapture the mood, she whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I met someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA degenerate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>His face got a faraway look to it. \u201cDon\u2019t try to make a hero out of me, Elise. I\u2019m anything but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always been good to me.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, and disappeared even as he stayed right where he was.</p><p>\u201cAxe, why do you find it so hard to believe the good in yourself? I mean ... Peyton told me what you did for the Brother Rhage. You saved his\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d He put his face in his hands. \u201cElise. Please stop.\u201d</p><p>As she laid her hand on his shoulder, he flinched away, and that hurt. But she gave him his space.</p><p>\u201cHelp me understand why, Axe. And I\u2019ll leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for so long, she became convinced he was going to ask her to leave. But then he cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cSo you know that my father was working at an aristocrat\u2019s house on the night of the raids. I told you that.\u201d He paused. \u201cActually, let me go back earlier. You remember that kitchen you liked so much when you came in here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a memorial to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that she passed, too\u2014I had wondered\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019s still alive. Living in a rich gentlemale\u2019s mansion, earning her keep on her back like any other prostitute.\u201d His brows sank so low, his eyes all but disappeared. \u201cSo yeah, my father actually died long before he was killed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe loved her that much,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cOh, Axe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that kitchen. I hate every one of those fucking leaves and the dumb-ass roses he carved for a female who didn\u2019t want him\u2014and Christ, you should see what\u2019s in the basement. My father spent his daylight hours down below, working on all these figurines after my mother left.\u201d The firelight played over features that were harsh with anger. \u201cThat male was fucking pathetic, the way he mourned her. She leaves him and her kid behind, just walks out one night\u2014so disgusted with their life as a family that she didn\u2019t even bother to take any of her clothes or her things. And what does he do? Collapses in mourning. I mean, whatever, he should have just fucked her off and gone about his life.\u201d</p><p>Elise shook her head. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was before my transition. I must have been ten or so. She upgraded us like we were stereo equipment. An eight-track tape player when she wanted to be with an iPod. She never looked back\u2014and my father never looked forward again. He got stuck, always convinced she was going to walk through that door at any moment, say she was sorry, and fall right back into place by his side and mine. He was so fucking deluded, though. Come on. We lived in this shitty little house, with a beater for a car and his rough workman\u2019s hands on her. Her son? I was this scrawny little shit.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I grew up fast after she pissed us away. I wasn\u2019t going to miss her, fuck no. I hated her and I was glad she stayed away. I don\u2019t know where she is and I don\u2019t fucking care\u2014shit, I wish they\u2019d killed her in the raids.\u201d</p><p>Elise took a deep breath. \u201cI can imagine how betrayed you must have felt. Both for her leaving and your father for deserting you as well.\u201d</p> <p>Axe shrugged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave, though. He fed me. Kept a roof over my head. But he was too wrapped up in his fantasy of her and her divine return\u2014\u201d He frowned and focused on her properly. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Taking a risk, she reached out and stroked his arm. \u201cI will never judge you, Axe. You\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep talking and I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p><p>One by one, Axe cracked his knuckles, the huge muscles of his shoulders bunching and releasing as he did. \u201cI took a lot of drugs. After my transition, you know. I just couldn\u2019t stand being here with my father. I hated him, I really did, even though none of it was his fault. He was a good male, a little on the soft side, maybe, but he deserved more than what he got for a shellan. More than what he got for a son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a child. As children, we have to survive, so we contort ourselves into whatever family of origin we grow up in. We are forced to cope and sometimes it\u2019s in ways that harm us.\u201d</p> <p>Axe shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a child when I started going on benders. When I\u2019d disappear for nights at a time. When I froze him out. I ended up breaking his heart as much as she did at the end.\u201d He ground his jaw. \u201cThe, ah ... the night he died? I was out in the city, I\u2019d been high for ... shit, for three, four days at that point, bouncing between cocaine and heroin like the two were a circus ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have saved him,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t even need to know the particulars. But you couldn\u2019t have saved him, Axe. You\u2019ve got to forgive yourself\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe called me. When the attack happened. He left me a fucking message on my cell phone\u2014right when it happened. You want to know how I know what time it was? Because I bumped him to voice mail. And when I saw he\u2019d left me a message? I erased it. I fucking ...\u201d</p><p>Axe looked away, hiding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cAxe, you were not responsible for your mother leaving him. And you were not responsible for his death, either\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they teach in all those psych classes you took?\u201d He sniffed up hard and rubbed his face into the crook of his elbow. \u201cTo placate everyone even though they were wrong and bad? You know, give \u2019em participation trophies just for breathing, even though in reality they\u2019re fucking shitheads who let people down?\u201d</p><p>Elise looked at him steadily and wished he would meet her eyes. \u201cNo, they teach us that self-hatred is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil you learn to let go of the responsibility for your parents\u2019 relationship and choices, you are going to see everything through a prism of blame. And you\u2019re going to eat yourself alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I erased his message.\u201d He scrubbed his face with a hard hand. \u201cThe last thing he said on the planet, I let it go like it was worthless. I\u2019m no different than she was. I left him when he needed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you nearly killed yourself last night to save Rhage? You just had to be there for someone and you weren\u2019t going to let anything stop you?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe find ways of repeating things until we get them right. But that can be dangerous. Especially if we\u2019re trying to fix things we never should have owned in the first place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thinking of herself in front of the door to Allishon\u2019s apartment, Elise wondered if maybe she shouldn\u2019t heed her own advice.</p><p>\u201cAxe, you might just want to consider the radical idea that your mother didn\u2019t leave because of you or your father. She left because of herself. She deserted both of you because of some failing she had. Or maybe it was that she and your father weren\u2019t compatible. Or ... maybe she fell in love with someone else. There are a whole host of reasons why relationships fail. But one thing I know for sure? No child, no matter how they behave, is responsible for keeping their parents together or in a healthy relationship. That\u2019s up to the grown-ups. That\u2019s their job.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time. Then he got up, wrapped a blanket around his waist, and stood over her.</p><p>Shit, she thought.</p> <p>She should have known better than to try and act like his therapist. It wasn\u2019t what anyone needed in a personal relationship, for one thing. For another, she wasn\u2019t trained as a shrink.</p><p>Just because you took psych classes, as he\u2019d said, didn\u2019t mean you were qualified to tell people how to frame their lives.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said sadly as she, too, stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have let my mouth get ahead of me. I\u2019ll just grab my clothes from upstairs in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>FORTY</p><p>As Elise got to her feet, still wrapped in the blanket Axe had given her, he couldn\u2019t find the words he wanted to say.</p> <p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m so pissed at myself,\u201d she muttered as she turned away. \u201cAnd I\u2019m leaving before\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>Looking over her shoulder, she seemed dumbfounded. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to ...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he led her past the stairs, into the kitchen, and over to the cellar door. On so many levels, he couldn\u2019t believe what he was doing. Couldn\u2019t believe what he\u2019d said. Really, totally couldn\u2019t believe that she didn\u2019t seem horrified in the slightest.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t seem to judge him at all.</p> <p>And all of that made him want to go deeper into his past with her.</p><p>Even though that made no sense.</p><p>Opening the cellar door, he kindled the lantern he\u2019d left at the head of the stairs and then led her on a descent down the wooden steps. As the yellow glow fanned out at the bottom, she gasped.</p><p>\u201cHe did all this? Your father?\u201d</p><p>She let go of his hand and walked forward to the shelves of finished figurines. \u201cThese are ... incredible.\u201d</p><p>Axe hung back, aware that, as she inspected the woodland creatures his father had excised\u2014or maybe exacerbated\u2014his grief with, Axe was showing her a part of himself.</p><p>\u201cHe was an artist,\u201d he heard himself say. \u201cA master. And yet he wasted it all just pining away for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you never got mated?\u201d she murmured as her slender hand cradled a rabbit that was up on its haunches with ears pricked. \u201cAre you always worried that the female will leave you and you\u2019ll do what he did?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t ...\u201d Axe shrugged even though she wasn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it a lot.\u201d</p><p>Coward, he said to himself. And what a liar he was.</p><p>That was exactly the reason. Well, that ... and he\u2019d never met the likes of her before.</p><p>Putting the woodland rabbit back next to a deer and a raccoon, Elise came over to him, moving in that lovely way she did. As she put her hands on his upper arms, he jumped at the contact, but didn\u2019t step away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to fix you, Axe. That\u2019s not my business. But if I think you\u2019re off base, I\u2019m going to tell you and then you can do with it what you will. No judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you know all my dark secrets now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m still here, aren\u2019t I.\u201d</p><p>He reached up to brush her cheek and wasn\u2019t surprised that his hand was shaking. \u201cYou scare the shit out of me, female.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather face a thousand lessers than her in a blanket, standing in front of his father\u2019s wall of misery. And yet he wasn\u2019t leaving. And he sure as fuck wasn\u2019t going to tell her to go.</p><p>\u201cIntimacy is scary,\u201d she said as she stroked down his arms, soothing him. \u201cIf you let people in, they can hurt you. In fact, in your case, that\u2019s what you grew up believing was a natural consequence of loving someone. They fail you. You fail them. And everything falls apart. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like that.\u201d</p><p>Axe put his hands on her waist and brought her up against his body. As he stared into her blue eyes, he whispered, \u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flat-out terrified of you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can trust me. I\u2019m not going to desert you.\u201d</p><p>Axe kissed her mouth. Because he wanted to. And because he desperately wanted to stop the conversation. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here. It\u2019s cold.\u201d</p><p>More to the point, he had this superstitious fear that maybe his parents\u2019 bad road was something the two of them could catch. A relationship virus or something.</p><p>Back upstairs, he hurried her into the living room. The sun was coming up soon, and the heaviest drapes were in there.</p><p>Damn, he\u2019d never given it much thought before, but he didn\u2019t feel safe with her here during the day. He wanted them behind steel doors, so sheltered underground from the sun that it was as if that big, glowing death orb didn\u2019t exist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they resettled in front of the fire, lying together, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t done any drugs since the night I found out he was killed.

But he wasn\u2019t going to do that anymore, either. Going back to The Keys tonight had been a revelation in how much he did not need that now that he had the real deal\u2014</p> <p>The sound of a phone ringing across the room made him frown.</p><p>It was his cell. Which Craeg had dropped off for him earlier.</p><p>The thing went silent. Only to ring again.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he muttered as he got up.</p><p>Fishing through the pockets of his cloak, he took the cell out and frowned. Answering it, he said, \u201cNovo? You okay? ... Yeah, I\u2019m fine.... Nah, I\u2019m home. Where are you? ... Are you leaving now? ... Novo, seriously, it\u2019s right before fucking dawn. What the fuck are you doing\u2014huh? ... Yeah, I lose track of time there, too, but Christ, come on. Don\u2019t make me regret getting you in.... Fine. Will you get off the phone and call me when you\u2019re home? Dumb-ass.\u201d</p> <p>He hung up and kept the phone with him as he went back over to Elise and lay down again.</p><p>\u201cSorry. That\u2019s one of my fellow trainees. A real hardheaded hard-ass who\u2019s just about as stupid as I am. I just\u2014you know, I don\u2019t want anyone hurt.\u201d</p><p>Elise nodded. \u201cOf course. Do you want to go see if he\u2019s okay or something?\u201d</p><p>Axe just rolled his eyes. \u201cNovo will be just fine, as long as\u2014\u201d</p><p>The phone rang again and he answered before the ring-a-linging stopped. \u201cWhere are you.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cGood. Don\u2019t stay that late again, okay? You can always go back, just not if you\u2019re fucking dead. See you tomorrow night, asshole.\u201d</p><p>He was laughing a little as he hung up. \u201cWhat a psychopath.\u201d</p> <p>Elise smiled, but it was a remote kind of thing. \u201cIt takes a special breed to do what you all and the Brothers are doing.\u201d</p><p>As Axe recognized that her mood had changed, he wanted to ease her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know where you\u2019ve gone in your head, but I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxe ... I think I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight, Elise thought. Not what she\u2019d expected to come out of her mouth. Like, not even close.</p><p>And as that bomb landed between them, Axe blinked like she\u2019d spoken a foreign language. Which, yup, was precisely the kind of reaction you were looking for when you told a male you loved him.</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d She put her face in her hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just said that.\u201d</p><p>With subtle pressure, he made her drop her arms down. And his expression was ...</p><p>Well, he was smiling.</p> <p>It was a slight kind of thing, not a big flash of the fangs or anything. But it was definitely a small, secret smile, meant only for her\u2014and created, she suspected, only by her.</p><p>Now, that\u2019s what she was talking about, she thought as she smiled back at him.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSend some more sunshine my way just so I\u2019m sure I heard you right.\u201d</p><p>Elise was very aware that she had two paths to choose from. She could deny the words, downplay them, be safe. Or she could let herself fly.</p><p>She picked glorious flight over fright. \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Axe smiled a little bigger and then he was kissing her, his heavy body easing her back on the pallet. With sure hands, he disappeared the blanket between them, and then he rolled on top of her, his hot, hard erection going in between her legs.</p><p>It was the most natural thing in the world to kiss him back and welcome him inside. And there was no frantic pumping this time, just a gentle rolling motion that warmed her first before it lit her on fire.</p><p>As they made love in front of the hearth, she felt like her world was complete: Yes, it was early in the relationship, but with honesty and trust, all things were possible.</p><p>Especially as Axe dropped his head and whispered into her ear, \u201cI\u2019m falling in love with you, too.\u201d</p><p>Elise giggled.</p><p>Yup, she let out a girlie giggle that was more fitting for the kind of female who got her nails done and had streaks in her hair and wore high heels and flirty skirts.</p><p>At the sound, Axe stopped and eased back. \u201cWas that what I think it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my psychology Ph.D. candidate actually\u2014\u201d</p><p>She clamped her palm over his mouth. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid\u2014\u201d</p><p>As he thrust fully into her, Elise arched under his body, pleasure flooding her veins. \u201cAxe ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>He rolled his hips twice. And then stopped. \u201cYou giggled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot fair\u2014\u201d He thrust again and this time she went for his butt with her nails. \u201cFinish what you started!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit you giggled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy!\u201d</p><p>They were laughing so hard, it didn\u2019t matter what they were saying. A buoyant bubble of happiness had engulfed them both, and they were bouncing in the center of the joyful space, free of anything on the outside.</p><p>\u201cFine, I giggled\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In response to her capitulation, Axe got down to business, thrusting into her ... before reaching down, grabbing one of her legs, and stretching it all the way up so she was cocked to the side and he could get in still further.</p><p>Even through her pleasure, she managed to keep her eyes on him. He was magnificent in the firelight, his warrior\u2019s body dominating her, his muscles standing out in sharp relief, the massive veins that ran down his neck and into his arms showing starkly against his tan skin.</p><p>When he bared his fangs, she knew he was going to go for her jugular, and she wanted him there. Turning her head to the side, she bared herself to him\u2014</p><p>The strike was brutal, his fangs going in so deep, she screamed\u2014but not in pain, even though it hurt in a delicious way.</p> <p>This was the marking she had heard about.</p><p>This was the owning of the female by the male, the staking of the claim. And sure enough, he held her in place at the throat with his teeth as he marked her from the inside out by coming into her sex.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t done with her.</p><p>Before she could catch her breath, he pulled out, flipped her over, and yanked her onto all fours. Rearing up behind her, he bit her again, on the other side, and then he was in her once more, taking her from the rear, one hand running up between her slapping breasts and locking on the base of her throat, the other planted on the floor, holding them both up.</p><p>She was facing the fire, and her vision swung wildly with each of his pounding thrusts\u2014the flames jumping this way and that, her hair flying around until some lashed into her open mouth.</p> <p>At some point, her upper body just collapsed onto the blanket, her sex up in the air, his for the taking as he drilled her over and over again, coming so many times, he coated her with his marking scent.</p><p>Elise forgot how many orgasms she had.</p><p>All she cared about was that he never, ever stop.</p><p>FORTY-ONE</p><p>The following evening, when the sun was safely below the horizon, and the temperature was dropping from the twenties into the teens, Rhage found himself once again exercising great self-control.</p><p>He was down in the mansion\u2019s foyer, standing in front of the double doors of the vestibule. No, that wasn\u2019t quite right. He was actually off to one side of them, staring out of the bubbly, antique glass framers that faced the courtyard beyond. Which meant he couldn\u2019t see much.</p> <p>Kind of apt, really, considering he had no idea how this was going to go.</p><p>He sensed, rather than heard or scented, his females upon the great staircase, and he turned around and watched them descend. Bitty was in a red velvet dress he and Mary had bought her in preparation for the human holiday, and the girl had white tights underneath, patent leather black shoes, and a black felt coat that had been made in the Victorian period and passed down through Bella\u2019s family.</p><p>She and Rehv had wanted Bitty to have it, and with its gorgeous satin lining and black velvet collar and cuffs, the thing was certainly made better than anything available at any store today.</p><p>Indeed, Bitty\u2019s outfit was so proper and festive ... but in spite of her pretty clothes, she looked like she was going to the gallows.</p><p>And Mary didn\u2019t appear any better.</p><p>As for him? Personally, he felt like someone had cut off both of his legs and left him to bleed out on the floor.</p><p>But hey, who was comparing?</p><p>As his females hit the mosaic floor and crossed over its depiction of an apple tree in full bloom, he took a deep breath. \u201cYou ready, Bitty?\u201d</p> <p>Dumb fucking question, he thought as she stopped before him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said in a shaky voice. \u201cCome with me? Don\u2019t make me go alone?\u201d</p><p>His hand was trembling as he brushed her cheek. \u201cYou won\u2019t be alone. Fritz is going to drive you in, and Vishous and Zsadist are going to be there waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Actually, V and Z and were going to track the Mercedes all the way into town, the pair of them dematerializing at regular intervals along the route until she arrived safely at the Audience House. And they would have ridden with her, but the concern was that the girl might feel as if her uncle were dangerous if she made the trip in with two heavily armed Brothers sitting on either side of her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d Bitty looked frantically at Mary. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t make me go. What if he takes me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Mary stepped in and smoothed the little girl\u2019s hair. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll be right here, waiting for you\u2014in fact, as soon as it\u2019s done, Rhage will dematerialize right there and he\u2019ll ride home with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will?\u201d Bitty asked him. \u201cYou promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely promise\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I go with you and stay with you the entire time.\u201d</p><p>All three of them wheeled around at the disembodied, synthesized voice. But no one was there, even though it sounded like\u2014</p><p>\u201cLassiter?\u201d Rhage said, as he glanced at all the thin air in the foyer. \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitty,\u201d came that voice. \u201cPut your hand out.\u201d</p><p>The little girl did as she was told\u2014and from out of nowhere, a tiny pool of golden light formed in her palm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s warm,\u201d she said with wonder.</p><p>The light spot traveled up her arm to her shoulder and stayed there, as a bird might have. And then the odd, phantom voice said, \u201cI\u2019ll be with you the whole time. No one else needs to know, okay? Only you\u2019ll know, and your parents will know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage and Mary both winced at that word. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2014and most importantly, you won\u2019t be alone. \u2019Kay?\u201d</p><p>Bitty took a long, slow inhale. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s good. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>A set of headlights flared in those old, narrow-paned windows by the exit ... and sure as shit, Rhage wanted to bust out of the house and scream at Fritz to go away.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Mary said in a strained voice. \u201cBig hugs.\u201d</p> <p>As the two embraced, Rhage stared at that little sun spot on Bitty\u2019s shoulder. It had gotten even smaller, so that it was nearly invisible, the sort of thing that was easily missed.</p><p>He was going to owe the angel big-time for this one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so brave,\u201d Mary said over Bitty\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not brave, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re doing this anyway\u2014which is the very definition of brave.\u201d</p> <p>Mary stepped free and brushed her own hair back. She was glancing away a lot, her eyes shimmering with tears that she was clearly determined not to shed.</p><p>Bitty came over to stand in front of Rhage. Looking up, up, way up at him, she said, \u201cYou promise you\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>He sank down on his haunches, both knees cracking like tree branches from a trunk. \u201cI promise. V will let me know and I have my phone right here.\u201d</p><p>As he showed her his cell, Bitty threw her arms around his neck and he pulled her in close, shutting his eyes and sending a prayer up that this would all somehow magically be okay.</p><p>And then he and Mary walked the girl out through the vestibule, across the stone pavers of the mansion\u2019s entrance, down the steps, and to the black Mercedes. Fritz helped the little girl by opening the door for her, and then the butler shut things up and bowed deeply to Rhage and Mary.</p><p>Those taillights going down the hill were the most tragic thing Rhage had ever seen.</p> <p>He and Mary stayed where they were, standing side by side in the cold, well after the pair of red eyes were long gone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d his shellan said dully.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can really do but wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She turned away and started back for the vestibule. But for some reason, he couldn\u2019t move. Rhage just stood there, immobile, staring out at the moon, which was full or pretty damn close to it.</p><p>His heart was in that fucking Mercedes. His heart was heading away from him, leaving his body and traveling in that car to someone else, to some other construct of family, to a future that didn\u2019t include him or Mary\u2014</p><p>\u201cRhage?\u201d</p> <p>Pivoting on his shitkicker, he looked toward the mansion. Mary was standing just inside the vestibule and holding the door wide for him.</p><p>He wanted to go over to her, but his body seemed to be ignoring the signals from his brain. And then he decided he should say something ... but speech didn\u2019t seem to be coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>There was a pause. And then Mary exploded forward, racing across the distance, throwing herself in his arms. As he caught her against him, he really couldn\u2019t believe it was all happening.</p><p>\u201cYou always tell me,\u201d she groaned, \u201cthat I know what to say. But I don\u2019t know what to say, I don\u2019t know what to do, I can\u2019t help you, I can\u2019t help her, I can\u2019t change anything....\u201d</p><p>Rhage smoothed his palm up and down her back, and felt so powerless.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to stop this,\u201d she babbled. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop ... this from happening.... oh, God, she\u2019s leaving.... Rhage, my baby is leaving me, my child....\u201d</p><p>He ended up scooping her into his arms and holding her off the ground, cradling her as she wept.</p><p>Eventually, the emotional burn-off eased up, and she took some shuddering inhales. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He shifted his hold and brushed her hair back. \u201cWhy would you ever apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to be there for you. I need to support you.\u201d</p><p>For a long moment, he stared down into her face, tracing the features he knew so well with his eyes. And then he smiled a little. \u201cMy Mary Madonna, by letting me take care of you? You make me strong. You give me strength by relying on me to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, though. What about you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage shook his head. \u201cDo I have to explain male bonded vampires to you again? You are ... my reason for being. And I\u2019ve never loved you more than I do right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if Bitty leaves.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went to the moon overhead. The bright shining moon. \u201cIf she leaves, nothing will be the same again for me. Nothing will be quite as bright or funny or free. I was forever changed the minute she came into our lives\u2014and I guess I didn\u2019t really understand how fully until now. It happened in an instant ... and it will take a lifetime to get over.\u201d He refocused on his shellan. \u201cThere is only one thing that will remain unchanged. And that is my feelings for you. In fact, my love for you is the one thing that will keep me standing at the end of this.\u201d</p><p>Mary teared up all over again, especially as he kissed her.</p><p>\u201cOur strength must be tested,\u201d he whispered, \u201cfor us to know it\u2019s still there. And I will always be your warrior, Mary mine. Always and forever.\u201d</p><p>Mary reached up to his face and stroked his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get through this, Mary. Even if we\u2019re limping and bloodied at the end. We will go on because ... maybe she\u2019ll come and see us someday, after she\u2019s grown. Maybe she\u2019ll remember us. Who knows. But even if she doesn\u2019t, we have to still be a family together, you and I. Otherwise ... God, the alternative doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FORTY-TWO</p><p>\u201cWait, so you don\u2019t have class?\u201d</p><p>As Elise asked the question, she was pulling on her jeans in Axe\u2019s bathroom upstairs, her damp, fresh-out-of-the-shower skin making it the kind of job she had to do sitting on the toilet with the seat down. Axe shook his head as he put shaving cream on his face and picked up his razor. \u201cWe were supposed to, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. The text said that the Brotherhood is \u2018otherwise engaged,\u2019 whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you think we can go have First Meal together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, where?\u201d</p><p>Okay, it was totally sexy, watching your male shave. And Axe was tragically efficient about the job, running those blades down his jaw, across his chin, over his upper lip. There was no light on above the mirror, but she could see well enough thanks to a candle he\u2019d lit and put on the side of the porcelain sink.</p><p>\u201cI love all the candlelight here,\u201d she remarked.</p><p>Loved even more what it was flowing over: the great pads of Axe\u2019s pecs, and his six-pack that was so sharp it threw shadows, and his long, low-hanging sex, and his heavy thighs.</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cYou keep looking at me like that and we\u2019re not going to make it out of this house before sundown tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Elise smiled. \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t so good to look at, I wouldn\u2019t stare so much. Anyway, I need to head over to Peyton\u2019s and get my phone first.\u201d</p><p>Axe frowned. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried about being seen with me?\u201d</p><p>Elise recoiled and then stared up at him. \u201cNo, not at all. Why would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m jealous.\u201d</p> <p>Okay, that was hot. But then she did the math. \u201cWait, of Peyton?\u201d</p><p>Axe rinsed his razor under the water, knocked it twice on the edge of the sink, and then resumed the de-bearding on the other side of his face. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She put both her hands up. \u201cLet me tell you right now, you have nothing to worry about. First of all, I saw him shirtless last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe turned his head so fast, he cut himself. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and he doesn\u2019t hold a candle to you. At all.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed at her. \u201cDid he come on to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and he wouldn\u2019t ever.\u201d She got to her feet and eased into Axe\u2019s body; extending her tongue, she lapped up the bright red blood\u2014which caused an immediate physical response in her male. \u201cHe knows better.\u201d</p><p>Before Axe could say anything else, she sank down onto her knees, opened her mouth ... and slid his erection home, sucking him deep as she cupped his heavy sac.</p> <p>\u201cOh, fuuuuck\u2014\u201d There was a bang and a crash as Axe fell back against the wall. \u201cOh, shit ...\u201d</p><p>Popping his erection out of her mouth, she ran her tongue up the underside of him, and then circled his head. \u201cStill jealous of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvkaeeio jgo eo faiofkal flla.\u201d</p><p>Or something to that effect.</p><p>With a smile, she went back to work, stroking him, sucking him, twisting his balls, teasing him with the sharp points of her fangs. Soon, he was panting and straining, and then coming in her mouth\u2014and she was relentless, milking him dry until he sagged, all his power gone and inside of her.</p><p>And oh, the way his eyes clung to her, as if she were the most sexually exciting and satisfying female on the planet.</p><p>\u201cI owe you,\u201d he said with a speech impediment she\u2019d never heard come out of him before.</p><p>\u201cAnd I look forward to collecting. I think I\u2019m going to go downstairs now, though\u2014or we\u2019ll never get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Axe mumbled something, and then she was leaving him be ... with the biggest smile on her face.</p><p>There was a serious rush to turning a male like that into putty. Go fig.</p><p>Down by the dwindling fire, she got Peyton\u2019s phone and called her own cell.</p><p>Her cousin picked up on the first ring. \u201cYellllllo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too. Where are you? And no, your pops didn\u2019t call\u2014you want to know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She switched the phone to her other ear so she could tuck in her shirt. \u201cAnd please tell me it\u2019s not because he drove over to your house the second the sun set to look everywhere for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t call because I reset the GPS locator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the GPS locator report that you\u2019ve been in your room all night. Well, as of three a.m., which is a perfectly respectable time to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeyton, no offense. You aren\u2019t that smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that\u2014I\u2019m in school. The Brother Vishous himself taught us how to do it. So as long as your sire didn\u2019t check your room, you\u2019re good to go. Did no one call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019ve got some texts, I didn\u2019t read them. They\u2019re not my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, nobody came looking for you in my room at my house. So I must have done something right. You can kiss my ass when I give you your phone back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me in a half hour at the cigar bar\u2014I\u2019ll bring it to you then. And boooonus, I\u2019m going to get off hearing you tell me how wonderful I am in your stupid bodyguard\u2019s presence, because he\u2019ll be there with the rest of us. He always shows up if there\u2019s free food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise rolled her eyes to herself. But she did owe Peyton. Unfortunately. \u201cYou are such an egoist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! If I\u2019m the reason you got to be out all day without getting in trouble? I\u2019d call that accuracy, not ego, when it comes to me being a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you can\u2019t wait, either. Buh-bye.\u201d</p> <p>First stop actually turned out to be Elise\u2019s family\u2019s mansion, and Axe let her go into her father\u2019s house alone. As he waited on her frozen front lawn, he wondered what it would be like to live in a place like that. With servants, and a museum\u2019s worth of stuff, and money, money, everywhere.</p><p>He thought of his unheated, dingy cottage.</p><p>Had his mother made it happen? he wondered. Had she made it to where she had told his father she wanted to go? Mistress of a house just like this one?</p><p>Was she happy\u2014assuming she was alive? Hell ... did she ever think of him? Wonder what had happened to the son she had left behind?</p><p>As Elise emerged out of the front door, he could tell by the skip in her step that all was well. Her father hadn\u2019t caught on.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d she asked as she came up to him.</p><p>\u201cAlways. Everything okay with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems\u2014and I told him I was meeting Peyton out, with you as an accompaniment, and he was fine with that.\u201d</p><p>Axe almost kissed her. But then he remembered that there were probably security cameras all over the outside of the mansion and around the property. Shit, he was still worried whether anyone had seen their little clinch behind the old oak tree the other night.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She smiled so widely, he couldn\u2019t help but return the grin a little. \u201cAnd brace yourself, Peyton thinks he\u2019s a god because he rewired the GPS system on my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. V taught us that\u2014should have thought of it myself. And if that cousin of yours is a god, it\u2019s only because his bong is telling him lies again.\u201d</p> <p>Axe dematerialized downtown first and checked the alleyway. Then he texted Peyton\u2019s phone, which Elise still had, and told her to come along ahead.</p><p>\u201cThis feels like a date,\u201d she said as they walked around to the front of the cigar club. \u201cDon\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>As she took his hand and kept holding it, he frowned. \u201cAre you sure you want to come out of the closet with me, so to speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all about honesty, right? I have nothing to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce Pandora\u2019s box is opened, you can\u2019t shut it back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Are you?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cFuck no.\u201d</p><p>As they came up to the entrance, Axe held the door open for her. And he had to admit, he wanted Peyton to know that Elise was his and his alone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take my cues from you,\u201d he muttered after he followed her in.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She linked an arm through his. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>As they walked back to Peyton\u2019s regular table, Axe was aware that he was blushing like a motherfucker\u2014but hopefully, the dim lighting and the ambient smoke in the air hid the shit well enough. Funny ... for as many people as he\u2019d fucked, he\u2019d never been ... claimed ... before. Never wanted to be, either. And the realization made him like something else about Elise: She always knew where she stood. There was no waffling, no inconsistency, nothing hidden or misrepresented about her.</p><p>She was solid as a rock.</p><p>And given that he\u2019d had a void for a mother and a ghost for a father?</p><p>Okay, wow. Enough with the psychoanalyzing.</p><p>Peyton was already at the seating arrangement, holding court with some other vampire males, his casual, Rich Guy suit and open-collar shirt making him seem like exactly what he was: a son of privilege who always got the girl, had the car, led the pack.</p><p>And that male\u2019s eyes snapped to where Axe and Elise were linked.</p><p>Axe was ready for anything. But what he got, at least in the short term, was nothing much: Peyton just stared over at them and then smiled remotely as Elise broke free and approached him.</p><p>The bastard didn\u2019t get up, but made her come to him\u2014which made Axe want to leave the guy spitting teeth and shitting out his lower intestines.</p><p>\u201cHow great am I?\u201d Peyton said, like he was the fucking Pope or something. \u201cG\u2019on, tell me. Don\u2019t hold back.\u201d</p><p>Elise just cocked a brow, took out his phone, and swapped it for her own. \u201cYou are amazing. Incredible. And a total blowhard\u2014which, considering how young you are, is really saying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just focus on the first two, thank you very much.\u201d Peyton looked at Axe, his tone hardening. \u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t the man of the hour. The big hero. Sit down and have a drink. Or as you\u2019re working, maybe you should stand in a corner and just watch her, bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>Elise froze, but Axe didn\u2019t.</p><p>He simply parked it across from the guy and kept his hands out and ready. He didn\u2019t think Peyton would make a direct move, but there clearly had been a lot of alcohol consumed already, and the male was giving off territorial hormones like he had Elise\u2019s certificate of title in his back pocket.</p><p>Fucking asshat cocksucker.</p><p>Elise crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>Peyton shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth. He works for your father, doesn\u2019t he. He\u2019s supposed to keep you safe, isn\u2019t he. What exactly do I have wrong here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour tone of voice, for one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.

But one minute, he was focused on getting Elise to go back inside so he could kill Peyton, and the next ...</p><p>Novo caught the scent at the same time he did, the female\u2019s head turning to the direction the wind was coming from.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d she said under her breath.</p><p>Axe dropped Peyton and let the guy find his feet and his oxygen. If he did. \u201cElise, back inside. Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving until\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe took her arm and airlifted her to the door. \u201cThat\u2019s a lesser. That smell\u2014it\u2019s not old garbage, that\u2019s a fucking lesser.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s look of alarm was the good news and the bad news: bad because he never wanted to see her scared; good because she didn\u2019t argue with him anymore.</p><p>He grabbed for the handle on the door they\u2019d come out of and\u2014locked. The emergency exit was locked. Duh.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Axe only had one gun on him, but as he glanced at Novo, she was already taking her forty out. Peyton was the same, palming up\u2014except he was coming toward Elise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her,\u201d the male announced.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s my responsibility\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my cousin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you two cut it out\u2014\u201d</p><p>The three of them escalated to yelling, which was exactly the wrong fucking thing to do, because down at the end of the alley, the lesser, who had previously had no concrete direction, glanced their way.</p><p>And then started coming at them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do this\u2014\u201d</p><p>Axe\u2019s bonded male ended Peyton\u2019s op-ed right goddamn there with a roar to rival Godzilla\u2019s\u2014proof positive that whatever civilized veneer vampires sported as they went about their nightly biz, at their heart, they were animals, unconstrained by logic when pushed.</p><p>Especially the males.</p><p>Peyton\u2019s shock was obvious, but there was no time to go into the how-did-bonding-happen thing. The slayer, previously on the approach to tease out whether they were human or vampire, now had its answer\u2014and it whistled, calling others in for backup.</p><p>Axe put Elise behind him. \u201cStay with me. Use me as a shield.\u201d</p><p>And then he raised his gun.

I feel like I\u2019m waiting to hear if I have cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs somebody who\u2019s gone through that one? Yup, it\u2019s pretty close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShit!\u201d Mary jumped up. \u201cI forgot!\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot what?\u201d</p><p>She put her hands up to her face. \u201cThe letter he wrote. I never gave it to Bitty. Oh, God, I don\u2019t want Ruhn to think I\u2019m obstructing anything!\u201d</p><p>Justlikethat, she was out of the billiards room, her feet carrying her fast up the grand staircase. Moments later, she came back down breathing heavily, with the folded papers in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Rhage asked. \u201cI mean, he told us we could read it.\u201d</p> <p>It seemed like the closest they could get to what Bitty was experiencing with the guy.</p><p>\u201cI really hope ... well, there\u2019s nothing to be done now.\u201d Mary sat down and opened the pages. \u201cI will apologize. It was an oversight ... it\u2019s all just been so emotional.\u201d</p><p>As she read what had been written in pencil, she was silent for a while, her brows moving up and down as her eyes went back and forth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Ah, he works on the estate as a handyman, fixing fences and tending the lawns and buildings. He ... takes care of the barn cats and the two security dogs. Lives by himself. Says ... well, this is too bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, that he molests farm animals?\u201d</p> <p>Mary shot him a look. \u201cNo, he seems apologetic he wasn\u2019t schooled.\u201d She went to the second page. \u201cOh ... this is about Bitty\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t reply, he let her go and waited, drumming his fingers on his knee. Checking his fucking watch. Letting his leg bounce against the sofa.</p><p>Her eyes finally lifted. \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. It\u2019s ... heartbreaking. He talks about all the things he used to do with Annalye when they were kids. Sounds like a pretty perfect upbringing on that estate. Their parents worked for the landowners\u2014it\u2019s been generations of the two families together. Everything changed, though, when Annalye met the male who was Bitty\u2019s father. Ruhn\u2019s respectful about it and doesn\u2019t give many details. But he says he never stopped thinking about his sister and he tried to find her numerous times. He didn\u2019t know for a while that they had even come up here to Caldwell.\u201d</p><p>Rhage rubbed his face. \u201cYou know, this would be so much easier if I could hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it ...?\u201d Mary murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t take care of her like we can.\u201d</p><p>Mary went to the last page. \u201cOh ... my God ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Okay, now he felt like going for his dagger. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d</p><p>She turned the final sheet to him. And \u201cOh, my God\u201d was right. Covering the white paper, there were incredibly detailed and beautiful pen-and-ink drawings of a big house, and fields ... a little cabin ... a close-up of a dog ... a cat napping all curled in a ball.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an artist,\u201d Mary breathed.</p><p>As Rhage let his eyes travel over the pictures, he wanted to hate everything about the letter and the dumb-ass fucking drawings. He wanted to take a shit all over those pages, rip them to shreds\u2014hell, nail them to a tree trunk and put bullets into them until there was nothing but shreds left.</p><p>Except he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Both his logic and his instincts were telling him that Ruhn was a good guy, a simple guy\u2014which was not to say there was anything stupid happening with her uncle ... just that there was an honest life of hard work being lived on his part. And yeah, the tragedy of that dead sister of his was only going to be eased if Ruhn could do right by his niece.</p><p>Mary\u2019s phone went off with a bing! and the two of them both reached for it on the sofa cushion\u2014</p><p>Mary won the race and didn\u2019t waste time opening whatever it was up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Marissa. They\u2019re still talking, Ruhn and Bitty. She says that ... Bitty was really shy in the beginning, but is now asking questions. They\u2019re going to eat.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cuz First Meal had been a no-go, even for him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long while,\u201d Mary concluded. \u201cAnd it should be.\u201d</p><p>Rhage scrubbed his eyes. It was so weird. When Ruhn had turned up and turned out to be real, there had been a tearing in him, a ripping apart, a searing pain. And now, with each new piece of information, Rhage felt like Bitty was a ship going out to sea, disappearing first by feet and then by yards and soon by miles as she floated off, leaving him on the shore.</p><p>Now the emotions were settling into more of a pervasive sadness.</p><p>\u201cWell, do you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>His phone went off next, and as he looked at it, he frowned. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>As Mary glanced over at him, he jumped up. \u201cShit. There\u2019s an emergency downtown\u2014listen, tell Marissa to call me when Bitty\u2019s ready\u2014I\u2019ve got to go, but I can break free.\u201d</p><p>Or at least he hoped he could.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Mary asked.</p><p>\u201cTrainees trapped with slayers\u2014and I want the brothers to stay with Bit and the uncle, she\u2019s more important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d his shellan said.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He bent down and kissed her. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>He hated leaving his mate there all alone, her eyes wide and scared. But there was no time to waste. He went upstairs, geared up, and then popped a window, dematerializing to the location that Axe had sent the SOS out from.</p><p>He\u2019d been looking for a distraction.</p> <p>Saving three recruits wasn\u2019t exactly what he\u2019d been after, but he would take what he got.</p><p>Elise\u2019s heart was thundering against her sternum, beating so hard, it was a wonder the muscle didn\u2019t explode.</p><p>From behind Axe\u2019s huge shoulders, she could see the three lessers approaching, their bodies moving with deadly-smooth strides, their expressions cold and flat, utterly emotionless.</p><p>They had guns.</p><p>The female trainee\u2014Elise couldn\u2019t remember her name, but she recognized her from the night she\u2019d first met Axe\u2014stepped into their paths with a gun up and a murderous expression on her face.</p> <p>Elise couldn\u2019t imagine being that calm or that aggresive in a situation like this.</p><p>\u201cStop where you are,\u201d the female said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll shoot you.\u201d</p><p>A fourth lesser, who seemed to come out of nowhere, just laughed. \u201cReally, bitch. Do you actually know how to use that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s entire body jumped as there was a pop! and the slayer fell to the ground.</p><p>That female had put a bullet right between its eyes.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Elise breathed.</p> <p>But that was the last time she had a chance to track anything. All at once, the drama went into overdrive\u2014the three slayers rushed in, bullets flying everywhere and ricocheting around as she was spun to the left and shoved behind something big and metal.</p><p>Car? Dumpster?</p><p>No, it was a discarded meat locker the size of an SUV.</p><p>A split second later, Elise felt a lash on her shoulder, like someone had put a curling iron on her skin\u2014but she couldn\u2019t worry about it as Axe jumped in front of her again, and Peyton pressed into her from the side\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on top!\u201d Peyton said.</p><p>What? she thought.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d</p><p>As Axe cursed, he angled his gun up to the heavens and pumped off more rounds\u2014and then a body was falling on them, a body that leaked black blood and smelled like baby powder and spoiled milk.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m out!\u201d Axe said. And she took that to mean he had no more ammunition.</p><p>Someone cursed. More gunshots. Her ankle hurt now, too.</p><p>And then Peyton fell away. Just dropped off like a blanket falling from the side of a bed.</p><p>\u201cPeyton!\u201d she screamed as she turned.</p><p>Just as she was reaching out for him, that female soldier grabbed her by the back of her coat and hauled her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cCan you shoot?\u201d</p><p>Elise blinked, her vision going fuzzy. More bullets were whizzing by. God, where were the bullets coming from? And then she focused on the female. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding! Y-y-y-you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>The slap came from the left and made a cracking impact on Elise\u2019s face. But it was like throwing a window open in a smoke-filled kitchen. She was suddenly able to concentrate on the soldier.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to shoot?\u201d she was asked again.</p><p>\u201cP-p-point and pull the trigger,\u201d Elise blurted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly there was a heavy piece of metal in her palm. \u201cTwo hands. And only if you need to.\u201d</p><p>And then Elise was picked up and thrown.</p><p>As she was airborne, her hair whipping her face, her body totally numb, she had the absurd thought, How the fuck was this happening right now? How the holy fuck was she\u2014</p><p>Bam!</p><p>She landed on her ass, her body slamming back against something else\u2014it was a Dumpster this time. She\u2019d been thrown behind the bar\u2019s Dumpster.</p><p>As she fought for her breath, her hands were shaking so badly they were a blur, but she was not going to drop the gun.</p><p>Looking out into the alley, she saw Axe going hand to hand with a slayer as the female stood over Peyton, who\u2014oh, dear Lord\u2014looked like he\u2019d been hit in the head. So much blood\u2014too much blood!</p><p>And the human police were coming\u2014she could hear the sirens.</p><p>Except then the tide turned. From out of nowhere, the biggest vampire she had ever seen in her life materialized right in the middle of the alley. He was blond and dressed in black and he attacked like a demon, grabbing on to the slayer that Axe was trading punches with and pitching the enemy against the side of the building like it was a doll.</p><p>Axe moved on to the next, and so did what had to be a Brother.</p><p>More lessers showed up, having obviously been called, but between Axe and the Brother and that female trainee, heads were snapped, and black blood that stank flowed, and bodies lined the pavement\u2014</p><p>Right as things were winding down, just before the cops arrived ... something caught her eye.</p><p>A subtle flash.</p><p>That lesser who had been shot in the head, the one behind the meat locker where they had started out, was still moving, and it had raised its gun up, pointing the muzzle at the Brother.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to shoot!\u201d Elise screamed.</p><p>Everything went into a slow crawl, and Elise watched in horror as the Brother turned his upper body in her direction\u2014which put him directly in line with the shooter.</p><p>And the lesser pulled its trigger, emptying bullets into that huge chest. Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>Someone screamed\u2014probably her\u2014as the blond-haired Brother threw up both of his hands and fell back onto the pavement. And still the slayer discharged its weapon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fuck this shit, Elise decided.</p><p>Without thinking, spurred by an aggression that was as uncharacteristic as it was manic, Elise jumped out from behind her cover, ran across the alley, and got as close as she could to the lesser.</p><p>Then she pointed ... and fucking shot.</p><p>Blam! Blam! Blam!</p> <p>Two hands, arms outstretched, eyes and body steady, she let the gun do the talking, black blood splattering back on her as she kept closing in and shooting and closing in and ...</p><p>She didn\u2019t know when to stop.</p><p>Wait, she couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Even when the gun was no longer talking, when the clip or whatever you called it was empty, even when the slayer was so bullet-ridden it was a sieve, she stayed where she was, standing over it, that gun muzzle pointed at her target, her body trembling so badly her teeth were chattering, her knees knocking in their sockets, her breath sawing up and down her throat.</p><p>And her forefinger squeezing the trigger\u2014</p> <p>\u201cElise?\u201d Axe said from a distance so far off she could barely hear him. \u201cElise ... sweetheart ... I\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-wh-what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to take the gun, \u2019kay? Let me have the gun\u2014no, don\u2019t turn toward me. Stay where you are.\u201d</p><p>His hands traveled gently down her arms and carefully released the weapon from her cramped fingers.</p><p>As soon as it was out of her grip, she turned to him and burst into tears. \u201cI tried to save him, the Brother, I tried to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to go\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Elise looked past his biceps at the dead body of the Brother: The blond-haired fighter was lying flat on his back, his arms out straight in a T formation, his heavy boots lolling to the sides.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to save him, oh, God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise, we need to go before the humans get here\u2014\u201d</p><p>Across the way, the female soldier picked Peyton up in her arms. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well. Where do we go\u2014\u201d</p><p>Human police cars screeched to a halt at the head of the block, humans swarming free of the vehicles and pointing down to where they were in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t leave him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut down your weapons,\u201d came out from a speaker system. \u201cPut down your weapons now or we will shoot to kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then things got truly surreal. Like something out of a movie, the Brother\u2019s torso rose up from the pavement. And he looked down his chest, cursed, and said something that sounded like, \u201cI just had Fritz buy this fucking thing.\u201d</p> <p>Then he reached into what seemed to be his own flesh, picked out a bullet, and flicked it across the alley.</p><p>That was when he seemed to notice what was happening with the police cars.</p><p>\u201cFucking humans, not again.\u201d He got to his feet and winced, but seemed otherwise fine. \u201cYou two, take the wounded and the female and go that way.\u201d He pointed to the far end of the alley. \u201cManny should be coming\u2014there he is.\u201d</p><p>At that precise moment, a large, boxy vehicle pulled across the other end of the lane, where the humans were not.</p><p>\u201cGo now!\u201d</p><p>At the barking command, Axe grabbed her hand and started running. And the female with Peyton did the same, the four of them hightailing it down the slushy way to what turned out to be some kind of fancy van.</p><p>Just as its wide door slid open and she was about to jump in, Elise looked back. Flashes were flooding the sides of the buildings, and there were popping noises, but not from bullets being discharged.</p><p>The Brother was stabbing the slayers back to the Omega, she thought with awe. Holy crap, was she actually seeing this?</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Axe said as he gave her a shove into a well-lit interior.</p><p>He followed and then dragged the door to a close.</p><p>\u201cHang on, folks!\u201d somebody yelled from up front. \u201cThis ride is going to be bumpy\u2014stay on the floor.\u201d</p><p>There was a roar and a lurch, and then they were moving. And Elise collapsed back against Axe. How had ... what had ...</p><p>So fast. Her mind couldn\u2019t comprehend how fast it had all gone down. It was like ... one minute they were walking up to Peyton inside the cigar bar, and the next she was in an action movie, except it wasn\u2019t a film set at all. It was real.</p><p>Looking across the way, Elise blinked away tears. The female fighter had Peyton in her lap, and had braced herself against a mounted table in the center of the space\u2014this was an ambulance, Elise realized. A massive ambulance with all kinds of supplies tacked to its walls or packed in glass-fronted cabinets mounted on the sides.</p><p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d Elise said.</p><p>The female didn\u2019t look up. \u201cYeah. At the moment.\u201d</p><p>There was so much blood. Oh, dearest Virgin Scribe ... the blood ...</p><p>But at least they seemed to be going even faster\u2014hopefully to someone who could operate in here, Elise thought. And as they banged and crashed, things rattling all around them, Axe kept her from bowling-balling it, his powerful arms locked around her waist, one of his legs braced against the stand of that operating platform.</p><p>\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d Elise mumbled. \u201cHow did the Brother ... survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulletproof vest,\u201d Axe said grimly. \u201cHe must have been wearing a bulletproof vest\u2014and the damn thing saved his life.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-FOUR</p><p>Axe\u2019s adrenaline didn\u2019t stop flowing until Dr. Manello\u2019s mobile surgical unit pulled into some kind of downtown garage and the surgeon opened the sliding door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And even then, Axe was on a hair trigger. Natch.</p><p>As he got out, he looked around at a dim, industrial interior that smelled like oil, gas, and old metal\u2014and tried to pretend he wasn\u2019t losing his fucking mind.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe that not only had Elise gotten ambushed with the rest of them, but that she had discharged about a pound and a half of lead into a lesser who had a gun\u2014and worse, it was all his own fucking fault. If he and Peyton hadn\u2019t been going at it, playing dick toss in that bar, the three of them, and then Novo, and then Rhage, never would have ended up outside, exposed, and wrong-place-wrong-timing it with all those slayers.</p><p>And yeah, then her fucking cousin, Peyton the Golden Boy, never would have gotten popped in the head. Plus, what if Rhage didn\u2019t get out of that human cluster-fuck okay? What if the cops got him or another lesser or\u2014</p> <p>That open-ended nightmare was solved when a side door got thrown wide and the stench of vampire blood and lesser death wafted in.</p><p>\u201cHow is Peyton?\u201d the Brother Rhage said as he came into the light thrown by the surgical unit. \u201cAnd what do I need to do to help.\u201d</p><p>As Rhage passed by, he clapped Axe on the shoulder in acknowledgment, but focused on Dr. Manello, who had laid Peyton out on the operating table and was hooking up all kinds of shit to him. Before there were any answers, Doc Jane came in through that same door. She was in surgical scrubs, just like Manello, and she was not interested in anyone other than her patient.</p><p>Inside the van, Novo was standing against the far wall with her arms crossed over her chest and her head down. Blood was dripping off her chin. She\u2019d been cut there. Also on the forearm.</p><p>Someone\u2019s phone started to ring.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Elise said next to him.</p><p>Snapping to attention, Axe put his arm around her as she fumbled with the thing and put it up to her ear.</p><p>\u201cTroy? No, I\u2019m so sorry, I can\u2019t talk right now. Tomorrow? Sure. What? Well ... I\u2019ve got ... a friend who\u2019s in trouble. We\u2019re at the ER right now. No, it\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow. Bye.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and leaned against him as if the interruption had never happened. Which made it less likely he\u2019d stalk across Caldwell to find her professor and black-eye him on principle.</p><p>Okay, fine. He wouldn\u2019t do that. At least not in a world outside of his jealous streak.</p><p>And why the fuck was he thinking like this right now?</p> <p>\u201cIs he going to be all right?\u201d Elise asked nobody in particular.</p><p>\u201cWe just have to wait,\u201d Axe heard himself reply. \u201cWe just have to pray.\u201d</p><p>After all, he didn\u2019t particularly like Peyton, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted the bastard to go brain dead or into an early grave. Especially if Elise was even tangentially involved.</p><p>After a little while, Rhage ducked his head out of the SUV. \u201cListen, I want you two to head home. There\u2019s nothing you can do here. We\u2019ll let you know what happens with him, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he ...\u201d Elise just let the sentence drift as if she recognized its futility.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can for him.\u201d Rhage looked over at Axe. \u201cYou were a huge asset again, son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you figure that? You send up a flare or some shit? Put an ad in Craigslist for your buddy to get shot in the head? Don\u2019t think so. G\u2019on now, get her home and you do the same.\u201d Rhage then met Elise\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd you were amazing. You really showed up when you had to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to shoot a gun,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve never shot one before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have now. And I\u2019m sorry you had to learn the skill.\u201d</p><p>With his head thumping, Axe led her over to the door and opened the way out. He stepped through first, and as he glanced around, he saw that they were close to the river under the bridges, the highway elevated up on pylons, the sound of the occasional car and truck above echoing around.</p><p>\u201cYou go now,\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m right behind you. To your house.\u201d</p><p>She nodded in a way that broke his heart. And then she closed her eyes.</p><p>It took her at least a minute, maybe two, to ghost out.</p><p>And then he was on her tail, traveling through the cold night in a loose collection of molecules that seemed to represent better who he was as opposed to the more organized, corporeal version of himself.</p><p>Scattered was his very definition.</p><p>When he re-formed, it was right beside her, something made possible because of the blood they\u2019d shared.</p><p>As she took his hand and started for the front door, he pulled her to a stop. \u201cYou have blood on your clothes. Is there a back way we can use?\u201d</p><p>Elise looked down at herself like she had forgotten what clothes were at all, much less what she was currently wearing and what condition it was in.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThis was how it all started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cWith you. I walked into the house through the front door by mistake and that\u2019s how my father saw me. And if I hadn\u2019t done that ... I never would have met you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and how\u2019s it working for you, he thought grimly. You shot a lesser, nearly got killed yourself, and you\u2019re covered with the stains of war.</p><p>\u201cTell me where the back door is,\u201d he said in a grim voice. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll take us in.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing Rhage could do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Doc Jane and Manny went to work on Peyton, stitching up the streak by his temple, assessing his concussion, trying to fix his too-low blood pressure, Rhage was pretty fucking tired of being in situations where he couldn\u2019t do shit.</p><p>He glanced at Novo. The female trainee hadn\u2019t moved the whole time. It was as if she had turned to stone. \u201cYou want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>In other circumstances, he might have argued, but she was tough. No matter what happened, she could handle it\u2014</p> <p>His phone went off and he grabbed for it. \u201cOh, shit ...

As he re-formed in front of the Audience House, he didn\u2019t think twice about running up the front walkway and shoving open the door\u2014</p> <p>Lot of people in the foyer and everyone turned to him\u2014</p><p>Complete. Fucking. Chaos.</p><p>Mary gasped. Bitty yelled. Somebody started cursing\u2014V, by the sound of it. And then his females were coming at him, talking a mile a minute, pointing, gesturing to his chest.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t fathom what they were going on about.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d he said, putting his palms out. \u201cHow was it with Ruhn\u2014are you okay, Bitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shot! You\u2019re bleeding!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Except then he looked down at himself. Sure enough, there were bullet holes through the front of his shirt and his leather jacket; there was bright red blood on his hands and all over his clothes ... and black lesser blood dripping off his daggers, which he\u2019d restrapped.</p><p>Oh. Right. That whole, you know, fighting thing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Doc Jane now!\u201d Mary said as she went for her phone.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He put his hand out again. \u201cThey\u2019re operating. And I\u2019m not hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just lived through you getting shot in the chest! Why are you still standing! Rhage\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stepped in front of his mate and ripped his shirt clean down the middle.</p> <p>As buttons went flying and then skipped across the marble floor, he exposed what used to be his shiny new bulletproof vest. But that now had more in common with Swiss cheese.</p><p>Rhage pounded on his chest. \u201cKevlar.\u201d He picked another bullet out and let the thing fall to the floor\u2014where it obligingly bounced along to play with all those buttons. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing them since I got shot, you know, the last time. I mean, yes, we agreed you\u2019d stay with her after I die, but there\u2019s no reason to rush that.\u201d</p><p>All at once, he became aware of Ruhn standing in the far corner, his eyes missing nothing.</p><p>Rhage cleared his throat. \u201cOr, you know, there was no reason to rush that.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. And then Mary and Bitty were on him, his females hugging him and talking a mile a minute, nervous energy being burned off, the fact that he was sweaty and bloodstained not seeming to matter to them in the slightest.</p><p>\u201cZ,\u201d he said over Bitty\u2019s head as she poked her fingers into the holes. \u201cYou need to get down to the garage. They\u2019re unprotected and operating on Peyton. And V, I\u2019m pretty sure they could use another set of hands.\u201d</p><p>There was conversation at that point, and someone suggested Ruhn head off to wherever he was staying.</p><p>And that totally changed the vibe. Bitty turned to her uncle and so did Mary.</p><p>\u201cWhen do I see you again?\u201d Bitty asked with her customary directness.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d Ruhn said in his quiet way.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>At least they didn\u2019t hug, Rhage thought uncharitably as the male bowed, murmured a few words to Marissa and Mary, and then walked to the door\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d the little girl said.</p><p>Without warning, she burst forward ... and embraced Ruhn.</p><p>It was just the way she had done it when she had been getting to know Rhage and Mary: Fast as a blink, but the first sign she was opening her heart.</p><p>Rhage felt tears spear into his eyes. More than any detail of the meeting, more than any he said/she said, this-was-discussed, that-was-explained, Bitty\u2019s actions told him exactly how her time with Ruhn had gone.</p><p>Funny, when he and Mary had been in the process of adopting the girl, Rhage had gotten flashes of insight that things were happening between the three of them, were changing, were going in a certain direction. Like his showing her the GTO and her liking the way it smelled ... he and Mary taking her to T.G.I. Friday\u2019s in Lucas Square and him explaining that it was okay if they had to leave if it was too much for her to handle ... that trip to the ice cream parlor ...</p><p>He was getting exactly one of those flashes now.</p><p>Except instead of it showing him an open road ...</p><p>... it was all about a brick wall.</p><p>FORTY-FIVE</p><p>Peyton woke up with the worst headache he\u2019d ever had.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t give a shit about the pain.</p><p>There was a wrist at his lips, and the most amazing blood he\u2019d ever had was filling his mouth, blazing down his throat, pooling in his gut. And the more he took, the more some instinct for survival ordered him to drink and drink and then keep on going.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he opened his eyes that he found out whose it was.</p><p>Novo was standing over him, her face drawn and pale, her shoulders and arms bare, whatever jacket she had been wearing gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Were they moving? he thought as something bumped and he felt it throughout his body\u2014</p><p>All at once, the argument in the cigar bar came back to him, he and Axe going at it hardcore, Elise running out after them, Novo showing up ... the lessers\u2014</p><p>Releasing the seal of his lips, he mumbled, \u201cDead? God ... Rhage dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly lessers,\u201d she said, before forcing her wrist back at him.</p> <p>He exhaled and returned to the drinking. And after what could have been years or at least hours, but was probably only ten minutes or so, he went lax, the floating, blissful feeling of satiation working to calm him better than any amount of morphine.</p><p>It was the most perfect high.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t get lost in the delicious sensation. Not with that female standing over him as she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna be fine.\u201d Or at least, that was what he meant to say. It didn\u2019t seem to come out right. Either that or his hearing was going.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, leaning in as if proximity might work as well as a Google translator set to stupid.</p> <p>He cleared his throat and forced his brain to come back online. \u201cElise okay? Axe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>She held her arms out and moved around in a circle ... and not for the first time, he noticed she was a damn fine female, if a little intimidating. She was just so tough, that body filed down to all its hard, muscular edges.</p><p>As Peyton started to become aroused, he took that as a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad nothing hurt you,\u201d he said roughly.</p> <p>\u201cAre you getting emotional on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re turning me on.\u201d</p><p>She seemed nonplussed for a second. Then she started to glare at him\u2014which for them was probably progress. As in, things getting back to normal.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re an attractive female. Surely I\u2019m not the first male to tell you that. And what can I say, I\u2019ve always had a healthy regard for the fairer sex.\u201d</p><p>She threw her head back and laughed. But it was not a happy sound. \u201cLet me get this straight. You and I are in the Brotherhood\u2019s mobile surgical van, on our way to the training center because you were shot and now have a tube in your head to reduce brain swelling ... and you\u2019re coming on to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gray matter isn\u2019t the only thing getting bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like the indestructible slut, aren\u2019t you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, to most people, slut is an insult.\u201d He tried to lift his hand to make the point. And failed. \u201cI personally take it as a compliment. Shows commitment to my work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour work?\u201d</p><p>Considering everything that had happened tonight, they might as well spend the trip to the training center arguing: He was rattling around inside his skin, and that energy needed an outlet\u2014and shit knew she could give as good as she got.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cI work at being with the females. Practice makes perfect and all.\u201d</p><p>When she just re-crossed her arms over her chest and leaned back against the wall again, he frowned. \u201cIf we\u2019re moving, shouldn\u2019t you be sitting down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar be it from me to suggest reasonable behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the first intelligent thing you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve regained consciousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve known you.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing, but it made his head hurt, so he stopped. \u201cTell me something ... where were you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to speak more slowly? I\u2019m the one with the cracked skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Peyton entertained the possibility that he\u2019d had a stroke and he had slipped into aphasia. But no, he was speaking correctly.</p><p>\u201cI called you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d He went to nod his head, but the stinging pain stopped him. \u201cI sure did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from your phone, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. \u201cShit, it was on Elise\u2019s. She had to leave it with me so she could go fuck Axe.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he sounded bitter. Which was a little rich, considering the guy had probably helped save his life tonight.</p><p>Take out the probably.</p><p>Novo frowned. \u201cAxe was with me.\u201d</p><p>Now Peyton was the one pulling a blank. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAxe took me to The Keys.\u201d</p><p>Peyton actually tried to sit up. And as he gasped, Novo put a hand on his chest and forced him back down.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop moving?\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is he doing taking you to The Keys? No female should be going there.\u201d</p><p>A bump in the road made everything hurt on him, as if the asphalt itself was taking her side.</p><p>Oh, and you want to talk about a death stare? If he hadn\u2019t already been flat on his back, her glare would have blown him out of his loafers.</p><p>\u201cI asked Axe to take me there, for one thing. And I had sex with a woman, so yes, there are females at that club.\u201d</p><p>Peyton blinked a couple of times. Then pulled his laconic mask into place. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like women, females, men, and males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Axe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Axe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The tips of Peyton\u2019s fangs started to tingle. \u201cWell, I bet you two had a great time. Before he went home to my cousin.\u201d He lifted his hand to rub his face, but the IV in his arm prevented him from moving as freely as he\u2019d like. \u201cI told him not to go near her\u2014and before you start lecturing me, no, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s just a civilian and she\u2019s an aristocrat. Elise isn\u2019t like us. She\u2019s ... clean. She\u2019s better than we are. She deserves respect\u2014like Paradise does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, riiiiiiight. Your progressive paradigm of females. And I keep forgetting which of the two buckets you\u2019ve put me in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me, Novo, okay? You know what I mean. Paradise and Elise wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a place like that, much less banging randoms and fellow trainees for shits and giggles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to remind you, Paradise is, currently, banging a fellow trainee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s a relationship. Paradise was a virgin. Elise was, too. Goddamn it\u2014how\u2019s she ever going to get mated now?\u201d</p><p>Novo stared at him for a long time. \u201cYou know what I find fascinating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? And if it\u2019s the color of my eyes, I feel the same about yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you can be such a sexist, judgmental pig. You have fucked twenty or thirty females since I\u2019ve known you\u2014and don\u2019t deny it, I\u2019ve been out in the clubs and watched you go off with them. And yet you\u2019re saying a female shouldn\u2019t, or even can\u2019t, do it, too. Tell me, does that double standard you\u2019re sporting not bother you at all? Like, not even a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFemales are different.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>Novo stared off somewhere over his head\u2014and he had the distinct impression that in her mind, she was finishing off the job that slayer had started on him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, \u201cactually, assholes are just assholes, no matter what\u2019s going on between their legs.\u201d</p><p>Across town, in a totally different zip code of Caldwell, Elise invited Axe into her bedroom and closed the door quietly behind them both.</p><p>\u201cWe made it,\u201d she said as she went directly to her bathroom. \u201cWithout anyone ...\u201d</p><p>The moment she saw her reflection in the mirror, she stopped and put her hands up to her cheeks. God ... the blood.</p><p>Axe stepped in beside her and shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you ever to see anything like that. Much less get stuck in the middle of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what your life is like? Going out there ... every night ... getting almost killed until some lesser finishes the job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think like that. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not?\u201d She turned to him and found herself wanting to touch him all over, as if there were bullet holes and other injuries that had somehow been missed on him. \u201cHow can I forget?\u201d</p><p>As if Axe knew what she needed from him, he put his mouth to hers and kissed her deeply. And all at once, she was consumed by the need to have him, her hands rough as she stripped his clothes and her own, the stained pile on the floor left where it landed as they went to her shower.</p><p>Whereas his was a simple stall with a tub bottom, hers was an entire enclosure you walked into, six shower heads raining down water that could be programmed to specific temperature preferences. And there was also almost no waiting at all for the warmth.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need the luxury. Not to be with him, now or ever.</p><p>After they soaped each other up and down, and rinsed away the gruesome souvenirs of the night, they left the bathroom and she turned off all the lights except one in the far corner. Lying down in her big bed, under her soft sheets, they made love quietly with him on top of her, their eyes meeting as their bodies were joined together. She found her release first, scoring his back with her nails\u2014and he soon followed, his hips jerking and bucking against her, his powerful orgasm filling her up and teeing off another for her.</p><p>There was no lingering closeness afterward, though.</p> <p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can. My father never comes in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take even a small risk of getting you in trouble. I already nearly got you killed tonight.\u201d</p><p>As he got out of the warm nest their bodies\u2019 exertions had created, she stood up and pulled on her pink bathrobe\u2014and thought it was a shame to have the stained things he\u2019d worn during the fight put on over his now-clean skin. But he didn\u2019t seem to care.</p><p>All too soon, he was standing in front of her, rubbing her shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how brave you were tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrave? Are you kidding me? To use a vernacular expression, I was crapping in my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou walked right up to a lesser, shooting the whole time. If I hadn\u2019t been fucking terrified for you, I would have been totally aroused.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little, but it was hard to hold on to. \u201cWhen can I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night. And before you ask, yeah, definitely. I\u2019ll let you know the second I hear anything about Peyton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She frowned, thinking back to the cigar bar. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he was so disrespectful to you. He can be ... old-fashioned and difficult sometimes, but he\u2019s not a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to die. And I don\u2019t want trouble from him. He just needs to stay out of my way and I\u2019ll stay out of his.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise nodded and then went into a kind of stasis. She didn\u2019t want him to go, but knew he didn\u2019t feel comfortable staying\u2014and she couldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Axe breathed. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Safe in his arms, she relaxed and held him close, feeling his warmth and strength.</p><p>\u201cI wish there was something I could do to help you,\u201d he whispered as he rubbed her back. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m bad for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>After a while, she said, \u201cActually ...\u201d Pulling away from him, she took a deep breath. \u201cThere is something you could do for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>FORTY-SIX</p><p>The following evening, Rhage and Mary let Bitty go to the Audience House again to see her uncle.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t any easier, Mary decided. Nope. Not something you got used to\u2014especially not after Rhage\u2019s getting shot.</p><p>And as the Mercedes took off down the hill once more, she and Rhage went back into the house and stalled out in the foyer. The mansion was largely quiet, First Meal being cleaned up, the Brothers going on about their nights, the shellans, too.</p><p>\u201cI kind of feel left behind,\u201d she said as she went over and sat on the lower step of the staircase. \u201cYou know, our lives are ending in a way. Everyone else is going on. I mean, I realize that\u2019s sadness talking, but it\u2019s how I feel.\u201d</p><p>Rhage came across and joined her. \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you were wearing that vest last night. But why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an addition in gear. You know, after that last chest wound\u2014that was too close a call, even for me. And with Bitty around ...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cSo, yeah, I asked Fritz to get me some. I tried a number of them out. And the one I had on last night is my favorite. Worked like a charm, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to order another one?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGuess so.\u201d</p><p>Mary put her arm around his shoulders\u2014well, not all the way around because of his size. \u201cBitty was so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet kid.\u201d</p><p>As Rhage looked at his hands and pretend-picked at his clipped nails, Mary felt a now-familiar mourning that she recognized she was going to have to live with for the rest of her life. There would be times when it wouldn\u2019t be this acute, she told herself. Times when it was even worse. But it was now her companion, a scar on her insides that was always going to be there.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to ask Rhage to know that it would be the same for him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any regrets?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAbout taking her in?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time, and she studied his handsome profile. His blond hair needed a trim. His cheeks seemed hollower than usual. And the grim light in those beautiful blue eyes made him look so much older.</p><p>As she rubbed his back, she felt the beast following her touch as she passed over his muscle shirt, the tattooed representation shifting to stay with her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is pretty rough. This is really hard. But no, I would still have wanted to take her in. If all I\u2019m supposed to get is two months of being her father to tide her over to her rightful home? Then I\u2019ll be grateful for what I was given. I\u2019d rather me suffer for the next thousand years over not having her than for her to have been alone in the world, getting those arms and legs fixed, wondering where she was going to end up. That trade-off \u2019s worth it to me.\u201d</p><p>Mary laid her head on his biceps. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have told you about what they were going to do to Bitty\u2019s limbs. I didn\u2019t want to concern you, and I was hoping it was all going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God ... not to worry. Water under the bridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>They sat there for oh, so long, the sounds of conversation in the kitchen and a distant vacuum and Wrath up in his study talking to someone trickling down.</p><p>Eventually, Boo, the black cat, padded by, the animal curling into a sit right in front of them.</p><p>\u201cHave you got something to tell us, Boo?\u201d Mary murmured. \u201cWe could use some good news.\u201d</p><p>A couple of meows were released, but they were hard to translate. And then Boo kept on going, attending to very important feline business, clearly.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Marissa about how it was going to work?\u201d Rhage asked. \u201cYou know ... and when?\u201d</p><p>Mary took a deep breath. \u201cA social worker went down tonight to check Ruhn\u2019s cottage again. There will have to be regular welfare visits there, but V did all the due diligence brilliantly. Oh\u2014and it turns out Ruhn\u2019s employer has access to schooling for Bitty. They\u2019re totally willing to help Ruhn get her into a program. That would be fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know anyone when she came into this house. But she adapted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know what she likes to eat. Her ice cream\u2014she\u2019s in a mint chocolate chip phase now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll tell them.\u201d Mary rubbed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll help her pack up her things. I think it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t draw it out longer than we have to. The transition is going to be hard enough on her without her having to stay in limbo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying on that third floor.

There\u2019s a meeting at twelve midnight to talk to the class about what went down last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Peyton survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Manny sent out a text to all of us\u2014that bastard is a brilliant surgeon. The brain swelling is down, stats are fine. The kid\u2019s not cleared to work out or fight for a couple more nights, but he\u2019ll be good to go soon enough. Novo saved his life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad everyone came through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a close call.\u201d</p><p>Even though it was time for Mary to leave, she didn\u2019t move. She just sat next to her male\u2014and when he reached out and took her hand, she went back to resting her head against his shoulder.</p><p>Being left behind was a special kind of loss.</p><p>After Elise drew on her coat and wrapped a scarf around her throat, she opened a window in her bathroom by the tub and dematerialized to where Axe was waiting for her downtown, their blood tie helping her triangulate him in an instant, even though they had agreed on the address.</p><p>As she re-formed, he was staring up at the condominium building like he was assessing its structural integrity.</p> <p>\u201cAllishon was on the fourteenth floor,\u201d Elise explained after they kissed hello. \u201cThe front door to the apartment is locked, but maybe the terrace is open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea which side of the building she faced out of? This place has hundreds of units.\u201d</p><p>She thought about where the elevator had emptied out in the hall. The direction the hallway had run. Which way she had gone.</p><p>\u201cFacing the Hudson. On that side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go around.\u201d</p><p>The two of them walked to the far edge of the high-rise, squeezed through some evergreen bushes, and whispered down its flank until they reached the river-view side.</p><p>Craning her neck, she had to hold her hair out of her face as gusts blew against her back. \u201cAlmost all the lights are on in the units.\u201d She counted floors. \u201cBut see? There are two that are out on the fourteenth level\u2014assuming they started the count with the lobby being the ground floor. One of them has to be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if we have to try fifty of the damn things. If we attract any human attention, I\u2019ll just scrub their memories.\u201d</p> <p>Elise nodded. \u201cYou first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you. I want to guard you when you\u2019re on the ground.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, she closed her eyes ... and went flying in her molecular form, coalescing herself on the terrace of the darkened apartment that was three units in from the end. Axe followed right along, materializing by her side.</p><p>There was a sliding glass door and she went over and grasped the handle. Bracing herself to be denied, she\u2014</p><p>Yup. \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d</p><p>Axe cupped his hands and looked inside. \u201cSeems pretty average human stuff. Not a place for a vampire to hide out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext door.\u201d</p><p>They proceeded over to the other unit, and her first thought as she leaned into the slider was, No way was this a vampire apartment. Even with the darkness inside, she had the impression the drapery was white and diaphanous\u2014nothing that would keep out the sun.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bloody handprint here,\u201d Axe said in a grim voice. \u201cOn the outside jamb.\u201d</p><p>As she glanced across to where he was pointing, Elise\u2019s heart started to hammer\u2014and then she closed her eyes. After a moment, she reached out, took hold of the handle\u2014</p><p>The slider pulled free without any problem at all, as if the glass were almost relieved to be getting out of the way.</p><p>\u201cI can smell blood,\u201d Elise said roughly. \u201cIt\u2019s faint ... and it\u2019s Allishon\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Stepping over the threshold, that first impression of white everything gained traction. Even the carpet was the color of a sheet of paper. And as her eyes adjusted, she focused on the bed across the way. The sheets were gone. So were the pillows. There was nothing but a headboard and a mattress.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to turn a light on?\u201d Axe asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Still, she jumped when illumination flooded the bedroom.</p><p>Oh ... blessed Virgin Scribe. There were stains on that mattress, most of them at the top of it, by the headboard. And there were footprints that were brown on the carpet. Another brown smudge on the doorjamb.</p><p>It was as if the violence had been filtered through the passage of time, drained of most, but not all, of its characteristics.</p><p>The remnants were more than enough.</p><p>Wrapping her arms around herself even though it wasn\u2019t cold, Elise walked out of the bedroom and down a short hall. The living room was also done in white with those same filmy drapes and a set of all-white furniture. The galley kitchen was unremarkable, the counters clean, nothing really in the cabinets. The refrigerator was empty.</p><p>No blood to be seen. But that was no relief, really.</p><p>\u201cShe came here to do drugs,\u201d Elise said to Axe as he loomed in the hall. \u201cThis was her party house, apparently. And one night ... she brought back someone....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not just someone, she reminded herself. Anslam. One of their own, and not only because he was a vampire, but because he was a high-bred member of the aristocracy.</p><p>Had been, at any rate.</p><p>And now they were both dead.</p><p>Elise took her time going around and around, pacing through the limited floor plan, even though she didn\u2019t know exactly what she was trying to make sense of. It was, she supposed, yet another example of how having all the education in the world about emotions didn\u2019t necessarily help when your own were raw and damaged.</p> <p>Heading back into the bedroom, she went for the closet. She had to. It was almost like closing the loop, her stepping into the walk-in and looking at ... emptiness.</p><p>There was nothing but a couple of jackets hanging off the rods and a formal gown pooling on the floor.</p><p>Allishon must have come here after one of the glymera\u2019s grand events. Stripped her mask of civilization off. And proceeded to ...</p><p>\u201cSo sad,\u201d Elise murmured as she went over and picked up the red swath of satin.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a fancy dress, though. It turned out to be a cloak, one that had beautiful trim and buttons of mother-of-pearl\u2014</p> <p>As she went to hang it up on a hanger, something knocked her in the leg.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d She looked through the folds, wondering what was hanging off the cloak\u2014or perhaps in a hidden pocket. \u201cOkay, that hurt\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise frowned as she took out a large piece of black metal from the lining. It was oddly shaped and heavy ... kind of like a key, but not really.</p><p>\u201cDid you find something?\u201d Axe asked from behind her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She held the thing out. \u201cWhat do you think this is?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, she glanced at him and then rolled the object over in her palm. \u201cIs it some kind of self-defense weapon? It isn\u2019t like there\u2019s a blade in here or ... maybe it\u2019s a key, except not to any door I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I think we should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to take whatever it was with her. But she didn\u2019t want to have to explain, if she was found with the object, why she had gone to Allishon\u2019s and nosed around.</p><p>Putting the weight back in the pocket of that cloak, she stepped out of the closet and shut the walk-in\u2019s door.</p><p>Going over to a stuffed chair, she sat down and stared at the bed. \u201cThank you for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>She was acutely aware of Axe standing by the sliding glass door they\u2019d come in through, his big body taking up nearly all of the slider\u2019s expanse.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate it.\u201d She shook her head as she imagined what had happened in the room. \u201cI guess ... you know, I had to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I can let her go now. I\u2019ve taken this as far as I can\u2014this is the dead end that means stop for me. I just have to mourn her in my own way. Maybe I\u2019ll even do some version of a Fade ceremony for her.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I feel closer to her now than I did when she was alive\u2014and all mourning is private, isn\u2019t it. We all do it in our own ways for our dead. And she was mine. Close or not, she was my blood and nothing will change that.\u201d</p><p>Axe stayed quiet, but that was probably because he didn\u2019t know the right thing to say\u2014and she could understand that. Except then he gave her something more important than words.</p><p>He came over to her, kneeling down and reaching out his arms.</p><p>As she went into him, up against him, she sighed with gratitude.</p><p>Sometimes, you didn\u2019t need the right syllables.</p><p>You just needed the right person.</p><p>FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t mind if I go to your house?\u201d Elise asked a little while later.</p><p>She and Axe were back down on the street, the apartment shut up again, the memories of having walked through those rooms stained on Elise\u2019s brain forever\u2014even as a fragile peace began taking root in her heart.</p><p>\u201cAxe?\u201d she prompted into the bitterly cold wind.</p><p>Her male shook his head like he was trying to clear his own thoughts of where they\u2019d been. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with my going back to your place? I promise I\u2019m just going to sit in front of the fire and probably fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you there,\u201d he said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI like the idea of you in front of my fire. And my meeting shouldn\u2019t last too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad Peyton\u2019s okay and resting at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again for coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you.\u201d</p><p>Axe kissed her, and took his time about it. Then he stepped back. \u201cLet me get you to the cottage safe, and then I\u2019ll take off. I\u2019ve got to be at the meeting point in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She hurried away, and so did he, and then he was escorting her into the house\u2014and insisting that he get the fire going for her even though it meant he was going to be late.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get down to zero tonight,\u201d he said as he started stacking hardwood on the lit kindling. \u201cAll that Canada air coming south and turning us into Popsicles.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands up to her wind-burned cheeks. \u201cIt was really windy downtown, too. Hey, listen, I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Soon enough, the flames were snap-crackle-and-popping and he was disappearing into the rear of the cottage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m locking this back door,\u201d he yelled out from the kitchen. \u201cAnd I want you to lock the front one after I leave.\u201d</p><p>As he returned to the living room, she was already sitting in front of the hearth, but she got up again. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd call me if you see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy extra gun is under that sofa cushion, right there.

You\u2019re going to miss the bus\u2014and yes,\u201d she drawled, \u201cI\u2019ll be naked when you come back.\u201d</p><p>Axe let out a growl. \u201cOkay, there\u2019s an incentive.\u201d</p><p>A quick kiss and he was out the door\u2014and yelling, \u201cLock up! Or I\u2019m not leaving!\u201d</p><p>She laughed and went over, turning the dead bolt. \u201cLocked! Go!\u201d</p> <p>Elise went back and sat before the fire, tucking her legs up tight and linking her arms. In the peaceful solitude, she thought about Troy and how much she was looking forward to them starting that seminar after New Year\u2019s. He\u2019d been so understanding when she\u2019d told him that as much as she liked him, she had just started to see somebody, so there could be no dating between them. He had almost seemed relieved, explaining that it was probably for the best, given their professional association.</p><p>So all was good there.</p><p>And Axe was going to get her back and forth to the classes safely. She was even excited to have him see her teach\u2014</p><p>A gust of wind hit the side of the cottage, whistling through the shutters and making the eaves moan. When another hit, she turned around and looked behind her. She felt like she was being watched, but ... no.</p><p>There was no one around.</p><p>As a third battering gust of wind howled, she could swear she felt the chill inside. But maybe that was because her brain was bouncing between the actual violence she had witnessed the night before in that alley ... and the representations of violence she had seen at Allishon\u2019s.</p> <p>Even with her coat on, she got cold.</p><p>Axe had stoked the fire perfectly, though, and at least the front of her was warm. But she sure could use ...</p><p>Getting up, she went over to the chair by the front door. There was a nice heavy throw draped over the back, and as she picked it up, it smelled like Axe\u2019s body. Perfect.</p><p>Halfway on the return trip to the fire, something dropped out of its folds, and she bent down to\u2014</p><p>At first, Elise couldn\u2019t believe what she was looking at.</p><p>So much so, that instead of picking the object up, she knelt down next to it.</p><p>A piece of metal. Painted black. In an odd shape that was kind of like a key, but not really.</p><p>Her heart started pounding and she looked around, which was ridiculous. Like any of the furniture or those banked flames were going to help her reconcile the issue?</p> <p>Which was the fact that not more than fifteen minutes ago, give or take, she had looked at Axe and asked him what this \u201ckey\u201d was\u2014and he had told her he didn\u2019t know?</p><p>Letting the weight of the fabric fall to the floor, she flattened the expanse out ... and was entirely unsurprised to find that it was a cloak. Just like Allishon\u2019s\u2014</p><p>There was a large bulge on one side, and she ran her hands over it, wondering if she wanted to go any further with this. But of course, she had to. Heart pounding, she reached inside and\u2014</p><p>With a curse, she dropped the mask of a skull. The thing was evil looking, realistic to the point of nightmare, hinged so that he could talk while wearing it.</p><p>Her hands shook as she put the horror back. And then, bending down low, she breathed in deep\u2014and smelled Axe ... along with some other things.</p><p>That made her want to throw up.</p><p>Images and memories filtered through her brain: of the two of them together, talking downstairs in that cellar; of him smiling at her for the first time; of him kissing her outside of that steakhouse; of their bodies in front of this very fire.</p><p>Maybe there was some kind of confusion or ... an explanation for why he\u2019d lied to her.</p><p>Surely there had to be.</p><p>Folding the cloak back together, she stared at the metal object.</p><p>Yes, there most certainly was an explanation ... but she was abruptly scared of what it might be.</p><p>All in all, Peyton had it good.</p><p>He was reclining in his bed, his every need catered to by his family\u2019s staff, his pain controlled by some Oxys that were, for once, entirely legal. And what do you know, his head was working fine\u2014i.e., it was running his body and generating reasonable thought processes\u2014like, yes, definitely, he wanted the underdog Louisville Cardinals to beat Kentucky in men\u2019s basketball.</p><p>He had good money bet in Vegas with his bookie.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t say he was happy. Even with the feel-fine opiate in his system.</p><p>That shit with Novo was staying with him and not in a good way.</p><p>The issue for him was not so much that he cared he was a douche bag. Hell, if that bothered him, he\u2019d have hanged himself in the closet years ago.</p><p>It was the idea that Novo thought he was a douche bag that was putting a hair across his ass.</p><p>Shit, maybe he was more old-fashioned than he thought. He\u2019d certainly flown those same colors with Paradise when she\u2019d told him she was entering the training program\u2014and look at how that had worked out. She had ended up being the Primus, the number one trainee during that brutal orientation they\u2019d all been through.

Head injury or not, Peyton was going to castrate the bastard.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, patting the bed next to him. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d</p><p>But she paced around, and it was a while before she spoke. \u201cYou told me ... back in the beginning ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d he prompted gently. \u201cKeep talking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Axe ... that I didn\u2019t really know him.\u201d</p> <p>Motherfucker. \u201cYes, I did. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand into the pocket of her coat and took out an object. As soon as he saw it properly, he frowned. \u201cWhat are you doing with one of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what this is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pass to that sex club downtown. The Keys. I\u2019m not a member, but I\u2019ve seen them every once in a while. Allishon had at least one\u2014I asked her what it was once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is not hers.\u201d Elise stared at the thing. \u201cBut I went to her apartment tonight. I just had to\u2014Axe was with me. When I found the one that was hers, he said he didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo whose is that one?\u201d Peyton had already guessed, but he wanted her to have to say it.</p><p>\u201cAxe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he lied to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI found his, by mistake. It was in the pocket of this cloak. I found a mask of a skull, too. They\u2019re both his. I could smell his scent on them\u2014and it\u2019s fresh.\u201d</p><p>As she stopped talking and stared across at him, Peyton realized he was at a crossroads with her, and it was funny. After getting slapped with Novo\u2019s little asshole label, he wasn\u2019t going to enjoy being honest if that was what Elise wanted\u2014</p><p>\u201cI want you to be honest with me.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you disapprove of him because he\u2019s a civilian, because he likes hardcore sex, or ... because of something else?\u201d</p><p>Noting her past tense, he fell silent\u2014although things were far from quiet in his head: All he could hear was Novo\u2019s voice in his ear, railing on his double standards about males and females. About judging the two sexes differently.</p><p>And what do you know, lightning kind of struck Marblehead: If he thought females who slept around were sluts ... that meant it was the female\u2019s fault that he himself was sexually promiscuous and kind of cruel when it came to the opposite sex. After all, if fucking was okay for males, but not females, then no matter how many people he banged without feeling, no matter how many hearts he trampled, nobody could hold him accountable.</p><p>\u2019Cuz he was a male.</p><p>It was the ultimate unassailable justification for being an asshole.</p><p>Peyton closed his eyes and rested his head back against his downy soft pillows. All things considered, given that he had been shot in the noggin the night before, he could have done without that flash of insight.</p><p>Mostly because the OxyContin, no matter how good it was at erasing his physical pain, didn\u2019t touch the emotional burn in the center of his chest.</p><p>The one that informed him he was not a nice guy. In spite of his looks. His money. His breeding.</p><p>Novo was right ... he was an asshole.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t put you in this position\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. You\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. She was an emotional wreck and he was starting to feel like he was having an identity crisis.</p><p>\u201cI should go\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sharply, and opened his eyes. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to get in the middle of you two. I did last night and it nearly got us all killed\u2014and even though there aren\u2019t any lessers around right now and nobody is armed, I just ... I\u2019m going to try and not be such a judgmental dickhead.\u201d</p><p>He was going to have to apologize to Axe, too.</p><p>\u201cNovo ... is that female who fought with us last night. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>Peyton nodded. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten her name. But you introduced her that first evening I met everyone at the cigar bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise\u2019s eyes started to water, except then she sniffed hard and blinked while looking up at the ceiling. \u201cHer scent was on the cloak. I didn\u2019t put it together until I was dematerializing over here\u2014but I scented her in the mobile surgical van when she was with us. I remember what she ...\u201d As Peyton looked away, Elise\u2019s voice got steady. \u201cHe was with her. And recently. Like within the last night or two.\u201d</p><p>Peyton just kept his mouth shut. Funny, as early as the night before, he would have jumped at this opportunity to take a shit all over Axe.</p><p>And he was jealous\u2014but not when it came to Elise. He was pissed that the fucker had been with Novo.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cthe only piece of advice I can give you is to go with your gut. It\u2019s never wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what it\u2019s telling me, then, is that while he and I were together, he was going to a hardcore club and having sex with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Peyton shook his head. \u201cI knew this was going to come to a bad end for you. I mean, shit, I\u2019m aware that you two are consenting adults and all, but this is exactly why I told him to stay the fuck away from you.\u201d</p><p>Ordinarily, he loved being right.</p><p>But not tonight, he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Not at all.</p> <p>FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>As Mary sat at her desk at Safe Place, she accomplished absolutely nothing.</p><p>Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly true. She succeeded, quite admirably if she did say so herself, in moving a pile of paperwork from the right corner to the left\u2014and, in the process, managed to review every page in said pile of case notes, intake forms, and schedules for grammatical errors, typos, and coffee stains.</p><p>Real high-level stuff.</p><p>Yup. She\u2019d located several its-versus-it\u2019s problems, a there instead of a their, and, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, an orientated versus the American English oriented.</p><p>Go. Her.</p> <p>Sitting back in her squeaky chair, she swiped the mouse pad and checked the time on her computer screen. Holy crap. It was three a.m.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard from Rhage\u2014and guessed that quick meeting about the attack on those trainees from the night before hadn\u2019t been all that quick.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she smelled chocolate chip cookie dough cooking in the ovens downstairs, and a wave of sadness hit her. She could remember trying to get Bitty to participate in the community baking right after her mother had died. The little girl had preferred to sit upstairs in the attic room she had shared with her mahmen, those battered suitcases all packed with her meager possessions, her stuffed tiger and that doll head beside her on the bed.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t even known her real age at that point.</p><p>God, that seemed like a million years ago\u2014</p><p>Her phone went off, and as she checked the text, she hoped it was Rhage. She needed an excuse to leave\u2014</p><p>It was not from him.</p><p>As her hands began to shake, she got to her feet, tucked her blouse into her slacks, and carefully pulled on her coat. Then she picked up her purse and her phone.</p> <p>Instead of telling everyone down below that she was going, she just sent a message to the group that she was leaving.</p><p>Now was not the time to stand in front of anybody and speak about anything\u2014especially not the compassionate females who worked here and would read her like a book.</p><p>Outside, the night was terribly cold and that seemed appropriate. After she got into the Volvo and started the engine, she went miles before any appreciable heat came out of the vents, but it was okay. She was too numb to feel either hot or cold.</p><p>The King\u2019s Audience House was some distance away and yet her destination arrived too quickly. Then again, her intention had been to use the drive to collect herself\u2014and really, she could have gone to California and back and not felt any different.</p><p>Just as she was getting out by the garage, Rhage was materializing.</p><p>As she saw him, there was a temptation to rush into his arms and wail again, but she was over that. She didn\u2019t have the energy, even if the emotions in her chest remained that big and hard to manage.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said in a dull voice. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p><p>They entered through the back door, using the code, and then walked through the kitchen, heading for that library.</p><p>When they entered the formal room, Bitty was sitting on the sofa in front of the fire. Next to her uncle.</p><p>Damn, the family resemblance was so clear.</p><p>Do not cry, Mary said to herself as she forced a smile. Do not make Bitty feel one ounce of guilt over this.</p><p>You\u2019re the adult. She\u2019s the victim of domestic abuse, an orphan, and a child.</p><p>Do not make this worse.</p><p>Of course, all that self-talk didn\u2019t really change the way she felt. But at least the stern lecturing distracted her from melting down.</p><p>Marissa was seated beside the pair of blood relations and she got to her feet with enviable grace. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>As if they were outside third parties attending a meeting in a lawyer\u2019s office. For, like, a fence dispute.</p><p>Except they were third parties, Mary reminded herself.</p><p>Somehow, she and Rhage managed to sit down on the sofa across from Bitty and Ruhn. Things were said. Who knew what. And Rhage was as quiet as she was.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t meet Bitty in the eye for more than a second or two, and she needed to work on that\u2014</p><p>\u201cSo, Ruhn? Or Bitty?\u201d Marissa said. \u201cWould you like to speak now?\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, and Mary was the one who broke it. Looking right into Bitty\u2019s eyes, she said in a voice that mostly didn\u2019t crack, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Bitty. It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all going to be\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll let him move here?\u201d the little girl said. \u201cAnd live with us?\u201d</p><p>Mary blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014what?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Bitty looked at her uncle. \u201cI want him to come live with the three of us. And he said he would. He doesn\u2019t need to be adopted like you guys are doing with me. But he has no family, and we have a big family, and Father always says the more the merrier? And we live in a big house. There is room. Ruhn can help, you know. That\u2019s his job.\u201d</p><p>Mary shook her head again. Opened and closed her mouth. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p> <p>Rhage leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>Ruhn cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to keep me in South Carolina. Bitty\u2019s my only family and I could use a fresh start\u2014I don\u2019t have to live with you all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d Bitty looked at him and spoke firmly. \u201cWe have a big house. And we have a cat and a dog. You like cats and dogs. You will come and live with us, and my parents will make sure you have work\u2014Mom? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Mary couldn\u2019t answer. Not with the tears streaming down her face and her breath catching in her throat and her whole body feeling like it was going to explode.</p><p>Putting her head in her hands, she was so overcome, all she could do was sit there and cry.</p> <p>Bitty\u2019s voice was close to her when the little girl spoke next. \u201cYou\u2019ll like him, Mom. I promise.\u201d</p><p>All Mary could do was reach out ... and pull her daughter in tight. There were no words, no words, no words at all.</p><p>Wait. No, there were: \u201cI know I\u2019m going to just love him.\u201d</p><p>Rhage\u2019s first thought was that this was the dream. He was finally in a dream, and of course, his subconscious was kicking out a fantasy world where everything worked out okay. Yup. Any second, the alarm was going to go off and they\u2019d be back in hell.</p><p>Except ... no electronic dinging.</p><p>Rhage put a hand out, aware that Bitty and Mary were hugging and talking and Mary was crying.</p> <p>The fighter side of him, the part that had been honed by countless cluster-fucks in countless engagements in the war, was no more willing to believe this than he would Santa Claus coming down a chimney.</p><p>Rhage got to his feet and nodded at Ruhn. \u201cI want to talk to you. Alone.\u201d</p><p>The uncle didn\u2019t hesitate to rise to his full height. \u201cAnywhere you want.\u201d</p><p>Naturally, nobody was going to let him be alone with the guy: Vishous, who Rhage hadn\u2019t even been aware of being in the room, came with them as they stepped out into the rear part of the foyer and closed the doors of the library.</p><p>But Rhage wasn\u2019t about to, well, rage.</p><p>He kept his voice down and his eyes leveled on the guy. \u201cI thought you came here to take her away.\u201d</p><p>The male nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s changed? And think this over carefully. Because my shellan is bleeding to death in there. Again. And I\u2019m getting really fucking bored with what\u2019s making her cry.\u201d</p> <p>Ruhn stepped off, but didn\u2019t back away. Instead, he paced around, his big body clearly unable to contain his emotions.</p><p>\u201cYes, I wanted to take her back to South Carolina with me. I did. And I won\u2019t apologize to you or anyone else for wanting to do right by my bloodline. But then I got here ... and I was only told she was in foster care. I didn\u2019t know that you all had started an adoption process until later. I really liked the both of you, and it was clear Bitty was well cared for. But last night ... when you came through that door and you\u2019d been shot at?\u201d He pointed to the front entrance of the mansion. \u201cYou were frantic to get here and help them. And when Bitty saw you, she was terrified and relieved. Then the three of you were together. Right there.\u201d</p><p>The male went over and stood in the spot. \u201cI was looking at all of you, and I thought ... that is a family. Right there. That is ... what I wished for my sister but knew she wasn\u2019t going to get with that male of hers. It was what I\u2019d hoped to bring to Bitty\u2019s life\u2014but she already has it, see. With you guys. She told me about how you took her in. What you\u2019ve been teaching her about movies and cars and life. How good Mary is with her. How Mary took care of my sister at that place for the battered females. How you two stayed with her during her procedure for her bones\u2014and about your beast. And by the way, wow, is all I can say about that.\u201d Ruhn shook his head. \u201cShe talked non-stop about the two of you. She loves you like you\u2019re her blood. And my stuff with my sister? That\u2019s not enough to justify breaking up a family. It just isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Rhage just stood where he was and blinked like an idiot. \u201cSo ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sign whatever you want. You know, to make it legal.\u201d The male put his palms up. \u201cAnd honest, I don\u2019t have to move in or anything. I don\u2019t want to impose. That\u2019s her idea\u2014but I would like ... I don\u2019t know, if you could see your way clear, to letting me see her maybe once every couple of years\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage was not aware of moving. But the next thing he knew, he was throwing a bone-crusher around the guy, holding that fucking uncle so tight, the muscles in his shoulders and arms popped hard.</p><p>\u201cYou will come and you will live at the mansion.\u201d He shoved the guy back and then had to catch Ruhn as he tottered on his work boots. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll find a job for you. And you will stay with us. And that is the way it is going to be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruhn seemed nonplussed. \u201cAh ...\u201d</p><p>Vishous spoke up. \u201cWrath has to approve this.

The meeting had gone on forever, new procedures being put in place for them entering the field downtown, new weapons being fitted for and ordered, reviews of defensive practices drilled into their heads until he\u2019d wanted to scream.</p><p>But at least the Brothers weren\u2019t stepping back from having the trainees engage with the enemy. Not at all.</p><p>The good news? Now he got to rush home to Elise.</p> <p>After a quick goodbye over his shoulder, Axe went ghost and then materialized on his front lawn. Smelling the burning fire and sensing her presence, he smiled.</p><p>It was amazing how much someone could bring to your life. Fill you out on the inside. Make you feel stronger and more peaceful at the same time.</p><p>He climbed the front steps, knocked on the door, and was so ready to have her answer it ...</p><p>When nothing happened, he frowned. Knocked again. Then took out a set of keys he hadn\u2019t though he\u2019d need to use. Opening the way up, he\u2014</p><p>The first thing he noticed was that Elise wasn\u2019t sitting in front of the fireplace, on the blankets where they made love.</p><p>She was on the sofa, almost out of reach of the heat.</p> <p>The second thing he tweaked to was ... that she had the cloak he wore to The Keys in her lap.</p><p>Axe closed the door slowly.</p><p>As she looked over at him, she met his eyes calmly. But her face was shut down, no emotion showing at all, no life in her eyes or her expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d he said, keeping his voice level.</p><p>Crossing his arms, he leaned back against the door. In his head, a litany of She\u2019s leaving you, she knows, she\u2019s leaving you, she knows ... you\u2019re going to be just like your father ... started up, a bad chorus that was off-key, off-tempo, and the kind of thing that was going to make him mental.</p><p>\u201cSo I found this,\u201d she said, running her hands over the black folds. \u201cAnd I found what\u2019s in it. The mask ... and the key.\u201d</p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom\u2014</p><p>For a split second, he looked over his shoulder, thinking that that sound must be someone beating on the kitchen door to get into the cottage.</p> <p>Nope. It was his heart.</p><p>\u201cI, ah, I\u2019ve been sitting here, thinking, for hours.\u201d She scratched the base of her nose. \u201cRunning through things to say to you in my head. Questions to ask you\u2014like how could you possibly stand in front of me at Allishon\u2019s and pretend you didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d found there. How could you lie to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped as her voice got higher and more urgent, and seemed to re-collect herself.</p><p>\u201cSo I went to Peyton\u2019s, right after I found your key ... found that you\u2019d lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered. He could only imagine how the guy had enjoyed fucking him up the ass with all kinds of\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t go into it with me. He didn\u2019t really say anything. And I respect him for staying out of this. I shouldn\u2019t have put him in that position in the first place. But I didn\u2019t know where else to go, and sometimes, when people are emotional, they don\u2019t make the best choices.\u201d</p><p>Axe waited, knowing that the hammer was about to fall\u2014and it did.</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess ... that\u2019s my conclusion.\u201d She motioned between the two of them. \u201cThe night I met you, I\u2019d decided to date Troy. It was as random a decision as they come. What I realize now is that what happened to Allishon and the stress in my household were eroding parts of me that I was unaware of becoming weak. I was flailing around, looking for an outlet\u2014and then I met you. I threw myself into this\u2014whatever it was\u2014between us, headlong and out of control.\u201d</p><p>Annnnd there it was, he thought. Past tense.</p><p>Was. Not is.</p><p>\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d she concluded, \u201cyou don\u2019t owe me anything. We\u2019re not in a relationship. The fact that you had sex with Novo at that club and then came home and were with me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, say what?\u201d he barked. \u201cWhen did this happen? If you\u2019re going to rewrite history, at least give me a timeline so I can keep up here.\u201d</p><p>Elise shot him a bored look. \u201cYou took her to the club. Two nights ago. And don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t. I was right here when she called and you wanted to make sure she was home safe. At the time, I didn\u2019t put two and two together, because I didn\u2019t remember the name of the female who was with you the night we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with her. That night, or any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s true. But I can\u2019t believe you. I can\u2019t believe anything you tell me. You didn\u2019t even correct me when I said she was \u2018he.\u2019 You lied to me about knowing what the key was at Allishon\u2019s. How will I ever know if you\u2019re being truthful?\u201d</p><p>Axe laughed in a hard burst. \u201cI told you shit I haven\u2019t told anybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you? Or was that an act to get my sympathy, falsely gain my trust?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cThis is the problem with lying, Axe. You do it once, and the other person has no idea what else you\u2019ve been untruthful about. I come from a family of lies and silence. I can\u2019t go into that shadow world with someone I\u2019m intimate with. Moreover, I won\u2019t do it. I told you in the beginning, honesty is the most important thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonesty? You want to talk about honesty? You\u2019ve been sneaking out of your father\u2019s house for how long? And you only came clean about what you were doing when you got caught. You switched phones with your BFF Peyton so no one knew where you were when you were with me. You broke in to your cousin\u2019s fucking apartment.\u201d He jabbed a finger across the tense air at her. \u201cYou want to make me out to be an asshole, fine. Have at it. But don\u2019t pretend for an instant that you\u2019re in some holier-than-thou ivory tower. Because that\u2019s bullshit, sweetheart. The only difference is, I\u2019m not judging you and I\u2019m not jumping to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>Elise looked toward the dying fire. After a moment, she nodded. \u201cAll of that is fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you for that seal of approval. It means so much to me.\u201d</p><p>She got to her feet and laid the cloak aside, placing that fucking key on the folds. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, though. The reality is, I\u2019m not mad at you for sleeping with Novo or going to the club or playing dumb\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d She turned to face him. And with the way she was staring at him, he knew without a doubt, this was the last time they were going to be in an enclosed space together. \u201cI\u2019m mad at myself. I\u2019m mad that I didn\u2019t recognize I was addressing an emotional problem concerning my dysfunctional family-of-origin with the distraction of a poorly thought-out physical affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, looks like you\u2019ve got it all figured out. You\u2019ve even tagged it with fancy therapy-speak. Good for you.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, he was being a bitter son of a bitch, but what the fuck else was he supposed to do. Judge, jury, guilty verdict\u2014it was all finished, all wrapped up. And he was going to the death chamber.</p><p>Because that\u2019s what life was going to be without her.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Elise shook her head slowly and put on her coat. \u201cI had no business jumping into anything, with anybody. And like I said, I don\u2019t blame you. You didn\u2019t owe me a thing. It\u2019s not like we had some big conversation about monogamy and then you went out and were with other people. I\u2019ve only known you a week, so ... there you go. Lesson learned.\u201d</p><p>Axe narrowed his eyes. \u201cAnd what exactly did you learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the only person you can really trust is yourself. And as long as you remember that, you\u2019re going to be okay. No matter what happens.\u201d</p> <p>As Elise finished saying her piece, she stared across the room at Axe ... and felt like she was looking at a stranger.</p><p>Which was actually more accurate than the illusion of closeness and intimacy that had been created thanks to the really good sex they\u2019d had together. But come on. The Scribe Virgin, when She created the race, had set things up right. Because pregnancy could be a result of sex, during a time of needing, and young were deadly to bear and hard to raise, the male and female had to reeealllly want to get it on so that the species survived.</p><p>Otherwise no one would take the risk. Ever.</p><p>So sexual tension and sexual expression were powerful things\u2014and potentially destructive when what made procreation possible for the species was brought to bear in a casual affair between two people who otherwise had no business being together.</p><p>Elise was living proof of it.</p><p>And yes, she wanted to go into her feelings of hurt, rejection, and betrayal with Axe. She wanted to yell and scream, throw something. Kick him, maybe. But she knew damn well that was a persuasion thing, a negotiation, in addition to a punishment: By revealing more of herself to him instead of less, she was looking for him to do a complete turnaround and become, once again, who she had believed him to be.</p><p>But what was the saying? When somebody showed you who they were, you needed to believe them the first time.</p><p>Axe\u2019s true colors had come out. But only because he\u2019d slipped up, and gotten caught by a happenstance of facts and circumstance.</p> <p>Elise had laid Allishon to rest tonight. And now she was putting this ... thing ... between her and Axe down along with her cousin.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to go now. I wish you well, and I will not speak of this again to anyone. You do as you wish, however. I don\u2019t need you to protect me. I\u2019m a big girl, and if there\u2019s fallout, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>Because actually, her situation with him wasn\u2019t the only thing she\u2019d been mulling over as she\u2019d sat here alone and waited for him to come home.</p><p>She\u2019d arrived at some other conclusions, too.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Axe.\u201d</p><p>Her body was a little shaky as she approached him, but not because she was afraid of him hurting her or saying something awful: Proximity was just hard ... even though her mind had changed gears when it came to him, her corporeal form still wanted his.</p><p>That was never happening again, though.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re really going into the right field,\u201d he said as he got out of her way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d</p><p>His eyes shifted over to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to make a great professor. You excel at one-sided conversations and you have all the answers. You\u2019ve given me an F, kicked me out of the class, and you\u2019re ready for the next student. And you feel terrific about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot terrific.

And you\u2019ve just proved my position all over again.\u201d</p><p>He leaned to the side and opened the door; then he walked away without looking back.</p><p>Which was fine.</p> <p>She was going to do the same.</p><p>Once outside, Elise dematerialized back to her house, and after she went in through the front door, she proceeded directly to her father\u2019s study. Knocking on the closed panels, she waited ... and then let herself in.</p><p>He was, as always, at his desk. Dressed impeccably. Shuffling papers. Working on his investments.</p><p>\u201cWell, good evening, daughter mine. How fare thee?\u201d</p><p>Elise ditched the preamble and sat down without being invited to do so. \u201cI\u2019m moving out as soon as I find a suitable place to live. I have some money that mahmen left me, and I\u2019m also going to be taking on more hours at the university for pay. I\u2019d like to stay here while I apartment hunt, but if that makes you uncomfortable, I\u2019ll locate other accommodations.\u201d</p> <p>As her father dropped his pen, and his lower jaw, she nodded. \u201cAnd yes, my mind\u2019s made up. I\u2019m sorry if this causes you any grief or embarrassment, and I would very much like to continue to have a relationship with you. That\u2019s your choice, of course, and if you need to distance yourself from me temporarily or even permanently, it will break my heart, but I will understand.\u201d</p><p>She got back to her feet. \u201cI need to go live my own life, on my own terms\u2014and that\u2019s not something that you, or anyone else, can grant me permission to do or withhold permission from me for. It\u2019s up to me, and me alone. And actually ... I\u2019m really good with that.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY</p><p>The following evening at around midnight, Mary stood to the side and watched Bitty walk Ruhn through the vestibule and into the great, colorful foyer of the Black Dagger Brotherhood\u2019s mansion.</p><p>Bitty\u2019s uncle had been interviewed by Wrath, and actually all the males of the household, the night before\u2014and you want to talk about a grilling? The poor guy had been two feet shorter after the interrogations were through, and Mary and Bitty had practically had to pour him into one of the beds down below at Darius\u2019s.</p><p>And then there had been the trip down South right after sunset, Ruhn, Rhage, and V heading back to where Ruhn stayed, and talking to his employer, who hadn\u2019t required notice. There had been so little in terms of personal belongings that the three of them had been able to fill up some backpacks and duffels and dematerialize the stuff up here to Caldwell, traveling at jumps of fifty to a hundred miles.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful!\u201d Bitty exclaimed as she let go of the male\u2019s hand and started to jump around. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry, you get used to it. I promise!\u201d</p><p>Ruhn looked like his head was spinning as his eyes bounced around the gold leafing and the crystal and the columns. \u201cIt\u2019s ... well, I\u2019ve worked in a big mansion. But nothing like this.\u201d</p><p>Bitty grabbed his hand again and dragged him into the billiards room. \u201cCome meet the pool tables!\u201d</p><p>As the pair of them went off, Rhage put his arm around Mary and whispered, \u201cHis place was spotlessly clean, my Mary, but there was nothing in it. Just a bed and table with one chair. Breaks your fucking heart\u2014he was prepared to make it work, though. His employer told me that Ruhn was going to take on more hours to put Bitty in school on the estate. He was ready to do his best.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, there was a chiming sound from the vestibule door and Mary glanced at the security screen. \u201cOh, it\u2019s Saxton.\u201d</p><p>She went over and let the King\u2019s attorney in. \u201cCome to join the festivities?\u201d</p><p>The blond-haired lawyer was perfectly dressed as always, a cravat at his neck, his dark suit set off with a coral shirt and pocket square. And oh, dear Lord, did he smell good.</p><p>And also, oh, dear Lord, did it feel great to be lighthearted enough to notice that kind of thing.</p> <p>Ever since Ruhn and Bitty had come forward with The Plan, as Mary thought of it, she felt as though her life had been returned to her. It was incredible. Everything was back to normal, almost like the pain and fear and uncertainty had never happened.</p><p>And it was funny ... Although Mary didn\u2019t know firsthand what birth was like, she decided that she had been through something at least emotionally similar: She had been out of control, in pain, grinding through hours and days, terrified and in a nightmare that seemed to have no end. Then there had been some tearing, and a vital separation ... only, in the end, to have her daughter in her arms, safe, the world righted once again, her life more complete than ever because the transition was over and everyone was okay on the other side.</p><p>It was a miracle\u2014and the pain, instead of crippling her and Bitty, had just made their bond stronger.</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Saxton said, \u201cI\u2019ve brought the paperwork Ruhn requested.\u201d</p><p>As the attorney took a folded sheaf of papers out of his inside pocket, Mary was very aware that both she and Rhage went totally still.</p><p>\u201cRuhn just has to sign them,\u201d Saxton explained gently.</p><p>\u201cSign what?\u201d the male said, as he came back into the foyer with Bitty. \u201cOh. Yes, please.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, Saxton turned\u2014and did a double take.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met, have you,\u201d Mary said. \u201cSaxton, this is Bitty\u2019s uncle, Ruhn. Ruhn, this is Saxton, keeper of all papers, strategist, and all-around great person.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saxton stared at the other male as Ruhn bowed low. \u201cSire.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.

Just Saxton.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn stared at what was outstretched in confusion. \u201cMy ... ah, my hands are rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Saxton murmured as he dropped his arm. \u201cWould you care to review this and give it your signature?\u201d</p> <p>As things got quiet, Mary stepped up. \u201cAre you sure you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ruhn said. \u201cThere needs to be clarity in the event decisions have to be made or if she is unable to communicate in a medical crisis.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, Mary got teary again. And then she remembered his limitations. \u201cBut you need to know what it says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says you are her parents, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cThen I shall sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is prudent,\u201d Saxton interjected. \u201cSo let us go into the library and you two should come as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Mary said as she started across the depiction of an apple tree in full bloom. \u201cRhage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight behind you. Bitty, give the grown-ups two secs, \u2019kay? Go find Lassiter and kick him in the butt for me, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it!\u201d the girl said as she tore off in search of the angel.</p><p>Once inside the library, Mary shut the doors\u2014and saw that Ruhn was staring at the tree. \u201cOh, that\u2019s our Christmas stuff. I\u2019m human\u2014or I was. You know. Ah, long story.\u201d</p> <p>Which made her think of something\u2014</p><p>\u201cWould you read the papers to me?\u201d Ruhn asked her. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ... yes. Yes, of course.\u201d She took the document from Saxton and they all sat in front of the fire. \u201cThis is ...\u201d She had to clear her throat as she held the pages out in front of Ruhn. \u201cThis is a release of all your ... parental rights to Bitty.\u201d She pointed to places. \u201cSee, this is your name. This is her name. This text here states that forevermore, you will not make any claim to any custody of her, physical or otherwise, or claim any benefits that may accrue to her, or be a party or consulted about any decisions that affect her life. Do you know ... I mean, once you sign this, it\u2019s done. It can\u2019t be undone.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn stared at the paper and then pointed to his name. \u201cThat\u2019s my name, right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHers ... is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the words for a while. \u201cFunny, this is the only time our names will ever be together.\u201d</p> <p>Mary swallowed a knot in her throat. \u201cRuhn, you don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes someone have a pen?\u201d the male said.</p><p>Saxton, who seemed to be holding in some kind of emotion, put a gold one out. \u201cHere, use mine.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn took the writing instrument and seemed amazed by it. Then he appeared worried. \u201cI can\u2019t ... I don\u2019t really have a signature. I don\u2019t know how to write my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny mark,\u201d Saxton said in a soft voice, \u201cwill suffice. And I will witness it as your own down below. You want to put it here.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn nodded as the lawyer pointed out a line three-quarters of the way down the second page. And then Bitty\u2019s uncle bent down over the document.</p><p>He was there for quite a while. Much longer than the two secs it took for most people to scrawl their name.</p><p>When he sat back up again, Mary covered her mouth with her palm.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Ruhn said, pointing to the small sketch he\u2019d made of his face. \u201cThat is my mark.\u201d</p><p>It was an absolutely beautiful rendering of his features. And everyone grew silent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all I know how to do,\u201d Ruhn explained.</p><p>Saxton pinched the brow of his nose. \u201cNo, no ... it\u2019s perfectly lovely. And perfectly sufficient.\u201d</p><p>Saxton did his thing, notarizing the document, and then the lawyer was standing up. \u201cI shall go file this at the Audience House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back, though,\u201d Mary said. \u201cPlease? We\u2019re going to have a little welcome party at the end of the night, and you should come if you can.\u201d</p><p>The attorney looked at Ruhn briefly. \u201cAll right. Thank you, I shall.\u201d</p><p>On the bus ride in to the training center, Axe sat in the rear, far away from the others. Peyton, meanwhile, stayed up front, choosing a seat close to the partition that separated them from the butler driver.</p><p>Elise\u2019s cousin hadn\u2019t looked back as he\u2019d gotten on the bus. Didn\u2019t look back as they made the trip north.</p><p>But he also didn\u2019t get off when they stopped inside the parking area and everybody else went in for class.</p><p>\u201cYou waiting for me?\u201d Axe said when they were alone.</p><p>Now the male turned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to attack you from behind, you know. I can do that right in your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Peyton shifted his legs around and put his elbows on his knees. As he stared straight ahead, his mood was hard to read. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you heard Elise came to see me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she let me know it, all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about you and Novo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good for you. Elise told me how much she hates liars, and considering I\u2019ve never fucked Novo, at least you\u2019re clean on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your concern, not mine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn fucking right. And I also haven\u2019t been with Novo.\u201d</p><p>The long silence was a surprise, but Axe didn\u2019t really care one way or another. \u201cWe done here? FYI, I\u2019m not going to cut you or anything. I don\u2019t want anything to fucking do with you, but that hasn\u2019t changed since orientation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father called me. She\u2019s moving out of the house. He\u2019s requested that I keep an eye out for her and I\u2019ve agreed to do that.\u201d</p><p>Elise was leaving home? Holy shit.</p> <p>Except then Axe reminded himself that it wasn\u2019t really his business anymore, was it.</p><p>\u201cSo you got what you want.\u201d Axe got to his feet. \u201cCongratulations. Then again, shit always works out for people like you, doesn\u2019t it\u2014\u201d</p><p>Novo came up the short steps and leaned into the bus. \u201cAre you two killing each other or something?\u201d</p><p>Axe shook his head. \u201cNope. We\u2019re good\u2014oh, but he thinks I fucked you three nights ago\u2014or whenever it was we went to the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>Novo stared at Peyton. \u201cAxe put me up for membership. That\u2019s why he took me there. And it was because I asked him to\u2014oh, and Axe shut me down when I asked him if he wanted to be with me. Turned me down flat. Jesus, Peyton, could you be any more of an asshole?\u201d</p><p>Axe walked forward, shaking his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. S\u2019all good. Moving on.\u201d</p><p>Pushing past Novo, he stepped off the bus, went over to the door that had been propped open, and entered the training center.</p><p>As he headed for the gym, where they were going to be sparring, he was aware of a whole lot of things: He was exhausted, for one thing, but he had a feeling he needed to get used to that. He was in pain, but yeah, file that along with the former.</p><p>And he was terrified.</p> <p>In his head, he was monitoring each and every thought he had, checking for signs that he was going to crash and burn as his father had. It was like he was searching for cracks in his foundation, waiting for his superstructure to collapse, anticipating the paralysis that he had watched for years.</p><p>He was already crippled on the inside. Surely the outside was going to go, too.</p><p>Because the truly pathetic thing? He had bonded with Elise.</p><p>Yes, as she had pointed out, it had been only a matter of nights, but\u2014as he had so often heard, and never truly believed\u2014when it came to males and their soul mates? It didn\u2019t take time; it took the right female.</p><p>And Elise was right for him even if he was wrong for her.</p><p>So yeah, he was crippled and going to remain that way for the rest of his life.</p><p>But what the hell.</p><p>He\u2019d already been crippled before. He was used to this.</p> <p>Just as some people were destined to be happy?</p><p>Others simply didn\u2019t win that lottery.</p><p>FIFTY-ONE</p><p>At the end of the evening, as everyone at the Brotherhood mansion came together and took their seats in the dining room, Rhage waited for Mary to give him the cue.</p><p>And when she did, just as the feast of Last Meal was being served, he turned to Bitty, who was next to him. \u201cHey, will you come with me and your mom for a second? Nothing is wrong, we just need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d The little girl was up and at \u2019em, ready to go. \u201cUncle Ruhn, I\u2019m going to be right back. You stay with the BABUs!\u201d</p><p>The male blinked in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>Lassiter leaned in. \u201cBuffoons. She has a speech impediment. It\u2019s really sad\u2014\u201d</p><p>Bitty nailed the angel in the arm. \u201cBad-Ass Big Uncles. And will you stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d the angel cackled. Before giving Bitty a playful tug on her hair.</p><p>As Bitty skipped out ahead and Rhage drew Mary in against him, he called out, \u201cThe library, okay? Bit, we\u2019re going in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoger that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he whispered to his shellan. As she nodded, he murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>When they were all in there together, he shut the doors. Man, it felt like he was back in his own skin, his own life, his own ocean, swimming freely with the current instead of against it. And Mary was the same way\u2014Dearest Virgin Scribe, it was good to see the light back in his shellan\u2019s eyes and the smile on her face.</p><p>And as for Ruhn? The guy was a gem. Quiet, dignified in himself, not a pansy, either. He had insisted on carrying his things up to the guest room he\u2019d been given down the hall of statues. And was already looking for projects to fix, clean, or improve.</p><p>Fritz was going to learn to hate the motherfucker.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bitty said\u2014before she got distracted by the Christmas tree. \u201cOh, my\u2014we need to celebrate your holiday, Mom. But not yet. Ruhn needs presents. We need to ... we need to figure out what he likes and I have an allowance. I can get him some myself\u2014but you guys need to, too.\u201d</p><p>Mary laughed and drew the girl over to the sofa. \u201cAbsolutely, we will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! So what\u2019s going on\u2014Father, we need to watch Deadpool with him. He hasn\u2019t seen any movies. Like, ever. Not even Jaws. I have a draft list, and I want you to go through it with me. We\u2019ll set up a viewing schedule just like we did for me.\u201d</p><p>Rhage nodded. \u201cAbsolutely. That kind of deficit is more important than literacy.\u201d</p><p>Mary put her head in her hands. \u201cYou two are insane.\u201d</p><p>Rhage put his palm out for a high five and Bit slapped it with her own. \u201cNailed it,\u201d Rhage said. \u201cNow, we need to get serious. Your mom has something she needs to tell you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bitty focused on their Mary. \u201cG\u2019head, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Jeez, it felt good to have that word back in their vocabulary.</p><p>In the short silence that followed, Rhage frowned and looked around.</p><p>For some reason, he was aware that they were not alone ... and yet no one else seemed to be in the library with them.</p> <p>Mary took Bit\u2019s hand and smoothed the back of it. \u201cDo you remember when I told you I was sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cancer isn\u2019t back?\u201d the girl asked with fear. \u201cYou aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Absolutely not. And that\u2019s kind of what I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? ... I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>In a steady stream of perfectly chosen words, Mary told the story from start to finish. The cancer. Rhage coming into her life. The Scribe Virgin\u2019s intervention ... and what it meant.</p> <p>\u201cYou mean ... you\u2019re immortal?\u201d Bit breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re like a god or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, no, not a god. Never. That is one job I wouldn\u2019t want. But it does mean ... well, think of it like this. I get to choose when I go into the Fade. Like, you know how everyone ages along a line? They get older every year? And sometimes bad things happen to them and they get sick or hurt or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. As with Father when he was shot. Before his vests. Or ... what happened to my mahmen.\u201d</p><p>As Mary reached up and stroked the little girl\u2019s face, Rhage thought, Oh, my two females. My two perfect females in the firelight ...</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that for me,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>\u201cSo you can live as long as I do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>Bitty\u2019s eyes got watery. And then she threw her arms around Mary. \u201cSo you\u2019ll never leave me. I\u2019ll never lose my mother.\u201d</p><p>Okaaaaay, time for some throat clearing.</p><p>\u201cNever. Ever.\u201d Mary held the girl and smiled through beautiful tears. \u201cNot ever. And I didn\u2019t want to hide this from you\u2014but I also didn\u2019t want it influencing your decision to stay with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel lucky. I just feel so lucky.\u201d Bitty pulled back and looked at Rhage. \u201cBut what about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBulletproof vests, my girl.\u201d He sniffed like he had allergies. \u2019Cuz it wasn\u2019t like he was crying or some shit. Nah. \u201cTraining and equipment. It\u2019s what I told you before, I go out to do my job and intend to come home to my females every night.\u201d</p><p>Bitty got quiet for a moment. But then she nodded. \u201cOkay, but you\u2019ll be careful\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage frowned as something caught his eye.</p> <p>A sun spot. On the carpet. By the tree.</p><p>\u201cLassiter,\u201d he called out. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The angel appeared all at once, his blond-and-black hair and his gold hoops and necklaces and earrings creating that aura he always had. Or hell, that glow was probably just him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I say?\u201d the angel demanded as he Vanna-White\u2019d the three of them. In zebra-striped leggings that were clearly out of Steven Tyler\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cHave faith. Believe. And all will be well. What. Did. I. Say.\u201d</p><p>Rhage had to laugh. \u201cFantastic. Another reason for you to be full of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatness is as greatness does.\u201d The angel pivoted in a circle and then pulled a Michael Jackson, moonwalking backward until he popped up onto the toes of his shoes. \u201cAnd I am awwwwwwesommmme.\u201d</p><p>Mary and Bitty started laughing, too, and Rhage just sat back and smiled.</p><p>Then he started to think. Okay, so if Ruhn hadn\u2019t even seen Jaws, where did they start?</p><p>Probably not there. Or with Jason. Michael. Freddy. The guy wasn\u2019t a pussy by any stretch, but for godsakes, you didn\u2019t want to make him crap in his pants, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Mary asked.</p><p>Rhage rubbed his face and looked at Bitty. \u201cYou know, your uncle? We might need to start him off slow with the movies. I don\u2019t want to scare the sh\u2014er, crap out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDie Hard?\u201d his daughter suggested.</p><p>\u201cToo much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. And then they both said, at the same time, in the same tone of voice: \u201cThe Goonies.\u201d</p><p>You want to talk about fatherly pride? Rhage mused as he held his hand out for another high five and Bit slapped him a good one.</p><p>There you had it.</p><p>FIFTY-TWO</p><p>There was something about New Year\u2019s Eve that made you want to start fresh.</p><p>Nights later, as Peyton sat on the foot of his bed, in his going-to-get-laid club clothes, he found himself scrolling through his texts. So many invitations, from his boys in the glymera, humans who thought they knew him from the Caldie club scene, females, females ... more females.</p><p>And the pings just kept coming through.</p><p>Paradise and Craeg were going to be chilling at her house, and she\u2019d invited him to join them\u2014but also tacked on that she knew he\u2019d be busy painting the town red. Boone was going over there. No one knew where Novo was at.</p><p>Axe certainly hadn\u2019t checked in with any updates.</p><p>Peyton put his phone aside and stared across his room. He was uncomfortably sober at the moment, and had every intention of fixing that shit.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>Any moment, he was going to hit the bottle or one of his bongs, and float away in the inside of his skull\u2014just ... leave behind the mess that had been stewing in his head for the last while. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He thought back to him and Axe and the others out on the streets the previous evening, working the blocks of abandoned buildings, instincts prickling, weapons up and ready to go, Brothers with them.</p><p>It was a new phase.</p><p>They were now not trainees, really. More like soldiers in training. If that made sense.</p><p>And Axe always kept it on the DL, never giving a hint of emotion away about anything, strung tight as a piano wire around someone\u2019s throat. But man, you could tell he was hurting. He\u2019d lost weight. The bags under his eyes were so big you could have packed for overnight in \u2019em. And the grim mood was a tangible weight he brought with him into every room, every alley, every bus ride to and from.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take a genius to realize Elise was in no better straits. Peyton had seen what she\u2019d looked like when she\u2019d come to him.</p><p>Time and the breakup surely was not improving that.</p><p>Shit, he thought as he rubbed his face. Just ... shit.</p><p>His phone rang. For like the fiftieth time. Another random calling to get him to come out.</p><p>When he finally picked up his phone, he went into his contacts and dialed a number he\u2019d only phoned once before.</p> <p>One ring. Two rings. Three\u2014</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNovo? Look\u2014don\u2019t hang up, okay?\u201d There was a pause. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I need you to do me a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it involves hitting you somewhere with a frying pan, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing with you.\u201d</p><p>He flexed his LV loafers. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a personality replacement, try eBay. You won\u2019t have to be too picky. Anything but Serial Killer would be an improvement.\u201d</p><p>Peyton stared at the blank, dark screen of his TV.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI need you to help me right a wrong. And I\u2019m not fucking with you, I really ... I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice or ... he didn\u2019t know what ... must have gotten through to her. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m not high, either.\u201d He shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cFuck me, maybe it\u2019s part of my problem. But I need to fix this first and then ... yeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo down and open your front door.\u201d She sounded annoyed. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Peyton left his phone behind. Frankly, he was sick to death of the people in it. And as he went to leave his suite, he passed by a mirror. Checking out his reflection, he saw the same features, same hair, same good looks he had every night of his life.</p><p>And yet he didn\u2019t recognize himself.</p><p>Maybe that bullet had given him brain damage, he thought as he opened the door and stepped out.</p><p>\u2019Cuz he hadn\u2019t felt right ever since he\u2019d been shot in the head.</p><p>Elise was sitting at her computer, combing the \u201cApartments for Rent\u201d section of the Caldwell Courier Journal online, when the house phone rang beside her little Tiffany lamp.</p><p>Picking the receiver up, she listened to the butler tell her she had guests and that they were waiting for her in the parlor. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d</p><p>As she hung up, it dawned on her that she hadn\u2019t even asked who they were. But she didn\u2019t really care. Could be cousins. Or, hell, an intervention set up by her father to scare her straight.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t afraid of even that. If she could get through losing Axe, she could get through anything.</p><p>Heading out of her room, she walked down the hall, passing by Allishon\u2019s old suite. Nothing had changed. Her uncle was still floating around, trying to find his footing, while his shellan self-destructed in their bedroom. Her father still didn\u2019t understand why Elise had to go, what she was doing getting her Ph.D., why she insisted on being such an iconoclast.</p><p>Everything would be okay, he had maintained, if she would just settle down and stop trying to talk about things that simply didn\u2019t need to be discussed.</p><p>To his credit, he wasn\u2019t telling her he would never see her again.</p><p>But he was sad that she was breaking away.</p><p>And so was she. She was going to miss the family she had been raised in, even if it was so broken that her only chance of living an authentic, halfway self-aware life was outside of it. You couldn\u2019t change others, though. Only yourself.</p><p>On that note, she hadn\u2019t heard from Axe.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t expected to.</p><p>She was surprised she missed him as much as she did, though. Was frustrated by that, actually. The trouble was, the high points of their ... whatever it was ... had been so high that in quiet moments of reflection, it was impossible not to remember them and mourn.</p><p>It was a process, though.</p><p>Or at least that\u2019s what all her fancy schooling had taught her.</p><p>And part of what was going to help her through her grief was that her and Troy\u2019s seminar started in a couple of days.</p><p>She was going to make it.</p><p>Because she wasn\u2019t going to have it any other way.</p><p>Downstairs, Elise crossed the foyer\u2019s marble squares and went over to the parlor\u2014but before she entered the pretty room, she halted.</p><p>\u201cPeyton? And ...\u201d</p><p>Okay, it was hard to say the female\u2019s name. Hard to look at that incredible body that just seemed to ooze sex appeal.</p><p>\u201cYou have a minute?\u201d Peyton said. \u201cWe need to talk to you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elise nodded and made herself walk forward. Peyton was looking great, as usual, his casual suit the kind of thing that had obviously been handmade for him, that open collar and perfect fit making him seem ready for a spectacular New Year\u2019s Eve night. Novo, in all her black leather, looked more prepared to fight.</p><p>Or have some hardcore sex.</p><p>Elise shook her head at herself and closed them all in. \u201cWhat ... ah, what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>God, even though she told herself to keep calm, her heart was pounding.</p> <p>Novo looked at Peyton. Peyton glanced at the female ... and then stared at Elise.</p><p>\u201cYou need to know some things. It\u2019s about Axe,\u201d he said.</p><p>Elise put both hands out like she was warding off an attack. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need to know anything about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t. And unless you\u2019ve come for some other reason\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had sex with him.\u201d Novo\u2019s voice was clear, unforced, and calm. \u201cHe took me to the club, yes. So I could become a member there. I asked him to do it for me as a favor. I\u2019ve never once been with that male\u2014and as far as both he\u201d\u2014she pointed at Peyton\u2014\u201cand I are aware, Axe hasn\u2019t slept with anybody since that night he first met you.\u201d</p><p>Peyton spoke fast, as if he were worried that Elise was going to run out of the room and he was going to lose his chance to say what he needed to. \u201cI know this is not my business, technically, but you kind of made it mine when you came to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you found that key of his.\u201d Novo nodded at Peyton. \u201cHe told me that Axe made like he didn\u2019t know what it was. I don\u2019t want to speak for the guy, but when you join the club, you\u2019re not supposed to talk about it. You\u2019re not supposed to reveal to anyone what the key is, where you use it, what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s a members-only thing, and if you blab, you\u2019re out. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t tell you about Allishon\u2019s. But it\u2019s just something you should think about. Before you shoot him in the foot for apparently lying to you.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s mind started to grind on the information. Even as she didn\u2019t want that whole door reopened.</p><p>It had been too hard to shut the damn thing in the first place.</p><p>Peyton came forward, stopping when he was right in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. I want to start this next year on the right foot. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. See, there are some people who feel like I\u2019m an asshole\u2014\u201d</p> <p>At that point, Novo muttered under her breath something that sounded like, \u201cGo figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and I guess ... I\u2019m kind of thinking I\u2019m one of them.\u201d Peyton shrugged. \u201cSo yeah, Axe is having a horrible time. He looks half dead. And look, I\u2019m not telling you what to do about this. But you might as well know the truth. What you choose to do or not do ... is up to you. He\u2019s not perfect ... but he\u2019s not like me, okay? He\u2019s not worthless.\u201d</p><p>FIFTY-THREE</p><p>Axe never cashed the check that Elise\u2019s father sent him.</p><p>Nope. He just put it on the mantelpiece above the fire, knowing that at some point, he was going to throw it into the flames. Just not tonight. And not last night, either. Or the one before that.</p><p>It kind of felt like his last tie to Elise, and yes, it was pathetic, but that was one bene of living alone\u2014no one else knew the weaknesses of your thoughts, your heart, your little rituals. It was like singing in the shower off-key\u2014nothing you had to share with anybody else.</p><p>Sitting in front of the hearth, he was naked and the back side of him was cold, but he didn\u2019t care. He hadn\u2019t cared about much since Elise had laid down the hammer\u2014</p><p>The knock on his front door drew his attention from the flames. \u201cOpen,\u201d he called out, not giving a shit who it was, and knowing that he could get to his gun if he\u2014</p> <p>Axe jumped to his feet. Then remembered he was naked, and grabbed a pillow off the old sofa. \u201cElise?\u201d he said to the closed door. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was muffled. \u201cDo you, ah ... do you mind if I come in?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. Mostly because his brain had traffic-jammed and rendered him too stoopid to talk.</p><p>Then he remembered she couldn\u2019t see him. \u201cYeah. I mean, sure.\u201d</p><p>Next thing he knew, she was stepping inside, closing the door and walking forward slowly, like she was thinking he might change his mind at any moment.</p><p>God ... she looked good. Then again, she always looked good. Even when she hated him.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know....\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this, so ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cG\u2019head. Whatever it is, I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already dropped a bomb in the center of his chest. So what if she took his arms and legs off as well? And, yeah, yeah, yeah, he should yell at her and get all righteous and shit over the fact that she\u2019d gotten him wrong. But honestly, he didn\u2019t have the energy for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Axe recoiled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ... listen, I\u2019m really sorry. I might have misjudged you I think....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>She started talking and he didn\u2019t really follow. Something about Peyton and Novo coming over to her father\u2019s house. The key thing. Membership. Not talking. No sex.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLike I said, they came over because Peyton wasn\u2019t feeling right about it all.

I thought you wouldn\u2019t understand. You know, that you\u2019d write me off or something. I don\u2019t know.

At, the, ah ... club?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Anslam, you mean? No. Never. And I was never with Allishon. I didn\u2019t even know her, to be honest. A lot of people go there.\u201d He threw up his hands. \u201cWhatever, I just wanted you to believe in me, okay? I wanted to be the male that I saw you thought I was. And a sex addict was not part of that picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel any need to ... go back there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot since I met you. When I took Novo to The Keys, none of it interested me anymore. I just didn\u2019t get juiced like I used to. I wanted to be with you and only you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that still true?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Axe crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Elise? Why did you come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just ... I\u2019m so sorry. I jumped to conclusions and I leveled a lot of things at you. And I\u2019m really sorry. My emotions got the best of me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d She seemed so sad. \u201cI guess the truth is ... well, as you said, I\u2019m a better professor than I am a student. I decided everything, and you\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t let you even defend yourself.\u201d</p> <p>As a silence stretched out, Axe wanted to pace around, but, hello. Ass naked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause ... I love you. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>It took a while for the words to sink in. And what do you know, he went good and speechless when they did. In his most pathetic fantasies, he had wanted\u2014hell, prayed for\u2014this turnaround on her part. Had hoped against hope it would be the one miracle he would ever receive. Was this even real?</p><p>Overcome, and highly emotional, all Axe could do was ... well, he leaned to the side and got something off the sofa cushions.</p><p>Elise came forward as he held out his hand. \u201cWhat is ...\u201d</p><p>As he gave her the wooden object, he muttered, \u201cIt was supposed to be a bird. I don\u2019t know what it really turned out to be. Anyway, I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up, her eyes popping wide.</p> <p>Axe just shrugged. And then started to smile. \u201cWhat? Do you want me to get on your case for wronging me? You\u2019re clearly already doing that yourself\u2014and as someone who can beat himself up a lot, we\u2019ll always be harder on ourselves than we will be on anyone else. And come on, I\u2019ve bonded with you. So you could pretty much run me over with a car, light me on fire, and pitch me off a bridge, and I\u2019ll still take you back. Not that I\u2019m recommending that approach to reconciliation\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elise threw herself at him and hung on to his neck so hard, he couldn\u2019t breathe. But he was good with that. Just having her against him and smelling her hair and her skin ... feeling her close, not just physically, but right in his heart?</p><p>Who the hell needed oxygen, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again as he began to shake. \u201cGod, I love you....\u201d</p><p>It was not at all how Elise thought it was going to go. Not even close.</p><p>She had braced herself for all kinds of recriminations. Was pretty sure that she was going to be kicked out of the cottage on her butt, and how could she blame him? She had jumped to a whole lot of conclusions because she\u2019d been hurting and feeling so paranoid and betrayed. Heck, she had hit him where it counted, reducing him to a grief strategy.</p><p>And yes, that might have been where things had started on her side, but it certainly had evolved into so much more: If Axe had only been a psychological crutch, she wouldn\u2019t have missed him as much as she had. As in every second, each heartbeat, and all the breaths in between.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said. \u201cI love you so much, and I almost blew it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh ... we don\u2019t need to think like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to make amends, and I have to re-earn your trust, and I need to\u2014\u201d</p><p>He put her down on her two feet\u2014um, okay, wow. He was oh, so naked and, yes, responding to her presence. And ... yup, she was responding to his.</p><p>\u201cElise.\u201d He brushed her hair back out of her face. \u201cListen, I\u2019m not going to condemn you for protecting yourself. The truth is, we don\u2019t really know each other very well, and trust ... it comes with time. You were emotional. I was emotional. And ... shit happens. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d much rather focus on the future than a couple of crossed wires that are really just part of the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept what if Peyton hadn\u2019t said anything?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe did, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you hadn\u2019t let me in the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you didn\u2019t believe me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He put his forefinger gently on her lips, stopping her ramble. \u201cSo I\u2019m thinking right now about something Rhage said to me a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it about professors being idiots in their own subject matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot. And no, it was about ... well, that night I saved him in the alley? Afterward? I was freaking out just like you are now. I was all, like, what if I didn\u2019t make it in time, or what if this, or that ... and he said something about there being no reason to beat yourself up over something that was fated to occur. On that theory? Even if Peyton hadn\u2019t said something, we would have ended up back together because that just is what\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut ... but ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise. Don\u2019t you understand? My door was always going to be open to you. It is always going to be open to you.\u201d</p> <p>And then he was kissing her, and laying her out in front of the fire.</p><p>Elise was soaring with him even before she was naked, her heart free, the tangle untangled, the path astray now back on course.</p><p>Just before they were joined, she inched back. \u201cSo your door is always open, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally ...\u201d She smiled at him, thinking if she were any happier, her heart would burst. \u201cBecause I happen to be moving out of my house.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cYou are? You don\u2019t say....\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me sad, but it\u2019s just not the right place for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know ... I could use a roommate. In fact, I was just thinking I was looking for a beautiful, intelligent female who\u2019s good with a comeback and a gun.\u201d</p><p>Elise started to nod. \u201cAnd I\u2019m looking for a place to stay that\u2019s safe, secure, private ... heated by an open hearth\u2014and that has fireworks every night thanks to a guy who has tattooed half of himself and doesn\u2019t mind females who jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re a perfect match, then.\u201d</p><p>On that note, he arched his back and filled her deeply. And as she gasped, he gave the knowing smile of a male was who well aware of the effect he had on his female.</p><p>\u201cWe are a perfect match,\u201d she moaned. \u201cBut there\u2019s just one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ...\u201d She glanced at the hunk of wood he\u2019d given her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re much of an artist.\u201d</p> <p>Axe started to laugh. \u201cI know, right? What the hell is that? I tried to give my dad\u2019s thing a shot and I sucked at it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it\u2019s a bird\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>As they talked over each other, midnight came and went, a new year beginning, a fresh start happening for both of them.</p><p>A fresh start ... that was going to last two lifetimes.</p><p>FIFTY-FOUR</p><p>\u201cWait, this one\u2019s for L.W.!\u201d</p><p>As Mary sat back in the library with a cup of hot cocoa in her hand and a candy cane in her mouth, she smiled as Bitty rushed over to the First Family with a foil-wrapped present. The girl was dressed in a red taffeta gown that had a green sash, and she looked picture perfect. Except for one thing: She was also wearing, tragically, Lassiter\u2019s baseball hat with the reindeer antlers. Which would almost have been okay.</p><p>Except it read \u201cThe Grinch Can Elf Off.\u201d</p><p>At least, Mary decided, there wasn\u2019t an actual \u201cf-bomb\u201d in there.</p><p>The entire household had crammed in around the Christmas tree\u2014well, everyone except the angel, and God only knew where Lassiter was. For the last hour, presents had been passed out, the human holiday being celebrated on New Year\u2019s Eve instead of the correct date because, hello, there had been a lot going on.</p><p>Rhage leaned in close. \u201cSo ... can you and I play find-my-mistletoe today after the kid goes to sleep?\u201d</p><p>Mary felt her body warm up. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Her hellren let out a purr. \u201cAnd I know just where to put it.\u201d</p><p>She elbowed him. \u201cShh, stop thinking like that. We still have a party to get through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always the bathroom. The pantry. The great outdoors\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s freezing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warm you up, female.\u201d</p><p>Mary threw her head back and laughed just as Wrath said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Tonka truck!\u201d Beth smiled at Bitty as she put the toy in her son\u2019s lap. \u201cDid you buy this with your own money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d The little girl was very proud. \u201cYou said you thought he\u2019d like one.\u201d</p><p>George, Wrath\u2019s seeing-eye dog, sniffed the thing and gave it a lick.</p><p>\u201cL.W.\u2019s going to love\u2014\u201d Beth laughed. \u201cYup, right in his mouth.\u201d</p><p>As the King\u2019s firstborn started gumming the tires, Bitty danced back to the tree and hunted around. \u201cThe last present is for you, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>Ruhn was two armchairs away, sitting in the self-contained way that Mary was coming to associate with him. He wasn\u2019t aloof\u2014on the contrary, he was always open and warm\u2014he just seemed a little overwhelmed by all the people and the shouting and the laughter and the never-ending rotation of inside jokes between the Brothers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Everyone went silent as the large flat box was delivered into his lap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from all of us!\u201d Bitty exclaimed. \u201cI put some of my money into it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all have been too generous already.\u201d The male looked down at the pile of clothes next to his chair. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>V cut in. \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.

Come on, I seriously spent, like, hours trying to help Rhage find the right one\u2014\u201d</p><p>Butch chimed in. \u201cHe totally did. I mean, it was intense, the two of them\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rhage shrugged. \u201cBut hey, you know, this is an important gift ... you want to get the color right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it another sweater?\u201d Ruhn asked. \u201cI have two now already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should open the box,\u201d Rhage said. \u201cG\u2019head, son.\u201d</p><p>It was funny, Ruhn had been taken under Rhage\u2019s wing within a night of coming here, and the two were really sweet together. Ruhn took all his cues from Rhage, learned from him, spent a lot of time with him.</p><p>Turned out Ruhn had gone through his transition only fifteen years before.</p><p>And Rhage would probably not admit it, at least not anytime soon, but Ruhn was quickly becoming a son to him.</p><p>Yup, that was Rhage\u2019s boy: Each time Ruhn mastered something else, like working out in the weight room with the Brothers, or signing up for an English-as-a-second-language course to learn to read, or watching another of Rhage and Bitty\u2019s god-awful movies, there was pride on Rhage\u2019s face.</p> <p>The universe had given them a BOGO, in essence\u2014</p><p>Ruhn opened the top of the box and rifled through the tissue paper. Then he frowned. \u201cWait, what is this?\u201d</p><p>He held up a key fob.</p><p>Rhage jumped out of his seat. \u201cCome on, son, you gotta meet her!\u201d</p><p>Bitty squealed and started yanking on her uncle\u2019s arm. \u201cShe\u2019s out back\u2014right here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, hit the button on the fob\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>As Rhage threw open a set of French doors, the whole household exploded out of their seats and jammed the exit....</p> <p>To see the most beautiful heavy-duty Ford truck with a blah-blah-something or another for an engine and double cab blah-blah with eight gazillion horses under the hood and yada, yada, yada, suspension, gear-shifting whatever\u2014</p><p>All that stuff.</p><p>Mary hung back and let them all go, the security lights coming on and giving her a great view of Ruhn\u2019s total shock and then tentative excitement.</p><p>And then the male was turning to Rhage and not looking him in the face. Rhage knew what he was doing, though, and wrapped Ruhn up in a big bear hug\u2014while Bitty danced around like a firefly.</p><p>Yes, Mary thought, this was the best Christmas she\u2019d ever\u2014</p><p>\u201cMary.\u201d</p><p>Turning at the soft sound of her name, she glanced behind herself. Then frowned. \u201cLassiter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d She looked all around. \u201cWhy is your voice echoing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChimney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stuck in the fucking chimney.\u201d</p><p>She raced over to the fireplace and got on her hands and knees. Looking up into the dark flue, she shook her head. \u201cLass? What the hell are you doing up there?\u201d</p><p>His voice emanated from somewhere above her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>An arm came down. A very sooty arm that was encased in a red sleeve that had white trim. Or what had been white trim and which was now smudged with ash.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cAnd thank God no one lit this fire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me,\u201d he muttered in his disembodied voice. \u201cI had to blow out Fritz\u2019s match like a hundred times before he gave up. Fuck, that sounds dirty. Anyway, just remind me never to try to be Santa for your kid, okay? I\u2019m not doing this again, even for her.\u201d</p><p>Mary stretched a little farther in, but the logs on the hearth stopped her. \u201cLassiter. Why can\u2019t you free yourself by dematerializing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impaled on a hook that\u2019s iron. I can\u2019t go ghost. And will you just take this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d</p><p>He turned his hand toward her and there was ... a box ... in it? A small navy blue box.</p><p>\u201cOpen it. And before you ask, I already cleared it with your pinheaded hellren. He\u2019s not jel or anything.\u201d</p><p>Mary sat back and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustopenthefuckingthingalready.\u201d</p><p>Taking off the top, she found a slightly smaller box inside. That was velvet. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>As she lifted the lid, she ... gasped.</p><p>It was a pair of diamond earrings. A pair of perfectly matched, sparkly, diamond ...</p><p>\u201cA mother\u2019s tears,\u201d Lassiter\u2019s slightly echo-y voice said softly. \u201cSo hard, so beautiful. I told you everything was going to be all right. And those are to remind you of how strong you are, how strong your love for your daughter is ... how, even in the worst of times, things have a way of working out as they should.\u201d</p><p>Blinking away tears, she thought of her crying in the foyer in front of the angel, crying because all had been lost. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re just beautiful,\u201d she said hoarsely.</p><p>Slipping one out of its box, she took out the pearl in her lobe and replaced it with the diamond.
