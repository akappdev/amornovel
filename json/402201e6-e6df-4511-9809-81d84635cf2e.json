I shake my head and pull my iced latte toward me, strategically placing my lips on the straw. Natalie sits across from me with her elbows propped on the little round table, chin in one hand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d she says staring off toward the guy who just got in line. \u201cSeriously, Cam, would you look at him?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and take another sip. \u201cNat,\u201d I say, placing my drink back on the table, \u201cyou have a boyfriend\u2014do I need to constantly remind you?\u201d</p> <p>Natalie sneers playfully at me. \u201cWhat are you, my mother?\u201d But she can\u2019t keep her eyes on me for long, not while that walking wall of sexy is standing at the register ordering coffee and scones. \u201cBesides, Damon doesn\u2019t care if I look\u2014as long as I\u2019m bending over for him every night, he\u2019s good with it.\u201d</p><p>I let out a spat of air, blushing.</p><p>\u201cSee! Uh huh,\u201d she says, smiling hugely. \u201cI got a laugh out of you.\u201d She reaches over and thrusts her hand into her little purple purse. \u201cI have to make note of that,\u201d and she pulls out her phone and opens her digital notebook. \u201cSaturday. June 15th.\u201d She moves her finger across the screen. \u201c1:54 p.m. \u2013 Camryn Bennett laughed at one of my sexual jokes.\u201d Then she shoves the phone back inside her purse and looks at me with that thoughtful sort of look she always has when she\u2019s about to go into therapy-mode. \u201cJust look once,\u201d she says, all joking aside.</p><p>Just to appease her, I turn my chin carefully at an angle so that I can get a quick glimpse of the guy. He moves away from the register and toward the end of the counter where he slides his drink off the edge. Tall. Perfectly sculpted cheekbones. Mesmerizing model green eyes and spiked up brown hair.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I admit, looking back at Natalie, \u201che\u2019s hot, but so what?\u201d</p> <p>Natalie has to watch him leave out the double glass doors and glide past the windows before she can look back at me to respond.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God,\u201d she says eyes wide and full of disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy, Nat.\u201d I place my lips on the straw again. \u201cYou might as well put a sign that says \u2018obsessed\u2019 on your forehead. You\u2019re everything obsessed short of drooling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Her expression has twisted into pure shock. \u201cCamryn, you have a serious problem. You know that, right?\u201d She presses her back against her chair. \u201cYou need to up your medication. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped taking it in April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d I say matter-of-factly. \u201cI\u2019m not suicidal, so there\u2019s no reason for me to be taking it.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head at me and crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cYou think they prescribe that stuff just for suicidal people? No. They don\u2019t.\u201d She points a finger at me briefly and hides it back in the fold of her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s a chemical imbalance thing, or some shit like that.\u201d</p><p>I smirk at her. \u201cOh, really? Since when did you become so educated in mental health issues and the medications they use to treat the hundreds of diagnoses?\u201d My brow rises a little, just enough to let her see how much I know she has no idea what she\u2019s talking about.</p><p>When she wrinkles her nose at me instead of answering, I say, \u201cI\u2019ll heal on my own time and I don\u2019t need a pill to fix it for me.\u201d My explanation had started out kind, but unexpectedly turned bitter before I could get the last sentence out. That happens a lot.</p><p>Natalie sighs and the smile completely drops from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, feeling bad for snapping at her. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t deny that I have some messed up emotional issues and that I can be a bitch sometimes\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes?\u201d she mumbles under her breath, but is grinning again and has already forgiven me.</p><p>That happens a lot, too.</p> <p>I half-smile back at her. \u201cI just want to find answers on my own, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind what answers?\u201d She\u2019s annoyed with me. \u201cCam,\u201d she says, cocking her head to one side to appear thoughtful. \u201cI hate to say it, but shit really does happen. You just have to get over it. Beat the hell out of it by doing things that make you happy.\u201d</p><p>OK, so maybe she isn\u2019t so horrible at the therapy thing after all.</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re right,\u201d I say, \u201cbut....\u201d</p><p>Natalie raises a brow, waiting. \u201cWhat? Come on, out with it!\u201d</p><p>I gaze toward the wall briefly, thinking about it. So often I sit around and think about life and wonder about every possible aspect of it. I wonder what the hell I\u2019m doing here. Even right now. In this coffee shop with this girl I\u2019ve known practically all my life. Yesterday I thought about why I felt the need to get up at exactly the same time as the day before and do everything like I did the day before. Why? What compels any of us to do the things we do when deep down a part of us just wants to break free from it all?</p><p>I look away from the wall and right at my best friend who I know won\u2019t understand what I\u2019m about to say, but because of the need to get it out, I say it anyway.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever wondered what it would be like to backpack across the world?\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s face goes slack. \u201cUh, not really,\u201d she says. \u201cThat might...suck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, think about it for a second,\u201d I say, leaning against the table and focusing all of my attention on her. \u201cJust you and a backpack with a few necessities. No bills. No getting up at the same time every morning to go to a job you hate. Just you and the world out ahead of you. You never know what the next day is going to bring, who you\u2019ll meet, what you\u2019ll have for lunch or where you might sleep.\u201d I realize I\u2019ve become so lost in the imagery that I might\u2019ve seemed a little obsessed for a second, myself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to freak me out,\u201d Natalie says, eyeing me across the small table with a look of uncertainty. Her arched brow settles back even with the other one and then she says, \u201cAnd there\u2019s also all the walking, the risk of getting raped, murdered and tossed on the side of a freeway somewhere. Oh, and then there\u2019s all the walking....\u201d</p><p>Clearly, she thinks I\u2019m borderline crazy.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought this on, anyway?\u201d she asks, taking a quick sip of her drink. \u201cThat sounds like some kind of mid-life-crisis stuff\u2014you\u2019re only twenty.\u201d She points again as if to underline, \u201cAnd you\u2019ve hardly paid a bill in your life.\u201d</p><p>She takes another sip; an obnoxious slurping noise follows.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not,\u201d I say thinking quietly to myself, \u201cbut I will be once I move in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo true,\u201d she says, tapping her fingertips on her cup. \u201cEverything split down the middle\u2014Wait, you\u2019re not backing out on me, are you?\u201d She sort of freezes, looking warily across at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m still on. Next week I\u2019ll be out of my mom\u2019s house and living with a slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d she laughs.</p><p>I half-smile and go back to my brooding, the stuff before that she wasn\u2019t relating to, but I expected as much. Even before Ian died, I always kind of thought out-of-the-box. Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, her boyfriend of five years, I dream about things that really matter. At least in my world, they matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp. \u201cYou\u2019re one deep chick.\u201d That\u2019s what Damon said to me on more than one occasion.</p><p>\u201cGeez!\u201d Natalie says. \u201cYou\u2019re a freakin\u2019 downer, you know that right?\u201d She shakes her head with the straw between her lips.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she says suddenly and stands up from the table. \u201cI can\u2019t take this philosophical stuff anymore and quaint little places like this seem to make you worse\u2014we\u2019re going to The Underground tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u2014No, I\u2019m not going to that place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You. Are.\u201d She chucks her empty drink into the trash can a few feet away and grabs my wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re going with me this time because you\u2019re supposed to be my best friend and I won\u2019t take no again for an answer.\u201d Her close-lipped smile is spread across the entirety of her slightly tanned face.</p><p>I know she means business. She always means business when she has that look in her eyes: the one brimmed with excitement and determination. It\u2019ll probably be easiest just to go this once and get it over with, or else she\u2019ll never leave me alone about it. Such is a necessary evil when it comes to having a pushy best friend.</p><p>I get up and slip my purse strap over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only two o\u2019clock,\u201d I say.</p><p>I drink down the last of my latte and toss the empty cup away in the same trash can.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but first we\u2019ve got to get you a new outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d I say resolutely as she\u2019s walking me out the glass doors and into the breezy summer air. \u201cGoing to The Underground with you is more than good deed enough. I refuse to go shopping. I\u2019ve got plenty of clothes.\u201d</p><p>Natalie slips her arm around mine as we walk down the sidewalk and past a long line of parking meters. She grins and glances over at me. \u201cFine. Then you\u2019ll at least let me dress you from something out of my closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my own wardrobe?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips at me and draws her chin in as if to quietly argue why I even asked a question so ridiculous. \u201cIt\u2019s The Underground,\u201d she says, as if there is no answer more obvious than that.</p><p>OK, she has a point. Natalie and me may be best friends, but with us it\u2019s an opposites attract sort of thing. She\u2019s a rocker chick who\u2019s had a crush on Jared Leto since Fight Club. I\u2019m more of a laid back kind of girl who rarely wears dark-colored clothes unless I\u2019m attending a funeral. Not that Natalie wears all black and has some kind of emo hair thing going on, but she would never be caught dead in anything from my closet because she says it\u2019s all just too plain. I beg to differ. I know how to dress, and guys\u2014when I used to pay attention to the way they eyed my ass in my favorite jeans\u2014have never had a problem with the clothes I choose to wear.</p><p>But The Underground was made for people like Natalie and so I guess I\u2019ll have to endure dressing like her for one night just to fit in. I\u2019m not a follower. I never have been. But I\u2019ll definitely become someone I\u2019m not for a few hours if it\u2019ll make me blend in rather than make me a blatant eye sore and draw attention.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s bedroom is the complete opposite of OCD clean. And this is yet another way she and I are so completely different. I hang my clothes up by color. She leaves hers in the basket at the foot of her bed for weeks before throwing them all back into the laundry to be washed again because of the wrinkles. I dust my room daily. I don\u2019t think she has ever actually dusted her room unless you call wiping off the two-inches of dust from her laptop keyboard, cleaning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis will look perfect on you,\u201d Natalie says holding up a thin, half-sleeve tight white shirt with Scars on Broadway written across the front. \u201cIt fits tight and your boobs are perfect.\u201d She puts the shirt up against my chest and examines what I might look like in it.</p><p>I snarl at her, not satisfied with her first pick.</p><p>She rolls her eyes and her shoulders slump over. \u201cFine,\u201d she says, tossing the shirt on the bed. She slides her hand in the closet and takes down another one, holding it up with a big smile that is at the same time a manipulation tactic of hers. Big toothy smiles equal me not wanting to crush her efforts.</p><p>\u201cHow about something that doesn\u2019t have some random band plastered across the front?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Brandon Boyd,\u201d she says, her eyes bugging out at me. \u201cHow can you not like Brandon Boyd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m just not into advertising him on my chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to actually have him on my chest,\u201d she says, admiring the tight-fitting V-neck top made much like the first one she tried to show me.</p><p>\u201cWell then you wear it.\u201d</p><p>She looks across at me, nodding as if contemplating the idea. \u201cI think I will.\u201d She takes off the top she\u2019s already wearing and tosses it in the laundry basket next to the closet and then slips Brandon Boyd\u2019s face down over her huge boobs.</p> <p>\u201cLooks good on you,\u201d I say, watching her adjust herself and admiring what she sees in the mirror at several different angles.</p><p>\u201cDamn right he does,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Jared Leto going to feel about this?\u201d I joke.</p><p>Natalie spats out a laugh and she tosses her long dark hair back and reaches for the hairbrush. \u201cHe\u2019ll always be my number one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Damon, y\u2019know, the non-imaginary boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d she says, looking at me through the reflection in the mirror. \u201cIf you keep raggin\u2019 on me about Damon like you do\u2014.\u201d She stops the brush mid-way in her hair and turns at the waist to face me. \u201cDo you have a thing for Damon, or something?\u201d</p> <p>My head springs back and I feel my eyebrows knot thickly in my forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo, Nat! What the hell?\u201d</p><p>Natalie laughs and goes back to brushing her hair. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find you a guy tonight. That\u2019s what you need. It\u2019ll fix everything.\u201d</p><p>My silence immediately tells her that she went too far. I hate it when she does this. Why does everybody have to be with somebody? It\u2019s a stupid delusion and a really pathetic way of thinking.</p><p>She places the brush back on the dresser and turns around fully, letting the jest disappear from her face and she sighs heavily. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say that\u2014look I swear I won\u2019t pull any match-making stuff, alright?\u201d She puts both of her hands up in surrender.</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d I say, giving in to her sincerity. Of course, I know too that a promise never stops her completely. She may not directly try to hook me up with somebody, but all she has to do is bat those dark eyelashes of hers at Damon about any guy in the place and Damon will know right away what she wants him to do.</p><p>But I don\u2019t need their help. I don\u2019t want to hook up with anyone.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Natalie says with her head in the closet. \u201cThis top is perfect!\u201d She turns around dangling a loose-fitting black top with the fabric in the shoulders missing. Across the front it reads: SINNER.</p> <p>\u201cGot it at Hot Topic,\u201d she says, sliding it off the hanger.</p><p>Not wanting to drag this shirt-choosing session out any longer, I slip off my own shirt and then take it from her hand.</p><p>\u201cBlack bra,\u201d she says. \u201cGood choice.\u201d</p><p>I slip the top on and check myself out in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Say it,\u201d she says, coming up behind me with a big smile on her face. \u201cYou like it, dont\u2019cha?\u201d</p><p>I smile slimly back at her and turn to look at how the bottom of the shirt just barely covers the top of my hips.</p><p>And then I notice it says SAINT across the back.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, \u201cI do like it.\u201d I turn around and point sternly at her. \u201cBut not enough to start raiding your closet so don\u2019t get your hopes up. I\u2019m content with my cute button-up tops, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said your clothes weren\u2019t cute, Cam.\u201d She grins and reaches up and snaps my bra against my back. \u201cYou look frickin\u2019 sexy on a daily basis, girl\u2014I\u2019d totally do you if I wasn\u2019t with Damon.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn sick, Nat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says as I turn back to the mirror and I hear the devilish grin in her voice. \u201cBut it\u2019s the truth. I\u2019ve told you before and I wasn\u2019t joking.\u201d</p><p>I just shake my head at her, smiling while picking her brush up from the dresser. Natalie had a girlfriend once, during a short breakup with Damon. But she claimed she was \u2018way too cock-crazy\u2019 (her words, not mine) to spend her life with a girl. Natalie\u2019s not a real slut\u2014she\u2019ll knock your face off if you ever call her one\u2014but she is any boyfriend\u2019s nympho dream, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>\u201cNow let me do your makeup,\u201d she says stepping up to the vanity with me.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Natalie thrusts her hands on her hourglass h*ps and looks at me wide-eyed, as if she was my mom and I just mouthed-off to her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to be painful?\u201d she asks, glaring at me.</p><p>I give in and plop down on the vanity chair.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say, holding up my chin to give her full access to my face, which has just become her blank canvas. \u201cJust no raccoon-eye shit, alright?\u201d</p><p>She cups my chin vigorously in her hand. \u201cNow hush,\u201d she demands, barely breaking a smile and trying to look all serious. \u201cAn arteest,\u201d she says with a dramatic accent and the flourish of her free hand, \u201cneeds quiet to vork! Vut do you think these ees, a Deetroit beautee parlor?\u201d</p><p>By the time she\u2019s finished with me, I look exactly like her. Except for the giant boobs and silky brown hair. My hair is the kind of blonde some girls pay a salon a lot of money to have, and it stops just to the middle of my back. I admit I was lucky in the perfect hair department. Natalie said that my hair would look better if I wore it down and so I did. I had no choice. She was very intimidating....</p><p>And she didn\u2019t make me look like a raccoon, but she didn\u2019t go light on the dark eye shadow, either. \u201cDark eyes with blonde hair,\u201d she had said as she went about applying the thick, black mascara. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy hot.\u201d And apparently my little open-toed sandals just weren\u2019t going to do, because she made me toss them and wear a pair of her pointy heeled boots, which fit snugly over the legs of my skinny jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou are one sexy bitch,\u201d she says, looking me up and down.</p><p>\u201cAnd you owe me big-time for doing this,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHuh? I owe you?\u201d She cocks her head to the side. \u201cNo, honey, I think not. You\u2019ll owe me before this is over with because you\u2019re going to have a great time and will be begging me to take you there more often.\u201d</p><p>I sneer playfully at her with my arms crossed and my hip popped out. \u201cI doubt that,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt and hope that I have a good time, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, slipping on her boots. \u201cNow let\u2019s get out of here; Damon\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>WE MAKE IT TO THE Underground just as night falls, but not before driving around in Damon\u2019s souped-up truck to various houses. He would pull into the driveway, get out and stay inside no more than three or four minutes and never say a word when he came back out. At least, not about what he went inside for, or who he talked to\u2014the usual stuff that would make these visits normal. But not much about Damon is usual or normal. I love him to death. I\u2019ve known him almost as long as I\u2019ve known Natalie, but I\u2019ve never been able to accept his drug habits. He grows copious amounts of weed in his basement, but he\u2019s not a pothead. In fact, no one but me and a few of his close friends would ever suspect that a hot piece of ass like Damon Winters would be a grower, because most growers look like white trash and often have hairdos that are stuck somewhere between the 70\u2019s and 90\u2019s. Damon is far from looking like white trash\u2014he could be Alex Pettyfer\u2019s younger brother. And Damon says weed just isn\u2019t his thing. No, Damon\u2019s drug of choice is coc**ne and he only grows and sells weed to pay for his coc**ne habit.</p><p>Natalie pretends that what Damon does is perfectly harmless. She knows that he doesn\u2019t smoke weed and says that weed really isn\u2019t that bad and if other people want to smoke it to chill out and relax, that she sees no harm in Damon helping with that.</p><p>She refuses to believe, however, that coc**ne has seen more action from his face than any part of her body has.</p><p>\u201cOK, you\u2019re going to have a good time, right?\u201d Natalie bumps my backseat door shut with her butt after I get out and then she looks hopelessly at me. \u201cJust don\u2019t fight it and try to enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cNat, I wouldn\u2019t deliberately try to hate it,\u201d I say. \u201cI do want to enjoy myself.\u201d</p><p>Damon comes around to our side of the truck and slips his arms around both of our waists. \u201cI get to go in with two hot chicks on my arms.\u201d</p><p>Natalie elbows him with a pretend resentful smirk. \u201cShut up, baby. You\u2019ll make me jealous.\u201d Already she\u2019s grinning impishly up at him.</p><p>Damon lets his hand drop from her waist and he grabs a handful of her butt cheek. She makes a sickening moaning sound and reaches up on her toes to kiss him. I want to tell them to get a room, but I\u2019d be wasting my breath.</p><p>The Underground is the hottest spot just outside of downtown North Carolina, but you won\u2019t find it listed in the phone book. Only people like us know it exists. Some guy named Rob rented out an abandoned warehouse two years ago and spent about one million of his rich daddy\u2019s money to convert it into a secret nightclub. Two years and going strong; the place has since become a spot where local rock sex gods can live the rock n\u2019 roll dream with screaming fans and groupies. But it\u2019s not a trashy joint. From the outside it might look like an abandoned building in a partial ghost town, but the inside is like any upscale hard rock night club equipped with colorful strobe lights that shoot continuously across the space, slutty-looking waitresses and a stage big enough for two bands to play at the same time.</p><p>To keep The Underground private, everybody who goes has to park elsewhere in the city and walk to it because a street lined with vehicles outside an \u2018abandoned\u2019 warehouse is a dead giveaway.</p><p>We park in the back of a nearby Mickey D\u2019s and walk about ten minutes through spooky town.</p><p>Natalie moves from Damon\u2019s right side and gets in between us, but it\u2019s just so she can torture me before we go inside.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d she says as if about to run down a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019t\u2019s for me, \u201cIf anybody asks, you\u2019re single, alright?\u201d She waves her hand at me. \u201cNone of that stuff you pulled like with that guy who was hitting on you at Office Depot.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was she doing at Office Depot?\u201d Damon says, laughing.</p><p>\u201cDamon, this guy was on her,\u201d Natalie says, totally ignoring the fact that I\u2019m right here, \u201cI mean like all she had to do was bat her eyes once and he would\u2019ve bought her a car\u2014you know what she said to him?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and pull my arm out of hers. \u201cNat, you\u2019re so stupid. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe,\u201d Damon says. \u201cIf the guy works at Office Depot he\u2019s not going to be buying anybody any cars.\u201d</p> <p>Natalie smacks him across the shoulder playfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t say he worked there\u2014anyway, the guy looked like the lovechild of...Adam Levine and...,\u201d she twirls her fingers around above her head to let another famous example materialize on her tongue, \u201c...Jensen Ackles, and Miss Prudeness here told him she was a lesbian when he asked for her number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up, Nat!\u201d I say, irritated at her serious over-exaggeration illness. \u201cHe did not look like either one of those guys. He was just a regular guy who didn\u2019t happen to be fugly.\u201d</p><p>She waves me away and turns back to Damon. \u201cWhatever. The point is that she\u2019ll lie to keep them away. I don\u2019t doubt for a second that she\u2019d go as far as to tell a guy she has Chlamydia and an out of control case of crabs.\u201d</p><p>Damon laughs.</p><p>I stop on the dark sidewalk and cross my arms over my chest, chewing on the inside of my bottom lip in agitation.</p> <p>Natalie, realizing I\u2019m not walking beside her anymore runs back towards me. \u201cOK! OK! Look, I just don\u2019t want you to ruin it for yourself, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m just asking that if someone\u2014who isn\u2019t a total hunchback\u2014hits on you that you not immediately push him away. Nothing wrong with talking and getting to know one another. I\u2019m not asking you to go home with him.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m already hating her for this. She swore!</p><p>Damon comes up behind her and wraps his hands around her waist, nuzzling his mouth into her squirming neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just let her do what she wants, babe. Stop being so pushy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Damon,\u201d I say with a quick nod.</p><p>He winks at me.</p> <p>Natalie purses her lips and says, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d and then puts up her hands, \u201cI won\u2019t say anything else. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I have heard that before....</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say and we all start walking again. Already these boots are killing my feet.</p><p>The ogre at the warehouse entrance inspects us at the door with his huge arms crossed in front.</p><p>He holds out his hand.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s face twists into an offended knot. \u201cWhat? Is Rob charging now?\u201d</p><p>Damon reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his wallet, fingering the bills inside.</p><p>\u201cTwenty bucks a pop,\u201d the ogre says with a grunt.</p> <p>\u201cTwenty? Are you f**king kidding me?!\u201d Natalie shrieks.</p><p>Damon gently pushes her aside and slaps three twenty dollar bills into the ogre\u2019s hand. The ogre shoves the money into his pocket and moves to let us pass. I go first and Damon puts his hand on Natalie\u2019s lower back to guide her in front of him.</p><p>She sneers at the ogre as she passes by. \u201cProbably going to keep it for himself,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask Rob about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Damon says and we slip past the door and down one lengthy, dreary hallway with a single flickering florescent light until we make it to the industrial elevator at the end.</p><p>The metal jolts as the cage door closes and we\u2019re rather noisily riding to the basement floor many feet below. It\u2019s just one floor down, but the elevator rattles so much I feel like it\u2019s going to snap any second and send us plunging to our deaths. Loud, booming drums and the shouting of drunk college students and probably a lot of drop-outs funnels through the basement floor and into the cage elevator, louder every inch we descend into the bowels of The Underground. The elevator rumbles to a halt and another ogre opens the cage door to let us out.</p><p>Natalie stumbles into me from behind. \u201cHurry up!\u201d she says, pushing me playfully in the back. \u201cI think that\u2019s Four Collision playing!\u201d Her voice rises over the music as we make our way into the main room.</p><p>Natalie takes Damon by the hand and then tries to grab mine, but I know what she has in store and I\u2019m not going into a throng of bouncing, sweaty bodies wearing these stupid boots.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on!\u201d she urges, practically begging. Then an aggravated line deepens around her snarling nose and she thrusts my hand into hers and pulls me towards her. \u201cStop being a baby! If anybody knocks you over, I\u2019ll personally kick their ass, alright?\u201d</p><p>Damon is grinning at me from the side.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d I say and head out with them, Natalie practically pulling my fingers out of the sockets.</p><p>We hit the dance floor and after a while of Natalie doing what any best friend would do by grinding against me to make me feel included, she eases her way into Damon\u2019s world only. She might as well be hav**g s*x with him right there in front of everybody, but no one notices. I only notice because I\u2019m probably the only girl in the entire place without a date doing the same thing. I take advantage of the opportunity and slip my way off the dance floor and head to the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I get\u2019cha?\u201d the tall blond guy behind the bar says as I push myself up on my toes and take an empty barstool.</p><p>\u201cRum &amp; Coke.\u201d</p><p>He goes to make my drink. \u201cHard stuff, huh?\u201d he says, filling the glass with ice. \u201cGoing to show me your I.D.?\u201d He grins.</p><p>I purse my lips at him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll show you my I.D. when you show me your liquor license.\u201d I grin right back at him and he smiles.</p><p>He finishes mixing the drink and slides it over to me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really drink much anyway,\u201d I say, taking a little sip from the straw.</p><p>\u201cMuch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, tonight I think I\u2019ll need a buzz.\u201d I set the glass down and finger the lime on the rim.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d he asks, wiping the bar top down with a paper towel.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d I hold up one finger, \u201cbefore you get the wrong idea, I\u2019m not here to spill my guts to you\u2014bartender-customer therapy.\u201d Natalie is all the therapy I can handle.</p><p>He laughs and tosses the paper towel somewhere behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s good to know because I\u2019m not the advice type.\u201d</p><p>I take another small sip, leaning over this time instead of lifting the glass from the bar; my loose hair falls all around my face. I rise back up and tuck one side behind my ear. I really hate wearing my hair down; it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you must know,\u201d I say looking right at him, \u201cI was dragged here by my relentless best friend who would probably do something embarrassing to me in my sleep and take a blackmail pic if I didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, one of those,\u201d he says, laying his arms across the bar top and folding his hands together. \u201cI had a friend like that once. Six months after my fianc\u00e9 skipped out on me, he dragged me to a nightclub just outside of Baltimore\u2014I just wanted to sit at home and sulk in my misery, but turns out that night out was exactly what I needed.\u201d</p><p>Oh great, this guy thinks he knows me already, or, at least my \u2018situation\u2019. But he doesn\u2019t know anything about my situation. Maybe he has the bad ex thing down\u2014because we all have that eventually\u2014but the rest of it, my parents\u2019 divorce, my older brother, Cole, going to jail, the death of the love of my life...I\u2019m not about to tell this guy anything. The moment you tell someone else is the moment you become a whiner and the world\u2019s smallest violin starts to play. The truth is, we all have problems; we all go through hardships and pain, and my pain is paradise compared to a lot of people\u2019s and I really have no right to whine at all.</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t the advice type?\u201d I smile sweetly.</p><p>He leans away from the bar and says, \u201cI\u2019m not, but if you\u2019re getting something out of my story then be grateful.\u201d</p><p>I smirk and take a fake sip this time. I don\u2019t really want a buzz and I definitely don\u2019t want to get drunk, especially since I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be the one driving us home again.</p><p>Trying to take the spotlight off me, I prop one elbow on the bar and rest my chin on my knuckles and say, \u201cSo then what happened that night?\u201d</p><p>The left side of his mouth lifts into a grin and he says, shaking his blond head, \u201cI got laid for the first time since she left me and I remembered how good it felt to be unchained from one person.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect that kind of answer. Most guys I know would\u2019ve lied about their relationship phobia, especially if they were hitting on me. I kind of like this guy. Just as a guy, of course; I\u2019m not about to, as Natalie might say, bend over for him.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d I say, trying to hold in the true measure of my smile. \u201cWell, at least you\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other way to be,\u201d he says as he reaches for an empty glass and starts to make a Rum &amp; Coke for himself. \u201cI\u2019ve found that most girls are as much afraid of commitment as guys are these days and if you\u2019re up front in the beginning, you\u2019re more likely to come out of the one-nighter unscathed.\u201d</p><p>I nod, fitting my fingertips around my straw. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d openly admit it to him, but I completely agree with him and even find it refreshing. I\u2019ve never really given it that much thought before, but as much as I don\u2019t want a relationship within one hundred feet of me, I am still human and I wouldn\u2019t mind a one-night stand.</p><p>Just not with him. Or anyone in this place. OK, so maybe I\u2019m too chicken for a one-night stand and this drink has already started going straight to my head. Truth is, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before and even though the thought is kind of exciting, it still scares the shit out of me. I\u2019ve only ever been with two guys: Ian Walsh, my first love who took my virginity and died in a car accident three months later, and then Christian Deering, my Ian rebound guy and the jerk who cheated on me with some red-haired slut.</p><p>I\u2019m just glad I never said that poisonous three-word phrase that begins with \u2018I\u2019 and ends with \u2018you\u2019, back to him because I had a feeling, deep down, that when he said it to me, he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was talking about.</p><p>Then again, maybe he did and that\u2019s why after five months of dating, he hooked up with someone else: because I never said it back.</p><p>I look up at the bartender to notice he\u2019s smiling back at me, waiting patiently for me to say something. This guy\u2019s good; either that, or he really is just trying to be friendly. I admit, he\u2019s cute; can\u2019t be older than twenty-five and has soft brown eyes that smile before his lips do. I notice how toned his biceps and chest are underneath that tight-fitting t-shirt. And he\u2019s tanned; definitely a guy who has lived most of his life near an ocean somewhere.</p><p>I stop looking when I notice my mind wandering, thinking about how he looks in swim shorts and no shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Blake,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m Rob\u2019s brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rob? Oh yeah, the guy who owns The Underground.</p><p>I reach out my hand and Blake gently shakes it.</p><p>\u201cCamryn.\u201d</p><p>I hear Natalie\u2019s voice over the music before I even see her. She makes her way through a cluster of people standing around near the dance floor and pushes her way past to get to me. Immediately, she takes note of Blake and her eyes start glistening, lighting up with her huge, blatant smile. Damon, following behind her with her hand still clasped in his, notices, too, but he just locks emotionless eyes with me. I get the strangest feeling from it, but I brush it off as Natalie presses her shoulder into mine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing over here?\u201d she asks with obvious accusation in her voice. She\u2019s grinning from ear to ear and glances between Blake and me several times before giving me all of her attention.</p><p>\u201cHaving a drink,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you come over here to get one for yourself, or to check up on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth!\u201d she says, letting Damon\u2019s hand fall away from hers and she reaches up and taps hers fingers on the bar, smiling at Blake. \u201cAnything with Vodka.\u201d</p><p>Blake nods and looks at Damon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Rum &amp; Coke,\u201d Damon says.</p> <p>Natalie presses her lips against the side of my head and I feel the heat of her breath on my ear when she whispers, \u201cHoly shit, Cam! Do you know who that is?\u201d</p><p>I notice Blake\u2019s mouth spread subtly into a smile, having heard her.</p><p>Feeling my face get hot with embarrassment, I whisper back, \u201cYeah, his name is Blake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Rob\u2019s brother!\u201d she hisses; her gaze falls back on him.</p><p>I look up at Damon, hoping he\u2019ll get the hint and drag her off somewhere, but this time he pretends not to \u2018get it\u2019. Where is the Damon I know, the one who used to have my back when it came to Natalie?</p><p>Uh oh, he must be pissed at her again. He only ever acts like this when Natalie has opened her big mouth, or done something that Damon just can\u2019t get past. We\u2019ve only been here for about thirty minutes. What could she have done in such a short time? And then I realize: this is Natalie and if anyone can piss a boyfriend off in under an under hour and without knowing it, it\u2019s her.</p> <p>I slip off the barstool and take her by the arm, pulling her away from the bar. Damon, probably knowing what my plan is, stays behind with Blake.</p><p>The music seems to have gotten louder as the live band ends one song and starts the next.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I demand, turning her around to face me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean what did I do?\u201d She\u2019s hardly even paying attention to me; her body moves subtly with the music instead.</p><p>\u201cNat, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she stops and looks right at me, searching my face for answers.</p><p>\u201cTo piss Damon off?\u201d I say. \u201cHe was fine when we came in here.\u201d</p><p>She looks across the space briefly at Damon standing by the bar, sipping his drink, and then back at me with a confused look on her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything...I don\u2019t think.\u201d She looks up as if in thought, trying to recall what she might have said or done.</p> <p>She puts her hands on her hips. \u201cWhat makes you think he\u2019s pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got that look,\u201d I say, glancing back at him and Blake, \u201cand I hate it when you two fight, especially when I\u2019m stuck with you for the night and have to listen to you both go back and forth about stupid shit that happened a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s confused expression turns into a devious smile. \u201cWell, I think you\u2019re paranoid and maybe trying to distract me from saying anything about you and Blake.\u201d She\u2019s getting that playful look now and I hate it.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cThere is no \u2018me and Blake\u2019, we\u2019re just talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking is the first step. Smiling at him\u2014(her grin deepens) which I totally saw you doing when I walked up\u2014is the next step.\u201d She crosses her arms and pops out her hip. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve already had a conversation with him without him having to pry the answers out of you\u2014Hell, you already know his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor someone who wants me to have a good time and meet a guy, you don\u2019t know how to shut up when things already appear to be going your way.\u201d</p><p>Natalie lets the music dictate her movement again, raising her hands up a little above her and moving her h*ps around seductively. I just stand here.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going to happen,\u201d I say sternly. \u201cYou got what you wanted and I\u2019m talking to someone and have no intention in telling him I have Chlamydia, so please, don\u2019t make a scene.\u201d</p><p>She gives in with a long, deep sigh and stops dancing long enough to say, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll leave you to him, but if he takes you up to Rob\u2019s floor, I want details.\u201d She points her finger at me firmly, one eye slanted and her lips pursed.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I say, just to get her off my back, \u201cbut don\u2019t hold your breath because it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>AN HOUR AND TWO drinks later, I\u2019m on \u2018Rob\u2019s floor\u2019 of the building with Blake. I\u2019m just a little buzzed, walking and seeing perfectly straight, so I know I\u2019m not drunk. But I\u2019m a little too happy and that bothers me a bit. When Blake suggested we \u2018get away from the noise for a while\u2019, my warning sirens were going off like crazy inside my head: Don\u2019t you go off by yourself at a nightclub after a couple of drinks with this guy you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t do it, Cam. You\u2019re not a stupid girl, so don\u2019t let the alcohol make you stupid.</p><p>All of these things screamed at me. And I listened until at some point, Blake\u2019s infectious smile and the way he made me feel completely at ease calmed the voices and the sirens down so much that I couldn\u2019t hear them anymore.</p><p>\u201cThis is what they call Rob\u2019s Floor?\u201d I ask, looking out over the cityscape from the roof of the warehouse. All of the buildings in the city are lit up brilliantly with glowing blue and white and green lights. The streets appear bathed in an orangish hue pouring down from the hundreds of street lamps.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d he says, taking my hand and I inwardly flinch at the gesture but accept it. \u201cA posh sex room with mirrors on the ceiling?\u201d</p><p>Wait a second...that\u2019s exactly what I thought\u2014well, in a roundabout way\u2014but then why in the hell did I come up here with him?</p><p>OK, now I\u2019m panicking a little.</p><p>I think maybe I am slightly drunk after all, otherwise my judgment would not be this far off. And it freaks me out and almost completely sobers me up to think that I would ever be up for any kind of \u2018sex room\u2019 even in a drunken state. Is the alcohol really just making me stupid, or is it bringing out something inside of me that I don\u2019t want to believe is there?</p><p>I glance over at the metal door set in the brick wall and notice a light shining through it and the doorjamb. He left it open; that\u2019s a good sign.</p><p>He walks with me to a wooden picnic table and nervously I sit down next to him on the top of it. The wind brushes through my hair, pulling a few strands into my mouth. I reach up and tuck my finger behind them and pull the strands away.</p><p>\u201cGood thing it was me,\u201d he says, looking out at the city with his hands draped between his knees; his feet are propped on the bench seat below.</p><p>I pull my legs up and sit Indian-style, folding my hands in my lap. I look over at him questioningly.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cGood thing it was me who brought you up here,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cA beautiful girl like you down there with all of those guys.\u201d He turns his head to look right at me; his brown eyes appear faintly luminescent in the dark. \u201cIf I had been someone else, you might\u2019ve been the rape victim of your very own Lifetime movie.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m completely sober now. Just like that, in two seconds flat, it\u2019s as though I never drank a thing. My back shoots straight up rigidly and I suck in a deep, nervous breath.</p><p>What the f**k was I thinking?!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he says, smiling softly and putting up both hands, palms facing outward in front of him, \u201cI would never do anything to a girl that she didn\u2019t want, or anything to one who\u2019s had a few drinks and just thinks it\u2019s what she wants.\u201d</p><p>I think I just dodged a very deadly bullet.</p><p>My shoulders relax somewhat and I feel like I can breathe again. I mean sure, he could just be filling my head full of more bullshit to make me trust him, but my instincts are telling me that he\u2019s perfectly harmless. Keep my guard up and be careful while I\u2019m alone up here with him, but at least I can relax. I think if he intended to take advantage of me, he wouldn\u2019t have announced the danger of the possibility like that.</p><p>I laugh a little under my breath, thinking about something he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d He looks across at me, smiling and waiting.</p><p>\u201cYour Lifetime movie reference,\u201d I say, feeling my lips shape in a faint, embarrassed smile. \u201cYou watch that stuff?\u201d</p><p>He looks away, sharing my embarrassment for him. \u201cNah,\u201d he says, \u201cI think it\u2019s just common knowledge comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I taunt him. \u201cI don\u2019t know; you\u2019re the first guy I\u2019ve ever heard use \u2018Lifetime movie\u2019 in a sentence.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s blushing now and I\u2019m kicking myself for being so happy to see it.</p><p>\u201cWell, just don\u2019t tell anybody, alright?\u201d He gives me his best pouty face.</p><p>I smile back at him and then look out at the city lights, hoping to deter any hopeful expectations he might have developed over the course of our brief, playful exchange. I don\u2019t care how nice or charming or sexy he is, I\u2019m not caving to him. I\u2019m just not ready for anything other than what we\u2019re doing right now: having an innocent, friendly conversation with no sexual or relationship strings attached. It\u2019s so damn hard to have that with any guy because they always seem to think that a simple smile means something more than it is.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me,\u201d he says, \u201cwhy are you here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no..,\u201d I shake my smiling head and my finger at him, \u201c...let\u2019s not go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, throw me a bone here. It\u2019s just conversation.\u201d He turns fully around at the waist to face me and rests one leg on the tabletop. \u201cI genuinely want to know. It\u2019s not a tactic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tactic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like digging around inside your problems to find something to pretend I care about just so I can get in your panties\u2014if I wanted in your panties, I\u2019d come out and tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you don\u2019t want in my panties?\u201d I look at him in a half-smiling sidelong glance.</p><p>A little defeated, but not deterred by it, he softens his face and says, \u201cEventually, yeah. I\u2019d be f**king mental to not want to sleep with you, but if that\u2019s all I wanted from you and that\u2019s what I brought you up here for, I would\u2019ve told you before you agreed to come up here.\u201d</p><p>I appreciate the honesty and definitely have more respect for him, but my smile sort of locked up when he said something about \u2018if that\u2019s all\u2019 he wanted from me. What else could he want from me? A date, which could lead to a relationship? Ummm, no. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say, backing off a little and letting him know it, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for either, just so you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of what?\u201d And then he realizes \u2018what\u2019 a second later. He smiles and shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m with you on that one\u2014I really did just bring you up here for the conversation, as hard as that may be to believe.\u201d</p><p>Something tells me that if I wanted either, sex or a date, or both, that Blake would give it to me, but he\u2019s smoothly backing off without making himself look rejected.</p><p>\u201cTo answer your question,\u201d I say, giving in to him for conversation\u2019s sake, \u201cI\u2019m single because I had a few bad experiences and right now I\u2019m just not looking for any do-overs.\u201d</p> <p>Blake nods. \u201cI hear yah.\u201d He looks away from my eyes and the breeze catches his blond hair, pushing his semi-long bangs away from his forehead. \u201cDo-overs generally suck, at least in the beginning. The learning process in itself is a nightmare.\u201d He looks back at me to elaborate. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with someone for so long you get used to them, y\u2019know? It\u2019s a comfort-zone thing. When we get settled in our comfort zone, trying to pull us out of it even if everything about it is hell and unhealthy, is like trying to pull a fat ass couch potato out of his living room long enough to get a life.\u201d Maybe realizing he was getting too deep with me too soon, Blake lightens the mood by adding, \u201cTook me three months with Jen before I was comfortable taking a shit with her in the house.\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud and when I\u2019m brave enough to look back at him, I see that he\u2019s smiling.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to get the feeling he\u2019s not over his ex-fianc\u00e9 as much he\u2019s trying to make himself believe. So, I try to do him a favor by steering the hurtful topic to myself before he has that eureka moment and his world comes falling down around him all over again.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend died,\u201d I blurt out, mostly for his sake. \u201cCar accident.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s face falls and he looks right at me, his eyes full of remorse. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I put up my hand. \u201cNo, it\u2019s perfectly alright; you didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d After he nods subtly and waits for me to go on, I say, \u201cIt was a week before graduation.\u201d He places his hand on my knee, but I know it\u2019s not for anything other than to comfort me.</p><p>I start to tell him what happened when I hear a loud smack! and Blake falls off the tabletop and hits the roof floor. It happened so fast I never saw Damon rushing him from the side, or heard when he burst through the metal door several feet away.</p><p>\u201cDamon!\u201d I shriek as he tackles Blake before he can get up and starts pummeling his face with his fists. \u201cSTOP! DAMON! OH MY GOD!\u201d</p><p>Another series of punches rain down on Blake before the shock wears off me and I run over and try pulling Damon off of him. I lunge on Damon\u2019s back, grabbing his flailing arms by the wrists, but he\u2019s so focused on beating the shit out of Blake that I feel like I\u2019m on the back of one of those mechanical bulls. I\u2019m thrown off and land hard on the concrete on my butt and hands.</p><p>Blake finally gets up after serving one good punch at the side of Damon\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the f**k is your problem, man?!\u201d Blake says, stumbling to his feet. One hand never leaves his jaw where he continuously rubs it as if trying to pop it back into place. His nose is bleeding from both nostrils and his upper lip is busted and swollen. All of the blood looks black in the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what the fuck!\u201d Damon roars and goes to attack him again, but I rush over and do what I can to hold him back. I step around in front of him and shove the palms of my hands against his rock-hard chest.</p><p>\u201cJust stop it, Damon! We were just talking! What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d I\u2019m yelling so loud already my voice feels strained.</p><p>I turn at the waist, keeping my hands firmly on Damon\u2019s chest and I look right at Blake. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Blake, I-I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says with a hard, rebuffed expression. \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d</p><p>He turns and walks away through the metal door. A vociferous bang! resounds through the air as it slams behind him. I whirl back around at Damon with fire in my eyes and I push him as hard as I can in the chest. \u201cYou a**hole! I can\u2019t believe you did that!\u201d I\u2019m literally screaming three inches from his face.</p><p>Damon\u2019s lip furrows and he\u2019s still breathing hard from the fight. His dark eyes are wide and unfettered and sort of feral. A part of me feels suspicious of him, but the part of me that has known him for twelve years cancels the suspicion out.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing leaving with some guy you just f**king met? I thought you were smarter than that, Cam, even buzzed out of your mind!\u201d</p><p>I step back from him and cross my arms angrily over my stomach. \u201cAre you calling me stupid? We were just talking!\u201d I shriek and my blonde hair falls down around my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly capable of recognizing the a**holes from the nice guys and right about now I\u2019m seeing a total f**king a**hole!\u201d</p> <p>He appears to grit his teeth behind his tightly-closed lips. \u201cCall me what you want, but I was just protecting you.\u201d He says it surprisingly calm.</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d I shout. \u201cBad conversation? A guy who genuinely just wanted to talk?\u201d</p><p>Damon smirks. \u201cNo guy just wants to talk,\u201d he says as if he\u2019s an expert. \u201cNo guy is going to lead a girl that looks like you out alone on the top of a goddamned warehouse building just to talk. Ten more minutes and he would\u2019ve thrown your little ass on top of that table and had his way with you. No one can hear you scream out here, Cam.\u201d</p><p>I swallow down a lump in my throat, but another one forms in its place. Maybe Damon\u2019s right. Maybe I was so blinded by Blake\u2019s sincere and privately wounded personality that I completely fell for a tactic I never contemplated. Sure, I\u2019ve envisioned these kinds of situations before and have seen the typical ones on television, but maybe Blake was trying something else on me...No, I don\u2019t believe it. He would\u2019ve thrown me on the picnic table if I asked him to, but my heart tells me he wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.</p><p>I turn my back on Damon, not wanting him to see anything left in my face that might give away that for a second I actually believed him. I\u2019m pissed as hell for the way he handled it, but I can\u2019t hate him forever because he really was just looking out for me. Overloaded on alpha male testosterone, no doubt, but looking out for me, nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cCam, look at me please.\u201d</p><p>I wait a few defiant seconds before turning around with my arms still crossed.</p><p>Damon peers in at me with a softer gaze than before. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just...,\u201d he sighs and looks off to the side now as though what he\u2019s about to say he can\u2019t while looking right at me, \u201c...Camryn, I can\u2019t stand the thought of you with some other guy.\u201d</p><p>I feel like someone just punched me in the gut. I even let out a weird yelping sound from my throat and my eyes grow wide.</p><p>I glance nervously toward the metal door and then back at him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Natalie?\u201d I have to drive this topic completely off this roof. What the hell did he just say? No, he can\u2019t mean what it sounded like. I must\u2019ve heard him wrong. Yeah, my buzz is back and I\u2019m not thinking straight.</p><p>He steps up closer to me and cups my elbows in his hands. Instantly, I feel the need to back away from him, but I\u2019m frozen in the same spot, barely able to move anything other than my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d he says, lowering his voice to a desperate whisper. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you since seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s that punch to the gut again.</p><p>Finally, I manage to back away from him. \u201cNo. No.\u201d I shake my head back and forth, trying to make sense of this. \u201cAre you drunk, Damon? Or strung out? Something\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d My arms come uncrossed and I put up my hands. \u201cWe need to go find Natalie. I won\u2019t say anything to her about what you said because you won\u2019t remember it in the morning, but we really do need to go. Now.\u201d</p><p>I start to walk toward the now closed metal door, but feel Damon\u2019s hand collapse around my bicep and he turns me around. My breath catches and that suspicious feeling I had about him earlier comes back full-force, completely reversing the years I\u2019ve known him and have trusted him. He glares at me with eyes more feral than before, but manages to retain a sort of eerie softness in them, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk and I haven\u2019t done any coke since last week.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he does coke at all is more than enough to make it impossible to ever be attracted to him, but he\u2019s always been one of my closest friends and so I\u2019ve always overlooked his drug use. But he\u2019s telling the truth right now and being such a close friend for so long is what allows me to know this.</p><p>For the first time, I wish he was strung out because then we really could forget this ever happened.</p><p>I look down at his fingers clamped around my arm and finally notice how much pressure he\u2019s applying and it scares me.</p><p>\u201cLet go of my arm, Damon, please.\u201d</p><p>Instead of loosening, I feel his fingers tighten and I try to pull away. He jerks me towards him and before I can react, he crushes his mouth over mine, his free hand wraps around the back of my neck forcing my head still. He tries to stick his tongue in my mouth, but I manage to rear my head back just enough to butt my forehead into his. It stuns him\u2014and me\u2014and instinctively he lets go of my body.</p><p>\u201cCam! Wait!\u201d I hear him yelling out to me as I run away and throw open the metal door.</p><p>I hear his fierce footsteps moving after mine as he races down the loud metal stairs behind me, but I lose him once I make it back into the cage elevator, slam the fence gate closed and pound hard once on the MAIN button. The same ogre who let us in the club is standing at the door when I rush past him, having to partially shove him out of my way to get outside.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, babe!\u201d he shouts as I run down the sidewalk and away from the warehouse.</p><p>I walk as far as the Shell station and call a cab to pick me up.</p><p>4</p><p>MY CELL PHONE WAKES me up the next morning. I hear it buzzing around on the nightstand beside my head. NATALIE reads in bold letters across the screen and her wide-eyed, toothy smiling face is staring back at me. Seeing her face wakes me the rest of the way up and I rise up stiffly from the bed and just hold the phone in my hand, letting it buzz against my palm for a few seconds more before finally getting the courage to hit the answer button.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d her voice shrieks into my ear. \u201cOh my God, Cam, you just disappeared and I was freaking out and Damon was missing for a short while and then he showed back up and I saw Blake leaving at one point with blood all over his damn face and then I really started to see what you were talking about when you said that Damon was pissed\u2014.\u201d She finally breathes. \u201cAnd I kept asking him what I did or said or if it was because of last week at the restaurant, but he just ignored me and said it\u2019s time to go and I\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNatalie,\u201d I cut in, my head spinning with her run-on sentences, \u201cjust calm down for a second, alright?\u201d</p><p>I toss the blanket off me and get out of the bed with the phone still pressed to my ear. I know that I have to do this, to tell her what Damon did. I have to. Not only would she never forgive me later when she found out, but I would never forgive myself. If the tables were turned I would want her to tell me.</p><p>But not over the phone. This is a mandatory face-to-face discussion.</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me for coffee in an hour?\u201d</p> <p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cUhh, yeah, sure. Are you sure you\u2019re alright? I was so worried. I thought you got kidnapped or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, yes, I\u2019m...,\u201d I\u2019m totally not fine, \u201cyes, I\u2019m fine, OK. Just meet me in an hour and please come alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon\u2019s passed out at his house,\u201d she says and I detect the grin in her voice. \u201cGirl, he did things to me last night I never knew he could do.\u201d</p><p>I shudder at her words. They\u2019re like screaming entities blaring at me on the other end of the phone but I have to pretend they\u2019re just words.</p> <p>\u201cI mean I couldn\u2019t even think about sex until I knew you were OK. You wouldn\u2019t answer your cell so I called your mom at like three and she said you were asleep in your bed. I was still so worried because you just left and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hour,\u201d I interrupt before she goes off on another tangent.</p><p>We hang up and the first thing I do is look at the missed calls on my phone. Six were from Natalie, but the other nine were from Damon. The only voice mails though were left by Natalie. I guess Damon didn\u2019t want to leave any incriminating evidence behind.</p><p>Not that I need evidence. Natalie and I have been best friends since the bitch stole my Corduroy Cool Barbie Doll at a sleepover.</p><p>I\u2019m fidgeting by the time she shows up and have drunk down over half of my latte. She plops down on the empty chair. I wish she wasn\u2019t smiling so much; it\u2019s only making it that much harder.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell, Cam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>She blinks, stunned.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No sarcastic \u2018thanks\u2019 followed by your famous rolling eyes?\u201d</p><p>Please stop smiling, Nat. Please, just take my strange UNsmiling behavior serious for once and look at me with a serious face.</p><p>Of course, she doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m just going to cut right to it, OK?\u201d</p><p>There it is: finally the smile starts to fade.</p><p>I swallow and take a deep breath. God, I can\u2019t believe this happened! If it were some random guy she had been seeing during one of her and Damon\u2019s short breakups, this wouldn\u2019t be so difficult. But this is Damon, the guy she\u2019s been with for five years, who she always runs right back into the arms of after a breakup or a fight. He\u2019s the only guy she\u2019s ever truly been in love with.</p> <p>\u201cCam, what\u2019s going on?\u201d She senses the severe measure of what I\u2019m about to tell her and I can see in her brown eyes how already she\u2019s trying to figure out if this is something she wants to hear, or not. I think she knows it has something to do with Damon.</p><p>I see the lump move down the center of her throat.</p><p>\u201cLast night, I was out on the roof with Blake\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her worried face is suddenly assaulted by smiles. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s grabbing a hold of the opportunity to mask the inevitable news with something she can joke around about.</p><p>But I stop her before she has a chance to comment.</p><p>\u201cJust listen to me for a minute, OK?\u201d</p><p>Finally, I\u2019ve reached her. The natural playful spirit that always exudes from her face drains right out of her.</p><p>I go on:</p><p>\u201cDamon thought Blake took me out on the roof to have his way with me. He stormed out and blew up on Blake; beat the shit out of him. Blake left understandably pissed off and then it was just me and Damon. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s eyes are already giving away her fears. It\u2019s like she knows what I\u2019m going to say and she\u2019s starting to quietly hate me for it.</p><p>\u201cDamon forced himself on me, Nat.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow narrower.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me and tried to tell me he\u2019s had a thing for me since seventh grade.\u201d</p><p>I can tell her heartbeat has sped up just by how heavy her short breaths have become.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lying bitch.\u201d</p><p>I feel punched in the gut again, except this time it completely knocks the breath out of me.</p><p>Natalie shoots up from the chair, shoulders her purse and glares down at me through ravenous dark eyes framed by equally dark hair.</p><p>I still can\u2019t move, stunned by what she said to me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve wanted Damon since I started dating him,\u201d she hisses down at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen it all these years, the way you look at him?\u201d Her mouth stretches into a hard line. \u201cShit, Camryn, you\u2019re always taking up for him, bitchin\u2019 at me when I joke around about other guys.\u201d She starts motioning her hands out in front of her and imitating me in an exaggerated, nasally voice: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a boyfriend, Nat\u2014Don\u2019t forget about Damon, Nat\u2014You should think about Damon.\u201d She slams her palms down on the table, causing the table to sway precariously side to side on its base before becoming still again. I don\u2019t even move to catch my drink, but it doesn\u2019t fall over. \u201cStay away from me and away from Damon.\u201d She points her finger in my face. \u201cOr I swear to God, I will beat you senseless.\u201d</p><p>She walks away and right out the tall double glass doors, the ringing of the little bell at the top of the door echoes around the space.</p><p>Once I finally snap out of the shock, I notice about three customers watching me from their tables. Even the barista behind the counter looks away when my eyes fall on her. I just look down at the table, letting the patterns in the wood grain move around in my unfocused vision. I rest my head in my hands and sit here for the longest time.</p><p>Twice I go to call her, but force myself to stop and just set the phone back on the table.</p><p>How did this happen? Years of inseparable friendship\u2014I cleaned up after the girl\u2019s stomach bug for Christ\u2019s sake!\u2014and she tosses me out like moldy leftovers. She\u2019s just hurting, I try to tell myself. She\u2019s just in denial right now and I need to give her time to let the truth sink in. She\u2019ll come around, she\u2019ll dump his ass and she\u2019ll apologize to me and drag me back to The Underground looking to find both of us new guys. But I don\u2019t really believe anything I\u2019m saying, or rather, the less rational, wounded part of me won\u2019t let me see past the angry red.</p><p>A customer walks by, tall older man in a wrinkled suit, and sneaks a glance at me before walking out. I\u2019m totally humiliated. I look up again and catch the same pairs of eyes as before looking, only to look away. I feel like I\u2019m being pitied. And I hate being pitied.</p><p>I grab my purse from the floor, stand up and throw the strap sloppily over my shoulder and storm out almost as indignantly as Natalie had.</p><p>It\u2019s been a week and I haven\u2019t heard a word from Natalie. I did eventually break down and try to call her\u2014several times\u2014but her voicemail always picked up. And the last time I called, she had changed her greeting to: Hi, this is Nat. If you\u2019re a friend\u2014a real friend\u2014then leave me a message and I\u2019ll call you back, otherwise, don\u2019t bother. I wanted to reach through the phone then and punch her in the face, but I settled with chucking it across the room. Thankfully, I bought that protection case when I bought this phone, otherwise I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be at the Apple store shelling out another couple hundred bucks for a new one.</p><p>I even broke down and tried to call Damon. He\u2019s the last person on this planet I want to talk to, but he\u2019s the one holding the key to mine and Natalie\u2019s friendship. Unfortunate, but apparently true. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking: That he would sell himself out and tell Natalie the truth? Yeah. Fat chance.</p><p>So, I stopped calling. I purposely avoided our favorite coffee shop and settled with the crap at the closest convenience store and I went two miles out of my way to go into my job interview at Dillard\u2019s, just so I didn\u2019t have to drive past Natalie\u2019s apartment.</p><p>I got the job. An assistant manager\u2019s position\u2014my mom put in a good word for me; she\u2019s good friends with Mrs. Phillips, the lady who hired me\u2014but I\u2019m as excited about working at a department store as I am about drinking this craptastic coffee every morning.</p><p>And it hits me as I sit at the kitchen table and watch my bleach-blonde mom sift her way through the refrigerator: I\u2019m no longer moving out on my own and in with my best friend. I\u2019m going to either have to find an apartment and live by myself, or be stuck here for a while longer with my mother until Natalie comes to her senses. Which might be never. Or, it might take so long that I become unforgiving and tell her to screw off when she does.</p><p>The room feels like it\u2019s swaying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out with Roger tonight,\u201d my mom says behind the refrigerator door. She lifts up from leaning inside and looks across at me, wearing too much eye shadow. \u201cYou met Roger, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I met Roger.\u201d Really I didn\u2019t, or maybe I did, but I\u2019m getting his name mixed up with the last five guys she\u2019s gone out on a date with in the past month. She signed up to one of those weird speed-dating things. And she sure speeds right through these guys, so I guess the term is literal in her case.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy. It\u2019s my third date with him.\u201d</p><p>I squeeze out a smile. I want my mom to be happy even if it means getting remarried, which is something that scares me to death. I love my dad\u2014I\u2019m Daddy\u2019s little girl\u2014but what he did to my mom is unforgivable. Ever since the divorce four months ago, my mom has been this strange woman who I only know halfway anymore. It\u2019s like she reached inside a drawer that has been locked for thirty years and pulls out the personality she used to wear before she met my dad and had me and my brother, Cole. Except that it doesn\u2019t really fit anymore, but she tries her damnedest every day to wear it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already talking about taking me on a cruise.\u201d Her face lights up just thinking about it.</p><p>I close the lid on my laptop. \u201cDon\u2019t you think three dates is a little soon for a cruise?\u201d</p><p>She purses her lips and waves the notion away. \u201cNo baby, it\u2019s just right. He has plenty of money so to him it\u2019s as casual as taking me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>I just look away and nibble on the edge of the sandwich I made, though I\u2019m not at all hungry.</p><p>Mom flits around the kitchen, pretending to clean. Usually, she has a housekeeper come in on Wednesday\u2019s, but when a man is stopping by, she thinks running a dish rag over the counter and spraying the house with air freshener is cleaning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget about Saturday,\u201d she says as she starts to load the dishwasher, which is a surprise.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, Mom.\u201d I sigh and shake my head. \u201cThough I might take a rain check this time.\u201d</p><p>Her back straightens up and she looks right at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBaby, you promised you\u2019d go,\u201d she says desperately, tapping her nails nervously on the countertop. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like going inside that jail by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s prison, Mom.\u201d I casually pick off a few pieces of bread crust and drop them on the plate. \u201cAnd they can\u2019t get to you; they\u2019re all locked up, just like Cole. And it\u2019s their own damn faults.\u201d</p><p>My mom lowers her eyes and a huge ball of burning hot guilt knots up in my stomach.</p><p>I sigh deeply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to say that.\u201d</p> <p>I totally meant what I said, just not out loud and to her because it hurts her whenever I talk about my older brother, Cole, and his five-year sentence in prison for killing a man in a drunk-driving accident. This happened just six months after Ian died in the car accident.</p><p>I feel like I\u2019m losing everybody....</p><p>I get up from the table and stand in front of the bar and she goes back to loading the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you, OK?\u201d</p><p>She pushes out a smile still masked by a thin layer of hurt, and she nods. \u201cThanks, baby.\u201d</p> <p>I feel sorry for her. It breaks my heart that my dad cheated on her after twenty-two years of marriage.</p><p>But we all saw it coming.</p><p>And to think, my parents tried to keep Ian and me away from each other when I confided in my mom at sixteen, telling her that we were in love.</p><p>Parents have this twisted belief that anyone under the age of about twenty simply can\u2019t know what love is, like the age to love is assessed in the same way the law assesses the legal age to drink. They think that the \u2018emotional growth\u2019 of a teenager\u2019s mind is too underdeveloped to understand love, to know if it\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 or not.</p><p>That\u2019s completely asinine.</p><p>The truth is that adults love in different ways, not the only way. I loved Ian in the now, the way he looked at me, how he made my stomach swim, how he held my hair when I was puking my guts up after eating a bad enchilada.</p> <p>That\u2019s love.</p><p>I adore my parents, but long before their divorce the last time my mom was sick, the most my dad did for her was bring up the Pepto-Bismol and ask where the remote control was on his way out.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>I guess my parents really screwed me up somewhere along the line because as good as they are to me, as much as they do for me and as much as I love them, I still managed to grow up terrified I would end up just like them. Unhappy and only pretending to live out this wonderful life with two kids, a dog and a white picket fence. But in reality, I knew they slept with their backs facing each other. I knew my mom often thought about what life would\u2019ve been like if only she had given that boy in high school who she secretly \u2018loved\u2019 another chance (I read her old diary. I know all about him). I know that my dad\u2014before he cheated on Mom with her\u2014thought a lot about Rosanne Hartman, his prom date (and first love), who still lives over on Wiltshire.</p><p>If anyone\u2019s delusional about how love works, what real love feels like, it\u2019s the majority of the adult population.</p><p>Ian and I didn\u2019t have sex that night he took my virginity; we made love that night. I never thought I\u2019d say those two words together: \u2018make love\u2019, because they always sounded corny, like it was an adult-only phrase. I winced when I heard someone else say it, or when that guy sang Feel Like Makin\u2019 Love from my dad\u2019s car stereo every morning on the classic rock station.</p><p>But I can say it because that\u2019s exactly what happened.</p><p>And it was magical and wonderful and awesome and nothing will ever compare to it. Ever.</p> <p>I did go with my mom that Saturday to see Cole in prison. But I didn\u2019t say much, as usual, and Cole ignored me right back. He never does it to be hateful, but instead it\u2019s like he\u2019s afraid to say anything to me because he knows I\u2019m still so pissed and hurt and disappointed by what he did. It wasn\u2019t like a one-time thing that can be filed away as a \u2018tragic accident\u2019; Cole was an alcoholic before be turned eighteen. He\u2019s the black sheep of the family. He was a rotten little bastard growing up with stints in juvy and making my parents sick with worry when he\u2019d disappear for weeks at a time while he was out doing whatever the hell he wanted. He\u2019s only ever really thought of himself.</p><p>I started my job as assistant manager the following Monday. I\u2019m grateful to have a job because I don\u2019t want to live off my dad\u2019s money the rest of my life, but as I stood there dressed in a cute black pants suit and white button-up shirt and heels, I felt completely out of place. Not necessarily because of the clothes, but...I just don\u2019t belong there. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but that Monday and the rest of that week when I woke up, got dressed and walked into that store, something was itching the back part of my consciousness. I couldn\u2019t hear the actual words, but it felt like: This is your life, Camryn Bennett. This is your life.</p><p>And I would look up at the customers walking by and all I could see was the negative: snooty noses in the air, carrying expensive purses, buying pointless products.</p><p>That was when I realized that everything I did from that point on produced the same results:</p><p>This is your life, Camryn Bennett. This is your life.</p><p>5</p><p>THE DAY WHEN EVERYTHING changed was yesterday.</p><p>That itch in my brain compelled me to get up. And so I did. It told me to put on my shoes, pack a small bag with a few necessities and grab my purse. And so I did.</p><p>There was no logic or any sense of purpose except that I knew I had to do something other than what I was doing, or I might not make it through this. Or, I might end up like my parents.</p><p>I always thought that depression was so overrated, the way people toss the word around (a lot like the L-word that I will never say to a guy again for as long as I live). When I was in high school, girls would often talk about how they were \u2018depressed\u2019 and how their mom\u2019s took them to a shrink to get on medication and then they\u2019d all gather around to see whose pills they wanted to try out. Depression to me meant three words: sadness, sadness and sadness. I saw those stupid commercials with the cartoonish figures moping around with black clouds constantly raining on their heads and thought to myself how people are really laying this depression stuff on thick. I feel bad for people. I always have. I never like to see someone hurting, but I admit whenever I heard someone play the depression card, I\u2019d roll my eyes and go about my business.</p><p>Little did I know that depression is a serious disease.</p><p>Those girls at school had no idea what it really means to be depressed.</p><p>It\u2019s not only about sadness. In truth, sadness really has little to do with it. Depression is pain in its purest form and I would do anything to be able to feel an emotion again. Any emotion at all. Pain hurts, but pain that\u2019s so powerful that you can\u2019t feel anything anymore, that\u2019s when you start to feel like you\u2019re going crazy.</p><p>It bothers me immensely to realize that the last time I actually cried was that day at school when I found out that Ian was killed in that crash. It was in Damon\u2019s arms that I cried. Damon, of all people.</p><p>But that was the last time I ever shed a tear and that was a little over a year ago.</p><p>After that, I just couldn\u2019t anymore. Not over my parent\u2019s divorce, or when Cole got sentenced, or when Damon showed his true colors, or when Natalie stabbed me in the back. I keep thinking that any day now I\u2019m going to break down and bawl my eyes out with my face buried in my pillow. I should be puking from crying so much.</p><p>But it never comes and I still feel nothing.</p><p>Except this sense of breaking free from it all. That itch, although vague and stingy, compels me to obey it. I don\u2019t know why, I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s there and I can\u2019t stop myself from listening to it.</p><p>I spent most of the night at the bus station, sitting there waiting for that itch to tell me what to do.</p><p>And then I walked up to the counter.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the woman said blankly.</p><p>I thought about it for a second and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see my sister in Idaho because she just had a baby.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me awkwardly, and I admit, it felt awkward. I don\u2019t have a sister and I\u2019ve never been to Idaho, but it was the first lie that popped into my head. And she had been eating a baked potato. It was sitting behind the counter in a buttery bowl of foil and sour cream. So, naturally Idaho was the first state I thought of. It doesn\u2019t matter where I choose to go really, because I just don\u2019t care.</p><p>I thought, once I get to Idaho I\u2019ll just buy another ticket to somewhere else. Maybe I\u2019ll go to California. Or Washington. Or, maybe I\u2019ll just head south and see what Texas is like. I always imagined it a giant landscape of dirt and roadside bars and cowboy hats. And people in Texas are supposed to be some kind of badasses, or something. Maybe they\u2019ll stomp the crap out of me with their cowboy boots.</p><p>I won\u2019t feel it. I don\u2019t feel anything anymore, remember?</p><p>That was yesterday, when I decided to just get up and go, to break free from everything. I had always wanted to do it, to break free, but I never imagined it happening like this. Ian and I, before he died, planned our life in an unconventional way. We wanted to steer clear of anything predictable, anything that made us the same drones of society that get up at the same time every morning and duplicate yesterday. We wanted to backpack across the world\u2014it\u2019s why I brought it up to Natalie that day in the coffee shop. Maybe a part of me hoped she\u2019d share the passion for the idea that Ian and I had and she\u2019d do it with me, but like everything else, it didn\u2019t exactly turn out like I hoped.</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit here?\u201d an older lady says standing in the aisle of the bus with a lime green purse pressed to her chest.</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead,\u201d I say, smiling faintly up at her. I really don\u2019t feel like smiling at all, but the last thing I want to do is give her any reason to believe I\u2019m a troubled young soul that needs a good dose of old lady advice.</p><p>She wiggles her way onto the seat next to me after putting her travel bag away overhead. She\u2019s kind of chunky, but she carries herself well. And she smells nice.</p><p>\u201cYou look young,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere yah headin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdaho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she smiles over at me, revealing all the deep wrinkles around her mouth. \u201cMust be for family\u2014don\u2019t think anybody goes there for vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Going to visit my sister.\u201d</p><p>She pooches her lips out slightly, nodding her head as if filing my answers away. Then she starts fishing around inside her purse.</p><p>I look toward the tall Plexiglas window beside me and watch the passengers come and go from other busses. It\u2019s midday and I\u2019m in Memphis at the moment. I slept most of the way overnight\u2014well, I tried to sleep, but mostly I napped until a bump in the road, or my aching neck and back woke me up from sleeping all cramped on the seat. Never been to Memphis before, but I have to say, this bus station makes me nervous. I\u2019ve seen a few shady-looking people walking around.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m on my way to Montana,\u201d the lady says putting a little white pill on her tongue. \u201cI usually take the train, but I decided to go a different route this time. See some new scenery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou must travel a lot,\u201d I say glancing over.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cJust once a year to visit my mama. She\u2019s ninety-eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that woman is as stubborn as a bull. Got the cancer five times already and she\u2019s still livin\u2019. Beats it every time.\u201d</p> <p>I smile warmly over at her.</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she says, pressing her back deeper against the seat and resting her head on it, \u201cI\u2019m in need of a long nap. I didn\u2019t sleep a lick on the last bus\u2014driver kept swervin\u2019 all over the road.\u201d She points upward. \u201cBe careful on these busses. Y\u2019meet all sorts of strange people and the bus drivers are usually sleep-deprived. Gotta watch \u2018em, help keep \u2018em awake by talkin\u2019 to \u2018em, or else you might end up over the guardrail upside-down in a heap of metal.\u201d</p><p>Now why did she have to say that? I swallow down the memory of Ian\u2019s wreck, which is eerily similar to her words and I just nod at her.</p><p>She closes her eyes, but then opens them back up and looks over at me one more time. \u201cBut really, it\u2019s the people y\u2019gotta watch out for. You never know who y\u2019might meet, or what Ol\u2019 Man Fate has in store for yah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d I say. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>Tennessee slips by my window in a blur. Night falls and I eventually fall asleep, too. I don\u2019t have any dreams; haven\u2019t had a single dream since Ian died, but it\u2019s probably better that way. If I have dreams they might provoke emotion and I\u2019m done with emotion. I\u2019m starting to get used to this feeling of not caring about anything. Aside from a few shady bus station dwellers, I\u2019m really not afraid of anything anymore. I guess when you just don\u2019t care it kind of makes fear your bitch.</p><p>I never used to curse this much, either.</p><p>The old lady and I depart ways in St. Louis and I ride all the way to Kansas with the double-seats to myself, finally getting to lay more horizontally across the seats instead of upright with my face pressed against the window.</p><p>Everything looks the same. Between home and Missouri, it seems the only things that change are the license plates and the signs welcoming travelers to each state, but then after you ride past them it\u2019s just more trees and freeway. In every state there\u2019s always a car broken down on the side of the road. There\u2019s always a hitchhiker and a guy wearing a wife-beater carrying a gas can from his truck to the nearest exit where all the gas stations and fast food restaurants congregate. And there\u2019s always, always a single shoe on the shoulder somewhere. I don\u2019t know what it is with shoes being on the road. You never see a pair of pants or a shirt, and rarely do you see anything like a hat or a pair of sunglasses every once in a while. But the single shoes. What is it with the shoes?</p><p>A bus ride is like being in another world.</p><p>Everybody knows that when they get on, they\u2019re gonna be here for a while. A long while. It\u2019s overcrowded. People are usually packed in so closely that you can smell every different sort of cologne and deodorant and the different kinds of detergent and fabric softener that people use. And unfortunately, you can also smell the people that don\u2019t wear cologne or deodorant at all and their clothes probably haven\u2019t been washed in several days.</p> <p>So far, I really don\u2019t mind the ride so much. It only bothers me when I have to share space with someone.</p><p>There\u2019s a two hour delay for my next bus and so I make my way through the partially crowded station in Kansas looking for a seat not too close to anybody else. Every bus station smells the same, mostly that overpowering fuel that\u2019s starting to make me feel a little sick. I shift on the hard plastic seat, trying to get comfortable but it\u2019s hopeless. There\u2019s a couple of pay phones nearby and I briefly think about how obsolete pay phones are these days. Instinctively, I go to reach for my cell phone inside my sling bag, just to make sure that it\u2019s still there.</p><p>The two hour delay drags by endlessly and when my next bus finally pulls into the station, I\u2019m among the first small group of people to get up and stand in line. At least the seats on the bus have padding and I\u2019ll be able to get somewhat comfortable again.</p><p>The bus driver, wearing navy blue and dark grey from the neck down, reaches out for my ticket and tears off his portion, handing the rest back to me. I tuck it safely down into my bag and board the bus, searching both rows of seats to find the one that feels like the one. I take a window seat near the back and instantly feel better once my body hits the comfort of the padding beneath me. I sigh and hold my bag close against my stomach, crossing my arms over it. It takes ten minutes or so for the bus driver to be satisfied that he has all of the passengers he\u2019s supposed to have for this round. This time there\u2019s only a handful of people, and thankfully, no screaming kids or obnoxious couples who don\u2019t care that it\u2019s gross to suck face in front of an audience. Nothing wrong with kissing in public\u2014Ian and I did it all the time\u2014but when it\u2019s on the verge of becoming a porno, that\u2019s a little much.</p><p>The driver goes to close the doors but then pulls back on the lever and they squeal open again. A guy gets on carrying a black duffle bag on his shoulder. Tall, stylish short brown hair and he\u2019s wearing a tight-fitting navy tee and a sort of crooked smile that could either be genuinely kind, or something more confident. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says to the driver in that laid-back way.</p><p>Even though there are plenty of empty seats for him to choose from, I still make it a point to slide my bag over onto the one next to me, just in case he decides it\u2019s the one for him. It\u2019s not likely, I know, but I\u2019m a just-in-case kind of girl. The doors squeal shut again as the guy walks down the aisle toward me. I look down into the magazine that had been sitting inside the terminal and start reading an article about Brangelina.</p><p>I sigh with relief when he passes me up and takes the pair of empty seats behind me.</p><p>Finally, an under-populated bus I might actually get some deep sleep on. It\u2019s all I really want to do. The longer I stay awake, the more I think about all of the things I don\u2019t want to think about. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, or where I\u2019m going, but I do know that I want to do whatever it is and get there soon.</p> <p>I doze off after staring out the window next to me for an hour.</p><p>Muffled headphone music blaring right behind me wakes me up sometime after dark.</p><p>At first, I just sit here, hoping maybe he\u2019ll notice the top of my now fully awake head bobbing over the seat and decide to turn the music down.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I lean up, reaching back to rub a crooked muscle in my neck from sleeping on my arm and then I turn around to look at him. Is he asleep? How can anyone actually sleep with music blasting in their ears like that? The bus is pitch dark except for a couple of dim reading lights shining down onto books and magazines from above the passenger\u2019s seats and the little green and blue lights at the front of the bus in the driver\u2019s dashboard. The guy sitting behind me is covered by darkness but I can see one side of his face lit up by the moonlight.</p><p>I contemplate it for a second and then push myself up with my knees on the seat and I lean over the back of it, reaching out and tapping him on the leg.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. I tap him harder. He stirs and slowly opens his eyes, looking up at me with my stomach hanging over the top of the seat.</p><p>He reaches up and pulls the earbuds from of his ears, letting the music funnel from the tiny speakers.</p><p>\u201cMind turning it down a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could hear that?\u201d he says.</p><p>I raise a brow and say, \u201cUhhh, yeah, it\u2019s pretty loud.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs and thumbs the MP3 player for the volume button and the music fades.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say and slide back down in my seat.</p><p>I don\u2019t lie down across the seats in the fetal position this time, but lean against the bus and press my head back against the window. I cross my arms and close my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>My eyes pop open, but I don\u2019t move my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you asleep yet?\u201d</p><p>I raise my head from the window and look up to see the guy hovering over me.</p><p>\u201cI literally just closed my eyes,\u201d I say. \u201cHow can I already be asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he whispers. \u201cMy granddad could fall asleep in two seconds flat after closing his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your granddad narcoleptic?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>Wow, this is awkward.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I ask as quietly as he had.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says grinning down at me. \u201cJust wanted to know if you were asleep yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can turn the music back up.\u201d</p><p>I think about it for a second, uncross my arms and lift the rest of the way from the seat, turning at the waist so that I can see him.</p><p>\u201cYou want to wait until I\u2019m asleep to turn the music back up so that you can wake me up again?\u201d I\u2019m having a hard time getting this.</p><p>He smiles a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cYou slept for three hours without it waking you up,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t my music that did it, must\u2019ve been something else.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows draw together. \u201cNo, ummm, I\u2019m pretty sure I know it was the music that did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says, slipping away from the seat and out of sight.</p><p>I wait for a few seconds before closing my eyes in case this might get weirder and when it doesn\u2019t, I drift back into the Land of No Dreams.</p><p>6</p><p>THE SUNLIGHT BEAMING IN through the bus windows wakes me the next morning. I lift up to get a better view, wondering if the scenery has changed any yet, but it hasn\u2019t. And then I notice the music blasting from the earbuds behind me. I creep up over the top of the seat, expecting to see him sound asleep, but he looks back at me with an I-told-you-so smile.</p><p>I roll my eyes and sink back down, pulling my bag onto my lap and sifting through it. I\u2019m starting to wish I\u2019d brought something to keep my mind busy. A book. A crossword puzzle. Something. I sigh heavily and literally start fiddling my thumbs. I wonder where we are in the United States, if I\u2019m even still in Kansas and decide that we must be because every car that passes by the bus has Kansas license plates.</p><p>When I can\u2019t find anything interesting to look at, I pay more attention to the music behind me.</p><p>Is that...? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>Feel Like Makin\u2019 Love comes from the guy\u2019s earbuds; I can tell at first by the distinctive guitar rift in the solo that everyone knows even if Bad Company isn\u2019t their kind of music. I don\u2019t hate classic rock, but I much prefer newer stuff. Give me Muse, Pink or The Civil Wars and I\u2019m happy.</p><p>The earbuds dangling over the back of the seat and practically on my shoulder scares the crap out of me. My body jerks up and a hand flies over as if to slap away a bug that at first I think just landed on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I say, looking up at the guy as he hovers over me again.</p><p>\u201cYou look bored,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can borrow them if you want. Might not be your type of music, but hey, it\u2019ll grow on you. I promise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m looking up at him with an awfully twisted face. Is this guy serious?</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no,\u201d I say and go to turn around again.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one,\u201d I say, \u201cyou\u2019ve had those things stuck in your ears for the past several hours. Gross.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, and?\u201d I think my face is just getting more twisted. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough?\u201d</p><p>He smiles that crooked smile again, which in the daylight I notice produces two tiny dimples near the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, reeling the earbuds back in, \u201cyou said \u2018for one\u2019; I just thought there might be another reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I say, flabbergasted, \u201cyou are unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He smiles and I can see all of his straight, white teeth.</p><p>I definitely didn\u2019t mean that as a compliment, but something tells me he knows as much.</p><p>I go back to digging in my bag already knowing I\u2019m not going to find anything but clothes, but it\u2019s better than dealing with this weirdo.</p><p>He plops down on the empty seat next to me, just before another passenger walks past toward the restroom.</p><p>I just kind freeze here, one hand buried inside my bag, unmoving. I may be looking right at him, but I have to let the shock wear off before I can actually figure out what kind of lecture I want to give him.</p><p>The guy reaches into his own bag and pulls out a little packet containing an antibacterial wipe, rips off the top half and unfolds the towelette. He wipes each earbud down thoroughly and then reaches over to me. \u201cLike new,\u201d he says, waiting for me to take them.</p> <p>Seeing as how it actually seems like he\u2019s trying to be nice, I let my defenses down just a little. \u201cReally, I\u2019m good. But thanks.\u201d It surprises me at how fast I got over the whole sit-next-to-me-without-asking thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably better off anyway,\u201d he says, putting the MP3 player in his bag. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to Justin Bieber or that crazy meat-wearin\u2019 bitch, so I guess you\u2019ll just have to do without.\u201d</p><p>OK, defenses are back up. Bring it on.</p><p>I snarl over at him, crossing my arms. \u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t listen to Justin Bieber. And second, Gaga isn\u2019t so bad. Playing the shock-value card a little too long, I admit, but I like some of her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s shit-music and you know it,\u201d he replies and shakes his head.</p><p>I blink twice, just because I\u2019m at a loss and don\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>He puts his bag on the floor and leans back on the seat, propping one booted foot up on the back of the seat in front of him, but his legs are so long it looks uncomfortable to me. He\u2019s wearing those stylish work-boot-looking things. Dr. Martens, I think. Dammit. Ian always wore those. I look away, not really in any mood to further this very strange conversation with this very strange person.</p><p>That old lady I met in Tennessee was right.</p> <p>He looks over at me, his head pressed comfortably against the itchy fabric behind him. \u201cClassic Rock is where it\u2019s at,\u201d he says matter-of-factly and then gazes out ahead. \u201cZeppelin, the Stones, Journey, Foreigner.\u201d He lets his head fall to the side to look over at me again. \u201cAny of that ringing any bells?\u201d</p><p>I scoff and roll my eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d I say, but then change my tune when I realize I can\u2019t think of many classic rock bands and I don\u2019t want to make myself look stupid after so eloquently saying that I\u2019m not. \u201cI like...Bad Company.\u201d</p><p>A little grin lifts one side of his mouth. \u201cName one song by Bad Company and I\u2019ll leave you alone about it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nervous as hell now, trying to think of any song by Bad Company other than the one he had been listening to. I\u2019m not going to look this guy in the face and say the words: I Feel Like Makin\u2019 Love.</p><p>He waits patiently, that grin of his still in-tact.</p><p>\u201cReady For Love,\u201d I say because it\u2019s the only other one I can think of.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>A smile etches deeper into his face. \u201cNothing,\u201d he says, looking away.</p><p>I blush. I don\u2019t know why and I don\u2019t want to know why.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say, \u201cdo you mind? I was sort of using both seats.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, this time without the smirk hiding behind his eyes. \u201cSure,\u201d he says getting up. \u201cBut if you want to borrow my MP3 player, you know where it\u2019s at.\u201d</p><p>I smile slimly, relieved more than anything that he\u2019s going to move back to his seat without a fight. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say, appreciative, nonetheless.</p><p>Just before he makes it all the way back, he leans around the outside seat and says, \u201cWhere are you going, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdaho.\u201d</p><p>His bright green eyes seem to light up when he smiles. \u201cWell, I\u2019m heading to Wyoming, so looks like we\u2019ll be sharing a few busses.\u201d And then his smiling face disappears somewhere behind me.</p><p>I won\u2019t deny that he\u2019s attractive. The short, tousled haircut, the toned arms and sculpted cheekbones, the dimples and how that stupid f**king grin of his makes me more willing to look at him even though I don\u2019t want to. But the reality is that it\u2019s not like I\u2019m into him, or anything\u2014he\u2019s a random stranger on a road-to-nowhere bus. No way in hell would I ever entertain something like that. And even if he wasn\u2019t, even if I knew him for six months, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Not ever. Not anymore.</p><p>The endless ride through Kansas seems to take longer than it should. I guess I never thought about how big states really are. You look at a map and it\u2019s just this piece of paper in front of you with oddly-shaped borders and veiny little lines. Even Texas seems pretty small when you\u2019re looking down at it like that, and always traveling everywhere by plane helps feed the delusion that the next state is just an hour away. Another hour and a half and my back and butt feel like stiff, hard pieces of meat. I\u2019m constantly shifting on the seat, hoping to find some way to sit to relieve the tenderness, but I just end up making other parts of my body sore.</p><p>I\u2019m only starting to regret this because the bus ride sucks.</p><p>I hear the bus intercom squeal once and then the driver\u2019s voice:</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be stopping for a break in five minutes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will have fifteen minutes to grab a bite to eat before we get back on the road. Fifteen minutes. I will not wait longer, so if you\u2019re not back in that time the bus will leave without you.\u201d The speaker goes dead.</p><p>The announcement causes everyone to stir in their seats and gather their purses and such\u2014nothing like talk of getting to stretch your legs after hours on a bus to wake everyone up.</p><p>We pull into a spacious lot where several semis are parked, and in-between a convenience store, a car wash and a fast food restaurant. Passengers are standing up in the center of the aisle before the bus even comes to a stop. I\u2019m one of them. My back hurts so bad.</p><p>We file out of the bus one by one, and the second I step off I cherish the feel of concrete underfoot and the mild breeze on my face. I don\u2019t care that this area is hick-in-the-sticks remote, or that the convenience store gas pumps are so outdated that I know the restrooms will probably be scary; I\u2019m just glad to be anywhere but cooped-up inside that bus. I practically glide (like an ungraceful, wounded gazelle) across the blacktop parking lot and toward the restaurant. I take advantage of the restroom first and when I come back out there are several people in line in front of me. I stare up at the menu, trying to decide between a large fry or vanilla shake\u2014never was a big eater of fast food. And finally when I walk out of the restaurant with a vanilla shake, I see the guy from the bus sitting on the grass that separates the parking lots. His knees are bent and he\u2019s eating a burger. I don\u2019t look at him when I start to walk past, but apparently it\u2019s not enough to keep him from bothering me.</p><p>\u201cEight more minutes before you have to crawl back into that tin can,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re really going to spend that precious time in there?\u201d</p><p>I stop next to a little tree still being held up by a stick in the ground and tied with pink fabric.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just eight minutes,\u201d I say. \u201cWon\u2019t make that much of a difference.\u201d</p><p>He takes a huge bite of his burger, chews and swallows it down.</p><p>\u201cImagine if you were buried alive,\u201d he says and takes a drink of soda. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have much time before you suffocated to death. If only they\u2019d gotten to you eight minutes earlier, hell, even one minute, you\u2019d still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I get it,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not contagious,\u201d he says and then takes another bite.</p><p>I guess I have been sort of a bitch. I mean, in a way he kind of deserved it, but he\u2019s really not being obnoxious or anything, so there\u2019s no reason to keep the defenses all the way up. I\u2019d rather not make any enemies on this trip if I can help it.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I say and take a seat on the grass a couple of feet in front of him.</p><p>\u201cSo why Idaho?\u201d he asks, though he looks at his food and all around him more than he looks directly at me.</p><p>\u201cGoing to see my sister,\u201d I lie. \u201cShe just had a baby.\u201d</p><p>He nods and swallows.</p><p>\u201cWhy Wyoming?\u201d I ask, hoping to divert the topic from myself.</p><p>\u201cGoing to visit my dad,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s dying. Inoperable brain tumor.\u201d He takes another bite. It doesn\u2019t seem like what he just told me bothers him too much.</p><p>\u201cOh....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says, looking right at me this time for a brief moment. \u201cWe all gotta go sometime. My old man isn\u2019t worried about it and told us not to be, either.\u201d He smiles and looks at me again. \u201cActually, he told us if we do any of that cryin\u2019 bullshit, that he\u2019d write us out of his will.\u201d</p><p>I suck on my vanilla shake for a moment, only to be doing something to keep my mouth from having to respond to the stuff he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m not sure if I could anyway, really.</p><p>He takes another sip.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asks, setting his drink on the grass.</p><p>I wonder if I should give him my real name. \u201cCam,\u201d I say, settling on the short version.</p><p>\u201cShort for what?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t expect that.</p><p>I hesitate, my eyes trailing. \u201cCamryn,\u201d I admit. I figure with all the lies I\u2019m going to have to keep track of, I might as well be truthful about my first name at least. It\u2019s one less-significant piece of information I don\u2019t have to remember to keep under wraps.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Andrew. Andrew Parrish.\u201d</p><p>I nod and smile slimly, not about to tell him my last name is Bennett. He\u2019ll have to make do with the first-name-basis only.</p><p>As he finishes the last of his burger and scarfs down a few fries, I secretly study him and notice the bottom of a tattoo poking out from underneath both sleeves of his t-shirt. He can\u2019t be older than mid-twenties, if even that.</p><p>\u201cSo, how old are you?\u201d It still felt too personal of a question. I hope he doesn\u2019t read something in it that\u2019s not there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTwenty-five,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me ponderingly, pauses and then subtly purses his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to meet you, twenty-year-old Cam short for Camryn heading to Idaho to see her sister who just had a baby.\u201d</p> <p>My lips smile, but my face doesn\u2019t. It\u2019ll take a while before any of my smiles directed at him can be genuine. Genuine smiles can sometimes give the wrong impression. At least this way, I can be civil and kind, but not the civil kind who after a few big smiles ends up in a trunk with their throat slit.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you from Wyoming?\u201d I ask and take another sip of my shake.</p><p>He nods once. \u201cYeah, was born there, but parents divorced when I was six and we moved to Texas.\u201d</p><p>Texas. How funny. Maybe all of my crap-talk about their cowboy boots and reputation is finally catching up to me. And he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s from Texas, at least, not the stereotypical way that most people assume everyone from Texas looks like.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019ll be headin\u2019 back to after visiting my dad\u2014what about you?\u201d</p> <p>OK, to lie or not to lie? Oh screw it. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a private investigator sent by my dad to get information. As long as I steer clear of #1...my last name, and #2...any addresses or phone numbers that might lead him back to my house in the event that I ever go back home, and then end up in his trunk with my throat slit. I think telling mostly the truth will be a lot easier than trying to conjure up a fitting lie for just about every question that he asks me and then having to remember all of them later. This is going to be a long bus ride, after all, and just like he said, we\u2019ve got several busses to share before we part ways.</p><p>\u201cNorth Carolina,\u201d I say.</p><p>He looks me over. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re from North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>Huh? OK, that was really weird.</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s a girl from North Carolina supposed to look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very literal,\u201d he says, grinning.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sort of confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says with a harmless, humorous snarl, \u201cjust outspoken and sometimes people can\u2019t deal with that kind of shit. It\u2019s like, you ask that guy over there if your ass looks big in those jeans and he\u2019ll tell you, no. You ask me, and I\u2019ll tell you the truth\u2014anything out of people\u2019s usual expectations throws them off track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I\u2019m not any closer to understanding this guy\u2019s personality than I was before I knew his name. I just continue to look at him like he\u2019s sort of nuts and I\u2019m sort of intrigued by it.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he answers matter-of-factly.</p><p>I wait for him to elaborate, but he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou are very strange,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you going to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk what?\u201d</p> <p>He laughs. \u201cIf I think your ass looks big in those jeans.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face crinkle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather not...I uhhh\u2014.\u201d Screw this times two. If he\u2019s going to play games, I\u2019m not going to sit back and let him win all the hands. I smirk at him and say, \u201cI know my ass doesn\u2019t look big in these jeans, so I don\u2019t really need your opinion.\u201d</p><p>A devilishly handsome grin sneaks up at the corners of his mouth. He takes another drink from his soda and goes to his feet, offering his hand. \u201cLooks like our eight minutes are up.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still completely confused by this entire exchange, but I accept his hand and he pulls me to my feet.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he says looking over at me once and letting my hand go, \u201clook how much we learned about each other in just eight minutes, Camryn.\u201d</p><p>I walk beside him, but still keep a little distance. I\u2019m not sure yet if his crafty comebacks and that confident air about him annoys me, or if I\u2019m finding it more refreshing than my brain wants to admit.</p><p>Everyone on the bus gets their usual seats. I had left the magazine I took from the last terminal sitting on mine, hoping no one would come behind me and claim it. Andrew also got his usual pair of seats behind me. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t take my willingness to actually hold a conversation with him as the O.K. to plop himself back on the seat next to me.</p><p>Hours pass and we don\u2019t talk. I think a lot about Natalie and Ian.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Camryn,\u201d I hear Andrew say from his seat behind me. \u201cMaybe tomorrow you\u2019ll tell me who Nat is.\u201d</p><p>I rise up quickly and lean over the top of the seat. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, girl,\u201d he says, lifting his head from his bag he pushed up against the bus to use as a pillow. \u201cYou talk in your sleep.\u201d He laughs quietly. \u201cHeard you bitchin\u2019 at someone named Nat last night\u2014something about Biosilk, or some shit like that.\u201d I notice his shoulders shrug even though he\u2019s lying down with his legs stretched across the empty seat, his arms crossed over his chest.</p><p>Great. I talk in my sleep. Just perfect. I wonder why my mom never told me.</p><p>Briefly, I think about what I could\u2019ve been dreaming about and realize that maybe I have been dreaming after all, and I just don\u2019t remember anymore.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Andrew,\u201d I say and slip back down into my own attempt at a comfortable position. I give a quick moment\u2019s thought to the way I just saw Andrew, who actually looked pretty comfortable and I decide to try laying down the way he is. I thought about trying to sleep like that a few times, but I never wanted to be rude by letting my feet stick out into the aisle. No one\u2019s going to care, I guess, and so I ball my bag packed with clothes up and position it behind my head, laying my body out over both seats just like Andrew. I\u2019m already comfortable. I wish I\u2019d have done this a long time ago.</p><p>The bus driver announcing that we\u2019ll be arriving in Garden City in ten minutes wakes me up the next morning.</p><p>\u201cBe sure to gather all of your belongings,\u201d the driver says through his intercom, \u201cand don\u2019t leave trash on the seats. Thank you for riding through the great state of Kansas and I hope to see you again sometime.\u201d</p><p>It sounded totally scripted and deadpan, but then I guess I probably would sound like that too, having to say the same thing to passengers every single day.</p><p>I lift up the rest of the way, pulling my bag from the seat and unzipping it to fish around for my bus ticket. I find it crumpled between a pair of jeans and my vintage-style Smurfs babydoll tee, unfold it and peer down into my next stop. Looks like Denver is about six and a half hours away, with two rest stops in-between. Damn, why did I choose Idaho? Really. Of all the places on the map, I chose mine based on a baked potato. I\u2019m riding all this way and don\u2019t even have anything to look forward to once I get there. Except more riding. Hell, I may just go ahead and use my credit card and buy a plane ticket home. No, I\u2019m not ready for that yet. I don\u2019t know why, but I know I can\u2019t go back there yet.</p><p>I just can\u2019t.</p><p>Surprised that Andrew has been so quiet, I find myself trying to see if I can glimpse him through the tiny space between my seats, but I can\u2019t see anything at all.</p><p>\u201cAre you up?\u201d I ask, lifting my chin so maybe he\u2019ll hear me back there.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer and I lift up to see. Of course, he\u2019s plugged in at the moment. I\u2019m a little shocked I can\u2019t hear the music funneling from the earbuds this time.</p><p>Andrew notices me and smiles, raising his hand and shaking his index finger as if to say good morning. I motion a finger too, toward the front of the bus to let him know there\u2019s been an announcement. He pulls the buds from his ears and looks up at me, waiting for me to put words to the gesture.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>A few days earlier...</p><p>7</p><p>I GOT A CALL from my brother in Wyoming today. He said our old man wasn\u2019t going to be around much longer. He\u2019d already spent the last six months in and out of the hospital.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re gonna see him,\u201d Aidan said on the other end of the phone, \u201cyou better come now.\u201d</p><p>I do hear Aidan. I do. But all I can really comprehend right about now is that my dad is about to f**king die. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever dare cry for me,\u201d he\u2019d said to my brothers and me last year when they diagnosed him with a rare form of brain cancer. \u201cI\u2019ll cut you right out of my will, boy.\u201d</p><p>I hated him for that, for telling me in so many words that if I cried for him, the one man in my life that I would die for, that I\u2019d be a p**sy for it. I don\u2019t care about the will. Whatever he leaves me I\u2019ll just let it sit. Maybe I\u2019ll give it to Mom.</p><p>Dad was always a hardass growing up. He drilled the shit outta me and my brothers, but I like to think we turned out decent (and that was probably the plan behind the drilling). Aidan, the oldest, owns a successful bar and restaurant in Chicago and is married to a Pediatrician. Asher, the youngest, is in college and has his sights set on a career at Google.</p><p>Me? I\u2019m embarrassed to say that I\u2019ve secretly done a few modeling gigs for several high profile agencies, but I only did it because I fell on hard times last year. Right after I found out about my dad. I couldn\u2019t cry, so I let it all out on my 1969 Chevy Camaro. Destroyed it with a baseball bat. Dad and I rebuilt that car from the ground up together. It was our \u2018father-son\u2019 project that began just before I graduated. I figured if he isn\u2019t going to be around, then neither should the car.</p><p>So yeah, modeling.</p><p>Hell no, I never went looking for a gig. I don\u2019t care about that kind of shit. I just happened to be at Aidan\u2019s bar when a couple of scouts found me getting shitfaced. I guess it didn\u2019t matter that I was...well, shitfaced, because they slipped me their card, offered me a generous sum of money just to show up at their building in New York and after three weeks of staring at that Camaro and regretting what I\u2019d done to it, I decided, why not? That one check just for showing up could cover some of the body work. And I did show up. And despite the money I made from the few ads I shot being enough to fix the car, I turned down the fifty-thousand-dollar contract I\u2019d been offered by LL Elite because, like I said, prancing around in my underwear for a living just isn\u2019t my thing. Hell, I felt dirty for accepting the few gigs I did accept. So, I did what any red meat-eating, beer-drinking guy would do and I tried to make myself look more man and less pansy by getting a few tattoos and a job as a mechanic.</p><p>Not the kind of future my old man wanted for me, but unlike my brothers, I learned a long time ago that it\u2019s my future and my life and I can\u2019t make myself live the way someone else wants me to live. I dropped out of college after I realized that I was studying something I didn\u2019t give a shit about.</p><p>What is it with people and their willingness to follow?</p><p>Not me. I want one thing in life. It\u2019s not money or fame or a Photoshopped dick on a billboard in Times Square or a college education that may or may not benefit me later. I\u2019m not sure what it is that I want, but I feel it deep in the pit of my stomach. It\u2019s there sitting dormant. I\u2019ll know it when I see it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA bus?\u201d Aidan says, unbelieving.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll take a bus there. I need to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew, Dad might not make it,\u201d he says and I can hear the restraint in his voice. \u201cSeriously, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there when I get there.\u201d</p> <p>I run my thumb over the end call button.</p><p>I think a small part of me hopes that he dies before I make it. Because I know I\u2019ll lose my shit if he dies while I\u2019m there. This is my father, the man who raised me and who I look up to. And he tells me not to cry. I\u2019ve always done everything he\u2019s ever told me and like the good son I\u2019ve always tried to be, I know I\u2019ll force back the tears because he told me to. But I also know that by doing it, it\u2019ll create something in me more destructive.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to end up like my car.</p><p>A single duffle bag packed with a clean pair of clothes, toothbrush, cell phone and MP3 player with my favorite classic rock songs\u2014another mark that Dad left on me: \u201cThat new stuff kids listen to these days is shit music, son,\u201d he said at least once a year. \u201cGet the Led out, boy!\u201d I\u2019ll admit I didn\u2019t completely shun newer music just because my dad did. I have my own damn mind, remember? But I did grow up on a healthy dose of the classics and I\u2019m very proud of that.</p><p>\u201cMom, I don\u2019t need those.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s stuffing a Zip-lock bag with about a dozen little packets of hand-sanitizing wipes for me to take. She\u2019s always been a germaphobe.</p><p>I\u2019ve lived back and forth between Texas and Wyoming since I was six-years-old. Ultimately, I realized that I fit better in Texas because I like the Gulf and the heat. I\u2019ve had my own apartment in Galveston for four years now, but last night my mom insisted I stay at her place. She knows how I feel about my dad and she knows that sometimes I can be explosive when I\u2019m hurting, or when I\u2019m pissed off. Spent a night in jail last year for beating the f**k out of Darren Ebbs after he punched his girlfriend in front of me. And when I had to have my best friend, Maximus, put to sleep because of congestive heart failure, I busted my hands up pretty good taking my emotions out on the tree behind my apartment.</p><p>I\u2019m not violent in general, only to douchebags and occasionally, myself.</p><p>\u201cThose busses are nasty,\u201d she says, tucking the baggie down into my bag. \u201cI rode on one back before I met your father and I was sick for a week afterwards.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t argue with her; it would be pointless.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t take a plane. You can get there in a fraction of the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d I say, kissing her cheek, \u201cit\u2019s just something I need to do\u2014like it was meant to be, or something.\u201d I don\u2019t really believe that second part, but I thought I\u2019d humor her with something meaningful, even though she knows I\u2019m full of shit. I walk over and open the kitchen cabinet, taking two brown sugar and cinnamon Pop Tarts from the box and drop them in my bag. \u201cMaybe the plane is supposed to crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Andrew.\u201d She glances over at me sternly.</p><p>I smile and squeeze her. \u201cI\u2019ll be alright, and I\u2019ll make it in time to see Dad before...,\u201d my voice trails.</p><p>Mom hugs me back tighter than I did her.</p><p>By the time I make it to Kansas, I\u2019m starting to wonder if my mom was right. I thought I could use the long ride to think, to clear my head and maybe figure out what I\u2019m doing and what I\u2019m going to do after my dad dies. Because things will be different. Things always change when someone you love dies. You just can\u2019t prepare yourself for those changes no matter what you do in advance.</p><p>The only thing that\u2019s a certainty is always wondering who\u2019s going to be next.</p><p>I know I\u2019ll never be able to look at my mom the same again....</p><p>I think the bus ride has been more of a taunt than a time for meaningful contemplation. I should\u2019ve known that time alone with my thoughts would be unhealthy. Already I\u2019ve decided that my life has been pretty much wasted and I\u2019m going through all the eye-opening emotions: What am I here for? What\u2019s the point in life? What the hell am I doing? I sure as hell haven\u2019t had any epiphanies, or stared out the bus window, lost in some dramatic movie-moment when suddenly life becomes clear to me. The only music playing in the background of this movie is Alice In Chains\u2019 Would?, and that\u2019s not exactly an epiphany-moment kind of song.</p> <p>The driver is just about to close the doors on the bus when I step up and he notices me.</p><p>Thank God, a bus I might actually get to sleep on; plenty of empty seats.</p><p>I head toward the back, my sights set on two empty seats right behind the cute blonde who I\u2019m pretty sure is jailbait. I always have my jailbait radar on, especially after almost hooking up with a girl I met at Dairy Queen. She said she was nineteen, but I found out later she was sixteen and her dad was on his way to the pool where we were to pummel me to death.</p><p>My dad said it right once: \u201cCan\u2019t tell twelve from twenty these days, son. It must be something the government has been puttin\u2019 in the water\u2014be damn careful when you need to knock some boots.\u201d</p><p>As I near the girl on the bus, I notice her move her bag over onto the aisle seat so that I won\u2019t sit there.</p><p>That\u2019s funny. I mean yeah, she\u2019s cute and all but there are about ten or so empty seats on this bus, which means I\u2019m going to get two to myself so I can sprawl my ass out however I want and get some much-needed shuteye.</p><p>Things don\u2019t go as planned and several hours later, just after dark and I\u2019m still wide awake, staring out the tall window beside me with music blasting in my ears. The girl in front of me has been passed out for about an hour and I got tired of hearing her talk in her sleep; though I could hardly make out anything she was saying, I didn\u2019t really want to know. Kind of feels like spying, hearing someone\u2019s thoughts when they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. I\u2019d much rather hear my playlist.</p><p>After I finally fall asleep, my eyes crawl open when I feel something tapping against my leg. Wow, she\u2019s kind of beautiful even with her hair all smashed on one side of her face and the darkness covering the rest of her. Jailbait, Andrew. I don\u2019t have to remind myself that she\u2019s probably jailbait to keep myself from doing anything I know I shouldn\u2019t, no, I remind myself because I don\u2019t want to be disappointed when I find out that I\u2019m right.</p><p>After a quick back-and-forth about the possibility of my music being what woke her up, I turn it down and she slips back down into her little bus-seat-cubicle.</p><p>When I lean up over the top of her seat to look down at her, I\u2019m wondering to myself what possessed me to do it. But I\u2019ve always been one for a challenge and her spunky attitude towards me in a conversation that lasted less than forty-five seconds was enough to shake her hand in this metaphorical bet.</p><p>I\u2019ve always been a sucker for spunky attitudes.</p><p>And I never back down from a challenge.</p><p>The next morning, I offer to let her borrow my MP3 player, but apparently she\u2019s as much of a germaphobe as my mother.</p><p>A man, probably in his early forties, has been sitting on the other side of the bus, three seats up from the girl. I saw the way he was looking at her when I first got on. She had no clue he had been watching her and it\u2019s disturbing to think about how long he\u2019s been watching her since before I got on, or what he\u2019s been doing to himself sitting up there all alone in the dark.</p><p>I\u2019ve been sort keeping my eyes on him ever since. He\u2019s so enamored by her that I doubt he knows I\u2019ve been watching.</p><p>His eyes keep glancing between her and down the center of the aisle towards the matchbox restroom. I can almost hear the gears churning in his head.</p><p>I wonder when he\u2019s going to try to make his move.</p><p>Just then, he gets up.</p><p>I slide out of my seat and into the one beside her. I just play it off like it\u2019s nothing. I can feel her eyes on me, looking at me wondering what the f**k I think I\u2019m doing.</p><p>The man walks past, but I don\u2019t let him see my eyes because then that would give away that I\u2019m onto him. Right now, he probably thinks I\u2019m just playing my own game with the girl; that I\u2019m making my own move and for now, he\u2019ll get over it and probably try again later.</p><p>And later is when I\u2019ll cave his face in with my fist.</p><p>I reach into my bag and fish for the baggie of antibacterial wipes my mom packed. Ripping one from the packet, I wipe the earbuds down and then reach over to her. \u201cLike new,\u201d I say, waiting for her to take them, but I know she won\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cReally, I\u2019m good. But thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably better off anyway,\u201d I say, putting the MP3 player in my bag. \u201cI don\u2019t listen to Justin Bieber or that crazy meat-wearin\u2019 bitch, so I guess you\u2019ll just have to do without.\u201d</p><p>Judging by that irritated look on her face, I pissed her off. I laugh quietly to myself, turning my head at an angle so she doesn\u2019t catch me grinning.</p><p>\u201cFirst off, I don\u2019t listen to Justin Bieber.\u201d</p><p>Thank God.</p><p>\u201cAnd second, Gaga isn\u2019t so bad. Playing the shock-value card a little too long, I admit, but I like some of her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s shit-music and you know it,\u201d I quote my father, shaking my head.</p><p>I put my bag on the floor and lean back on the seat, propping up one foot on the seat in front of me. I wonder why she hasn\u2019t told me to leave yet. And this also worries me. Would she have been \u2018too nice\u2019 to tell that man to leave right away if he had made it here before me? There\u2019s no way someone like her would be in to someone like him, but face it, sometimes girls let that overly sympathetic gene get the best of them. And that few seconds is really all it takes.</p><p>I look over at her again, letting my head fall sideways against the seat. \u201cClassic Rock is where it\u2019s at,\u201d I say. \u201cZeppelin, the Stones, Journey, Foreigner\u2014any of that ringing any bells?\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d she says and a grin lifts one side of my mouth because there\u2019s that spunky attitude again.</p><p>\u201cName one song by Bad Company and I\u2019ll leave you alone about it,\u201d I challenge her.</p><p>I can tell she\u2019s nervous, how she gently bites down on her bottom lip, and like talking in her sleep and being watched by bad men, she probably doesn\u2019t even know it.</p><p>I wait patiently, unable to peel the grin from my face because it\u2019s amusing watching her squirm, trying to sort through all of the times she was in the car with her folks listening to this stuff, searching for some memory that will help her in this critical moment.</p><p>\u201cReady For Love,\u201d she finally answers and I\u2019m impressed.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d I ask and something hits me in this moment. I don\u2019t know what the hell \u2018it\u2019 is, but it\u2019s there, waving at me from behind a wall, like when you know someone\u2019s watching you, yet you don\u2019t see anybody.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she says, as caught off-guard by my question as I was afterwards.</p><p>A smile creeps up on my face. \u201cNothing,\u201d I say, looking away.</p><p>The pervert from the restroom comes quietly back down the dark aisle and goes back to his seat, no doubt pissed off that I\u2019m sitting where he wants to be sitting. I\u2019m just glad she waited for him to pass by before finally asking me to move so she can have both of her seats back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After I crawl back behind her, I lean around the edge of her seat and say, \u201cWhere are you going, anyway?\u201d</p><p>She tells me Idaho, but I think there\u2019s more to her answer than that. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but I get the feeling she\u2019s either lying, which is probably a good thing because I\u2019m a total stranger, or she\u2019s hiding something else.</p><p>I let it go for now and tell her where I\u2019m heading and then duck back in my seat behind her.</p><p>The man three seats up just looked at her again. I\u2019m about ready to bash his f**king brains in right now, just for looking.</p> <p>Hours later, the bus pulls into a rest stop and the driver gives us all fifteen minutes to get out, stretch our legs and get something to eat. I watch the girl head inside toward the restrooms and I\u2019m the first in line to order food. I get my food and head back outside, taking a seat on the grass next to the parking lot. The pervert walks past me, stepping back inside the bus by himself.</p><p>I manage to talk her into sitting with me. She\u2019s hesitant at first, but apparently I\u2019m charming enough. My mom always told me I was her charming middle-child. I guess she was right all along.</p><p>We talk for a minute or two about why I\u2019m going to Wyoming and why she\u2019s going to Idaho. I\u2019m still trying to figure her out, what it is about her that I can\u2019t quite place, but at the same time trying to force myself not to be attracted to her because it\u2019s like I just know she\u2019s jailbait, or she\u2019s going to lie about it.</p><p>But she looks close to my age, younger than me, but we can\u2019t be too far apart.</p><p>Goddammit! Why am I even considering an attraction to her? My dad is dying right now as I sit here on the grass next to her. I shouldn\u2019t be thinking about anything other than my dad and what I\u2019m going to say to him if I do manage to get to Wyoming before he passes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask, setting my drink on the grass and trying to push thoughts of my dad\u2019s death somewhere else in my mind.</p><p>She thinks about it for a minute, probably wondering whether she should tell me the truth, or not. \u201cCam,\u201d she finally answers.</p><p>\u201cShort for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Andrew. Andrew Parrish.\u201d</p><p>She seems a little shy.</p> <p>\u201cSo, how old are you?\u201d she asks and it completely surprises me. Maybe she\u2019s not jailbait, after all, because underage girls, when they want to lie about their age, usually steer clear of this topic at all costs.</p><p>I\u2019m hopeful now that maybe she\u2019s legal. Yeah, I really want her to be....</p><p>\u201cTwenty-five,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d I can\u2019t breathe all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cTwenty,\u201d she says.</p><p>I think about her answer for a moment, pursing my lips. I\u2019m still not sure if she\u2019s lying, but maybe after more time with her on this journey that seems to have brought us together, I will find out the truth eventually.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to meet you, twenty-year-old Cam short for Camryn heading to Idaho to see her sister who just had a baby.\u201d</p><p>I smile. We talk for a few minutes more\u2014eight minutes to be exact\u2014about this and that and I screw with her head some more because that spunky mouth of hers deserves it.</p><p>Actually, I think she likes it, the way I treat her. I can tell there\u2019s an attraction. Though small, I sense it. And it can\u2019t really be because of the way I look\u2014hell, my breath probably smells like ass right now and I haven\u2019t had a shower today\u2014if it was because of looks, unlike most girls who are ever into me, she turned me down already. She didn\u2019t want me sitting next to her on that bus. She wasn\u2019t shy to tell me to turn my music down, with a snippy-ass attitude at that. She got pissed when I accused her of having Bieber Fever (it pisses me off that I even know what the f**k that means\u2014I blame that on society) and I get the feeling that she would have no problem kicking me in the nuts if I touched her in an inappropriate way. Not that I would. Hell no. But it\u2019s good to know that she\u2019s the type.</p> <p>Hell yeah, I like this girl.</p><p>We board the bus and I crawl back in my seat, letting my legs stretch out into the aisle and then I see her white tennis shoes poke out from her aisle seat and I smile at the thought that I\u2019d been interesting enough for her to take ideas from. I check on her about twenty minutes later and just like I thought, she\u2019s passed out cold.</p><p>I turn the music back up and listen to it until I fall asleep, too, and wake up the next morning long before she does.</p><p>She pops her head over the top of her seat and I smile and wave a finger at her.</p><p>She\u2019s even prettier in the daylight.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>8</p><p>\u201cTEN MINUTES,\u201d I SAY, \u201cand we\u2019re off this tin can.\u201d</p><p>Andrew grins and pulls his back away from the seat and goes to put his MP3 player away.</p><p>I\u2019m not exactly sure why I felt the need to tell him.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep better?\u201d he asks, zipping up his bag.</p><p>\u201cYeah, actually I did,\u201d I say, reaching around to feel the back of my neck where I don\u2019t feel any twisted muscles this time. \u201cThanks for the involuntary idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome,\u201d he says with a huge grin.</p><p>\u201cDenver?\u201d he asks, looking up at me.</p><p>I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s asking if that\u2019s my next stop. \u201cYeah, almost seven hours away.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shakes his head, seeming as dissatisfied with that time-frame as I am.</p><p>Ten minutes later and the bus pulls into the Garden City station. There are three times as many people at this station than there were at the last one and this worries me. I make way my through the terminal and to the first empty seat I see because they are filling up quickly. Andrew slips around a corner underneath the vending area sign and comes back with a Mountain Dew and a bag of chips.</p><p>He sits down beside me and cracks the top on the soda can.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks looking over at me.</p><p>I didn\u2019t notice I had been watching him gulp that soda down with a disgusted look on my face.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I say, looking away, \u201cI just think it\u2019s gross.\u201d</p><p>I hear him laugh under his breath beside me and then the chip bag rattles open.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to think a lot of stuff is gross.\u201d</p><p>I look over at him again, positioning my bag on my lap. \u201cWhen was the last time you ate something less....heart-attack inducing?\u201d</p><p>He crunches another chip and swallows. \u201cI eat whatever I want to eat\u2014what are you, one of those uppity vegetarian girls that complain about how fast food is making the country fat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of those,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I think the uppity vegetarian girls might be onto something.\u201d</p><p>He chomps down on a couple more chips and takes a swig of his soda, grinning over at me.</p><p>\u201cFast food doesn\u2019t make people fat,\u201d he says steadily chewing away. \u201cPeople make their own choices. Fast food restaurants are just bankin\u2019 good on the stupidity of Americans who choose to eat their food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you calling yourself a stupid American?\u201d I grin right back at him.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI guess I am when my options are limited to vending machines and burger joints.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cOh, like you\u2019d actually choose to eat something better if you had the choice to make. I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d</p><p>I think I\u2019m getting better at these comebacks.</p><p>He laughs out loud. \u201cHell yeah I\u2019d choose something better. I\u2019ll take a fifty-dollar steak over a day-old burger any day, or a beer over a Mountain Dew.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, but can\u2019t wipe the faint grin off my face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you normally eat, anyway?\u201d he asks. \u201cSalads and tofu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleh,\u201d I say with a wrinkled face. \u201cNo way in hell would I ever eat tofu and salads are just weight-loss fads.\u201d I pause and grin over at him. \u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah\u2014spit it out,\u201d he says.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me as though I\u2019m something funny and cute that needs to be studied.</p><p>\u201cI like SpaghettiO\u2019s with meatballs and sushi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like all mixed together?\u201d Now he looks quietly disgusted.</p><p>It takes me a few seconds to catch on.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I say, shaking my head back and forth, \u201cthat would be gross, too, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, looking relieved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not big on steak,\u201d I go on, \u201cbut I\u2019d eat one if offered to me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re asking me to ask you on a date?\u201d His grin just got wider.</p><p>My eyes bulge and my mouth falls open. \u201cNo!\u201d I say, practically blushing. \u201cI was just saying that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and takes another swig.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he says, \u201cdon\u2019t worry. I\u2019d never consider asking you on a date.\u201d</p><p>My eyes and mouth get even bigger and my face flushes hot.</p><p>He laughs even louder.</p><p>\u201cDamn, girl,\u201d he says, still with laughter in his voice, \u201cyou don\u2019t catch on too quick, do you?\u201d</p><p>I frown.</p><p>He frowns, too, but he\u2019s still sort of smiling at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d he says, looking a bit more serious, \u201cif we happen to get lucky enough to find a steakhouse at one of our rest stops that can cook a steak in the fifteen minutes we have before the bus leaves us behind, then I\u2019ll buy you one and let you decide if while we eat our steaks together on the bus it\u2019s a date, or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can tell you now that it won\u2019t be a date.\u201d</p><p>He smiles crookedly.</p><p>\u201cThen it won\u2019t be,\u201d he says. \u201cI can live with that.\u201d</p><p>I think he\u2019s done with the topic, but then suddenly he adds, \u201cBut then what would it be, if not a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say. \u201cIt would be a friendship thing, I guess. Y\u2019know, two people who happen to be sharing a meal together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says with a sparkle in his eyes, \u201cso now we\u2019re friends?\u201d</p><p>That catches me off-guard. He\u2019s good. I give it a moment\u2019s thought, pursing my lips in contemplation.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cI guess we are sort of friends at least until Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>He reaches over and offers his hand to me. Reluctantly, I shake it. His grip is gentle, but firm and his smile is genuine and kind.</p><p>\u201cFriends until Wyoming it is then,\u201d he says, shaking my hand once and letting go.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what just happened, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve done anything I\u2019m going to regret later. I guess there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a traveling \u2018friend\u2019. I can think of a hundred other kinds of people who Andrew could be and it could be worse. But he seems harmless and I admit he\u2019s interesting to talk to. He\u2019s not an old lady looking to tell me stories of when she was my age, or an older delusional man who still thinks he\u2019s as hot as he was when he was seventeen and that somehow he thinks I might be able to see him for what he used to look like. No, Andrew is right there in the goldilocks zone. Sure, it\u2019d be better for many different reasons if he was a girl, but at least he\u2019s close to my age and he\u2019s not at all ugly. No, Andrew Parrish is far from being anywhere near the Ugly Tree. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Truthfully, he lives right next door to the Sexy Tree and I think that\u2019s the only thing that bothers me about this whole situation.</p><p>You know damn well that it doesn\u2019t really matter what\u2019s going on in your life, who you just lost, how much you hate the world, or how inappropriate it is to have an attraction to someone before that mending phase has reached the acceptable zone. You\u2019re still human and the moment you see someone attractive, you can\u2019t help but make note of it. It\u2019s human nature.</p><p>Acting on it is a whole other story and that\u2019s where I draw the line.</p><p>That\u2019s not gonna happen, no matter what.</p> <p>But yeah, the fact that he\u2019s hot bothers me because it only means that I will have to try that much harder to make sure that nothing I say or do will give him the wrong impression. Hot guys know they\u2019re hot. They just do, even the ones who don\u2019t go around flaunting it. And it\u2019s also human nature for hot guys to automatically assume that an innocent smile, or a conversation that goes on for three minutes without awkward silence, are signs of an attraction.</p><p>So, this \u2018friendship\u2019 is going to take a lot of work on my part. I want to be nice, but not too nice. I want to smile when necessary, but I have to be careful and measure the level of the smile. I want to laugh if something he says is funny, but I don\u2019t want him to think it\u2019s an I\u2019m-so-f**king-into-you kind of laugh.</p><p>Yeah, this is definitely going to take work. Maybe an old lady would\u2019ve been better, after all....</p><p>Andrew and I wait in the terminal for nearly an hour before the next bus pulls into the station. And as expected, it doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019re going to have two seats to ourselves this time. The line waiting to board already looks like there might not be enough seats to hold everyone. Dilemma. Crap. Andrew and I are suddenly temporary friends, but I can\u2019t bring myself to ask him to sit with me. That might count as one of those things that gives the wrong impression. So, as the line inches forward and he follows close behind, I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll take it upon himself to sit next to me. I\u2019d rather it be him than someone else who I haven\u2019t even spoken to.</p><p>I make my way toward the center of the bus and into two empty seats, passing up the one on the outside and taking the one by the window.</p> <p>He sits next to me and I\u2019m secretly relieved.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re a girl,\u201d he says, putting his bag on the floor between his feet, \u201cI\u2019ll let you keep the window seat.\u201d</p><p>He smiles.</p><p>After the bus is full and I can already feel the extra body heat rising up all around us from so many people crammed inside the space, I hear the door squeal shut and the bus lurches in motion.</p><p>The drive doesn\u2019t seem so long and torturous anymore now that I have someone to talk to. It only takes about an hour of constant conversation about everything from what all of his favorite classic rock bands are, to why I like Pink and how much better her stuff is than Boston and Foreigner who sound the same to me. We argued about this for twenty minutes out of that hour\u2014he\u2019s really stubborn, but then he said the same about me, so maybe we\u2019re both guilty. And I let him in on who \u2018Nat\u2019 is, though I don\u2019t go into the gruesome details of mine and Natalie\u2019s relationship.</p><p>By the time the night falls, I realize there hasn\u2019t been a single awkward moment of silence between us since we boarded the bus and he decided to sit next to me.</p> <p>\u201cHow long are you staying in Idaho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019re riding back on a bus?\u201d Strangely, Andrew\u2019s face has lost all of its humor.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, not wanting to go too deeply into this topic because I don\u2019t already know my answers in advance.</p><p>I hear him sigh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of my business,\u201d he says looking over at me and I feel the space between us closing in since he\u2019s sitting so close, \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t be traveling around by yourself like this.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t look at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I kind of have to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to hit on you or anything, but a young, devilishly gorgeous girl like you traveling by herself in the slums of the bus stations of America is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face break into a smile, but I try futilely to hide it.</p><p>I look over at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to hit on me,\u201d I say, \u201cyet you call me \u2018devilishly gorgeous\u2019 and practically use that what\u2019s-a-girl-like-you-doing-in-a-place-like-this line all in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>He seems gently offended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Camryn,\u201d he says and the playful smile on my face dissolves. \u201cYou could really get hurt.\u201d</p><p>In an attempt to shift the awkward moment, I grin and say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m confident in my ability to scream really loud if I get attacked.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and takes a deep breath, slowly giving in to my attempts to lighten things up.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your dad,\u201d I say.</p><p>The almost-smile flees from his face and he looks away from me. It wasn\u2019t an accident, bringing it up like I did. I don\u2019t know, I just get this strange feeling that he\u2019s hiding something. When he briefly mentioned back in Kansas about his dad dying, on the outside it didn\u2019t seem to faze him. But he\u2019s going all this way, by bus at that, to see his dad before he dies, so he must love him. I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re never unfazed when someone you love is dead, or dying.</p><p>Sounds strange coming from me, who can\u2019t cry anymore.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Andrew says, still looking in front of him. I get the feeling he\u2019s picturing his dad right now, that he doesn\u2019t actually see anything in front of him except for his memories.</p><p>He looks over at me and is smiling now, but it\u2019s not a smile trying to cover up any pain, more-so one washed with a good memory.</p><p>\u201cInstead of taking me to a baseball game, my dad took me to a boxing match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I feel my smile light up. \u201cDo tell?\u201d</p><p>He looks back out ahead, but the warmth in his face never leaves him in this moment. \u201cDad wanted us to be fighters\u2014.\u201d He glances over. \u201cNot boxers or actual fighters, though he probably wouldn\u2019t have minded that so much, either. But I mean fighters in general, you know, in life. Metaphorically.\u201d</p><p>I nod to let him know that I understand.</p><p>\u201cI sat ringside, eight-years-old, mesmerized by these two men beating each other and the whole time I could hear my dad talking over the crowd next to me: \u2018They fear nothing, son,\u2019 he said. \u2018And all of their moves are calculated. They move one way and it either works, or it doesn\u2019t, but they learn something from every move, every decision.\u2019</p><p>Andrew catches my eye briefly and his smile dissolves, leaving his expression standard. \u201cHe told me that a real fighter never cries, never lets the weight of any blow bring him down. Except that final blow, the inevitable one, but even then they always go out like men.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m no longer smiling, either. I can\u2019t tell exactly what\u2019s going on in Andrew\u2019s head right now, but we share the same sober mood. I want to ask him if he\u2019s OK, because it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s not, but the timing doesn\u2019t feel right. It feels weird because I don\u2019t know him well enough to be digging around inside of his emotions.</p><p>I say nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou must think I\u2019m a dick,\u201d he says.</p><p>I blink, surprised. \u201cNo,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>He backs off immediately and downplays the seriousness of his own question, letting that devastating smile slip back to the surface again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see him before he kicks the bucket,\u201d he says, and his choice of words shocks me a little, \u201cbecause that\u2019s what we do, right? It\u2019s a customary thing, kind of like saying \u2018bless you\u2019 when someone sneezes, or asking someone how their weekend was when really you don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d</p><p>Damn, where is all of this coming from?</p><p>\u201cYou have to live in the now,\u201d he says and I\u2019m quietly stunned. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d His head falls to the side and he\u2019s looking at me again.</p><p>It takes me a moment to get my head together, but even then I\u2019m not sure about what to say.</p><p>\u201cLiving in the now,\u201d I say, quoting him, yet at the same time thinking of my own belief of loving in the now. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d But I still wonder exactly what his take on the belief is.</p><p>I straighten my back against the seat and raise my head a little to look over at him more closely. It\u2019s like suddenly I have this great desire to know all about his belief. To know everything about him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is living in the now to you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I notice one of his eyebrows twitch for a second and his expression shifts, surprised at the seriousness of my question, or the level of my interest. Maybe both.</p><p>He straightens his back and raises his head, too.</p><p>\u201cJust that dwelling and planning is bullshit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou dwell on the past, you can\u2019t move forward. Spend too much time planning for the future and you just push yourself backwards, or you stay stagnant in the same place all your life.\u201d His eyes lock on mine. \u201cLive in the moment,\u201d he says as if making a serious point, \u201cwhere everything is just right, take your time and limit your bad memories and you\u2019ll get wherever it is you\u2019re going a lot faster and with less bumps in the road along the way.\u201d</p><p>The silence between us is just two minds thinking about what he just said. I wonder if his thoughts are the same as mine. I also wonder, more than I want to admit, why so many of his thoughts already make me feel like I\u2019m staring into a mirror when I look at him.</p><p>The bus glides heavily over the freeway, always loud and rarely soft. But after so long, it\u2019s easy to forget how unpleasant a bus ride is compared to the luxury of a car. And when you\u2019re thinking more about the positive aspects of a bus ride, instead of the negative, it\u2019s easy to forget that there\u2019s anything negative about it at all. There is a guy sitting next to me with beautiful green eyes and a beautiful sculpted face and a beautiful way of thinking. There\u2019s no such thing as a bad bus ride when you\u2019re in the company of something beautiful.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t be here....</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>9</p><p>I CAN\u2019T BELIEVE SHE brought up my dad. Not that I\u2019m pissed about it, but I\u2019m surprised that she seemed to really want to know. That she even remembered. She didn\u2019t dive into questions about what I do for a living to calculate how much money I might make, or giggle and blush and look all stupid while reaching out to touch my tattoos, using them as an excuse to touch me. Huge f**king turn-off. I mean yeah, it\u2019s a turn-on when you\u2019re just looking to get laid\u2014makes it easier\u2014but for some reason, I couldn\u2019t be happier that Camryn didn\u2019t do it.</p><p>Who the hell is this girl?</p><p>And why am I even thinking about this stuff?</p><p>She falls asleep before me with her head propped against the bus window. I resist the urge to watch her, noticing how soft and innocent she looks, which makes me that much more primal, more protective. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The pervert seems to have stopped watching her when he saw us sitting together inside the last terminal. In the eyes of men, he probably sees her as my \u2018territory\u2019 now, my property. And that\u2019s good thing because it means he\u2019ll leave her alone as long as I\u2019m around. The truth is though, we\u2019ll only be together until Wyoming and this worries the f**k out of me. I hope the man changes busses before Camryn and I have to depart ways. Two more rest stops between here and Denver\u2014I hope like hell Denver is his last stop and if not, I\u2019ll be watching him the rest of the way to Wyoming.</p><p>He\u2019s not going to Idaho. I\u2019ll kill the son of a bitch first.</p><p>I gaze through the dark and stillness of the bus. The man is asleep, his head pressed back against the aisle seat. A woman sits beside him next to the window, but she\u2019s way too old to catch this guy\u2019s eye. He likes them young, probably really young. It makes me f**king sick to think of what he may have already done to some other young girl.</p><p>Despite the bus generally being loud, the whistling of the wind pushing against the metal, the fast crushing sound of rubber moving swiftly over the road, the large engine progressively humming as it compels the heap of metal across the freeway, it\u2019s still quiet. It\u2019s almost peaceful. As peaceful as a bus ride can be.</p> <p>I finger my earbuds in and turn on the power on my MP3 player, setting it to shuffle. What will it be? What will it be? I always let the first song set the mood. I have over three hundred songs on this thing. Three hundred different mood-setters. I think my MP3 player is biased though because the first song is almost always between Kansas\u2019 Dust in the Wind, Zeppelin\u2019s Going to California or something by The Eagles.</p><p>I wait for it, not looking down at the information on the playlist as if it\u2019s some kind of guessing game and I don\u2019t want to cheat. Ah, good choice. Aerosmith\u2019s Dream On. I lean my head back against the seat and shut my eyes, not realizing until after I\u2019m in the middle of doing it that my finger is gently pressing the volume down. Because I don\u2019t want to wake Camryn up.</p><p>I open my eyes and look over at her, how she clutches that bag of hers so tightly that she must still be completely conscious of it even in a deep sleep. I wonder about what might be inside, if there\u2019s anything in it that could tell me more about her. If there\u2019s anything in it that can tell me the truth about her.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t matter. I won\u2019t know her after Wyoming and she\u2019ll probably never even remember my name. But I know it\u2019s better that way. I have too much baggage and even as a friend, she doesn\u2019t need any of it in her lap. I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.</p><p>The low, melodious droning of Steven Tyler\u2019s voice lulls me to partial-sleep. Except when he\u2019s screaming that high-pitched scream, where I wait for him to let it all out and then I drift off the rest of the way.</p> <p>\u201cDude, seriously,\u201d I hear a voice say.</p><p>Something is pressing against my shoulder. I wake up to find Camryn pushing me off of her with her little arms. It\u2019s actually kind of funny, that awry look on her morning face and how no matter how hard she pushes, the weight of my body is too heavy to move me completely.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, still trying to wake up. I lift up disoriented and feel the back of my neck as stiff as wood. I really didn\u2019t mean to end up with my head pressed against her arm, but I\u2019m not as mortified about it as she\u2019s pretending to be. At least I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s pretending. She\u2019s trying really hard not to break a smile.</p><p>Let me help her a little with that.</p><p>I grin over at her.</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s funny?\u201d she says, her mouth partly hanging open and her eyebrows rumpled in her cute little forehead.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, actually I do think it\u2019s funny.\u201d My grin gets bigger and finally that smile of hers breaks softly in her face. \u201cBut I am sorry. Really.\u201d And I mean it.</p><p>She narrows one eye and looks at me sideways, scrutinizing my sincerity, which is also kind of cute.</p><p>I look away and reach my arms above my head to stretch and that makes me need to yawn.</p><p>\u201cGross!\u201d she says and that word doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. \u201cYour breath smells like ass.\u201d</p><p>A single voluble laugh comes out through my words: \u201cDamn, girl, how would you know what ass smells like anyway?\u201d</p><p>That shuts her up. I laugh again and rummage through my bag after dropping my MP3 player inside of it. I pop the cap on my toothpaste and squirt a dab on the end of my tongue, move it around inside my mouth real good and then swallow. Of course, Camryn\u2019s watching me do all of this with a look of revolt, but that\u2019s what I was shooting for.</p><p>The rest of the bus seems to have woken up before me. I\u2019m surprised I slept this long and without waking up at least three times to find another comfortable position, which always manages to elude me.</p><p>My watch says that it\u2019s 9:02 a.m.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we anyway?\u201d I ask, gazing out the large window next to Camryn, searching for any freeway signs.</p><p>\u201cAbout four hours away from Denver,\u201d she answers. \u201cDriver just announced another rest stop in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, stretching one leg out into the aisle, \u201cI need to walk around. I\u2019m stiff as hell.\u201d</p><p>I catch her grinning, but she turns to face the window. Stiff as hell. OK, so she also has a dirty mind. I just laugh thinking about it.</p><p>The next rest stop isn\u2019t too much different from the last several, with a series of gas stations on either side of the freeway and two fast food restaurants. I can\u2019t believe this girl has me actually debating whether or not to head inside one like I normally would without a thought otherwise. I just can\u2019t really tell if it\u2019s because I want to prove to her that I can choose to eat better stuff if given the choice, or because I know she\u2019s going to yell at me.</p><p>Wait a damn second. Who\u2019s the one in control of the situation here?</p><p>Clearly she is. Goddammit.</p><p>We file out of the bus, Camryn in front of me, and after walking around the front of the bus she stops and turns at the waist, crossing her arms and looking up at me, pursing her lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re so smart,\u201d I say, sounding sort of third grade and I admit it, \u201cthen see if you can find something healthy to eat\u2014that doesn\u2019t taste like rubber dipped in shit\u2014in one of these places.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugs one corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on,\u201d she accepts the challenge.</p><p>I follow her into the gigantic convenience store and she makes her way first to the drink coolers. Like that blonde chick on that game show (I don\u2019t know which because I don\u2019t watch game shows, but everybody knows about that blonde chick) Camryn waves her hands in front of the cooler doors, as if revealing the world of fruit juices and bottled water to me for the first time.</p><p>\u201cWe start off with a variety of juice, as you can see,\u201d she says in her proper showcase voice. \u201cAny of this is better than soda. Take your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a baby. There\u2019s plenty to choose from. I\u2019m sure you can find something you can stomach.\u201d</p><p>She moves back two steps to let me see the dozens of flavored bottled waters on display behind the next door.</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s water,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I just don\u2019t see someone like you sipping on a fancy bottle of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s too douchy.\u201d Really, I have no issue with drinking bottled water, but I like this game we\u2019re playing.</p><p>She smiles, but tries to keep a straight face.</p><p>I wrinkle my nose at her, purse my lips and look back and forth between her and the juice cooler.</p><p>I sigh heavily and step up closer, scanning over the different brands and flavors and mixed flavors and I wonder why there\u2019s so much with strawberry or kiwi, or strawberry and kiwi in it. I hate both.</p><p>Finally, I open one glass door and settle on plain OJ.</p><p>She sort of winces.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask, still holding the door open.</p><p>\u201cOrange juice isn\u2019t so good to wash stuff down with.\u201d</p><p>I let out a spat of air and just look at her, unblinking.</p><p>\u201cI pick something out and you tell me it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d I want to laugh, but I\u2019m trying to lay a guilt trip on her here.</p><p>And I think it\u2019s working.</p><p>She frowns. \u201cWell, it\u2019s just...well that\u2019s more of grab-n-go vitamin C boost, really. It just makes you thirstier.\u201d</p><p>She actually looks as though she\u2019s worried that she offended me and this strikes me in the strangest way. I let myself smile just to see her smile again.</p><p>She grins at me like the Devil.</p><p>Oh, she\u2019s good....</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>10</p><p>DENVER FINALLY FLIES BY and we\u2019re drawing closer to Andrew\u2019s final stop in Wyoming. I can\u2019t lie and say it doesn\u2019t bother me. Andrew was right in saying that it\u2019s dangerous for me to be traveling alone. I\u2019m just trying to understand why that fact didn\u2019t faze me much before I met him. Maybe I just feel safer with him as my company because he does look like he can bust a few jaws without breaking a sweat. Damn, maybe I shouldn\u2019t have ever talked to him in the first place; definitely shouldn\u2019t have let him sit next to me because now I\u2019m sort of used to him. Once we\u2019re in Wyoming and we go our separate ways, I\u2019ll be back to staring out the window watching the world fly by and not knowing where in it I\u2019m going next.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have a girlfriend?\u201d I ask just to spark up conversation so I won\u2019t think about being alone again in a few hours.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s dimples appear. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself; just a question. If you don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answers, \u201cI\u2019m happily single.\u201d</p><p>He just looks at me, smiling, waiting, and it takes me a second to understand what he\u2019s waiting for.</p><p>I point at myself nervously, wishing I had come up with a less personal topic. \u201cMe? No, not anymore.\u201d Feeling more confident now, I add, \u201cI\u2019m happily single as well and want to stay that way. For about...forever.\u201d I should\u2019ve just left it at \u2018happily single\u2019 instead of rambling my way right out of the confident zone and making myself look obvious.</p><p>Of course, Andrew notices right away. I get the feeling he\u2019s the type that never misses someone else\u2019s foot-in-your-mouth moment. He thrives on them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d he says, grinning.</p><p>Thankfully he doesn\u2019t probe.</p><p>He rests his head back against the seat and absently taps his thumbs and pinky fingers against his jeans for a moment. Secretly, I glimpse his muscular, tanned arms and try to see once and for all what the tattoos are of on his arms, but as usual they\u2019re mostly hidden by the sleeves of his t-shirt. The one on the right side I saw a little more of earlier when he stretched down to tie his boot. I think it\u2019s a tree of some sort. The arm facing me now, I can\u2019t really tell but whatever it is, it has feathers. All of the tattoos I\u2019ve seen so far are colorless.</p><p>\u201cCurious?\u201d he says and I flinch. I didn\u2019t think he saw me checking them out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Yes, I\u2019m very curious, actually.</p><p>Andrew lifts away from the seat and pulls the sleeve of his left arm over the tattoo, revealing a phoenix with a long, flowing beautiful feathered tail that ends a couple of inches past where his sleeve ends. But the rest of its feathered body is skeletal, giving it a more \u2018manly\u2019 appearance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty awesome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ve had this one about a year,\u201d he says, pulling the sleeve back down. \u201cAnd this one,\u201d he says, turning at the waist and pulling up the other sleeve (first, I notice the obvious outline of his abs underneath his shirt), \u201cis my gnarly, Sleepy-Hollow-lookin\u2019 tree\u2014I have a thing for wicked trees\u2014and if you\u2019ll look real close...,\u201d I peer closer where his finger points within the tree trunk, \u201cis my 1969 Chevy Camaro. My dad\u2019s car, really, but since he\u2019s dying I guess I have to keep it.\u201d He looks out in front of him.</p><p>There it is, that tiny glimmer of pain that he kept hidden before when talking about his father. He\u2019s hurting a lot more than he\u2019s letting on and it sort of breaks my heart. I can\u2019t imagine my mom or dad being on their deathbed and I\u2019m sitting on Greyhound bus on my way to see them for the last time. My eyes scan his face from the side and I really want to say something to comfort him, but I don\u2019t think I can. I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my place for some reason; at least not to bring it up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a couple of others,\u201d he goes on, looking back over at me with the back of his head lying against the seat again. \u201cA small one here,\u201d he turns over his right wrist to show me a simple black star in the center right below the base of his hand; I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t notice that one sooner. \u201cAnd a larger one down the left side of my ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, the one on your side? How big is it?\u201d</p><p>His bright green eyes sparkle as he smiles warmly, tilting his head over to see me. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty damn big,\u201d I see his hands move as if he\u2019s going to lift his shirt to show me, but he decides against it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a woman. Nothing worth getting nak*d on a bus for.\u201d</p> <p>Now I want to see what it looks like more than ever, just because he doesn\u2019t want me to see it.</p><p>\u201cA woman you know?\u201d I ask. I keep looking to and from his side, thinking maybe he\u2019ll change his mind and lift his shirt, but he never does.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cNah, it\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s of Eurydice.\u201d He waves his hand out in front of him as if to dismiss any further explanation.</p><p>The name sounds like something ancient, maybe Greek, and it\u2019s vaguely familiar, but I can\u2019t place it.</p><p>I nod. \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>He smiles.</p> <p>\u201cA little. Well actually it hurts the most on the ribs, so yeah it hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you cry?\u201d I grin.</p><p>He laughs lightly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t cry, but hell, I might\u2019ve if I decided to get it even a fraction bigger than it is. In total, it took about sixteen hours.\u201d</p><p>I blink back, stunned. \u201cWow, you sat there for sixteen hours?\u201d</p><p>For such a detailed conversation about this tat, it makes me wonder why he won\u2019t actually show it. Maybe it doesn\u2019t look all that great and the tattoo artist screwed it up, or something.</p><p>\u201cNot all at once,\u201d he says, \u201cwe did it over a few days\u2019 time\u2014I\u2019d ask if you have any tattoos, but something tells me that you don\u2019t.\u201d He smiles, knowingly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d be right,\u201d I say, blushing a little. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve never thought about getting one.\u201d I hold up my wrist and wrap my thumb and middle finger around it. \u201cThought about getting something here, like script that says \u2018freedom\u2019 or something in Latin\u2014obviously, I didn\u2019t think about it much.\u201d Smiling, I breathe out a little embarrassed spat of air. Me talking about tattoos with a guy who obviously knows more about them than I ever could is a bit intimidating.</p> <p>When I go to set my wrist back down on the armrest, Andrew\u2019s fingers curl around it. It stuns me for a brief second, even sends a strange chill through my body, but it quickly fades when he starts talking so casually.</p><p>\u201cA tattoo on the wrist for a girl can be very graceful and feminine.\u201d He traces the tip of his finger around the inside of my wrist to indicate where it should go. I shiver a tiny bit. \u201cSomething in Latin, very subtle, just about here would look nice.\u201d Then he lets go gently and I let my arm rest back on the armrest.</p><p>\u201cI expected you to say \u2018no way\u2019 about ever getting one yourself,\u201d he laughs and brings up his leg, resting it at the ankle on his knee. He interlaces his fingers and slides back further against the seat to get more comfortable.</p><p>It\u2019s getting dark fast; the sun is barely peeking over the landscape now, leaving everything bathed in fading orange and pink and purple.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m not a predictable person.\u201d I smile over at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess you\u2019re not,\u201d he says smiling back and then looking thoughtfully in front of him.</p><p>Andrew wakes me up the next day sometime after 2:00p.m. at the bus station in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I feel his fingers poking me in the ribs. \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he says and finally I open my eyes and lift my head from the window.</p><p>My breath I know smells God awful because it tastes dry and funky so I look away from him when I yawn.</p><p>The bus\u2019 brakes squeal to a stop at the terminal and like always, the passengers stir themselves out of their seats and start grabbing their carry-on bags from the overhead compartment. I just sit here, feeling a little panicked and I glance carefully over at Andrew. I literally feel like I\u2019m going to have a mini-anxiety attack. I mean, I knew this time would come, that Andrew would leave and I would be alone again, but I didn\u2019t expect to feel like a scared little girl sent out in the world to fend for herself with no one to look after her.</p><p>Shit! Shit! Shit!</p><p>I can\u2019t even believe I let myself get comfortable with him and as a result I\u2019m no longer able to make fear my bitch.</p><p>I fear being alone.</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019?\u201d he asks looking down at me from the center aisle and holding out his hand. He smiles at me gently, setting aside any smartass remarks or making jokes at my expense because, after all, it is the last time we will ever see each other. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in love or something crazy like that, but something weird happens when you spend several days with a stranger on a bus, getting to know them and enjoying their company. And when they\u2019re not so different from you and you share that bond without actually telling one another why you\u2019re hurting, that just makes the inevitable departure more difficult.</p><p>But I can\u2019t let him know this. It\u2019s stupid. I put myself in this situation and I intend to go through with it. No matter where in the world it eventually leads me.</p><p>I smile back up at him and place my hand into his. And all the way down the aisle as he walks in front of me, he keeps my fingers clasped carefully within his hand from behind. And I find a sense of warmth in his touch, clinging onto it mentally for as long as I can so that maybe I can be more confident when I\u2019m alone again.</p><p>\u201cWell, Camryn...\u201d he looks at me as if fishing for my last name.</p><p>\u201cBennett.\u201d I smile and cave to my own rule.</p><p>\u201cWell, Camryn Bennett, it was a pleasure to meet you on the road to nowhere.\u201d He adjusts his bag strap on his shoulder and then slides his hands down inside the pockets of his jeans. The muscles in his arms harden. \u201cI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>I try to smile and I do, but I know it looks like something in-between a smile and a frown.</p><p>I adjust the strap from my purse on one shoulder and my sling bag on the other and then just let my arms hang limply at my sides.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice meeting you, too, Andrew Parrish,\u201d I say, though I don\u2019t want to say it. I want him to ride with me just a little farther. \u201cDo me a favor if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve piqued his curiosity and he cocks his chin a little to one side. \u201cAlright. What kind of favor? Is it sexual?\u201d His dimples deepen as his devilishly handsome lips start to curve.</p><p>I laugh a little and look down with a blush hot on my face, but then I let the moment fade because this really isn\u2019t a lighthearted kind of request. Instead, I soften my expression and look upon him with true sympathy.</p><p>\u201cIf your dad doesn\u2019t make it,\u201d I begin and his expression falls, \u201clet yourself cry, OK? One of the worst feelings in the world is being unable to cry and eventually it...starts to make things darker.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a long, silent moment and then he nods, allowing a tiny thankful smile to appear only in the depths of his eyes. I reach out my hand to shake his goodbye and he does the same, but he holds it there for a second longer than normal and then pulls me into a hug. I hug him back tight, wishing I could just blurt out to him that I\u2019m scared of him leaving me alone, but I know I can\u2019t.</p><p>Suck it up, Camryn!</p><p>He pulls away, nods at me one last time with that smile I grew so quickly to like and then he walks away and out of the terminal. I stand here for what feels like forever, unable to move my legs. I watch him get into a cab and I keep watching until the cab drives away and out of sight.</p><p>I\u2019m alone again. Over a thousand miles away from home. No direction, no purpose, no goals other than to find myself on this journey I never imagined I could bring myself to begin. And I\u2019m scared. But I have to do this. I have to because I need this time alone, away from everything back home which brought me here in the first place.</p><p>Finally, I take control again and walk away from the tall glass windows to find a seat. There\u2019s a four hour layover before I get on the next bus into Idaho, so I need to find something to make use of my time.</p><p>I hit the vending machines first.</p><p>Sliding my change into the slot I start to hit E4 to get the fiber bar\u2014the closest thing to healthy in the whole machine\u2014but then my finger makes a sharp U-turn to hit D4 instead and a fattening, disgusting, sugary chocolate candy bar falls from the spiral and into the bottom. Happily taking out my junk food, I move over to the soda machine, passing up the one before it which has bottles of water and juice, and I get a teeth-decaying, stomach bubbling, carbonated drink instead.</p><p>Andrew would be so proud.</p><p>Dammit! Stop thinking about Andrew!</p><p>I take my junk food and find an empty seat and wait out the day.</p><p>A four hour delay turns into a six hour delay. They announced it over the intercom, something about my particular bus being late due to mechanical failure. A chorus of disappointed moans rises throughout the terminal.</p><p>Great. Just great. I\u2019m stuck in a bus station in the middle of nowhere and I could very well end up here all night, trying to sleep curled up in the fetal position on this hard plastic chair that\u2019s not even comfortable for sitting.</p><p>Or, I could just go ahead and buy another bus ticket somewhere else.</p><p>That\u2019s it! Problem solved!</p><p>I just wish I would\u2019ve thought of this sooner and spared myself the six hours I\u2019ve already wasted here. It\u2019s like I tricked my brain somehow into thinking I actually had to drive all the way to frickin\u2019 Idaho just because I already paid for the ticket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I grab my bag and purse from the seat next to me and shoulder them as I march my way across the terminal, past a boatload of disgruntled passengers who clearly don\u2019t have the option that I do, and make my way to the ticket counter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re closing the counter down ma\u2019am,\u201d the employee says on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWait, please,\u201d I say, throwing my arms across the counter exasperatedly, \u201cI just need to get another ticket somewhere else. Please, you\u2019ll be doing me a huge favor!\u201d</p><p>The wiry-haired old woman wrinkles her nose at me and appears to chew on the inside of her cheek. She sighs and then taps a few keys on her computer keyboard.</p> <p>\u201cOh thank you!\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome! Thank you!\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes.</p><p>I swing my purse around and toss it on the counter and search quickly through it to find my little zipper wallet.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you traveling?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Oh great, there\u2019s that million dollar question again. I look around the counter for any other \u2018signs\u2019 like that baked potato back at the North Carolina terminal, but I don\u2019t see anything obvious. The old lady is starting to get even more agitated with me and it makes me more anxious to hurry and figure this out.</p> <p>\u201cMiss?\u201d she says with a heavy sigh. She glances at the clock on the wall. \u201cI clocked out fifteen minutes ago. I\u2019d really like to get home to my dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I fumble my credit card out of my wallet and hand it to her. \u201cTexas,\u201d I say first as a test, but then afterwards I realize it felt right on my tongue. \u201cYeah, anywhere in Texas would be great.\u201d</p><p>The old lady raises an ungroomed reddish brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>I nod furiously. \u201cUh, yeah, I just mean that I\u2019ll take any bus going to Texas that\u2019s next in line.\u201d I smile across at her hoping she\u2019s buying this load of crap and doesn\u2019t feel the need to have my driver\u2019s license checked out for anything suspicious. \u201cI\u2019ve already been here for six hours. I hope you understand.\u201d</p><p>She looks right at me for a long, unnerving moment and then takes my credit card from between my fingers and starts tapping her keyboard again.</p><p>\u201cNext bus leaving for Texas is in an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll take that one!\u201d I say before she even has a chance to tell me whereabouts in Texas exactly.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t matter. And she\u2019s in such a hurry to get home that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to think it matters, either. As long as I don\u2019t care, she surely doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I get my brand new bus ticket and shove it inside my purse next to the old one as the counter closes behind me at 9:05 p.m. and I feel a small sense of relief wash over me. Walking back towards my seat, I fish around in my purse for my phone, pulling it out to check to see if I missed any calls or text messages. My mom called twice and left a voicemail both times, but still no call back from Natalie.</p><p>\u201cBaby, where are you?\u201d my mom asks on the other end when I call her back. \u201cI tried calling Natalie to see if you were staying with her but can\u2019t seem to catch her. Are you OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I\u2019m pacing in front of my chair with my phone pressed to my right ear. \u201cI decided to take a trip up to see my friend Anna in Virginia. I\u2019ll be here for a little while hanging out with her, but I\u2019m OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Camryn, what about your new job?\u201d She sounds disappointed, especially since it was her friend who gave me the chance and hired me. \u201cMaggie said you worked for a week and then didn\u2019t show up or call or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom, and I\u2019m really sorry, but it just wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the least you could\u2019ve done was be courteous and tell her\u2014give her a two-weeks-notice\u2014something, Camryn.\u201d</p> <p>I feel awful about how I handled that and normally would not have done something so inconsiderate, but the situation unfortunately warranted it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, \u201cand when I get back I\u2019ll call Mrs. Phillips personally and apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not like you,\u201d she says and I\u2019m getting worried she\u2019s steering too close to the reasons why I really left and all that which I refuse to go into with her. \u201cAnd to just up and leave to Virginia without calling me or leaving a note. Are you sure you\u2019re alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine. Stop worrying. Please. I\u2019ll call you again soon, but I gotta go now.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t want to and I can tell by how deeply she sighs on the phone, but she gives up.</p><p>\u201cOK, well you be careful and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Mom.\u201d</p><p>I check my phone one more time, hoping maybe Natalie sent me a text message and I just didn\u2019t see it. I scroll back to several days, even though I know full-well that if there were any unread text messages on my phone that there would be a little red circle on the icon indicating it.</p><p>I end up scrolling back down so far without realizing it that Ian\u2019s name pops up and my heart freezes inside my chest. I stop it right there and start to run my thumb over his name so that I can read the back-and-forth between us shortly before he died, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I thrust the phone angrily back into my purse.</p><p>11</p><p>NOW I REMEMBER ANOTHER reason I don\u2019t like soda: it makes me have to pee. The thought of being trapped on that bus with just a tiny matchbox restroom in the back forces me straight toward the facilities inside the terminal. I chuck the half-full soda in the trash on my way.</p><p>Passing up the first three stalls, because they\u2019re disgusting, I close myself up inside the fourth and hang my purse and bag on the hook mounted at the top of the blue door. I spread a good layer of toilet paper over the seat so I don\u2019t catch anything; do my business fast and now comes the strategic part. With one foot propped on the toilet seat to keep it from flushing on its own because of the sensor, I fumble the button on my jeans, reach out to get my bags from the hook and then open the door, all still with one foot propped awkwardly behind me.</p><p>And then I jump out fast right before the toilet flushes.</p><p>Blame it on Myth Busters; I was mortified for months after the episode on how the toilet really does spray invisible germs on you when it flushes.</p><p>The fluorescent lights in the restroom are duller than the ones in the waiting area. One flickers above me. There\u2019s two spiders burrowed behind webs tangled with dead bugs in the corner wall. It stinks in here. I step in front of a mirror and look for a dry spot on the counter to put my bags and then I wash my hands. Great, no paper towels. The only way I\u2019m drying my hands is by that obnoxious blower hanging on the wall, which never really dries anything, but just spreads the water around. I start to wipe my hands on my jeans instead, but I hit the large silver button on the hand drier and it roars to life. I wince. I hate that sound.</p><p>As I\u2019m pretending to dry my hands (because I know in the end, I\u2019ll be wiping them on my jeans anyway), a moving shadow behind me catches my eye in the mirrors. I turn around and at the same time the hand drier turns off, bathing the room in silence again.</p><p>A man is standing at the restroom entrance, looking at me.</p><p>My heart reacts and my throat goes dry. \u201cThis is the ladies restroom.\u201d</p><p>I glance at my bags on the counter. Do I have a weapon? Yeah, I did at least pack a knife, though little good it\u2019ll do me when it\u2019s several feet away inside a zipped-up bag.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I thought this was the men\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Good, apology accepted, now please get the hell out of here.</p><p>The man, wearing dirty, old running shoes and faded jeans with paint stains on the legs, just stands there. This isn\u2019t good. If it really was an accident that he came in here, surely he\u2019d look more embarrassed and would\u2019ve already turned tail and left.</p><p>I march over to my bags on the counter and I notice from the corner of my eye that he takes a few more steps toward me.</p><p>\u201cI...didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I throw open my bag and dig around inside of it for my knife, while at the same time trying to keep my eyes on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you on the bus,\u201d he says and he\u2019s still drawing closer. \u201cMy name is Robert.\u201d</p><p>I swing my head around to face him. \u201cLook, you\u2019re not supposed to be in here. It\u2019s not exactly the place for conversation and I suggest you leave. Now.\u201d Finally, I feel the contours of the knife and grip it in my hand, keeping my hand hidden inside the bag. My finger presses down on the thin metal piece to set the blade free from the handle. I hear it click open and lock in place.</p><p>The man stops about six feet from me and smiles. His black hair is oily and slicked back. Yes, I remember him now; he\u2019s been on every bus change with me since Tennessee.</p><p>Oh my God, has he been watching me all this time?</p><p>I pull the knife out of the bag and hold it up clutched in my fist, ready to use it and letting him know that I will not hesitate.</p><p>He just smiles. That scares me, too.</p><p>My heart is banging against my ribs.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell away from me,\u201d I say, gritting my teeth. \u201cI swear to God I will f**king gut you like a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d he says, still smiling eerily. \u201cI\u2019ll pay you\u2014a lot\u2014just if you suck my dick. It\u2019s all I want. You\u2019ll leave the bathroom about five hundred dollars richer and I\u2019ll get this image out of my head. We\u2019ll both get something out of it.\u201d</p><p>I start to scream at the top of my lungs when suddenly another dark shadow catches my eye. Andrew barrels into the man, hurling his body over a two foot space and onto the long counter. His back crashes into one of the mirrors. The glass shatters and shards rain down all over the place. I jump back and shriek, pressing my back against the hand drier, waking it up again. My knife fell from my hand at some point. I see it on the floor, but I\u2019m too afraid to move right now to pick it up.</p><p>Blood drips off what\u2019s left of the mirror when Andrew pulls the man off the counter by the front of his shirt. He pulls back his other hand and buries his fist in the man\u2019s face. I hear a nauseating crunch! and blood pours from his nose. Again and again, Andrew rains blows down on his head, one bloody hit after another until the man can\u2019t hold his head up straight and it starts to bob and sway drunkenly on his shoulders. But Andrew goes in for more, digging both of his hands into the man\u2019s shoulders and lifting his feet from the floor, bashing his back twice against the tile wall.</p><p>He knocks him out cold.</p><p>Andrew lets go and the man\u2019s body falls against the floor. I hear his head thump against the tile. Andrew just stands there hovering over him, maybe waiting to see if he\u2019s going to get up, but there\u2019s something disturbingly untamed in his posture and his enraged expression as he stares down at the unconscious man.</p><p>I can hardly breathe but I manage to say, \u201cAndrew? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>He snaps out of it and jerks his head around to face me. \u201cWhat?\u201d He shakes his head and his eyes narrow under lines of disbelief. He marches over. \u201cAm I alright? What kind of question is that?\u201d He fastens his hands around my upper arms and stares deeply into my eyes. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to look away because the intensity in his eyes is overpowering, but his head follows mine and he shakes me once to force me to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah...I\u2019m fine,\u201d I finally say, \u201cthanks to you.\u201d</p><p>Andrew pulls me into his rock hard chest and wraps his arms around my back, practically squeezing the life out of me.</p><p>\u201cWe should call the cops,\u201d he says, pulling away.</p> <p>I nod and he takes me by the hand and pulls me with him out of the restroom and down the gloomy gray hallway.</p><p>By the time the cops get here, the man has disappeared.</p><p>Andrew and I agree that he probably slipped out right after we left. He must\u2019ve gone out the back while Andrew was on the phone. Andrew and I give the cops a description of the man and our statements. The cops commend Andrew\u2014sort of vacantly\u2014for stepping in, but he really just seems to want to stop talking to them altogether.</p><p>My new bus to Texas left ten minutes ago and so once again I\u2019m stuck in Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to Idaho?\u201d Andrew says.</p> <p>I had let it slip that my \u2018bus to Texas\u2019 just left without me.</p><p>I bite gently on the inside of my bottom lip and cross one leg over the other. We\u2019re sitting near the front doors inside the bus station, watching passengers come and go from the tall windows.</p><p>\u201cWell, now I\u2019m going to Texas,\u201d is all I say, even though I know I\u2019m \u2018caught\u2019 and have a feeling I\u2019ll be spilling some of the truth very soon. \u201cI thought you left in the cab?\u201d I say, trying to divert the subject.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he says, \u201cbut don\u2019t turn this around on me, Camryn. Why aren\u2019t you going to Idaho anymore?\u201d</p><p>I sigh. I know he won\u2019t stop asking until he gets it out of me so I throw in the towel.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have a sister in Idaho,\u201d I admit. \u201cI\u2019m just traveling. Nothing more to it, really.\u201d</p> <p>I hear him let out an irritated sigh next to me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something more to it\u2014are you a runaway?\u201d</p><p>I look over at him finally. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a runaway, at least not in the underage illegal sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then in what sense?\u201d</p><p>I shrug.</p><p>\u201cI just had to get away from home for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you ran away from home?\u201d</p><p>I let out a sharp breath and look right into his intense green eyes staring right through me. \u201cI didn\u2019t run away, I just had to get away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you jumped on a bus alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019m getting irritated at the drilling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to give me more than that,\u201d he says, relentless.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m more appreciative than you know for what you did. I really am. But I don\u2019t think you saving me gives you the right to know my business.\u201d</p><p>A small wave of insult subtly stuns his features.</p><p>I feel bad instantly, but it\u2019s the truth: I\u2019m not obligated to tell him anything.</p><p>He gives up and looks out ahead, propping an ankle on the other knee.</p><p>\u201cI saw that piece of shit eyeing you since I got on the bus in Kansas,\u201d he reveals and has all of my attention. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see it, but I did so I started watching him.\u201d He still hasn\u2019t looked over at me again, but I\u2019m staring right at him from the side as he explains. \u201cI saw him get into a cab and leave here before I did and only then did I feel it was OK to leave you here by yourself. But on the way to the hospital, I just had this bad feeling. I told the cab driver to drop me off at a restaurant instead, and I ate. Still couldn\u2019t get it out of my head though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say, interrupting him, \u201cyou didn\u2019t go to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, I knew if I went that...,\u201d he turns his eyes away again, \u201c...I wouldn\u2019t be enough in my right mind to pay attention to the bad feeling I was having if I was staring down at my dying father.\u201d</p><p>I understand and I don\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>\u201cSo, I went to my dad\u2019s house and got his car, drove around for a while and when I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I came back here. I parked across the street and waited for a while and sure enough, a cab pulled in and dropped the guy back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come inside instead of waiting in the car?\u201d</p><p>He looks down in thought.</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to freak you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would that freak me out?\u201d I realize I\u2019m smiling a little.</p><p>Andrew looks right at me and I see that playful, smartass look start to crawl back into his features again.</p><p>He holds his hands open, palms up. \u201cUmmm, strange guy you met on the bus coming back hours later to sit next to you?\u201d His eyebrows crinkle in his forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s almost as creepy as suck-my-dick-for-$500-guy, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything like that.\u201d</p><p>He tries to bury his smile, but relents.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Camryn?\u201d His face is serious again and my smile fades.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess I\u2019m going to wait here until the next bus to Texas comes and then I\u2019m on my way to Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I slap my hands down against my thighs. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not going home yet!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s unfazed by my shouting at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go home yet?\u201d he asks calm and intently. \u201cMight as well spill your f**king guts because I\u2019m not leaving you alone in this bus station, especially not after what happened.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms tight over my chest and stare out in front of me. \u201cWell then I guess you\u2019ll be sitting here for a long time until I get on the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That includes not letting you get on another bus alone to go anywhere. Texas. Idaf**kingho. Wherever. It\u2019s dangerous and I can tell you\u2019re an intelligent girl\u2014so here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do...,\u201d</p><p>I blink a few times, stunned by his sudden authoritarian arrogance.</p><p>He goes on:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here with you until morning. That\u2019ll give you enough time to decide whether you\u2019re going to let me pay for your plane ticket back home, or if you want to call someone to fly here to get you. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>I look at him like he\u2019s crazy.</p><p>His eyes say back at me: Yeah, I\u2019m dead serious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going back to North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shoots up from the chair and stands in front of me. \u201cOK, then I\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>I blink, looking up at his intense eyes; his perfectly sculpted cheekbones seem more pronounced from this angle making his gaze even fiercer. A shiver moves through my stomach.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane,\u201d I laugh it off, but I know he\u2019s serious and then I say with more severity, \u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>His teeth grind together and the intensity in his eyes becomes more forlorn.</p><p>He starts to look away but a thought pulls him back. \u201cThen come with me.\u201d</p><p>What? No way....</p><p>He looks hopeful rather than determined now. He sits back down next to me on the plastic blue seat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay right here until morning,\u201d he goes on, \u201cbecause surely you wouldn\u2019t leave with some strange guy from a bus station after dark? Right?\u201d</p><p>He turns his chin away from me, looking at me in a questioning sidelong glance.</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d I say, even though I really do feel like I can trust him\u2014he saved me from being raped, for God\u2019s sake! And nothing about him is giving me the same fears I had when Damon practically did the same thing. No, Damon had something darker in his eyes when he looked at me that night on the roof. All I see in Andrew\u2019s eyes is concern.</p><p>But I still won\u2019t leave with him like this.</p><p>\u201cGood answer,\u201d he says, apparently glad I\u2019m as \u2018intelligent\u2019 as he hoped I was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait until daylight and just to give you more peace of mind I\u2019ll have a cab drive up straight to the hospital instead of expecting you to get in my car.\u201d</p><p>I nod, glad he thought of that. I won\u2019t say that I hadn\u2019t exactly sorted that part out yet. I mean, I already trust him enough, but it\u2019s like he wants to be sure that I don\u2019t, like he\u2019s teaching me a lesson in a quiet, roundabout way.</p><p>I\u2019m ashamed to admit that he has to \u2018teach me\u2019 any of this at all.</p><p>\u201cAnd then from the hospital, we\u2019ll catch a cab back here and wherever you want to go, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his hand to shake on it. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>I think about it a moment, confused, yet at the same time utterly fascinated by him. I nod reluctantly at first and then again with more assurance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d I say and place my hand into his.</p><p>Honestly, I\u2019m not sure I agree with it entirely. Why would he even do that? Doesn\u2019t he have a life elsewhere? Surely he\u2019s not as miserable with home as I am.</p><p>This is crazy! Who is this guy?</p><p>We sit together for several hours right here in the station and talk about nothing important, yet I love every second of our conversations. About how I gave in and drank a soda and it was the soda\u2019s fault I ended up in the restroom with the man\u2014he laughs it off and tells me I just have a weak bladder. We quietly gossip about the passengers that come and go; the weird-looking ones and those who look dead, as if they\u2019ve been riding a bus for the past week and haven\u2019t been able to sleep. And we talk about classic rock some more, but the argument remains as much a stalemate as it was when we first discussed it on the bus.</p><p>He practically died when I said that I\u2019d listen to Pink over The Rolling Stones, any day. I mean, I literally think I wounded him. He put his big hand over his heart and threw back his head in devastation and everything. It was very dramatic. And funny. I tried not to laugh, but it was hard not to when his hardened, over exaggerated face was practically smiling, too.</p><p>And just as we went to leave after the sun rose, I stopped to look at him for a moment. A slight breeze brushed through his stylish brown hair. He cocked his head to the side, smiling at me and waving me into the cab. \u201cYou\u2019re still coming, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled warmly back at him and nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d And I took his hand and slid into the backseat with him.</p><p>What I had been thinking about when I looked at him was that I realized I haven\u2019t smiled or laughed this much since before Ian died. Not even Natalie could get a genuine elated emotion out of me and she tried really hard. She went out of her way to help snap me out of my depression, but nothing she ever did came close to what Andrew has managed to do in such a short time and without even trying.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>12</p><p>MY THROAT CLOSES UP when we step foot inside the hospital, like a wall of blackness came out of nowhere and engulfed me. I stop for a second at the entrance and just stand here with my arms heavy at my sides. And then I feel Camryn\u2019s hand touch my wrist.</p><p>I look over at her. She\u2019s smiling so warmly that it melts me a little. Her blonde hair is pulled into a messy braid around to one side, lying freely over her right shoulder. A few strands that escaped the rubber band rest freely down the side of her face. I have this urge to reach up and brush them softly with my finger, but I don\u2019t. I can\u2019t be doing shit like that. I need to get rid of this attraction. But she\u2019s different from other girls and I think that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m having such a hard time with it. I don\u2019t need this right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she says.</p><p>Her hand falls away from my wrist when she sees that she has my attention. I smile faintly back at her.</p><p>We follow the hall to the elevator and ride up to the third floor. Every step of the way I feel like I should just turn around and leave this place. My father doesn\u2019t want me to show emotion when I go in there and right about now I\u2019m about to explode with it.</p><p>Maybe I should go outside and punch a few trees and get it all out of my system before I go in there.</p> <p>We stop at the waiting area where a few other people are all sitting around reading magazines.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here for you,\u201d Camryn says and I look right at her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d</p><p>I really do want her to. I don\u2019t know why.</p><p>Camryn starts to shake her head no. \u201cI-I can\u2019t go in there,\u201d she says, looking uncomfortable now. \u201cReally, I...I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>I reach out and gently take her sling bag from her shoulder and put it on mine. It\u2019s light, but she\u2019s starting to look discomforted by it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I say. \u201cI want you to go with me.\u201d</p><p>Why am I saying this?</p><p>She looks down at the floor and then carefully gazes around at the rest of the room before her blue eyes fall on me again. \u201cOK,\u201d she says with a subtle nod.</p><p>I feel my face break into a small smile and I instinctively take her by the hand. She doesn\u2019t pull away.</p><p>I\u2019m comforted by her, needless to say, and I get the feeling she\u2019s happy to oblige. Surely she knows how hard something like this would be for anyone.</p> <p>We walk hand in hand toward my father\u2019s room.</p><p>She squeezes once, looking over at me as if to give me more encouragement. And then I push open the hospital room door. A nurse looks up when we walk in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mr. Parrish\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>She nods solemnly and goes back to adjusting the machines and tubes hooked up to my father. The room is a typical bland and sterile space with bright white walls and a tile floor so shiny the lights running along the ceiling panels blaze off of it. I hear a constant and steady beep coming from the heart rate monitor next to my father\u2019s bed.</p><p>I still haven\u2019t actually looked at my father. I realize I\u2019m looking at everything in the room but him.</p><p>Camryn\u2019s fingers squeeze around mine.</p><p>\u201cHow is he doing?\u201d I ask, but I know it\u2019s a stupid question. He\u2019s dying; that\u2019s how he\u2019s doing. I just can\u2019t get anything else out.</p><p>The nurse looks at me expressionless.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in and out of consciousness, as you probably already know.\u201d</p><p>No, I didn\u2019t know, actually.</p><p>\u201cAnd there hasn\u2019t been any change, good or bad.\u201d She adjusts an I.V. running from the top of his rugged hand.</p><p>Then she walks around the bed and picks up a clipboard from the side table and tucks it underneath her arm.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone else been here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The nurse nods. \u201cFamily has been in and out for the past several days. Some left about an hour ago, but I expect they\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Probably Aidan, my older brother and his wife, Michelle. And my younger brother, Asher.</p><p>The nurse slips out of the room.</p><p>Camryn looks up at me, tightening her hand around mine. Her eyes smile carefully. \u201cI\u2019m going to sit over there and let you visit with your father, OK?\u201d</p><p>I nod, though everything she said just kind of slipped through my head like a wispy memory. Her fingers slowly fall away from mine and she takes a seat against the wall on the empty vinyl chair. I suck in a deep breath and lick the dryness from my lips.</p><p>His face is swollen. Tubes are running from his nostrils, feeding him oxygen. I\u2019m surprised he\u2019s not on life support yet, but this gives me a small sense of hope. Really small. I know he won\u2019t get better; that\u2019s pretty much already been established. What\u2019s left of his hair has been shaved off. They had talked about trying to perform surgery, but after my dad found out that it wasn\u2019t going to save him he, of course, complained:</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not cuttin\u2019 into my fuckin\u2019 head,\u201d he had said. \u201cYou want me to shell out thousands of dollars so you boys can have these cereal box doctors crack my damn skull open? Dammit, boy! (He had been talking to Aidan specifically), you are one nut shy of a man!\u201d</p><p>My brothers and I were prepared to do whatever it took to save him, but he had gone behind our backs and signed some kind of \u2018stipulation\u2019 that when things got worse that no one would have the right to make these decisions for him.</p><p>My mom was who alerted the hospital of his wishes days before the surgery was to be performed and provided them with the legal papers. We were upset by it, but my mother is a smart and caring woman and none of us could ever be pissed at her for what she did.</p><p>I move closer and look the rest of him over. My hand sort of has a mind of its own and the next thing I know it\u2019s slithering up beside his and taking a hold of it. Even this feels odd. Like I shouldn\u2019t be doing it. If it were anyone else, I\u2019d have no issue holding their hand. But this my dad and I feel like I\u2019m doing something I shouldn\u2019t. I can just hear his voice inside my head: \u201cYou don\u2019t hold another man\u2019s hand, boy. What the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, my dad\u2019s eyes crack open and instinctively I pull my hand away from his.</p><p>\u201cThat you, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>I nod, gazing down at him.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Linda?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinda,\u201d he says and his eyes can\u2019t decide if they want to stay open. \u201cMy wife, Linda. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard and glance over at Camryn who is sitting so quietly, watching.</p><p>I turn back to my dad. \u201cDad, you and Linda divorced last year, remember?\u201d</p><p>His pale green eyes are glazed over by moisture. Not tears. Just moisture. He looks dazed for a moment and smacks his lips together, moving his dry tongue around in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo you want some water?\u201d I ask and go to reach for the long lap table on wheels that had been moved away from the bed. A pale pink pitcher of water sits on it next to a thick plastic mug with a pop-on top with a straw poking up through the center.</p><p>My dad shakes his head no.</p><p>\u201cDid\u2019ja\u2019 fix Ms. Nina?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod again. \u201cYeah, she looks great. New paint job and rims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d he says, nodding a little, too.</p><p>This feels awkward and I know it\u2019s written all over my face and my posture. I just don\u2019t know what to say or if I should try to force him to drink some water or if I should just sit down and wait for Aidan and Asher to get back. I\u2019d rather them do this than me. I\u2019m not good with this kind of thing.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that pretty thing?\u201d he asks, looking toward the wall.</p><p>I wonder how he can even see Camryn all the way over there and then I notice he\u2019s looking at her through the tall mirror on the other side of him which reflects that portion of the room. Camryn freezes up a little, but that pretty smile of hers brightens her face. She raises her hand and waves at him through the mirror with her fingers.</p><p>Even through his swollen skin, I see a grin on my dad\u2019s lips. \u201cIs that your Eurydice\u2019s?\u201d he asks and my eyes freeze wide open. I hope Camryn didn\u2019t catch that, but I don\u2019t see how she couldn\u2019t. My dad weakly raises one hand and gestures toward Camryn.</p><p>She gets up and walks over to stand next to me. She smiles so warmly at him it even impresses me. She\u2019s a natural. I know she\u2019s nervous and probably feels more uncomfortable than she ever has standing in this room with this dying man who she doesn\u2019t even know, yet she doesn\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. Parrish,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Camryn Bennett, a friend of Andrew\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His eyes move to me. I know that look; he\u2019s comparing her answer with the look on my face, trying to decipher her meaning of \u2018friend\u2019.</p><p>And then suddenly my father does something I have never seen him do: he reaches out his hand...to me.</p><p>The gesture stuns me numb.</p><p>Only when I notice Camryn covertly glaring at me to acknowledge him, do I break free from the numbness and nervously take his hand. I hold it for a long, awkward moment and my father closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep. I move my hand from his when I feel his weak grip go completely slack.</p><p>The door opens and my brothers walk in, along with Aidan\u2019s wife, Michelle.</p><p>I step away from my father right on cue, taking Camryn with me and not realizing that I\u2019m holding her hand again until Aidan\u2019s eyes move down to see our interlocked fingers.</p><p>\u201cGlad you could make it,\u201d Aidan says, though with a bit of contempt in his voice, no doubt.</p><p>He\u2019s still pissed at me for not taking a plane and getting here sooner. He\u2019ll have to f**king get over it; we grieve in our own ways.</p><p>Regardless, he pulls me into a hug, gripping one hand between us and patting my back with the other.</p><p>\u201cThis is Camryn,\u201d I say, looking back at her.</p><p>She smiles up at them, having already found her way back to the empty chair against the wall.</p><p>\u201cThis is my older brother, Aidan and his wife, Michelle.\u201d I point gently at them. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the runt, Asher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDickhead,\u201d Asher says.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say.</p><p>Aidan and Michelle take the other two seats next to a table and start distributing the burger and fries they just bought.</p><p>\u201cThe ol\u2019 man still hasn\u2019t come to,\u201d Aidan says, stuffing a few fries in his mouth. \u201cI hate to say it, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to.\u201d</p><p>Camryn looks right at me. We both spoke to my father just moments ago and I know she\u2019s waiting for me to give them the news.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d I say and see Camryn\u2019s eyes wrinkle in confusion.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d Aidan asks.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that surprise me?\u201d He takes a bite of his burger.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start your shit with me, Aidan, I\u2019m not in the mood for it and this isn\u2019t the f**king time or the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Aidan says, shaking his head and working his jaws around to chew his food. He dips a few fries in a mound of ketchup Michelle just made on a napkin in-between them. \u201cDo what you want, but be here for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>There is no emotion in his face. He just continues to eat.</p><p>My whole body goes rigid.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Aidan,\u201d Asher says from behind me. \u201cCan you please not do this right now? Seriously, bro, Andrew\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>Asher has always been the mediator between Aidan and me. And always the most level-headed. When it comes to me or Aidan, we think better with our fists. He always won the fights between us when we were kids, but little did he know that all that time he was beating the shit out of me, he was training me.</p><p>We\u2019re pretty even now. We avoid actual contact fighting with each other at all costs, but I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I don\u2019t hold my shit back as good as he does. And he knows it. It\u2019s why he\u2019s backing off now and using Michelle as a distraction. He reaches up and wipes ketchup from the side of her mouth. She giggles. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Camryn catches my eyes; she\u2019s probably been trying to get my attention for the past couple of minutes, and for a second, I think she\u2019s trying to indicate that she\u2019s ready to go, but then she shakes her head, telling me instead to calm down.</p><p>Instantly, I do.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Asher chimes in to lessen the tension in the room, \u201chow long have you two been going out?\u201d He leans against the wall near the television, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>We look almost exactly alike with the same brown hair and crazy f**king dimples. Aidan is the oddball of the three of us; his hair is a lot darker and instead of dimples, he has a small birthmark on his left cheek.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no we\u2019re just friends,\u201d I say.</p><p>I think Camryn just blushed, but I can\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cMust be a good friend to come all the way to Wyoming with you,\u201d Aidan says.</p><p>Thankfully he\u2019s not being a dick. If he decided to take his anger on me out on her, I\u2019d have to break his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Camryn speaks up and instantly I\u2019m absorbed by the sweetness of her voice, \u201cI live near Galveston; thought someone should ride along with him since he was taking a bus.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised she remembers what city I told her I lived in.</p><p>Aidan nods kindly at her; his cheeks moving as he chews.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hot, bro,\u201d I hear Asher whisper at me from behind.</p><p>I turn around at the waist and glare at him to shut up. He smiles, but he does shut up.</p><p>The ol\u2019 man stirs almost unnoticeably and Asher moves over to the side of the bed. He thumps Dad on the nose playfully. \u201cWake up. We brought burgers.\u201d</p><p>Aidan holds his burger up as if our dad can actually see it. \u201cThey\u2019re good, too. Better wake up soon or they\u2019ll be gone.\u201d</p> <p>Dad doesn\u2019t stir again.</p><p>He has all three of us trained. We would never think to stand around his bed and look all depressed and shit. And when he dies, Aidan and Asher will probably order a pizza and buy a case of beer and shoot the shit until the sun comes up the next morning.</p><p>I won\u2019t be here for that.</p><p>In fact, the longer I stand here the better the chances are that he will die before I can leave.</p><p>I talk with my brothers and Michelle for a few more minutes and then walk over to Camryn.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>She takes my hand and stands up with me.</p><p>\u201cAlready leaving?\u201d Aidan says.</p> <p>Camryn speaks up before I do and says with a smile, \u201cHe\u2019ll be back; we\u2019re just going to grab something to eat.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trying to diffuse an argument before it starts. She looks at me and I, agreeing to go along with it, turn to Asher and say, \u201cCall me if there\u2019s any change.\u201d</p><p>He nods but offers nothing else.</p><p>\u201cBye Andrew,\u201d Michelle says. \u201cIt was good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Asher walks with us out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not coming back, are you?\u201d he says.</p><p>Camryn turns away from us and walks a little ways down the hall to give us a minute.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ash, I just can\u2019t deal with this. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know bro.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDad wouldn\u2019t even care, you know that. He\u2019d rather you be getting laid, or shitfaced, than hanging around his old ass in that bed.\u201d</p><p>He does speak the truth, strangely enough.</p><p>He also glances at Camryn once after having said that.</p><p>\u201cJust friends? Really?\u201d he whispers at me with a devious grin.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re just friends, so shut the f**k up.\u201d</p><p>He laughs in his chest and then pats the side of my arm. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I need to, alright?\u201d</p><p>I nod, agreeing. When he \u2018needs to\u2019 call me, he means when Dad has died.</p><p>Asher raises his hand to wave at Camryn. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and he disappears back inside the room.</p><p>\u201cI really think you should stay here, Andrew. I really do.\u201d</p><p>I start to walk faster down the hall and she keeps up right alongside me. I slide my hands down in my pockets. I always do that when I\u2019m nervous.</p><p>\u201cI know you probably think I\u2019m a selfish bastard for leaving, but you don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tell me,\u201d she says, grabbing me around the elbow and we just keep walking. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being selfish, I think you just don\u2019t know how to deal with this kind of pain.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s trying to catch my gaze, but I can\u2019t look at her. I just want to get out of this death sentence built with red bricks.</p><p>We make it to the elevator and Camryn stops talking since there are two other people inside with us, but as soon as we stop on the ground floor and the silver metal doors slide open, she goes back to it.</p><p>\u201cAndrew. Stop. Please!\u201d</p><p>I stop at the sound of her voice and she turns me around. She gazes up at me with such a tormented look on her face that it sort of hurts my heart. That long, blonde braid still hangs over her right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she says more softly now that she has my attention. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like how it doesn\u2019t hurt to tell me why Texas?\u201d</p><p>That stings her.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>13</p><p>HIS WORDS SHUT ME up for about five full seconds. My hand drops from his elbow.</p><p>\u201cI think your situation is a little more important than mine right now,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he says, \u201cAnd you wanting to ride around alone on a bus, not knowing where the hell you\u2019re going and putting yourself in danger; that doesn\u2019t seem imminently as important to you?\u201d</p><p>He seems angry. I can tell that he is, but most of it, if not every bit of it, is because his father is upstairs dying, and Andrew doesn\u2019t know how to let him go. I feel sorry for him, for being raised to believe that he can\u2019t show the kind of emotion needed in a situation like this, or else it will make him less of a man.</p><p>I can\u2019t show the emotion, either, but I wasn\u2019t raised that way, I was forced into it.</p><p>\u201cDo you cry at all?\u201d I ask. \u201cAbout other things? Have you ever cried?\u201d</p><p>He scoffs. \u201cOf course. Everybody cries, even big tough guys like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, name one time.\u201d</p><p>He answers easily: \u201cA...movie made me cry once,\u201d but he suddenly appears embarrassed and might be regretting his answer.</p><p>\u201cWhat movie?\u201d</p><p>He can\u2019t look me in the eyes. I feel the mood lightening between us, despite what created it.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d he says.</p><p>I smile and step up closer to him. \u201cOh come on, just tell me\u2014what, you think I\u2019m going to laugh at you and call you a p**sy?\u201d</p><p>He breaks a small grin underneath the embarrassed flush of his face.</p><p>\u201cThe Notebook,\u201d he says so low that I didn\u2019t quite catch it.</p><p>\u201cDid you say The Notebook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I cried watching The Notebook, alright?\u201d</p><p>He turns his back on me and I\u2019m using every shred of strength I have to hold back the laughter. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all funny that he cried watching The Notebook; what\u2019s funny is his humiliated reaction admitting it.</p><p>I laugh. I can\u2019t help it, it just comes out.</p><p>Andrew whirls around with eyes wider than plates and he glares at me for a second. I yelp when he grabs me and throws me over his shoulder, carrying me right out of the hospital.</p><p>I\u2019m laughing so hard I have tears in my eyes. Fun tears, not the ones I stop shedding after Ian died.</p><p>\u201cPut me down!\u201d I beat my fists against his back.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t laugh!\u201d</p><p>Him saying that only makes me laugh harder. I cackle and let out weird noises I never knew I could make.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Andrew! Put me down!\u201d My fingers are digging into his back through the fabric of his shirt.</p><p>Finally, I feel my shoes touch the concrete. I look at him and I do stop laughing because I want him to talk to me. I can\u2019t let him leave his father.</p><p>But he speaks up first:</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t cry around or for him, like I told you before.\u201d</p><p>I touch his arm gently. \u201cWell then don\u2019t cry, but at least stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to stay, Camryn.\u201d He stares deeply into my eyes and I know just by the way he\u2019s looking at me that I\u2019m not going to be able to change his mind. \u201cI appreciate you trying to help, but this isn\u2019t something I can give in to.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I nod.</p><p>\u201cMaybe sometime during this road trip you agreed to, we\u2019ll be able to tell each other the things we don\u2019t want to tell,\u201d he says and my heart, for some reason, reacts to his voice.</p><p>There\u2019s a flutter inside my chest, just between my br**sts behind my ribcage.</p><p>Andrew smiles brightly, his perfectly-shaped green eyes like the centerpiece of his sculpted face.</p><p>He really is gorgeous....</p><p>\u201cSo, what have you decided?\u201d he asks, crossing his arms and looking all inquisitive. \u201cAm I buying you a plane ticket home, or are you really set on the road to Nowhere, Texas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really want to go with me?\u201d I just can\u2019t believe it and at the same time, I want more than anything for it to be true.</p><p>I hold my breath waiting for him to answer.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYes, I really do.\u201d</p><p>The fluttering turns into hot mush and my face smiles so hugely that for a long moment, I can\u2019t seem to soften it.</p><p>\u201cI just have one complaint about tagging along though,\u201d he says, holding up a finger.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding on that bus,\u201d he says. \u201cI really f**king hate it.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle quietly and have to agree with him on that one.</p><p>\u201cSo how else are we supposed to go?\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth lifts into a knowing smile. \u201cWe can take the car,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK?\u201d he says, pausing. \u201cThat\u2019s it? You\u2019re just going to hop in the car with a guy you barely know and trust him not to rape you on a deserted highway somewhere\u2014I thought we already went over this?\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head to one side, crossing my arms. \u201cIs it any different than meeting you at the library and going out with you a night or two later, alone in your car?\u201d I tilt my head to the other side. \u201cEverybody starts out as strangers, Andrew, but not everybody meets a stranger who saves her from a r**ist and takes her to meet his dying father practically in the same night\u2014I\u2019d say you passed the trustworthy test a little ways back.\u201d</p><p>The left side of his mouth lifts into a grin, disrupting the seriousness of my heartfelt words. \u201cSo this road trip is a date then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I laugh. \u201cNo! It was just an analogy.\u201d</p><p>I know he\u2019s aware of that, but I need to say something to help distract him from my reddening cheeks. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cYeah, I know, but you do owe me a \u2018friendly\u2019 dinner in the company of a steak.\u201d He quotes with his fingers when he says \u2018friendly\u2019. The smile never leaves his face.</p><p>\u201cI do, I admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d he says, looping his arm through mine and walking me toward the cab waiting near the parking lot. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick up my dad\u2019s car from the bus station, stop by his house and grab a few things and then we\u2019re on the road.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He opens the back door on the cab to let me get in first, shutting it behind him once he slides in next to me.</p><p>The cab pulls out of the lot.</p><p>\u201cOh, I should probably set a few ground rules before we do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I turn at the waist and look at him curiously. \u201cWhat kind of ground rules?\u201d</p> <p>He smiles.</p><p>\u201cWell, number one: my car, my stereo; I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to elaborate on that.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cSo, basically you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m stuck with you in a car on a road trip and can only listen to classic rock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019ll grow on ya\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never grew on me when I was growing up and had to endure my parents listening to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNumber two,\u201d he says holding up two fingers and dismissing my argument altogether. \u201cYou have to do whatever I say.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps back and my brows draw together harshly. \u201cHuh? What the hell\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>His smile gets bigger, crafty even.</p><p>\u201cYou said you trusted me, so trust me on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to give me more than that.

I still trust him, I admit, but I\u2019m also a little terrified now in a worried-I\u2019ll-wake-up-with-a-Sharpie-moustache sort of way.</p><p>He pats my thigh with his hand. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, you can tell me to screw off if you want to refuse anything, but I hope you won\u2019t because I really want to show you how to live.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that totally catches me off-guard. He\u2019s serious; nothing humorous about those words and once again I find myself fascinated by him.</p> <p>\u201cHow to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask too many damn questions.\u201d He pats my thigh one more time and moves his hand back into his lap.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you were on this side of the car, you\u2019d be asking a lot of questions, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>My lips part halfway. \u201cYou are a very strange person, Andrew Parrish, but alright, I trust you.\u201d</p><p>His smile becomes more warming as he lays his head against the seat looking over at me.</p><p>\u201cAny more ground rules?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks up in thought and chews on the inside of his mouth for a moment.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d His head falls back to the side. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn.</p><p>\u201cWell I have a few ground rules of my own.\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head with curiosity, but leaves his hands flat over his stomach with his strong fingers interlocked.</p><p>\u201cAlright, shoot,\u201d he says, grinning, prepared for anything I can throw at him, surely.</p><p>\u201cNumber one: under no circumstances will you be getting in my panties. Just because I\u2019m friendly to you and am agreeing to\u2014well, the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever done\u2014I\u2019m giving you advance warning that I\u2019m not going to be your next lay, or fall in love with you (he\u2019s grinning from ear to ear right now and it\u2019s very distracting) or anything like that. Is that understood?\u201d I\u2019m trying to be very serious about this. I really am. And I do mean what I said. But that stupid grin of his is sort of forcing me to smile and I hate him for it.</p><p>He crinkles his lips in thought. \u201cCompletely understood,\u201d he agrees, though I feel there is a hidden meaning behind his words.</p><p>I nod. \u201cGood.\u201d I feel better that I made myself clear.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d he asks.</p><p>For a second I forgot about the other ground rule.</p><p>\u201cYeah so number two is: no Bad Company.\u201d</p><p>He looks mildly mortified.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell kind of rule is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just my rule,\u201d I say, smirking. \u201cYou have a problem with it? You have all the other classic rock you can listen to and I\u2019m not allowed to listen to anything I want, so I see nothing wrong with my tiny stipulation.\u201d I hold my thumb and index finger a half inch apart to show how tiny.</p><p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t like that rule,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cBad Company is a great band\u2014why such a hater?\u201d</p><p>He looks wounded. I find it cute.</p><p>I purse my lips. \u201cHonestly?\u201d I\u2019m probably going to regret this.</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, honestly,\u201d he says, crossing his arms. \u201cOut with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sing too much about love. It\u2019s cheesy.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs out loud again and I\u2019m starting to think the cab driver is really getting an earful with us in his car.</p><p>\u201cSounds like someone is bit-ter,\u201d Andrew says and a deep grin warms his lips.</p><p>Yep, I regret it.</p><p>I look away from him because I can\u2019t let him see anything in my face to confirm that he\u2019s right on target with his assessment of me. At least where my cheating ex, Christian, is concerned. With him, it\u2019s bitterness. With Ian, it\u2019s cruel, unadulterated pain.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ll fix that, too,\u201d he says nonchalantly.</p><p>I look back over.</p><p>\u201cUmmm, well thanks Dr. Phil, but I don\u2019t need help with that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>Wait a damn minute! Who ever said I needed to be \u2018fixed\u2019 at all?</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He tilts his chin, looking curious.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cBesides, that would sort of break my ground rule number one.\u201d</p><p>He blinks and smiles. \u201cOh, you automatically assume I was going to offer myself up as the guinea pig?\u201d His shoulders bounce with gentle laughter.</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>I try not to look offended. Not sure if it\u2019s working all that well, so I use a different tactic:</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hope not,\u201d I say, batting my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not my type.\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, ball\u2019s in my court again; I think he actually flinched!</p><p>\u201cAnd just what\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d he asks, but I\u2019m totally not buying anymore that my comment really hurt him. People don\u2019t normally smile after they\u2019ve been offended.</p><p>I turn around the whole way, pressing my back against the cab door and look him up and down. I\u2019d be lying my ass off if I said I don\u2019t like what I see. I haven\u2019t found anything yet that doesn\u2019t make him my type. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for me not being into sex or dating or relationships or love, Andrew Parrish is the kind of guy that I would totally go for and who Natalie would openly drool over.</p><p>She would wear him across her boobs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2018wrong\u2019 with you,\u201d I say. \u201cI just tend to end up with the...tame types.\u201d</p><p>For the third time, Andrew\u2019s head falls back into laughter.</p><p>\u201cTame?\u201d he says, still laughing. He nods a few times and adds, \u201cYeah, I guess you\u2019re right in saying I\u2019m not exactly the tame type.\u201d He holds up his finger as if to make a point. \u201cBut what interests me more about what you said is that you \u2018end up\u2019 with them\u2014what do you think that means?\u201d</p><p>How did the ball even get back in his court? I never saw him coming.</p><p>I look to him for the answer, even though he\u2019s the one who asked the question. He\u2019s still smiling, but there\u2019s something much softer and perceptive in it this time, rather than the usual jest.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know,\u201d I say distantly and then look right at him. \u201cWhy does that have to mean anything anyway?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head subtly, but just looks out in front of him as the cab pulls into the parking lot near the bus station. Andrew\u2019s dad\u2019s 1969 Chevy Chevelle is the only car left in the lot. They must really be into that whole vintage car thing.</p><p>Andrew pays the driver and we get out.</p><p>\u201cHave a good night, man,\u201d he says, waving as the driver pulls away.</p><p>I end up riding to Andrew\u2019s dad\u2019s house mostly in a contemplative quiet, thinking about what he said, but then I let it go when we pull into the driveway of his dad\u2019s immaculate house.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d I say with parted lips as I step out of the car. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of house.\u201d</p><p>His door shuts. \u201cYeah, my dad owns a successful construction and design company,\u201d he says nonchalantly. \u201cCome on, I don\u2019t want to spend too much time here in case Aidan shows up.\u201d</p><p>I walk alongside him down the curved, landscaped walkway leading to the front door of the three-story house. It\u2019s such a rich, immaculate place I just can\u2019t see his particular father living in it. His father just seems more of a simple kind of man and not one to be as materialistic as my mother.</p><p>Mom would faint in something like this.</p><p>Andrew thumbs through his keys and pushes the right one into the door lock.</p><p>It clicks open.</p><p>\u201cNot to be nosey, but why would your dad want to live in a house this big?\u201d</p><p>The foyer smells like cinnamon potpourri.</p><p>\u201cNah, this was his ex-wife\u2019s doing, not his.\u201d I follow him straight to the white-carpeted staircase. \u201cShe was a nice woman\u2014Linda, the woman he mentioned at the hospital\u2014but she couldn\u2019t deal with Dad and I can\u2019t blame her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to tell me she married him for his money.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shakes his head as he leads me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was nothing like that\u2014my dad is just a difficult man to live with.\u201d He slips his keys down into his front right jeans pocket.</p><p>I steal a quick glance of his butt in those jeans as he pads up the stairs in front of me. I bite my bottom lip and then mentally kick myself.</p><p>\u201cThis is my room.\u201d We enter the first bedroom on the left. It\u2019s fairly empty; looks more like a storage room with a few boxes piled neatly against one taupe-colored wall, some exercise equipment and a weird-looking Native American statue pushed into the far corner and partially wrapped in plastic. Andrew moves across the space to the walk-in closet and flips a light switch inside. I stay near the center of the room, arms crossed, looking around and trying to not to look like I\u2019m snooping.</p><p>\u201cYou say \u2018is\u2019 your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says from inside the closet, \u201cfor when I visit, or if I ever want to live here.\u201d</p><p>I walk closer to the closet to see him sifting through clothes hanging much how I hang mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re OCD, too, I see.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me questioningly.</p><p>I point to the clothes hung by color and on matching black plastic hangers.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, definitely not,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cDad\u2019s housekeeper comes in here and does this shit. I could care less that my clothes are hung up at all, much less by color\u2014that\u2019s too...wait\u2014.\u201d He pulls away from the shirts and looks at me in a sidelong glance. \u201cYou do this to your clothes?\u201d He points his finger horizontally at the shirts and moves it back and forth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, but I feel weird admitting it to him, \u201cI like my stuff neat and everything has to have a place.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and goes back to sifting through the shirts. Without really looking at them much, he yanks a few shirts and pairs of jeans from the hangers and throws them over his arm.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that stressful?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Hanging my clothes up neatly?\u201d</p> <p>He smiles and shoves the small mound of clothes into my arms.</p><p>I look down at them awkwardly and back up at him.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he says and points behind me in the room. \u201cCan you put those in that duffle bag hanging from the workout bench?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say and carry them over.</p><p>First I set them down on the black vinyl bench and then grab the duffle bag hanging from the weights.</p> <p>\u201cSo, where are we going to go first?\u201d I ask, folding the shirt on top of the pile.</p><p>He\u2019s still rummaging through the closet.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he says from inside; his voice is kind of muffled, \u201cno outlines, Camryn. We\u2019re just going to get into the car and drive. No maps or plans or\u2014.\u201d He\u2019s popped his head out of the closet and his voice is clearer. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I look up, the second shirt from the pile already in a half-fold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m folding them for you.\u201d</p><p>I hear a thump-thump as he drops a pair of black running shoes on the floor and emerges from the closet towards me. When he makes it over, he looks at me like I\u2019ve done something wrong and takes the half-folded shirt from my hands.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so perfect, babe; just shove them in the bag.\u201d</p><p>He does it for me as if to show me how easy it is.</p><p>I don\u2019t know which has my attention more: his lesson in disorganization, or why my stomach flip-flopped when he called me \u2018babe\u2019.</p><p>I shrug and let him have his way with his clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat you wear really doesn\u2019t matter much,\u201d he says, walking back to the closet. \u201cAll that matters is where you\u2019re going and what you\u2019re doing while you\u2019re wearing it.\u201d</p><p>He tosses the black running shoes to me, one at a time, and I catch them. \u201cShove those in there, too, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>I do exactly what he says, literally shoving them inside the bag and I cringe while doing it. Good thing the bottoms of the shoes look like they\u2019ve never been worn, otherwise I would\u2019ve had to protest.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I find sexy in a girl?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s standing with one muscular arm raised high above his head as he searches through some boxes on the top shelf of the closet. I can see the very end of that tattoo he has down his left side, peeking just at the edge of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cUmmm, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d I say. \u201cGirls who wear wrinkled clothes?\u201d I scrunch up my nose.</p><p>\u201cGirls who just get up and throw something on,\u201d he answers and takes down a shoe box.</p><p>He walks back out with it perched on the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThat just-got-up-and-don\u2019t-give-a-shit look is sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re one of those guys who despise makeup and perfume and all that stuff that makes girls, girls.\u201d</p><p>He hands me the shoebox and just like with the clothes, I look down at it with vague question.</p><p>Andrew smiles. \u201cNah, I don\u2019t hate it, I just think simple is sexy, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do with this?\u201d</p><p>I pat the top of the shoe box with my finger.</p><p>\u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at it, uncertain, and back up at him. He nods once to urge me.</p><p>I lift the red top off the box and stare down at a bunch of CD\u2019s in their original jewel cases.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was too lazy to put an MP3 player in his car,\u201d he begins, \u201cand when traveling you can\u2019t always get the best radio reception\u2014sometimes you can\u2019t find a decent station at all.\u201d</p><p>He takes the shoebox top from my hand.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be our official playlist.\u201d He smiles hugely, revealing all of his straight, white teeth.</p><p>Me, not so much. I grimace and scrunch up one side of my mouth sourly.</p><p>Everything is here, all of the bands he mentioned when I met him on the bus and several others I\u2019ve never heard of. I\u2019m pretty confident that I\u2019ve heard ninety-percent of the music I\u2019m staring at at one time or another being around my parents. But if anyone were to ask me the name of this or that song, or what album it\u2019s from, or what band sings it, I probably wouldn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say sarcastically, frown-smiling at him with a wrinkled nose.</p><p>His smile just gets bigger. I think he loves torturing me.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>14</p><p>SHE\u2019S CUTE WHEN I\u2019M torturing her. Because she enjoys it.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how I got myself into this, but I do know that as much as my conscience is ripping into my f**king ears, telling me to leave her alone, I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to.</p><p>We\u2019ve already gone too far.</p><p>I know I should\u2019ve left it at the bus station, bought her a First Class plane ticket home so she would feel obligated to use it since it cost so much, then call her a cab and had it drop her off at the airport.</p><p>I should never have let her leave with me, because now, I know that I won\u2019t be able to let her go. I have to show her first. It\u2019s mandatory now. I have to show her everything. She might get hurt in the end after all is said and done, but at least she\u2019ll be able to go back home to North Carolina with something more to look forward to in her life.</p><p>I take the shoebox from her hands and place the top back over it and set it on top of the opened duffle bag. She watches me as I throw open the top dresser drawer and fish out a few clean pairs of boxers and socks and then shove them down inside the bag, too. All of my basic hygiene necessities are in the bag out in the car that I brought on the bus with me.</p><p>I hoist the duffle bag strap over my shoulder and look at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cWait, you guess?\u201d I ask, stepping up to her. \u201cYou either are, or you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She smiles up at me with those beautiful crystal blue eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m definitely ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, but why the hesitation?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head softly to say I\u2019m wrong.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely no hesitation,\u201d she says. \u201cAll of this is just...strange, you know? But in a good way.\u201d</p><p>She looks like she\u2019s trying to untangle something in her head. Obviously, she\u2019s got a lot on her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say. \u201cIt is kind of strange\u2014OK, it\u2019s a lot strange because it\u2019s not natural, stepping out of the box like this.\u201d I peer in at her, forcing her to catch my eyes. \u201cBut that\u2019s the whole point.\u201d</p><p>Her smile brightens as though my words rang a little bell inside her mind.</p><p>She nods and says with a fun and eager air, \u201cWell, then what are we waiting for?\u201d</p><p>We walk back out into the hall and just before we start to head down the stairs, I stop.</p><p>\u201cWait one second.\u201d</p><p>She waits there at the top of the stairs and I turn back, passing my bedroom and head toward Aidan\u2019s. His room is as pathetic as mine. I see his acoustic guitar sitting propped against the far wall and I walk over and grab it by the neck and carry it out.</p><p>\u201cYou play guitar?\u201d Camryn asks as I lead her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I play some.\u201d</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>ANDREW CHUCKS HIS BAG in the backseat with his smaller bag and mine and my purse. He\u2019s a little more careful with the guitar, though, laying it neatly across the seat. We hop inside the vintage black car (with two white racing stripes down the center of the hood) and shut our doors at the same time.</p><p>He looks over at me.</p><p>I look over at him.</p><p>He thrusts the key in the ignition and the Chevelle roars to life.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m not afraid or worried or feel like I should stop this right now and just go home. Everything about it feels right; for the first time in a very long time, I feel like my life is back on track again, except on a very different sort of road, one in which I have no idea where it\u2019s going. I can\u2019t explain it...except that, well, like I said: it feels right.</p><p>Andrew punches the gas once we hit the entrance ramp and get on 87 going south.</p><p>I kind of like watching him drive, how he\u2019s so casual even when he speeds past a few slow drivers. It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s trying to show off as he\u2019s weaving between cars; it just looks like second-nature to him. I catch myself getting a glimpse every now and then of his muscled right arm as his hand grips the steering wheel. And as my eyes carefully scan the rest of him, I go right back to wondering about that tattoo hidden underneath that navy t-shirt which fits him so well.</p><p>We talk about whatever for a while; about that guitar being Aidan\u2019s and that Aidan will probably blow up if he finds out that Andrew took it. Andrew doesn\u2019t care. \u201cHe stole my socks once,\u201d Andrew said.</p><p>\u201cYour socks?\u201d I said back with a rather screwed-up expression. And he looked over at me with an expression that read: hey; socks, guitars, deodorant\u2014a possession is a possession.</p><p>I just laughed, still finding it ridiculous, but easily letting him slide.</p><p>We also got into a really deep conversation about the mystery of the single shoes that lie on the side of the freeways all across the United States.</p><p>\u201cGirlfriend got pissed and tossed her boyfriend\u2019s shit out the window,\u201d Andrew had said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s a possibility,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I think a lot of them belong to hitchhikers, because most of them are raggedy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over at me awkwardly, as if waiting for the rest.</p><p>\u201cHitchhikers?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, \u201cWell yeah, they do a lot of walking so I imagine their shoes get worn out fast. They\u2019re walking along, their feet are hurting and they see a shoe\u2014probably one of those tossed out by that angry girlfriend (I point at him to include his theory)\u2014and seeing that it\u2019s in better shape than the ones on his feet, he trades one out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d Andrew says.</p><p>My mouth parts with a spat of offended air. \u201cIt could happen!\u201d I laugh and reach over and smack him on the arm. He just smiles at me.</p><p>And we went on and on about it, each of us coming up with an even stupider theory than the one before.</p><p>I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed this much.</p><p>We finally make it back into Denver nearly two hours later. It\u2019s such a beautiful city with the vast mountains in the background that look like white clouds at their peaks, sprawled across the bright blue horizon. It\u2019s still pretty early in the day and the sun is shining full-force.</p><p>When we make it into the heart of the city, Andrew slows the car to a forty mile per hour crawl.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell me which way,\u201d he says as we coast toward another entrance ramp.</p><p>He looks in three directions and then over at me.</p><p>Caught off-guard, my eyes dart around at each route and the closer we get to having to make a decision on which way to turn, the slower he drives.</p><p>Thirty-five miles per hour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d he asks with sparkling bright green eyes flecked by a little bit of taunt.</p><p>I\u2019m so nervous!

Move out of the way a**hole!</p><p>It all just rolls off Andrew\u2019s back and he never stops smiling.</p><p>\u201cThat way!\u201d I finally yell, throwing my hand up and pointing to the east ramp. I squeal out laughter and slide my back down further against the seat so that no one else can see me, I\u2019m so embarrassed.</p> <p>Andrew flips his left blinker on and slides over into the left lane with ease, in-between two other cars. We make it through the yellow light just before it turns red and in seconds we\u2019re on another freeway and Andrew is pressing on the gas. I have no idea which direction we\u2019re traveling, only that we\u2019re going east, but where it leads exactly is still up in the air.</p><p>\u201cNow that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d he says, glancing over at me with a grin.</p><p>\u201cKind of exhilarating,\u201d I say and then let out a sharp laugh. \u201cYou really pissed those people off.\u201d</p><p>He brushes it off with a shrug. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in too much of a hurry. God forbid you drive the speed limit or you might get lynched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo true,\u201d I say and look out ahead through the windshield. \u201cThough I have to come clean\u2014I\u2019m usually one of them.\u201d I wince admitting it.</p><p>\u201cYeah, me too sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>Everything gets quiet all of a sudden and it becomes the first quiet moment that the both of us notice. I wonder if he\u2019s thinking the same thing, wondering about me and wanting to ask, just as I\u2019m curious about so much when it comes to him. It\u2019s one of those moments that are inevitable and almost always open the door to the stage where two people really start to get to know each other.</p><p>It\u2019s very different from when we were on the bus together. We thought that our time was limited then and if we were never going to see each other again, there was no reason to get all personal.</p><p>But things have changed and personal is all that\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your best friend, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>I keep my eyes on the road for several long seconds and I\u2019m slow to answer because I\u2019m not sure which part of her I should tell.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s even still your best friend,\u201d he adds, sensing the animosity somehow.</p><p>I look over.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. She\u2019s sort of whipped, for lack of a better explanation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have a better explanation,\u201d he says, putting his eyes back on the road. \u201cMaybe you just don\u2019t want to explain it.\u201d</p><p>I make a decision.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do want to explain it, actually.\u201d</p><p>He looks pleased, but keeps it at a respectful level.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known her since second grade,\u201d I begin, \u201cand I didn\u2019t think anything could break up our friendship, but I was so wrong about that.\u201d I shake my head, disgusted just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe chose her boyfriend over me.\u201d</p><p>I think he expected more of an explanation and I intended to give him more, but it just came out the way it did.</p><p>\u201cDid you make her choose?\u201d he asks with a subtly raised brow.</p><p>I turn around to look at him. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t like that at all.\u201d I sigh long and heavily. \u201cDamon\u2014her boyfriend\u2014got me alone one night and tried to kiss me and tell me he wanted me. Next thing I know, Natalie is calling me a lying bitch and says she never wants to see me again.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nods one of those long, hard nods that show he completely understands now.</p><p>\u201cAn insecure girl,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s probably been with him for a long time, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, about five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this best friend of yours, she believes you, right?\u201d</p><p>I gaze over at him confusedly.</p><p>He nods. \u201cShe does; think about it, she\u2019s known you practically all her life. Do you really think she\u2019d just toss away a friendship like that because she didn\u2019t believe you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still confused.</p><p>\u201cBut she did,\u201d I say simply. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s just a reaction, Camryn. She doesn\u2019t want to believe it, but not so very far down, she knows it\u2019s true. She just needs time to think on it and to see it for what it is. She\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, by the time she does, I might not want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so,\u201d he says and flips on his right blinker and switches lanes, \u201cbut I don\u2019t take you for the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnforgiving?\u201d I say.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>We speed past a crawling semi and move around in front of it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, unsure myself anymore, \u201cI\u2019m not like I used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you used to be?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure about that, either. It takes me a second to find a way around mentioning Ian. \u201cI used to be fun and outgoing and I...,\u201d I laugh suddenly as the memory tickles my mind, \u201c...and I used to run nak*d into a freezing lake every winter.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s whole beautiful face twists into a curious, energized smile. \u201cWow,\u201d he says, \u201cI can just picture it....\u201d</p><p>I smack him on the arm again. Always smiling. He pretends it stings, but I know better.</p><p>\u201cIt was a fundraiser for the hospital in my town,\u201d I say, \u201cand they put it on every year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d He looks thoroughly confused aside from grinning thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, not fully nak*d,\u201d I say, \u201cbut in a tank top and shorts in freezing water, you might as well be nak*d.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, I should sign up for hospital fundraisers when I get home,\u201d he says, hitting the steering wheel once. \u201cDidn\u2019t know what I was missing out on.\u201d</p><p>He tames the smile a little and looks back at me. \u201cSo why is that something you used to do?\u201d</p><p>Because Ian was the one who talked me into it and who I did it with for two years.</p><p>\u201cI just stopped about a year ago\u2014just one of those things you fall out of.\u201d</p><p>I get the feeling he doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s not more to it than that, so I jump onto something else to distract from it.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask, turning around at the waist to give him my full attention. \u201cWhat\u2019s something crazy that you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>Andrew purses his lips in thought, looking out at the road. We pass another semi and get around in front of it. The traffic is thinning out the farther away from the city we drive.</p><p>\u201cI hood-surfed once\u2014not so much crazy as it was stupid, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s pretty stupid.\u201d</p><p>He reaches his left hand up and puts the underside of his wrist into view. \u201cI fell off the damn thing and sliced my wrist open on no telling what.\u201d I peer in at the two-inch scar running along the skin from the bottom of the thumb bone and onto his arm. \u201cI rolled across the road. Cracked my head open.\u201d He points to the back right side of his head. \u201cGot nine stitches there in addition to the sixteen on my wrist. I\u2019ll never do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I would hope not,\u201d I say sternly, still trying to see the scar through his brown hair.</p><p>He switches hands on the steering wheel and takes a hold of my wrist, sliding his index finger over the length of the top of mine so he can use his as a guide.</p><p>I pull closer, letting his hand guide mine.</p><p>\u201cRight about...there,\u201d he says when he finds it. \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d</p><p>His hand falls away from mine, but I watch it for a moment.</p><p>Coming back to the issue of his head, I look up and run the tip of my finger along an obvious uneven smooth strip of skin on his scalp and then I part his short hair away with my fingers. The scar is about an inch long. I run my finger over it one more time and reluctantly pull away.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you have a lot of scars,\u201d I say.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cNot too many; got one on my back from when Aidan clipped me with a bicycle chain, swingin\u2019 it around like a whip (I wince, gritting my teeth). And when I was twelve, had Asher riding on the handlebars of my bike. Hit a rock. Bike flipped forward and sent us both skidding across the concrete.\u201d He points to his nose. \u201cBroke my nose, but Asher broke an arm and had fourteen stitches on his elbow. Mom thought we\u2019d been in a car wreck and were just lying about it to cover our asses.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still looking at his perfectly shaped nose; don\u2019t see any evidence that it had ever been broken before.</p><p>\u201cGot a weird L-shaped scar on my inner thigh,\u201d he goes on and points to the general area. \u201cNot gonna show you that one though.\u201d He grins and puts both hands on the wheel.</p><p>I blush, because it really took me all of two seconds to start envisioning him dropping his pants to show me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing,\u201d I laugh and then lean up toward the dashboard so I can pull my babydoll Smurfette shirt up just over my hip. I catch his eyes on me and it does something to my stomach, but I ignore that. \u201cCamping one year,\u201d I say, \u201cjumped off these bluffs into the water and hit a rock\u2014I almost drowned.\u201d</p><p>Andrew frowns and reaches over, tracing the edges of the small scar on my hipbone. A shiver runs up my spine and through the back of my neck like something freezing racing through my blood.</p><p>I ignore that too, as much as I can.</p><p>I let my shirt fall back over my hip and I lean back against the seat.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t drown.\u201d His eyes warm up with his face.</p><p>I smile back at him. \u201cYeah, that would\u2019ve sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>I WAKE UP AFTER dark when Andrew slows down through a toll. I don\u2019t know how long I slept, but I feel like I got a full night in, despite being curled up in the corner of the passenger\u2019s seat with my head against the door. I should be trying to rub out a couple of stiff muscles like when I rode on the bus, but I feel good.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I ask, cupping my hand over my mouth to cover the yawn.</p><p>\u201cMiddle of nowhere Wellington, Kansas,\u201d he says. \u201cYou slept a long time.\u201d</p><p>I rise up the rest of the way and let my eyes and body adjust to being awake again. Andrew pulls onto another road.</p><p>\u201cI guess I did, better than I slept on the bus the entire trip from North Carolina to Wyoming.\u201d</p><p>I look at the glowing blue letters on the car stereo: 10:14 p.m. A song is funneling low from the speakers. It makes me think of when I met him back on the bus. I smile to myself feeling like he made sure to keep it at a low level in the car while I slept.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask, turning around to see him, the darkness casting his face in partial shadow. \u201cI feel weird offering because it\u2019s your dad\u2019s car, but I\u2019m good to drive if you need me to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah, you shouldn\u2019t feel weird,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a car. A precious antique that my dad would string your ass up from a ceiling fan for if he ever knew you were behind the wheel, but I would totally let you drive it.\u201d Even in the shadow, I see the right side of his mouth pull into a devious grin.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not so sure I want to anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying, remember? What\u2019s he gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Andrew.\u201d</p> <p>He knows it\u2019s not. I\u2019m fully aware of the game he\u2019s playing with himself, always looking for anything to help him cope with what\u2019s going on but coming up short. I just wonder how much longer he\u2019ll be able to keep this up. The misplaced jokes will eventually run dry and he\u2019s not going to know what to do with himself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stop at the next motel,\u201d he says, turning onto another road. \u201cI\u2019ll get some shut-eye there.\u201d</p><p>Then he glances over at me. \u201cSeparate rooms, of course.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m glad he had that part sorted out so fast. I may be driving awkwardly across the U.S. alone with him, but I don\u2019t think I can share a room with him, too.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I say, stretching my arms out in front of me with my fingers locked. \u201cI need a shower and to brush my teeth for about an hour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo arguments there,\u201d he jokes.</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re breath isn\u2019t all that great, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it,\u201d he says, cupping one hand over his mouth and breathing sharply into it. \u201cIt smells like I ate that horrid shit casserole my aunt makes for Thanksgiving every year.\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud.</p><p>\u201cBad choice of words,\u201d I say. \u201cShit casserole? Really?\u201d I mentally gag.</p><p>Andrew laughs, too.</p> <p>\u201cHell, it might as well be\u2014I love my Aunt Deana, but the woman was not blessed with the ability to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must suck,\u201d he says, glancing over. \u201cGrowing up on Ramen noodles and Hot Pockets.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo, I taught myself how to cook\u2014I don\u2019t eat unhealthy food, remember?\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s smiling face is lit up by a soft gray light pouring from the light posts along the street.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right,\u201d he says, \u201cno bloody burgers or greasy fries for little Miss Rice Cakes.\u201d</p><p>I make a bleh! face, disputing his rice cake theory.</p><p>Minutes later we\u2019re pulling into a small two-floor motel parking lot; the kind with rooms that open up outside instead of an inside hallway. We get out and stretch our legs\u2014Andrew stretches legs, arms, his neck, pretty much everything\u2014and we grab our bags from the backseat. He leaves the guitar.</p> <p>\u201cLock the door,\u201d he says, pointing.</p><p>We enter the lobby to the smell of dusty vacuum cleaner bags and coffee.</p><p>\u201cTwo singles side by side if you\u2019ve got them,\u201d Andrew says, whipping out his wallet from his back pocket.</p><p>I swing my purse around in front of me and reach in for my little zipper wallet. \u201cI can pay for my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously, let me pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, no, alright, so just put your money away.\u201d</p><p>I do, reluctantly.</p><p>The middle-aged woman with graying blonde hair pulled into a sloppy bun at the back of her head looks at us blankly. She goes back to tapping on her keyboard to see what rooms are available.</p><p>\u201cSmoking or non-smoking?\u201d she asks, looking at Andrew.</p><p>I notice her eyes slip down the length of his muscled arms as he fishes for his credit card.</p><p>\u201cNon-smoking.\u201d</p><p>Tap, tap, tap. Click, click, click. Back and forth between the keyboard and the mouse.</p><p>\u201cThe only singles I have right next to each other are one smoking and one non-smoking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take them,\u201d he says, handing her a card.</p><p>She pulls it from between his fingers and all the while she watches every little move his hand makes until it falls away from her eyes down behind the counter.</p><p>Slut.</p><p>After we pay and get our room keys, we head back outside and to the car where Andrew grabs the guitar from the back seat.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve asked before we got here,\u201d he says as I follow alongside him, \u201cbut if you\u2019re hungry I can run up the street and get you something if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He looks over at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not hungry at all, but if I do get hungry I can just get something from the vending machine.\u201d</p><p>He slides the keycard into the first door and a green light appears. He clicks open the door afterwards.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing but sugar and fat in those things,\u201d he says, recalling our earlier conversations about junk food.</p><p>We walk into the fairly dull-looking room with a single bed pressed against a wood headboard mounted behind it on the wall. The bedspread is brown and ugly and scares the crap out of me. The room itself smells clean and looks decent enough, but I have never slept in any motel without stripping the bed of the bedspread first. There\u2019s no telling what\u2019s living on them, or when the last time was they were washed.</p><p>Andrew inhales deeply, getting a good whiff of the room.</p><p>\u201cThis is the non-smoking room,\u201d he says, looking around as if inspecting it first. \u201cThis one\u2019s yours.\u201d He sets the guitar down against the wall and walks into the small bathroom, flips on the light, tests out the fan and then goes over to the window on the other side of the bed and tests the air conditioner\u2014it is the middle of July, after all. Then he goes to the bed and carefully pulls back the comforter and examines the sheets and pillows.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you lookin\u2019 for?\u201d</p><p>He says without looking at me, \u201cMaking sure it\u2019s clean; I don\u2019t want you sleeping in any funky shit.\u201d</p><p>I blush hard and turn away before he can see it.</p><p>\u201cKind of early for bed,\u201d he says, stepping away from the bed and taking up the guitar again, \u201cbut the drive did take a lot out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, technically you haven\u2019t slept since before we got off the bus back in Cheyenne.\u201d</p><p>I drop my purse and bag down on the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d he says. \u201cSo that means I\u2019ve been up for about eighteen hours. Damn, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExhaustion will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>He walks to the door and places his hand on the silver lever, clicking it open again. I just stand here at the foot of the bed. It\u2019s an awkward moment, but it doesn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d he says from the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m right next to you in 110, so just call or knock or bang on the wall if you need me.\u201d There\u2019s only kindness and sincerity in his face.</p><p>I nod, smiling in answer.</p><p>\u201cWell, goodnight,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNight.\u201d</p><p>And he slips out, shutting the door softly behind him.</p><p>After absently thinking about him for a second, I snap out of it and rummage around inside my bag. This will be the first shower I\u2019ve had in couple of long days. I\u2019m drooling just thinking about it. I yank out a clean pair of panties and my favorite white cotton shorts and varsity babydoll tee with pink and blue stripes around the quarter-sleeves. Then I find my toothbrush, toothpaste and Listerine and head to the bathroom carrying it all with me. I strip down nak*d, happily pulling all of the days-old dirty clothes off and tossing them in a pile on the floor. I stare at myself in the mirror. Oh my God, I\u2019m hideous! My make-up has completely worn off; I barely even have any mascara on anymore. More wandering strands of blonde hair have fallen from my braid and are smashed against one side of my head in a rat\u2019s nest.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m been driving around with Andrew looking like this.</p><p>I reach up and pull the hairband from the braid to release the rest of the hair and then run my fingers through it to break it all apart. I brush my teeth first and leave my mouth full of mint Listerine long until after the burning has already stopped.</p><p>The shower is like heaven. I stay in it forever, letting the semi-scalding hot water beat on me until I can\u2019t take it anymore and the heat starts to lull me to sleep standing up. I clean everything. Twice. Just because I can and because it\u2019s been so damn long. Lastly I shave, glad to get rid of that gross wig I was starting to grow on my legs. And finally, I turn off the squeaky faucets and go for the white motel towel folded OCD-like on a rack over the back of the toilet.</p><p>I hear the shower running in Andrew\u2019s room next door and I catch myself just listening to it. I picture him in there, just showering, nothing sexual or perverted even though something like that wouldn\u2019t be hard to do at all. I just think about him in general, about what we\u2019re doing and why. I think about his dad and it breaks my heart all over again knowing how much Andrew is hurting and how I feel helpless to do anything for him. Finally, I force myself back into me and into my life and my issues, which really have nothing on Andrew\u2019s.</p><p>I hope it never comes down to me being forced to tell him my problems and all of the things that led me on that road-to-nowhere bus trip, because I will feel so stupid and selfish. My problems are nothing compared to his.</p><p>I get into bed with wet hair, combing it out with my fingers. I turn on the TV\u2014not tired at all since I just slept most of the way from Denver\u2014and flip through the channels, eventually leaving it on some random movie with Jet Li. But it\u2019s more for background noise than anything.</p><p>Mom called four times and left four messages.</p><p>Still nothing from Natalie.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing in Virginia?\u201d my mom says into my ear. \u201cHaving loads of fun, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s been great. How are you?\u201d</p><p>My mom giggles on the other end of the phone and instinctively it repels me. There\u2019s a man with her. Oh gross, I hope she\u2019s not talking to me in bed, nak*d, with some guy licking her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been good, baby,\u201d she says. \u201cStill seeing Roger\u2014going on that cruise next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, Mom.\u201d</p><p>She giggles again.</p><p>I scrunch up my nose.</p><p>\u201cWell, baby, I need to go (Stop it, Roger).\u201d She giggles again. I\u2019m going to throw up in my mouth. \u201cI just wanted to know how you were doing. Please call me tomorrow sometime and give me an update, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, Mom, I will. Love you.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I let the phone fall on the bed in front of me. Then I fall back against my pillows, instantly thinking about Andrew being in the room next door. He may be leaning his head against the same wall. I flip through the channels some more until I\u2019ve been through every one of them at least five times and then just give up.</p><p>I slump down further and look at the room.</p><p>The sound of Andrew playing the guitar pulls me out of myself and I lift my back slowly from the pillows so I can hear it more clearly. It\u2019s a soft tune, kind of something in-between searching and lamentable. And then when the chorus comes around, the speed picks up just a fraction only to lament again for the next verse. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I listen to him play for the next fifteen minutes and then it goes silent. I had turned the TV off when I first heard him and now all that I can hear is a constant drip coming from the bathroom sink and the occasional car driving through the motel parking lot.</p><p>I drift off to sleep and the dream comes back:</p><p>That morning, I didn\u2019t get my usual string of text messages from Ian before I got out of bed. I tried calling his phone, but it rang and rang and the voicemail never picked up. And Ian wasn\u2019t at school when I got there.</p><p>Everybody was staring at me as I walked through the halls. Some couldn\u2019t look me in the eye. Jennifer Parsons burst into tears when I walked past her at her locker, while another group of girls, cheerleaders, turned their noses up at me and eyed me as though I was something contagious. I didn\u2019t know what was going on, but I felt like I had walked into some freaky alternate reality. No one would say a word to me, but it was so damn obvious that everybody in that school knew something that I didn\u2019t. And it was bad. I never really had any enemies, except sometimes a few of the cheerleaders showed jealousy towards me because Ian loved me and wouldn\u2019t give them the time of day. What can I say? Ian Walsh was hotter than the star quarterback and it didn\u2019t matter to anyone, not even Emily Derting, the richest girl in Millbrook High School, that Ian didn\u2019t have much and that his parents still drove him to school.</p> <p>She still wanted him.</p><p>Everybody did.</p><p>I went on to my locker, hoping to see Natalie soon so maybe she could tell me what was going on. I lingered around my locker longer than usual waiting for any sign of her. It was Damon who found me and told me what happened. He pulled me off to the side, in-between the alcove that housed the water fountains. My heart was hammering inside my chest. I knew something was wrong when I got up that morning, even before I realized there were no text messages from Ian. I felt...off. It was like I knew....</p><p>\u201cCamryn,\u201d Damon said and I knew right then the seriousness of what he was about to tell me because he and Natalie always call me \u2018Cam\u2019. \u201cIan was in a car accident last night....\u201d</p><p>I felt my breath catch and both of my hands flew to my mouth. Tears were burning my throat and streaming from my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHe died early this morning at the hospital.\u201d Damon was trying so hard to tell me this, but the pain in his face was unmistakable.</p><p>I just stared at Damon for what felt like an eternity before I couldn\u2019t stand up on my own anymore and I collapsed into his arms. I cried and cried until I made myself sick and finally Natalie found us and they both helped me into the nurse\u2019s office.</p><p>I wake up from the nightmare sweating, my heart racing like mad. I throw the sheet off of me and sit in the center of the bed with my knees drawn up, running my hands across my head and I let out a long sigh. The dream had stopped a long time ago. In fact, it was the last dream I remember having. Why is it back?</p><p>A loud banging on my room door jolts me up.</p><p>\u201cRISE AND SHINE BUTTERCUP!\u201d Andrew says harmoniously from the other side.</p><p>I don\u2019t even remember when I fell back asleep after the dream. The sun is shining through a sliver parted between the curtains, pooling on the tan carpet just below the window. I rise up from the bed and push back the sloppy hair away from my face and go to open the door before he wakes up the whole motel.</p> <p>He\u2019s gawking at me when I open the door.</p><p>\u201cDamn girl,\u201d he says, looking me over, \u201cwhat the hell are you trying to do to me?\u201d</p><p>I look down at myself, still trying to wake up the rest of the way and realize I\u2019m in those tiny cotton white shorts and varsity tee with no bra on underneath. Oh my God, my n**ples are like beacons shining through my shirt! I cross my arms over my chest and try not to look him in the eyes when he helps himself the rest of the way inside.</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you to get dressed,\u201d he goes on, grinning as he walks into the room carrying his bags and the guitar, \u201cbut really, you can go just like that if you want.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, hiding the smile creeping up on my face.</p><p>He plops down on the chair by the window and sets his stuff on the floor. He\u2019s wearing a pair of tan cargo shorts that drop just past his knees, a plain dark gray t-shirt and those low black running shoes with no-show socks, or no socks at all. I glimpse the tattoo on his ankle; looks like some kind of circular-shaped Celtic design positioned right over his ankle bone. And he definitely has runner\u2019s legs; his calves are bulging with tight muscles.</p><p>\u201cWait there and I\u2019ll get ready,\u201d I say, going toward my bag sitting on the elongated dresser where the TV sits on the opposite end.</p><p>\u201cHow long will this take?\u201d he asks and I detect a hint of interrogation in his voice.</p> <p>Remembering what he said back at his dad\u2019s house, I think about my answer first and weigh my options: my usual thirty-minute prep time, or cave to a throw-it-on-and-go?</p><p>He helps me out with the dilemma:</p><p>\u201cYou have two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes?\u201d I argue.</p><p>He nods, grinning. \u201cYou heard me. Two minutes.\u201d He holds up two wriggling fingers. \u201cYou agreed to do whatever I said, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I thought it was going to be crazy stuff like mooning someone from a moving car or eating bugs.\u201d</p><p>One of his brows rises and he draws back his chin as if I just slapped two ideas into his lap. \u201cIn time you will moon someone from a moving car and eat a bug\u2014we\u2019ll get to that.\u201d</p><p>What the hell just I just do?</p><p>My head rolls backward in dispute and mortification and my hands fly to my hips. \u201cUh, there is no way\u2014.\u201d I notice his grin has changed into something more \u2018crafty school boy\u2019 and I look down, realizing my arms are no longer covering my n**ples poking so proudly through the thin fabric of my shirt. I let out a spat of air and my mouth falls open. \u201cAndrew!\u201d</p><p>He lowers his head with false shame, but it just makes him appear more devious the way he looks back up under hooded eyes at me.</p><p>He is so f**king hot....</p><p>\u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who\u2019d rather complain about the ground rules than protect your girls from my eyes\u2014I should warn you they have a mind of their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet they aren\u2019t the only things on you with a mind of their own.\u201d I smirk and grab my bag, shuffling my way barefooted into the bathroom and shutting the door.</p><p>I\u2019m smiling like one of those 1980\u2019s cheesy portrait studio photos when I look at myself in the mirror.</p><p>OK, two minutes. I literally dive into my bra and tight jeans, jumping up and down to get them to slide over my butt. Zip. Button. Brush teeth thoroughly. A quick shot of Listerine. Swish. Gargle. Spit. Comb out raggedy hair and twist it into a sloppy braid over my right shoulder. A little bit of foundation and a light layer of powder. Black mascara, because mascara is the most important piece of makeup in the arsenal. Lipsti\u2014</p><p>BAM! BAM! BAM!</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re two minutes are up!\u201d</p><p>I smooth the lipstick on anyway and blot with a square of toilet paper.</p><p>I can tell he\u2019s smiling on the other side of the bathroom door and when I open it a second later, I see that I was right. He stands with both arms raised above his head, propped on the doorjamb. His hard, six-pack is partially visible with his shirt raised up high with his arms. A little happy trail moves from just below his bellybutton and down beneath the waist of his shorts.</p><p>\u201cSee? Look at you?\u201d He whistles while blocking the door, but I\u2019m definitely not the one of us I\u2019m looking at. \u201cSimple is sexy.\u201d</p><p>I push my way past him, finding the perfect opportunity to press my palms against his chest and he lets me pass.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know I was trying to be sexy for you,\u201d I say with my back turned, throwing the clothes I slept in inside my bag.</p><p>\u201cWow, look at that,\u201d he goes on, \u201csimple, sexy and disorganized\u2014I\u2019m proud!\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even realize it. I just shoved my clothes into the bag without even thinking of trying to be neat about it. I\u2019m not \u2018clinically\u2019 OCD; I\u2019m just one of those people who claim the acronym because of a few methodical habits. Still, folding my clothes and trying to be neat is something I\u2019ve always done since I was like eleven.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>16</p><p>TALK ABOUT EARLY MORNING sexual frustration. Alright, I\u2019m going to have to take it down a notch with her or she\u2019ll start to think that\u2019s really what I\u2019m hanging around for. Any other time, with some other random girl, I would\u2019ve already gotten out of bed to toss the condom in the toilet, but with Camryn, it\u2019s different. It\u2019s hard (pun intended), but I\u2019m going to have to try laying off the flirting. This is an important trip, for both of us. I only have one shot to get this right and I\u2019ll be damned if I f**k it up.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next on our spontaneous trip?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast first,\u201d I say, grabbing my bags from the floor, \u201cbut I guess it wouldn\u2019t be spontaneous if I had a plan in place.\u201d</p><p>She grabs her cell phone from the table beside the bed, checks it for new text messages and phone calls and then tosses it in her purse.</p><p>We head out.</p><p>Enter stubborn, whiney Camryn:</p><p>\u201cPlease, Andrew; I can\u2019t eat at those places,\u201d she says from the passenger\u2019s seat.</p><p>The town is small and most of the food joints are fast food or not open this early.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d she says with a cute pouty face I just want to cup in my hands and lick so she shrieks and pretends it\u2019s the grossest thing ever. \u201cUnless you want an annoying road trip companion, holding her nauseous stomach and moaning for the next hour, you won\u2019t make me eat that stuff, especially this early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I draw my head back and press my lips together looking over at her. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s not.</p><p>She shakes her head and props her elbow on the car door and then rests her thumb between her front teeth.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m serious; every time I eat fast food I get sick. I\u2019m not trying to be difficult, believe me, it creates a problem whenever I go anywhere with my mom or Natalie. They have to go out of their way to find a place to eat that won\u2019t make me miserable.\u201d</p><p>OK, so she\u2019s telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cAlright, well I definitely don\u2019t want to make you sick,\u201d I laugh lightly, \u201cso we\u2019ll drive a little farther and find something else along the way. More places will be open in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiles sweetly.</p><p>You\u2019re very welcome....</p><p>Two and a half hours later, we\u2019re in Owasso, Oklahoma.</p><p>Camryn looks up at the big yellow and black restaurant logo and I think she\u2019s debating whether she wants to eat here, or not.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s really only one place to eat breakfast,\u201d I say, pulling into a parking space, \u201cespecially across the South\u2014kind of like Starbucks, there\u2019s a Waffle House on every corner.\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cI think I can handle this\u2014do they have salad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look, I agreed not to make you eat the fast grease,\u201d I tilt my head to one side and turn at the waist on the seat, \u201cbut I draw the line with salads.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She puckers her lips and chews on the inside of her mouth and then says, nodding, \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t eat a salad, even though salads can come with chicken and all sorts of good stuff that someone like you probably never thought of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. So just give it up,\u201d I say resolutely and then gently jerk my head back in gesture. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ve waited long enough to eat. I\u2019m starving. And I get grumpy when I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already grumpy,\u201d she mumbles.</p><p>I grab her arm and pull her next to me. She tries to hide her blushing face.</p> <p>I love the smell of Waffle House; it\u2019s the smell of freedom, being on the open road and knowing that ninety percent of the people eating around you are also on that road. Truck driver\u2019s, road-trippers, hangovers\u2014those who don\u2019t live that monotonous life of society slavery.</p><p>The restaurant is nearly full. Camryn and I get a booth close to the grill farthest away from any of the tall windows. A mandatory jukebox\u2014symbolic of Waffle House culture\u2014sits against one of those windows.</p><p>The waitress greets us with a smile, standing with a notepad resting in one hand, and a pen ready to write with the tip poking the paper in the other. \u201cCan I get you some coffee?\u201d</p><p>I look up at Camryn, who\u2019s already scanning over the menu on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a glass of sweet tea,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The waitress jots that down and looks back at me.</p><p>\u201cCoffee.\u201d</p><p>She nods and goes to make our drinks.</p><p>\u201cSome of this stuff looks good,\u201d Camryn says peering down at the menu with one cheek propped on the top of her folded hand. Her index finger slides over the plastic and lands on the tiny salad section. \u201cSee, look,\u201d she glances up at me, \u201cthey have Grilled Chicken Salad and Chicken Apple Pecan Salad.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t resist that hopeful look in her wide blue eyes.</p><p>I cave. Totally f**king cave.</p> <p>\u201cOrder whatever you want,\u201d I say with a warm expression. \u201cReally, I won\u2019t hold it against you.\u201d</p><p>She blinks twice, mildly stunned I gave in so easily and then her eyes seem to smile back at me. She closes the menu and places it back on the menu holder above the table as the waitress returns with our drinks.</p><p>\u201cReady to order?\u201d the waitress asks after placing our drinks in front of us. The tip of her pen, as if it never really leaves that spot, is still pressed against the notepad waiting to be put to work.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the Fiesta Omelet,\u201d Camryn says and I catch a small grin in her face as her eyes skirt mine.</p><p>\u201cToast or biscuit?\u201d the waitress asks.</p><p>\u201cBiscuit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrits, hash browns or tomatoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHash browns.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress jots the last of Camryn\u2019s order down and turns to me.</p><p>I pause for a second and then say, \u201cI\u2019ll have the Chicken Apple Pecan Salad.\u201d</p><p>Camryn\u2019s grin shuts down immediately and her face just freezes like that. I wink at her and slide the menu behind hers.</p><p>\u201cLivin\u2019 on the edge, huh?\u201d the waitress says.</p><p>She rips off the top ticket.</p><p>\u201cFor today,\u201d I tell her and she shakes her head and walks away.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Camryn says holding her hands out, palms up. She can\u2019t decide whether to smile or look at me awkwardly, so she ends up doing a little of both.</p><p>\u201cI figure if you\u2019re willing to eat something for my sake, then I can do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I just don\u2019t see that salad doing it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d I say, \u201cbut fair is fair.\u201d</p><p>She scoffs lightly and leans her back against the booth seat. \u201cIt won\u2019t be so fair if I\u2019m listening to you complain about being hungry when we get back on the road\u2014you said yourself that you\u2019re grumpy when you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t really be grumpy towards her, but she\u2019s right: the salad\u2019s not going to do it for me. And lettuce gives me gas\u2014she\u2019ll definitely hate riding in the car with me if I eat this shit. But I can do this. I just hope I can eat the whole thing without letting any one of a hundred complaints about it, which are already tap-dancing on the tip of my tongue, give me away.</p><p>This should be interesting.</p><p>Several minutes later, the waitress is bringing Camryn her food and setting my plate of blasphemy down in front of me. She refills our drinks, asks if we need anything else and then goes back to her other customers.</p><p>Camryn is already scrutinizing me.</p><p>She looks down at her plate, arranges the biscuit on the other side of the hash browns and then twists the plate around by its edges to put the omelet in reach. I pick up my fork and poke the salad around a few times, pretending, just like Camryn, to prepare it.</p><p>We look up at each other and pause as if waiting for the other to say something. She purses her lips. I purse mine.</p><p>\u201cWanna trade?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say without hesitation and we\u2019re sliding the food across the table to one another.</p><p>Relief washes over both of our faces.</p><p>It\u2019s not something I would\u2019ve ordered on my own, but it beats lettuce.</p><p>Halfway through the meal\u2014well, halfway for her; I\u2019m done with mine\u2014I\u2019m ordering a slice of chocolate pie and getting another coffee refill. And we go on and on about her ex best friend, Natalie, and how Natalie is some over-the-top bi-sexual with huge boobs. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been getting out of Camryn\u2019s descriptions of her.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened after the restroom incident?\u201d I ask, taking a bite of my pie.</p><p>\u201cI never went in a public restroom with her again after that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe girl has no shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sounds fun,\u201d I say.</p><p>Camryn looks thoughtful. \u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>I study her quietly. She\u2019s lost in some memory, poking her fork at the last piece of chicken in her salad. My fork clinks against the plate as I make a decision and set it down. I wipe my face with my napkin and slide out of the booth.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She looks up at me.</p><p>I just grin and walk away toward the jukebox by the window. I slip the money in and scan the titles, finally choosing one song and pressing the buttons. Raisins In My Toast starts to play as I make my way back.</p><p>All three of the waitresses and the cook eyeball me with glaring, unforgiving looks. I just smile.</p><p>Camryn\u2019s whole body has locked up on the seat. Her back is rigid, the whites of her eyes blaring at me and then when I start mouthing the words to the fifties-sounding song, she slinks way down onto the seat, her face redder than I have ever seen it.</p><p>I slide back into my seat, moving my h*ps all the way down.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Andrew, please don\u2019t sing it!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying my damndest not to laugh, but I just sing along to the lyrics with a giant grin plastered all over my face. She buries her face in her hands, her little shoulders, covered by a thin white shirt bounce up and down as she suppresses her laughter. I snap my fingers in tune with the music as if my hair is greased back and when the high-pitched voice comes on, I mimic it, my face all scrunched up with exaggerated emotion. And I hit the deeper notes, too, dropping my chin toward my chest and looking all serious. I never stop snapping my fingers. The further into the song I go, I start to put a little more emotion into it. And by the middle, Camryn can\u2019t contain herself any longer. She laughs so hard under her breath that her eyes water-up.</p><p>She\u2019s let herself fall so far down onto the seat by now that her chin is almost level with the table\u2019s edge.</p><p>When the song ends\u2014to the relief of the employees\u2014I get one pair of hands clapping for me from the old lady sitting in the booth behind Camryn. Nobody else cares, but by the look on Camryn\u2019s face, you\u2019d think everyone in the restaurant was watching and laughing at us. Hilarious. And she\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s embarrassed.</p><p>I prop my elbows on the table and lay my arms across it, folding my hands together.</p><p>\u201cAh, it wasn\u2019t that bad was it?\u201d I smirk.</p><p>She slides the edge of her finger underneath each of her eyes to wipe off that tiny streak of black that she instinctively knows is there. A few more laughs still rattle through her calming chest.</p><p>\u201cYou have no shame, either,\u201d she says, laughing one more time.</p><p>\u201cIt was embarrassing, but I think I needed that.\u201d Camryn kicks off her shoes and pulls her bare feet onto the front seat in the car.</p><p>We\u2019re back on the road again, and taking direction only from Camryn\u2019s pointing finger. Heading east on 44; looks like we\u2019re going to be passing through the bottom half of Missouri.</p><p>\u201cGlad I could oblige.\u201d</p><p>I reach out and press the power on the CD player.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d she teases, \u201cI wonder how far back into the seventies we\u2019ll go this time.\u201d</p><p>I tilt my head over and smirk at her.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good song,\u201d I say, reaching out to turn the volume up a little and then tapping my thumbs on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard it before,\u201d she says, laying her head against the seat. \u201cWayward Son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose,\u201d I say, \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, close enough you didn\u2019t need to correct me.\u201d She pretends to be offended, but isn\u2019t doing a very good job.</p><p>\u201cAnd what band is it?\u201d I test her.</p><p>She makes a face at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKansas,\u201d I say with an intellectually raised brow. \u201cOne of my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that about all of them.\u201d She purses her lips and flutters her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do,\u201d I relent, \u201cbut really, Kansas songs have a lot of emotion. Dust in the Wind, for example; can\u2019t think of a more fitting piece of music for death. It has a way of stripping your fear of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStripping your fear of death?\u201d she says, not convinced.</p><p>\u201cWell yeah, I guess so. It\u2019s like Steve Walsh is the reaper and he\u2019s just telling you that there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. Shit, if I could choose a song to die to, that one would be at the top of my playlist.\u201d</p><p>She looks discouraged.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little too morbid for my blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you look at it that way, I guess so.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s fully facing me now with both legs pulled onto the seat, knees drawn up, and her shoulder and head lying on the back of the seat. That golden braid of hers which makes her look that much softer always draped over her right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHotel California,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Eagles.\u201d</p><p>I look at her. I\u2019m impressed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one classic song that I like.\u201d</p><p>That makes me smile \u201cReally? That\u2019s a great one; very chilling\u2014kind of makes me feel like I\u2019m in one of those old black and white horror films\u2014Good choice.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m actually really impressed.</p><p>I tap my thumbs some more on the steering wheel to Carry On Wayward Son and then I hear a loud pop! and a constant flap-flap-flap-flap-flunk-flap-flunk until I veer slowly off the side of the freeway and pull onto the shoulder.</p><p>Camryn has already dropped her bare feet back onto the floorboard and is looking all around the car trying to figure out the direction of the noise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo we have a flat?\u201d she asks, though it\u2019s more like: \u201cOh great, we have a flat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say putting the car in park and turning the engine off. \u201cGood thing I have a spare in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it one of those ugly mini tires?\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I have a life-sized tire in there with a rim and everything and I promise it\u2019ll match the other three.\u201d</p><p>She looks slightly relieved, until she realizes I was making fun of her and she sticks her tongue out at me and crosses her eyes. Not sure why that made me want to do her in the backseat, but to each his own, I guess.</p><p>I put my hand on the door handle and she pulls her legs back onto the seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting all comfortable for?\u201d</p><p>She blinks. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet your shoes on,\u201d I say, nodding to them on the floorboard, \u201cand get your ass out with me and help.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes get wider and she just sits there as though waiting for me to laugh and tell her I\u2019m only kidding.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know how to change a tire,\u201d she says when she realizes I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cYou know how to change a tire,\u201d I correct her and it stuns her even more. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen it done hundreds of times in real life and in movies\u2014trust me, you know how; everybody knows how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never changed a tire in my life.\u201d She all but sticks out her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cWell you\u2019re going to today,\u201d I say grinning, opening my door just a few inches so the semi coming toward us doesn\u2019t knock it off.</p> <p>A few more seconds of disbelief and Camryn is slipping her feet down into her running shoes and shutting the car door behind her.</p><p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d I motion to her and she walks to the backside of the car with me. I point to the flat one, back passenger\u2019s side. \u201cIf it had been one of those two on the side with the traffic, you might\u2019ve gotten out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously gonna make me change a tire?\u201d</p><p>I thought we already established this.</p><p>\u201cYes, babe, I\u2019m seriously going to make you change a tire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut in the car you said help you, not actually do all the work.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWell you are going to help technically, but\u2014just come here.\u201d</p><p>She walks around to the trunk and I lift the spare out and set in on the road. \u201cNow get the jack and the tire iron out of the trunk and bring them over.\u201d</p> <p>She does what I say, grumbling under her breath something about getting \u2018black gook\u2019 on her hands. I restrain my very passionate desire to laugh at her as I roll the tire over near to the flat one and lay it on its side. Another semi zooms by; the wind rocks the car gently side to side.</p><p>\u201cThis is dangerous,\u201d she says, dropping the jack and the tire iron on the ground at my feet. \u201cWhat if a vehicle veers off the road and hits us? Don\u2019t you watch World\u2019s Dumbest?\u201d</p><p>Holy shit! She watches that show, too?</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact I do,\u201d I say, \u201cnow get over here and let\u2019s get this done. If you\u2019re the one squatting down, hidden from the traffic by the car then we\u2019re less-likely to get run-over by anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does that make it less-likely?\u201d Her eyebrows are knotted in her forehead.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you\u2019re standing out here in the open lookin\u2019 all sexy and shit, I\u2019d probably veer off the road looking at you, too.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes so hard and bends over to pick up the tire iron.</p><p>\u201cUgh!\u201d she grunts, trying to get the lug nuts loosened. \u201cThey\u2019re too damn tight!\u201d</p><p>I loosen them for her but let her twist them off the rest of the way, all the while keeping my eyes on the oncoming traffic without letting her know that it\u2019s making me nervous. If I\u2019m watching, I\u2019ve got a better chance of grabbing her in time and getting us both out of the way than if it were the other way around.</p><p>Next is the jack; I help her with it, showing her how to loosen it so it expands and I guide her about the best spot to place it, though she seemed to know where without my help. She fumbles at first with the jack handle, but quickly gets the hang of it and she hoists the car up a little. I check her butt out because I\u2019d be an idiot, or gay, not to.</p><p>And then out of nowhere, not even a hint of thunder or lightening beforehand, rain literally starts pouring from the sky in buckets.</p><p>Camryn starts yelling about getting soaked and it starts to distract her from the tire completely. She shoots up from the ground and starts to run toward the car door, but stops once she realizes she probably shouldn\u2019t try to get in with the car being held up by the jack.</p><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d She\u2019s completely drenched, holding her hands over her head as though it\u2019s actually going to do something to help shield her from the rain.</p><p>I laugh my ass off.</p><p>\u201cAndrew!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s laughably furious.</p><p>I take her shoulders into my hands and say with rain pounding on my face, \u201cI\u2019ll finish the tire.\u201d It\u2019s hard to keep a straight face. And I don\u2019t.</p><p>In a few minutes, the new tire has been tightened and I chuck the flat one along with the jack and the tire iron back into the trunk.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I say as Camryn starts to get inside the car now that it\u2019s safe.</p><p>She stops. She\u2019s shivering in the rain and every part of her is drenched. I slam the trunk closed and step up to her, feeling the water squishing around inside my shoes because I\u2019m not wearing socks and I smile in at her, hoping to make her smile, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just rain.\u201d</p><p>She relents a little, searching for more playful encouragement from me, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d I hold out my hand and she clasps hers around it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asks coyly.</p><p>Her braid is heavy with water; the few loose strands that always lay softly about her face are stuck to her forehead and on one side of her neck. I walk her around to the trunk and hop onto it. She just stands there as the rain continually washes over her. I reach out my hand again and hesitantly she takes it and I hoist her onto the back of the car. She climbs to the roof with me, all the while looking at me like I\u2019m some crazy person that she can\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cLay down,\u201d I say over the loud, pounding rain as I lay my back against the roof and let my feet dangle over the end and on the windshield.</p><p>Without question or objection\u2014although both are kind of written all over her face\u2014she lies down next to me.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she shouts. \u201cYou are crazy.\u201d</p><p>She must like crazy because I\u2019m getting the feeling she wants to be up here with me.</p><p>Tossing that earlier plan of mine out the window, the one where I needed to control myself around her, I let my left arm lay straight out at my side and instinctively she lays her head on it.</p><p>I swallow hard. I really didn\u2019t expect that. But I\u2019m glad she did it.</p><p>\u201cNow just open your eyes and look up,\u201d I say, already looking up myself.</p><p>A smaller truck zooms past, followed by a few cars, but neither of us notices. Another semi flies by and the wind knocks the car a little, but we don\u2019t care about that, either.</p><p>She winces at first as the rain gets in her eyes, but she does it, every now and then squinting and trying to curl her face into my side to shield it from the rain and the whole time, laughing gently. She forces herself to look straight up, but this time closes her eyes and lets her mouth part halfway. I watch her lips, how the rain moves over them in rivulets and how she smiles and flinches when the drops hit her in the back of the throat. How her shoulders push up when she tries to bury her face, smiling and laughing and soaking wet.</p><p>I watch her so much that I forget it\u2019s raining at all.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>17</p><p>WHEN I COULD HOLD my eyes open long enough, I did stare up at the rain pelting down on me. I\u2019ve never looked at it like that, straight up into the sky, and while I flinched more than I could actually see, when I could see it was absolutely beautiful. Like each drop rocketing towards me was separate from the thousands of others and for a suspended moment in time, I could glimpse it and see its delicate facets. I saw the gray clouds churning above me and felt the car shake when the wind from the traffic pushed against it. I shivered even though it\u2019s warm enough to swim. But nothing I saw or felt or heard was as warm and fascinating as Andrew\u2019s closeness.</p><p>I scream and laugh as we race to get back inside the car minutes later.</p><p>The door slams shut and then his does after mine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m freezing!\u201d I shudder out a laugh, pressing my uplifted arms between my br**sts with my fingers tightly interlocked and my chin pressed against them.</p><p>Andrew, smiling so hugely that it stretches his entire face, shivers once and flips on the heat.</p><p>Instinctively, I try to forget that I had lain against his arm, or that he put it out there for me to begin with. I think he tries to forget, too, or at least not to make it obvious.</p><p>He rubs his hands together, trying to get warm as the heat blasts from the vents. My teeth are chattering.</p><p>\u201cWearing wet clothes sucks,\u201d I say with shivering jaws.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m with you on that one,\u201d he says, stretching his seatbelt around and clicking it in place.</p><p>I do the same, though like always, after being in the car so long I\u2019ll end up slipping out of it so that I can find another comfortable seating position.</p><p>\u201cMy toes feel slimy,\u201d he says, looking toward his feet.</p><p>My whole face crumples. He laughs and then reaches down and pulls his shoes off, tossing them in the back floorboard.</p><p>I decide to do the same because even though I won\u2019t say it, my feet feel slimy, too.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find a place a change,\u201d I say.</p><p>He puts the car in drive and looks at me. \u201cThere\u2019s a backseat,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cI won\u2019t look, I swear.\u201d He puts his hands up for assurance and then grips the steering wheel again, pulling back onto the freeway when he has an opening between traffic.</p><p>I scoff. \u201cNah, I think I\u2019ll wait until we find a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d</p><p>I know he would totally look. And, well, it wouldn\u2019t bother me much....</p><p>The windshield wipers are swishing back and forth full blast and it\u2019s raining so hard that it\u2019s still difficult to see the road out ahead. Andrew leaves the heat on until it starts to feel like a sauna and he turns it down after checking first to see if I\u2019m good with it.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hotel California, huh?\u201d he asks, grinning over at me with deep dimples. He reaches out and presses the button to choose another CD and then keeps pressing until he finds the song. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much you know.\u201d</p><p>His hand drops back on the wheel.</p><p>The song begins like I always remembered with that eerie guitar, slow and haunting. We look at each other back and forth, letting the music move through and between us, waiting for the lyrics to begin. Then at the same time, we raise our hands as if knocking on the air one, two, three with the beat and we start to sing with Don Henley.</p><p>We get fully into it, line after line and sometimes we switch off, him letting me sing a line and then he sings one. And when the first chorus comes, we sing together at the top of our lungs, practically shouting the lyrics at the windshield. We squint our eyes and bob our heads and I pretend I\u2019m not mortified by my singing. Then the second verse comes and our taking-turns starts to get a little tangled, but we totally have fun with it and only trip-up a couple of times. And we say 1969! loudly together. Then we lose a little of the passion to sing and just let the music funnel through the car instead. But when the iconic second chorus comes around and the song slows and becomes more haunting, we get serious again and sing every single word together, looking right at each other. Andrew hits \u2018alibis!\u2019 so flawlessly that it sends shivers up my arms. And we both \u2018stabbed the beast\u2019 together, pumping our fists at our sides and getting into it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that was how the drive was to wherever for the next several hours.</p><p>I sang so much with him that my throat became sore.</p><p>Of course, all of it was classic rock with the occasional early nineties: Alice in Chains and Aerosmith mostly, and none of it bothered me one bit. I actually loved it all and the memory it was creating in my mind. A memory with Andrew.</p><p>We find a rest stop off the freeway in Jackson, Tennessee, and take full advantage of it. We slip inside the restrooms to change out of our wet clothes, which we\u2019ve been in for longer than either of us realized. I guess our fun together in the car with my less-than-stellar singing and him pretending he loves it distracted us from everything else.</p> <p>He\u2019s dressed before me and already waiting inside the car when I stroll out wearing the only thing I had left in my bag that was clean: the white cotton shorts and varsity tee I like to sleep in. I only brought one bra and I happened to be wearing it when I was being rained on so it\u2019s completely wet still. But I\u2019m wearing it anyway because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m getting in that car with him bra-less.</p><p>\u201cI am not wearing these shorts for your benefit,\u201d I say, pointing sternly at him as I crawl back inside the car. \u201cFor the record.\u201d</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifts into a grin.</p><p>\u201cNote taken,\u201d he says, jotting it down on a pretend tablet.</p><p>I lift my butt from the seat and grasp the end of my shorts, pulling them just a little so they aren\u2019t crawling up my crotch and to cover a little more skin on my thighs. I start to kick my black flip-flops onto the floorboard until I see how saturated the floor mat is and decide to leave them on. It\u2019s a good thing the seats are leather.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna have to find some more clothes,\u201d I say.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s wearing jeans again and his black Doc Marten boots, and another plain gray t-shirt, lighter in color than the last one. Like anything, it looks good on him, but I kind of miss his tanned muscled calves and the black and gray Celtic tattoo on the ball of his ankle.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that all you brought?\u201d he asks, keeping his eyes on the road. \u201cNot that I\u2019m complaining, of course.\u201d</p><p>I smirk over at him. \u201cI guess since I didn\u2019t know where I was going I didn\u2019t want to lug a bunch of crap around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>The sun is shining in Tennessee and we\u2019re heading south now. The other side of the freeway is grid-locked because of road construction and we both express how glad we are that we\u2019re not on \u2018that side of the road\u2019. Eventually, the daylight fades behind the landscape and dusk bathes the rice and cotton fields in a purplish haze; there\u2019s always some kind of massive field on either side of the freeway, stretching far off in the distance.</p> <p>We make it to Birmingham, Alabama a little after 7:00p.m.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you wanna stop for clothes?\u201d he asks, creeping along a city street lined by stop lights and gas stations.</p><p>I rise up from the seat and look around, trying to glimpse the lighted signs for someplace suitable.</p><p>Andrew points out ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s a Walmart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s as good any,\u201d I say and he makes a left at the stoplight and we pull into the parking lot.</p><p>We get out and the first thing I do is pull my panties out of the crack of my butt.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh.</p> <p>We walk together through the sea of cars in the parking lot, my flip-flops snapping against my heels. Instantly, I recoil into myself, knowing I look like hell with a dirty, matted braid over my shoulder and dressed in these skimpy shorts that keep crawling up my ass. No makeup anymore, since my becoming-one-with-the-rain washed it all off. I keep my eyes on the bright white floor as we walk through the store and avoid eye contact with anyone.</p><p>We head to the women\u2019s clothes first and I grab a few simple things: two more pairs of cotton shorts that are still short but not up-my-crotch short like the ones I\u2019m wearing, and a couple of cute v-neck graphic tees with random stuff on them. I hold out on my desire to visit the panties and bras section. I think for now I\u2019ll make do with what I have.</p><p>Then I follow Andrew over to the area by the pharmacy where all of the vitamins and cold medicines and toothpaste and stuff are.</p><p>We go straight into the aisle with the razors and shaving cream.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t shaved in a week,\u201d he says, rubbing the stubble that has been growing on his face for the past few days.</p><p>I think it\u2019s sexy, but with or without it, it\u2019s still sexy so I don\u2019t complain.</p><p>Why would I anyway?</p><p>I grab a pack of razors, too, as well as some Olay shaving cream in a gold can. Then in the next aisle, I pick up a small bottle of mouthwash because one can never have enough mouthwash. I adjust my purse on the opposite shoulder as the items start to fill up in the other arm. We go into the next aisle and I pluck a set of shampoo and conditioner from the shelf, trying to balance them in my hands with the other stuff, but Andrew takes it from me and carries it instead. He takes the mouthwash, too.</p><p>We head over to the medicines and there\u2019s a middle-aged couple standing in front of the cough syrup, reading the labels.</p><p>Andrew says casually, without lowering his voice, \u201cBabe, did you find that yeast infection stuff?\u201d</p><p>My eyes spring open and I freeze in front of the Tylenol.</p><p>He removes a small box of Advil from the shelf.</p><p>The couple pretends not to have heard what he said, but I know they heard him.</p><p>\u201cI mean are you even sure that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the itch?\u201d he goes on and I\u2019m literally melting from the heat in my face.</p><p>The couple does glance over this time, covertly.</p><p>Andrew is grinning his ass off at me from the side, pretending to be reading labels.</p><p>I want to smack him, but instead, I play him at his own game.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby I found it,\u201d I say as casually as he had. \u201cWhat about you? Did you see if they have extra-small sized condoms?\u201d</p><p>The woman turns her head and looks right at him, up and down, and then she eyes me before going back to reading labels.</p><p>Andrew doesn\u2019t break; somehow I knew he wouldn\u2019t. He just smiles over at me, enjoying every second of this.</p><p>\u201cOne size fits all, baby,\u201d he says. \u201cI told you they fill out better when you can actually make it hard.\u201d</p><p>A spitting noise bursts from between my lips followed by laughter.</p><p>The couple leaves the aisle.</p><p>\u201cYou are so bad!\u201d I hiss at him, still laughing. The can of shaving cream clanks against the floor after it falls from my arm and I bend over to pick it up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not so innocent yourself.\u201d</p><p>Andrew grabs a tube of antibiotic ointment and holds it in the same hand with the Advil and we head to the register. He tosses two packages of beef jerky on the moving belt and a pack of Tic Tacs. I get a travel-sized bottle of hand sanitizer, a tube of ChapStick and a package of beef jerky for myself.</p><p>\u201cGettin\u2019 brave aren\u2019t yah?\u201d he says about the beef jerky.</p><p>I smirk at him and put the plastic gray item divider in-between his stuff and mine. \u201cNope,\u201d I say. \u201cI love jerky. If it contained radioactive material I\u2019d still eat it.\u201d</p><p>He just smiles, but then tries to tell the cashier that his and my stuff is \u2018together\u2019 as he pulls his credit card from his wallet.</p><p>\u201cNo, not this time,\u201d I argue, laying my arm on the belt next to the item divider. I look right at the cashier and shake my head, daring her to ring my stuff up with his. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for mine.\u201d She looks between me and Andrew briefly, as if waiting for his turn.</p><p>When he starts to argue back I turn my chin at a stern angle and say, \u201cI\u2019m paying for my stuff and that\u2019s that. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He sort of rolls his eyes and gives in, sliding his card through the machine.</p><p>When we get back in the car, Andrew rips the top strip off one of his beef jerky bags and pops a jagged piece into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to drive some?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He shakes his head, his jaws working hard on that stiff piece of jerky.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get another motel and crash for the night.\u201d</p><p>He swallows and pops another piece in his mouth and puts the car in drive and we pull away.</p><p>We find a motel a few miles out and grab everything and take it up to our side-by-side king rooms. Green checkered carpet in this one with matching dark green, heavy curtains and a dark green flowery bedspread. I turn the television on immediately, just to give some light and animation to the dark and gloomy atmosphere.</p><p>He paid for the rooms again, using how I \u2018got my way\u2019 with paying for the stuff at Walmart as his excuse to get away with it.</p><p>Andrew checks the room out first, just like the last time, and then plops down on the recliner by the window.</p><p>I drop my stuff on the floor and rip the bedspread from the bed and toss it in the corner next to the wall.</p><p>\u201cIs there something on it?\u201d he asks, leaning back into the recliner and letting his legs splay below.</p><p>He looks exhausted.</p><p>\u201cNo, they just scare me.\u201d I sit on the end of the bed and kick off my flip-flops, drawing my legs onto the bed Indian-style. I place my hands within my lap because still wearing the white cotton short shorts, I feel a little exposed to him with my knees open like this.</p><p>\u201cYou said: since you didn\u2019t know where you were going,\u201d Andrew says.</p><p>I look up and it takes me a second to understand what he\u2019s referring to: back in the car when I mentioned my reason for not bringing more clothes. He knits his fingers together, laying his hands flat over his stomach.</p><p>It takes me a moment to answer, although the answer I give him his vague:</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Andrew lifts his back straight up from the chair and leans over forward, resting his arms on his thighs, his hands draped together below his knees. He cocks his head to one side looking across at me. I know we\u2019re about to have one of those conversations where I can\u2019t foresee if I\u2019ll accept or dodge his questions. It\u2019ll depend on how good he is at drawing the answers out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no expert on this stuff,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t see you setting out alone like you did on a bus, of all things, with a purse, a small bag and absolutely no idea where you\u2019re going just because your best friend stabbed you in the back.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t leave because of Natalie and Damon; they were just part of the pattern.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t because of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what was it?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to talk about it; at least, I don\u2019t think I do. A part of me feels like I can tell him anything and I sort of want to, but the other part is telling me to be careful. I haven\u2019t forgotten that his issues outweigh mine and I would feel stupid and whiney and selfish telling him anything at all.</p><p>I look at the TV instead of him and pretend to be halfway interested in it.</p><p>He stands up.</p><p>\u201cIt must\u2019ve been pretty bad,\u201d he says walking over to me, \u201cand I want you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>Pretty bad? Oh great, he just made it worse; even if I did tell him, at least before I wouldn\u2019t have had it in my head that he expected something really horrible. Now that I know he does, I feel like I should make something up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I don\u2019t, of course.</p><p>I feel the bed move when he sits down next to me. I can\u2019t look at him yet; my eyes stay focused on the TV. My stomach swims with guilt and also something tingly when I think about how close he is. But mostly guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve let you get away with not telling me anything for a long time,\u201d he says. He rests his elbows on his thighs again and sits the way he had been sitting on the recliner, with his hands folded and hanging between his legs. \u201cYou have to tell me sometime.\u201d</p><p>I look over and say, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to what you\u2019re going through,\u201d and leave it at that, facing the TV again.</p> <p>Please stop prying, Andrew. I want more than anything to tell you because somehow I know you can makes some sense of it all, you can make it all better\u2014what am I saying?\u2014Please just stop prying?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re comparing it?\u201d he says, piquing my curiosity. \u201cSo, you think that because my dad is dying that whatever made you do what you did somehow doesn\u2019t live up?\u201d He says this as if the very thought of it is absurd.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what I think.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows draw inward and he looks at the TV briefly before turning back to me.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s complete bullshit,\u201d he says matter-of-factly.</p> <p>My head snaps back around.</p><p>He goes on:</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know, I\u2019ve always hated that expression: Others have it worse than you do; I guess if you want to look at it in a competitive way, sure, give me welfare over blindness any day, but it\u2019s not a f**king competition. Right?\u201d</p><p>Is he asking me because he wants to know how I feel, or was that his way of telling me how it is and hoping I get it?</p><p>I just nod.</p><p>\u201cPain is pain, babe.\u201d Every time he calls me \u2018babe\u2019 I notice it more than anything else he says. \u201cJust because one person\u2019s problem is less traumatic than another\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re required to hurt less.\u201d</p> <p>I guess he makes a valid point, but I still feel selfish.</p><p>He touches my wrist and I look down at it, the way his masculine fingers drape over the bone along the side of my hand. I want to kiss him; the urge inside of me just climbed its way to the surface, but I swallow and force it back down into the pit of my stomach which has been trembling for the past few seconds all on its own.</p><p>I pull my hand away from his and get up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cCamryn, look, I didn\u2019t mean anything by that. I was just trying to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I say softly, crossing my arms and turning my back on him. It\u2019s definitely one of those it\u2019s-not-you-it\u2019s-me moments, but I\u2019m not about to lay that on him.</p><p>I sense him stand up and then I turn carefully at the waist to see him grab his bags and his guitar from against the wall.</p><p>He walks to the door.</p><p>I want to stop him, but I can\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you get some sleep,\u201d he says gently.</p><p>I nod but don\u2019t say anything because I\u2019m afraid that if I do, my mind will betray my mouth and I\u2019ll just dig myself deeper into this dangerous situation with Andrew that I\u2019m finding more conspicuous every day that I spend with him.</p><p>18</p><p>I HATE MYSELF FOR letting him walk out that door, but it had to be done. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t let myself fall into the world that is Andrew Parrish even though everything in my heart and in my desires is telling me to. It\u2019s not just about being afraid of getting hurt again; everybody goes through that phase and maybe I\u2019m not out of it completely yet, but it\u2019s about so much more.</p><p>I don\u2019t know myself.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I want or how I feel or how I should feel and I don\u2019t think I ever really have. I would be a selfish bitch to let Andrew into my life. What if he falls in love or wants something from me that I can\u2019t give him? What if I add a broken heart on top of his dad\u2019s death? I don\u2019t want his pain hanging over my head.</p><p>I turn abruptly and look at the door again, picturing the way he looked right before he walked through it.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s not even an issue. How conceited of me to even entertain the thought of him ever falling in love with me. Maybe he just wants a friend with benefits, or a one-time thing.</p><p>My head is swimming with a chaotic swarm of thoughts, none of which I feel are right and all of which I know are possible. I walk over to the mirror and stare at myself in it, looking into the eyes of some girl that I feel like I\u2019ve met, but never really got acquainted with. I really do feel detached from myself, from everything.</p><p>Fuck this!</p><p>I grit my teeth and smack the palms of my hands against the TV stand. Then I grab a new pair of black cotton shorts, my new white tee with je t'aime written in script across it, wrapped around the Eiffel Tower and I head for the shower. I spend forever letting the water beat on me not because I feel dirty but because I feel like shit. All I can think about is Andrew. And Ian. And why suddenly I feel this strange, provoking need to think about them both in the same thought at all.</p><p>After my skin feels stripped of its top layer by the hot water, I get out and dry off, soaking up the water from my hair into the towel. I blow-dry it nak*d in front of the mirror and then go back into the room to get dressed because I didn\u2019t bring a clean pair of panties in with me. Finally, I comb out my halfway dried hair and leave it down to air-dry the rest of the way, pushing it back behind both ears and out of my face.</p><p>I hear Andrew playing the guitar through the wall again. The TV is still yapping and it pisses me off so I stomp over and turn it off so I can hear Andrew more clearly.</p><p>I just stand here for a few seconds, taking in the notes funneling through the wall and painfully into my ears. It\u2019s not a sad kind of tune, but for some reason it\u2019s still painful for me to hear.</p><p>Finally, I grab my room key, slip my feet into my flop-flops and leave the room.</p><p>Nervously licking the dryness from my lips, I take a deep breath, swallow and raise my hand to knock lightly on his door.</p><p>The sound of the guitar ceases and a few seconds later, the door clicks open.</p><p>He has showered, too. His brown hair is still wet; pieces of it a little messy in the front above his forehead. He stares at me, shirtless and wearing nothing else but a pair of black cargo shorts. I try not to look at his lightly-tanned six-pack abs or the veins running along the length of his arms that somehow appear more pronounced with the rest of his skin in plain-view.</p><p>Oh...my God. Maybe I should just go back...</p><p>No, I came over here to talk to him and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.</p><p>For the first time, I see the tattoo down his left side and I want to ask about it, but I\u2019ll save that for later.</p><p>He smiles gently at me.</p><p>\u201cIt started about a year and a half ago,\u201d I just come out with it, \u201ca week before graduation\u2014my boyfriend was killed in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>His gentle smile fades and he softens his eyes, letting me see just enough remorse to show that he feels bad for me without it seeming fake or exaggerated.</p><p>He pushes the door open the rest of the way and I walk inside. The first thing he does before I even sit down on the end of the bed is pull a shirt over his chest. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want me to feel like he\u2019s trying to be distracting or flirty, especially when I came here to tell him something obviously painful. I respect him even more for that. That small, seemingly insignificant gesture speaks volumes, and although it might be unfortunate that he hid that body away, I\u2019m OK with it. That\u2019s not what I came here for.</p><p>I think....</p><p>There\u2019s a sort of genuine sadness in his green eyes, mixed with something thoughtful. He turns the TV off and sits down next to me, the same way he did on my bed and he looks over, waiting patiently for me to go on.</p><p>\u201cWe fell in love at sixteen,\u201d I begin and look out ahead of me, \u201cbut he waited for me for two years\u2014two years\u2014,\u201d I glance over once in emphasis, \u201cbefore I slept with him. I don\u2019t know any teenage guy who would wait that long to get in a girl\u2019s panties.\u201d</p><p>Andrew makes a slight you-have-a-point face.</p><p>\u201cI had had a couple of short-term boyfriends before Ian, but they were so...,\u201d I look up in thought searching for the word, \u201c...mundane. To tell you the truth, I started seeing a lot of people as mundane by the time I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looks reflective, his brows gently creasing inward.</p><p>\u201cBut Ian was different. The first thing he said to me after we met and had our first real conversation was: \u2018I wonder if the ocean smells different on the other side of the world.\u2019 I laughed at first because I thought it was a weird thing say, but then I realized that simple sentence set him apart from everyone I knew. Ian was a guy standing on the outside of the glass, looking in at the rest of us shuffling back and forth, doing the same thing every day, taking the same paths, like ants in an ant farm.</p><p>\u201cNow, I had always known that I wanted something more in life, something different, but it was when I met Ian that things started to become clear to me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew smiles gently and says, \u201cEstablished and matured before twenty\u2014that\u2019s a rare trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess so;\u201d I say, smiling back at him and then I let out a small laugh, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t believe how often Damon or Natalie or even my mom and my brother, Cole, messed with me about how \u2018deep\u2019 I was.\u201d I quote \u2018deep\u2019 with my fingers and roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDeep is good,\u201d he says and I glance over coyly because I detect the attraction even though he\u2019s taming it very well for the sake of the conversation. But then his smile fades and his voice drops a little. \u201cSo when you lost Ian, you lost your partner in crime.\u201d</p><p>My smile fades, too, and I prop my hands on the edge of the bed and let my body slump between my shoulders. \u201cYes. We were going to backpack across the world after graduation, or maybe just Europe, but we were determined; had that much planned out at least.\u201d I look straight at Andrew now. \u201cWe knew we didn\u2019t want to do the college thing and end up working the same job for forty years\u2014we wanted to work everywhere, try everything while on the road!\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s actually a pretty cool idea,\u201d he says. \u201cOne week you\u2019re waitressing at a bar and bankin\u2019 on tips and the next week, in a different city or town, you\u2019re belly-dancing on a street corner and tourists are tossing money in a jar as they walk by.\u201d</p><p>My slumped shoulders bounce softly with laughter and I blush, looking over at him. \u201cWaitressing, sure, but belly-dancing?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNot so much.\u201d</p><p>He grins and says, \u201cAh, you could pull it off.\u201d</p><p>Still with a hot, blushing face I look out ahead of me again and let the blush fade.</p><p>\u201cSix months after Ian died,\u201d I go on, \u201cmy brother, Cole, killed a man in a drunk-driving accident and now he\u2019s in prison. And after that, my dad cheated on my mom and they got divorced. My new boyfriend, Christian, cheated on me. And then, of course, you already know about what happened with Natalie.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all of it. I told him everything that, combined, made me want to get away. But I can\u2019t look at him because I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be done, like he\u2019s thinking to himself: OK, where\u2019s the rest of it? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of shit to dump on a person\u2019s lap,\u201d he says and I look back up when I feel him adjusting on the bed beside me. I smell his minty breath now that he has turned fully at the waist to face me from the side. \u201cYou have every right to be hurt, Camryn.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything, but I thank him with my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can see now why you weren\u2019t hard to convince to go on this road-trip with me,\u201d he says.</p><p>His face is unreadable. I hope he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m using him to mimic that part of my life I had planned with Ian. The whole road-trip situation seems similar, even to me now that I think about it, but it couldn\u2019t be further from the reason I left with Andrew. I\u2019m with him now because I want to be.</p> <p>It\u2019s in this moment that I realize I haven\u2019t been thinking of Ian and Andrew so much because I\u2019m trying to find Ian in Andrew...I think it\u2019s guilt...maybe I\u2019m trying to replace Ian completely.</p><p>I stand up from the bed and shake those thoughts from my mind.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d Andrew asks from behind. \u201cAfter this road-trip is over, what do you plan to do with your life?\u201d</p><p>My heart hardens in my chest. Not once during this trip with Andrew, or even before I met him after I left North Carolina, have I thought beyond the present. It wasn\u2019t ever that I tried not to think about what lies ahead, I simply just didn\u2019t think about it at all. Andrew\u2019s question wakes me up and now I feel panicked inside. I never wanted a dose of that reality; I was content with my illusion.</p><p>I turn around, my arms crossed over my chest. Andrew\u2019s beautiful eyes are gazing intensely at me.</p> <p>\u201cI...don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>He looks mildly surprised, his gaze becoming more contemplative and his eyes stray.</p><p>\u201cYou can still go to college,\u201d he says, offering ideas to help me feel better, I guess, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t mean you have to get a job afterwards and work there until you die\u2014hell, you can still backpack across Europe if you want.\u201d</p><p>He stands up with me. I can tell the thinking gears are churning in his head as he paces the dark green carpet a few times.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he says and my heart flutters, \u201cyou\u2019re intelligent and obviously have more determination than the average girl; I think you could do just about anything you wanted\u2014shit, I know that all sounds commonplace, but it couldn\u2019t be truer in your case.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI guess so,\u201d I say, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have the slightest idea about what I want to do except that I don\u2019t want to go home to figure it out. I think I\u2019m afraid that if I go back there, I\u2019ll be drowned in the same crap I pulled myself out of when I got on that bus that day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d Andrew says suddenly and my eyes lock on him, \u201cwhat part of being around everyone else frustrates you the most?\u201d</p><p>Frustrates me?</p><p>I think on it for a second, my gaze fixated on the brass lamp mounted on the wall beside the bed.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m...not sure.\u201d</p><p>He steps up to me and places two fingers at the bend of my arm, guiding me to sit back down with him and I do.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it,\u201d he goes on, \u201cbased on what you\u2019ve told me already, what is different between you and them?\u201d</p><p>I hate it that it\u2019s taking me longer to figure something out that he seems to already have an idea about. I stare down at my hands within my lap and think about it long and hard until I come up with the only answer I feel might be right, but I\u2019m still unsure of myself:</p><p>\u201cExpectations?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a question, or your answer?\u201d</p><p>I give up.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know\u2014I mean I feel...restricted around everyone, with the exception of Ian, of course.\u201d</p><p>He nods and listens, letting me go on without interruption while the answer is hanging on the tip of my brain.</p><p>And then out of nowhere, the answers just come:</p><p>\u201cNo one wants to do what I want to do,\u201d I say and my explanation begins to unfold more quickly now that I feel more confident in the answer. \u201cJust like with living free and not taking the ordinary route, y\u2019know? No one wants to step out of their comfort zone to do that with me because it\u2019s not something most people do. I was afraid to tell my parents I didn\u2019t want to go to college because that\u2019s what they expected me to do. I accepted a job at a department store because my mom expected it to fulfill me in some way. I went with my mom every Saturday to visit my brother in prison because she expected me to go, because he\u2019s my brother and I should want to see him even though I didn\u2019t. Natalie relentlessly tried to hook me up with guys because she thought it was abnormal that I be single.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve been afraid most of my life to be myself.\u201d</p><p>My head whirls around to face him. \u201cIn a way, that was even true with Ian.\u201d</p><p>I look away quickly because that last part was not something I really expected to say out loud. It just came out while the realization was taking shape in my mind so fast.</p><p>Andrew looks inquisitive, but at the same time, unsure if he should probe.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure if I should elaborate.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>Apparently, he decides it\u2019s not his place to further this particular subject.</p><p>He twists the inside of his cheek in-between his teeth. I watch him for a moment, always trying to force down the obvious attraction I have for him, but it\u2019s becoming harder to do. I glimpse his lips and wonder what they taste like. And then I force my eyes away\u2014I\u2019m doing it again. Right now. I\u2019m afraid to tell him what I want. Or, at least what I think I want.</p><p>\u201cAndrew,\u201d I say and his face quietly reacts to my voice saying his name.</p><p>Think about this, Cam, I say to myself. Are you sure this is what you want?</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had a one-night stand?\u201d</p><p>It feels like I just let the biggest secret I\u2019ve ever been told slip while standing in front of a microphone in a room full of people. But it\u2019s out of the bag now. I\u2019m still not entirely sure if it\u2019s even what I want, but it\u2019s there in my mind and has been for a while. I remember vaguely thinking about it while up on that roof with Blake.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s face loses all emotion and he can\u2019t seem to find words to say. Instantly, my heart freezes and I feel sick to my stomach. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have said that! He\u2019s going to think I\u2019m a slut or something.</p><p>I jump up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014God, you must think I\u2019m\u2014.\u201d</p><p>He reaches out and takes my wrist, \u201cSit back down.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly, I do, but I can\u2019t look at him. I\u2019m completely f**king mortified.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>I look back at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing it right now.\u201d He motions his hands to emphasize \u2018right now\u2019; his eyebrows are knotted.</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>He licks his lips, sighs as if disappointed and finally says, \u201cCamryn, you started to tell me something that maybe you\u2019ve contemplated a time or two and just when you got the courage to speak your mind, you did a one-eighty and regretted it.\u201d He looks deep into my eyes, his full of intensity and knowledge and something else I can\u2019t yet place. \u201cAsk me the question again and this time, wait for me to answer.\u201d</p><p>I pause, searching that tense look on his face, unsure of it. Or, maybe it\u2019s just me that I\u2019m unsure of.</p><p>I swallow and say, \u201cHave you ever had a one-night stand?\u201d</p><p>His expression doesn\u2019t shift or fall. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve had a few here and there.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s waiting for me now, even though I\u2019m not sure yet how to make myself feel comfortable in this awkwardly-developing conversation. It\u2019s like he knows I\u2019m squirming inside, but to teach me a lesson he\u2019s going to make me do the talking instead of being my shrink like he\u2019s been since I came into his room.</p><p>His eyebrows arch a little as if to say: Well?</p><p>\u201cWell, I was just wondering...because I\u2019ve never done something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he says so casually.</p><p>I look down and then back up at him so he doesn\u2019t scold me for it.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just kind of slutty, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and it surprises me.</p><p>Finally, he relieves me somewhat of my torture.</p><p>\u201cIf a girl did that a-lot,\u201d he draws out that word with a squeamish smile, \u201cthen it would be slutty, sure. Once or twice, I don\u2019t know...,\u201d he motions his hands at level with his shoulders as if shaking the numbers around in his mind indecisively, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>Why isn\u2019t he taking full advantage of this right now? I start freaking out a little inside, wondering why he\u2019s still all shrink-mode rather than amping-up the flirting and getting down to business.</p><p>\u201cAlright, so....\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t say it. It\u2019s just not me, to be able to casually talk about my sexual anything. I can only vaguely do that with Natalie.</p><p>Andrew sighs and his shoulders slouch over. \u201cAre you wanting to sleep with me, to have a one-night stand with me?\u201d He knew I wasn\u2019t going to come out and say it, so he gave in and did it for me.</p><p>The question, although obvious for both of us, stops my breath. It embarrasses and mortifies me with him saying it as much, maybe more, than if I would have.</p><p>\u201cMaybe....\u201d</p><p>He stands up and looks down at me and says, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not into you in that way.\u201d</p><p>The biggest fist in existence just slammed into my stomach. My hands go rigid, gripping the edge of the mattress, making my arms all the way up to the top of my shoulders, completely unmovable. All I want to do right now is run out that door and lock myself inside my room and never look at Andrew again. Not because I don\u2019t want to see him, but because I don\u2019t want him to see me.</p><p>I\u2019ve never been so embarrassed in my entire life.</p><p>And this is what speaking my mind got me!</p><p>I don\u2019t know whether to accept it as a lesson learned, or to hate him for making me do it.</p><p>19</p><p>IN A SPLIT-SECOND, I leap off the bed and walk as fast as I can to the door.</p><p>\u201cCamryn, stop.\u201d</p><p>I just keep moving, even faster when I feel him coming up behind me, and I grab the lever and swing the door open and then I run out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just wait a damn minute!\u201d he says, following me and I can hear the aggravation elevating in his voice.</p><p>I ignore him and reach into the little pocket on the back of my shorts and yank out my card key, thrusting it in my door. I push my way inside the room and go to close the door, but Andrew is already through it behind me.</p><p>The door shuts after him.</p><p>\u201cWill you just listen to me?\u201d He tries once more, exasperated.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to look at him, but I do anyway.</p><p>His eyes are wide and fierce and sincere when finally I turn around.</p><p>He steps up to me and grips my upper-arms carefully in his hands. And then he leans in and presses his lips softly against mine. I wilt, but I\u2019m still too confused to react properly to it. Confused and stunned and my heart is racing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulls away and looks in at me, his face every bit of sincere and he tilts his head to one side...smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhy is that funny?\u201d I ask sharply and go to push away from him.</p><p>He holds me still by my arms and forces my humiliated gaze, which is beginning to reflect resentment.</p><p>\u201cI say that I\u2019m not into you like that, Camryn, because...,\u201d he pauses, searching my face, looking at my lips for a moment as if deciding whether or not he should kiss them again, \u201c...because you\u2019re not the girl I could only sleep with once.\u201d</p> <p>His words snap the thoughts out of me and my racing heart flickers behind my ribs. I can\u2019t make myself understand what he just said and instead of trying to figure out exactly what he means, I pull my head together the best I can and try to gain back some of the composure I lost when I stormed out of his room.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he says, moving to my side and slipping his hand around the back of my waist. Just feeling his fingers graze my skin causes shivers along that side of my body. What the hell is happening to me? I do want him...I mean, right now I feel like there\u2019s no going back, that I would force myself to be a slut just for tonight just to keep him in the room. But what I don\u2019t understand is why I feel like I want more from him than sex....</p><p>\u201cCamryn?\u201d His voice snaps me back into whatever it was he was trying to say moments ago. He guides me to sit down on the bed and then crouches down in front of me on the floor. He gazes up into my eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t have a one-night stand with you, but I will make you come, if you let me.\u201d</p><p>A tiny jolt of electricity just shot through my belly and down in-between my legs.</p><p>\u201c...What?\u201d I can\u2019t say anything else, really.</p> <p>He smiles gently, deepening those dimples just a little, and he rests his arms across the length of my nak*d thighs, clasping his hands to my sides.</p><p>\u201cNo strings attached,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get you off and tomorrow morning when you wake up, I\u2019ll be in my room next door getting ready to head out with you to our next location. Nothing will change between us\u2014I won\u2019t even bring up what happened joking around or otherwise. It\u2019ll be like it never happened at all.\u201d</p><p>I can hardly breathe. He just made the sweet spot between my legs swell with just a few direct words.</p><p>\u201cBut...what about you?\u201d I manage to get out.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>He presses his fingertips into my sides a little more. I pretend not to notice.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t...seem fair.\u201d</p><p>I really have no idea what I\u2019m saying. I\u2019m still shocked that this is happening at all.</p><p>Andrew just smiles up at me, unfazed by my observation and then suddenly he lifts up from being crouched on the floor and moves in-between my legs, causing me to slide backward a little on the bed. He sits in front of me and pulls me onto his lap, one leg over each side of him. I\u2019m wide-eyed and practically biting into my bottom lip. He\u2019s being so casual about this that it alone, the mere unexpectedness of it, makes me wetter.</p><p>He wraps his firm arms around my back and leans in, brushing the edge of my chin with his mouth. Chills attack me from head to toe. Then he pulls me closer toward his body and whispers near my mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s fair. I want to make you come, and trust me; I\u2019ll definitely be getting something out of it.\u201d I hear the grin in his voice and I look down into his eyes and I can\u2019t resist them. If Andrew told me right now to bend over and get on my hands and knees for him, I would without hesitation.</p><p>He brushes the other side of my jaw with his lips.</p><p>\u201cThen why won\u2019t you just sleep with me?\u201d I ask quietly, but then try to re-word it, \u201cI mean, if you wanted to do...something else to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>He leans back from my jaw and puts his three middle fingers over my lips to hush me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say this just once,\u201d he begins and his eyes are so bottomless, churning with intensity, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want you to comment when I say it, alright?\u201d</p> <p>I nod nervously.</p><p>He pauses, moistening his lips with his tongue and then says, \u201cIf you were to let me f**k you, you would have to let me own you.\u201d</p><p>A wave of unrestricted pleasure shudders through my entire body. His words shock me into submission. My heart is telling me to say one thing. My mind is telling me to say another. But I can\u2019t hear what the f**k either one of them are saying because of this feeling between my legs that just keeps getting more and more impossible to ignore.</p><p>I swallow hard, searching desperately for saliva. It feels like every part of me that normally produces its own moisture has stopped working because all of the moisture has localized that to one spot in the center of my body.</p><p>I still can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Oh my God, he hasn\u2019t even touched me yet and I already feel this way?</p><p>Am I dreaming?</p><p>\u201cBut what if I give you a hand-job, or something?\u201d</p><p>I admit it; the idea of this is making me feel guilty.</p><p>He cocks his head to one side, smirking, and it makes me want to kiss him hungrily. \u201cI told you not to comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I well, I didn\u2019t comment on what you said, exactly, I just\u2014\u201d He slips his fingers underneath the thin fabric of my panties and touches me. I gasp, forgetting about what I had started to say.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he demands gently, though he completely means it. My lips snap shut and I gasp again when he slips two fingers inside of me and just holds them there, his thumb pressing on the outside against my pelvic bone. \u201cAre you going to be quiet, Camryn?\u201d</p><p>I shudder out the word, y-yes, and bite my bottom lip.</p><p>Then his fingers slide out of me. I want to beg him not to move them away, but he told me to be quiet in such a way that makes me utterly mad for him and equally submissive, so I say nothing. My eyes open carefully when he moves his wet fingers across my lips and instinctively I lick them, just a little, until he pulls them toward his own lips and takes in the rest of me on his tongue. I lean toward him, touching his mouth to my own, shutting my eyes softly just wanting to taste him and myself on him. His tongue snakes out to touch mine, but then he pushes me carefully back on the bed, instead of giving in to the ravenous kiss I so desperately want.</p><p>He slips both hands on the fabric around my waist and slides my shorts and panties over my h*ps and down my legs, dropping them somewhere on the floor.</p><p>Then he crawls up and lies next to me, draping one arm over my body and slipping his hand up the front of my shirt. I never did put a bra on earlier. He gently pinches one nipple, then the other and kisses me along the jaw again. Every tiny hair along the back of my neck rises when his tongue traces the curvature of my ear. \u201cDo you want me to touch it?\u201d His breath is warm against the side of my face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>He pins my earlobe between his teeth and his hand starts to slide down my belly, but it stops near my bellybutton.</p><p>\u201cTell me that you want me to touch it,\u201d he breathes into my ear.</p><p>I can hardly open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want you to touch it....\u201d</p><p>He slides his hand down further and my heart starts pounding fiercely in my chest, but when I think he\u2019s going to touch me, his hand moves to my inner thigh instead. \u201cSpread them for me.\u201d I let my legs fall gently apart, but he moves them apart further with his hand, the edges of his fingers pushing against my flesh until I\u2019m completely exposed.</p><p>He lifts up from my side and leans over my body, pushing my shirt up to expose my br**sts and then pins my n**ples between his teeth, one after the other. Then he flicks the tip of his wet tongue over them and places his mouth around them, kissing each one of them hungrily. I wind my fingers through the top of his hair, wanting to grip it and pull it, but I don\u2019t. Andrew makes his way down my chest and to my ribs, tracing each one with his tongue before my bellybutton.</p><p>He looks up at me with dominant, hooded eyes and says with his lips gently pressed against my stomach, \u201cYou have to tell me what you want, Camryn.\u201d He licks my belly once so slowly that my skin ripples with shivers. \u201cYou won\u2019t get it unless you tell me and make me believe you.\u201d</p><p>I breathe in an unsteady breath that literally rattles my chest. \u201cPlease, please touch it....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he says tauntingly and licks my cl*t once. Just once. He stops and looks at me across the landscape of my body, waiting for me.</p><p>Because I\u2019m afraid to say the word, I whisper so softly, \u201cPlease...I want you to lick my p**sy,\u201d that he pretends he didn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he says and licks my cl*t again, this time taking a little longer and a wave of shivers runs through me below. \u201cI didn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d</p><p>I say it again, raising my voice just a little, still too embarrassed to say that forbidden word, the one I\u2019ve always found dirty and wrong and belonging only in a porno movie.</p><p>Andrew slides his hand between my legs and parts my lips with two fingers. He licks me once. Only once. My thighs are starting to tremble heavier.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait.</p><p>\u201cA woman who knows what she wants sexually,\u201d he licks me again, his hooded eyes always watching me, \u201cand isn\u2019t afraid to express it is so f**king hot, Camryn\u2014Tell. Me. What. You. Want. Or, I won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d He licks me again and I can\u2019t take it anymore.</p><p>I reach my hands down and grab fistfuls of his hair, pushing his face further between my legs, as much as he\u2019ll allow me, and I say looking right into his eyes, \u201cLick my p**sy, Andrew; goddammit, lick my f**king p**sy!\u201d</p><p>I catch the darkest grin I\u2019ve ever seen on his face just before my eyelids slam shut and my head arches back when he starts to lick me and this time doesn\u2019t stop. He sucks hard on my cl*t and works his fingers in and out of me at the same time and I think I want to faint. I can\u2019t open my eyes; they feel drunk with pleasure. I buck my h*ps toward him and pull the shit out of his hair, but he never misses a beat. He licks me hard and fast and every now and then he\u2019ll slow down to suck on me and roll the pad of his thumb over my swollen clit, before diving right back in. And when I start to feel like I can\u2019t take it anymore and try to slide myself away from his face, he grasps my thighs and forces me to stay put until I come hard, my legs trembling uncontrollably, my hands gripping his head with all my strength. A moan shudders from my lips and both of my hands come up behind my head, clutching the headboard with my fingertips, trying to use it as leverage to pull away from Andrew\u2019s lashing tongue. But he grips me harder, his hands curled under my thighs and over my hips; he puts so much pressure on me that it hurts, digging his fingertips into my skin, but I like it.</p><p>And as my shuddering body begins to calm and my labored breathing starts to slow, although unevenly, Andrew also starts to lick me more gently. When my body stops moving, he kisses the inside of both of my thighs and then right below my bellybutton before crawling upward towards my mouth, bracing his tight, muscled arms against the mattress on each side of me. His soft, wet lips fall on my neck and both sides of my jawline first and then my forehead. Lastly, he looks down into my eyes for a long moment and then leans in and pecks my lips softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then he gets up from the bed.</p><p>I can\u2019t move.</p><p>I want to reach out and grab him and pull him down on top of me, but I can\u2019t move. Not only am I still reeling from the orgasm he just gave me, but my mind is still reeling from the entire experience.</p><p>I just look at him, barely raising my head from the pillow as he goes toward the door. He looks at me once just after he places his hand on the door lever.</p> <p>But I\u2019m the one who speaks first:</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>I know where he\u2019s going, but it was the only thing I could think to say to delay him from leaving my room.</p><p>He smiles gently. \u201cTo my room,\u201d he says as if I should already know.</p><p>The door opens and light from the hallway floods into the space around him, illuminating his features over there in the shadow. I want to say something, but I\u2019m not sure what. I raise my back from the bed and sit up straight; my fingers restlessly fidget with the sheet near my lap.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d he says and he gives me one last meaningful grin just before he closes the door behind him and the light from the hall snaps out. But it\u2019s still fairly bright in my room; I had left the lamp on by the bed. I look over, thinking about the lamp. It was on the whole time. I had always been kind of shy in bed and even with Ian the most light I ever had sex with him in was from a television, but never bright light. I didn\u2019t even think about it this time.</p><p>And the words that came out of my mouth...I have never said something like that before. Not the P-word. I can\u2019t even say it right now. Sure, I often told Ian to \u2018please f**k me\u2019 or \u2018fuck me harder\u2019, but that was the extent of my pornographic vocabulary.</p><p>What is Andrew Parrish doing to me?</p><p>Whatever it is...I don\u2019t think I want it to stop.</p><p>I get up from the bed and dive back into my panties and shorts and go to the door, intent on marching right back over there and...I don\u2019t know what.</p><p>I stop at the door before opening it and just look down at my bare feet against the green carpet. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d say if I went over there because I don\u2019t even know what I want or what I don\u2019t want. Then I let my arms fall loosely at my sides and a deep sigh bursts through my lips.</p> <p>\u201cLike it never happened at all,\u201d I mock him dryly. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re not good enough to pull that one off.\u201d</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>20</p><p>I\u2019VE BEEN AWAKE SINCE 8:00a.m. I got a call from my brother, Asher, and was afraid to answer because I thought it would be the \u2018news\u2019 of my father. He was just calling to let me know that Aidan is pissed off about me taking his guitar. I don\u2019t give a shit; what\u2019s he gonna do, drive down to Birmingham and fight me for it? I know it really has nothing to do with the guitar; Aidan is just pissed that I left Wyoming while our dad is still alive.</p><p>And Asher wanted to check up on me.</p><p>\u201cAre you doin\u2019 alright, bro?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m perfect, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that sarcasm?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said into the phone, \u201cI\u2019m being straight with you, Ash, I\u2019m having the time of my life right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that girl, isn\u2019t it? Camryn? Was that her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s her name and yeah, it\u2019s the girl.\u201d</p><p>I grinned inwardly, distracted by the very vivid image in my mind of what happened last night, but then I just smiled, thinking about Camryn in general.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know where I\u2019m at if you need me,\u201d Asher said and I heard the quiet message in his voice that he wanted to convey but knows better than to speak of it more openly. I told him before never to bring it up again, or I\u2019d have to beat the shit out of him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know, thanks, bro\u2014hey, how\u2019s Dad doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the same as he was before you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better than worse, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>We hung up and I called my mom to let her know I was alright. A day longer and she would\u2019ve had the police looking for me.</p><p>I get up and shove my stuff into my duffle bag. As I walk past the television, I pound on the wall with the bottom of my palm next to where Camryn\u2019s head is probably lying against her pillow on the other side. If she wasn\u2019t already awake, that might\u2019ve done the trick. Well, OK maybe not, since she is such a deep sleeper\u2014except when it comes to music, apparently. I take a quick shower and brush my teeth and I think about her being in my mouth last night and it\u2019s kind of a shame I have to brush my teeth at all. Oh well, maybe I\u2019ll do it again later. If she wants me to, of course. Shit, I have absolutely no issues with it whatsoever, except that afterwards I have to take care of myself, but that\u2019s alright, too. I\u2019d rather do it than risk letting her touch me. I know that when she does, it\u2019ll all be over. For me anyway. I f**king want her, but I\u2019ll only take her if the street goes both ways. And right now, I can tell she doesn\u2019t know what she wants.</p><p>I get dressed and slip my bare feet down into my black running shoes, glad they\u2019re dry now after being soaked by the rain. I shoulder both of my bags and take Aidan\u2019s guitar by the neck and head out into the hallway and next door to Camryn\u2019s room.</p><p>I hear the TV on inside, so I know she must be up.</p><p>I wonder how long it\u2019ll take her to crack.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>I HEAR ANDREW KNOCK on the door. I suck in a sharp breath, hold it there for a long, tense minute and then let it out in a spat of air, blowing a tassel of hair outward that hangs freely from my braid\u2014preparation to keep me from cracking.</p><p>Like it never happened, my ass.</p><p>Finally, I open the door and when I see him standing there so casually\u2014and so edible\u2014I crack. Well, it\u2019s more like a really red blush, so hot that my face literally feels like it\u2019s on fire. I look down at the floor because if I look at his smiling eyes a second longer my head might melt.</p><p>I manage to look back up at him seconds later.</p><p>His close-lipped smile is bigger now and much more telling.</p><p>Hey! I think an expression like that is the same as talking about it!</p><p>He looks me up and down, seeing that I\u2019m already dressed and ready to go and then jerks his head back a little and says with a huge grin, \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I grab my purse and my bag and head out with him.</p><p>We hop inside the car and I do what I can to distract myself from the best or*l s*x I\u2019ve ever had in my life by finding something random to talk about. He smells extra good today: natural skin with a hint of soap and some kind of shampoo. That\u2019s not helping me, either.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we just going to drive to random motels and not stop anywhere except Waffle Houses?\u201d</p><p>Not that that bothers me one bit, but I\u2019m struggling to find \u2018random\u2019 here.</p><p>He clicks his seatbelt on and starts the engine.</p><p>\u201cNo, I actually have something in mind.\u201d He glances over.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I ask, my curiosity piqued. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking from the spontaneous rule of our trip and actually have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, technically it wasn\u2019t ever a rule,\u201d he says, underlining the fact.</p><p>We back out of the parking lot and the vintage Chevelle purrs onto the road.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing the same black cargo shorts he wore yesterday and I get a quick glimpse of his rock-hard calves, one foot pressing gently on the gas pedal. A dark navy t-shirt fits his chest and arms just right, the fabric tighter around his biceps.</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s the plan, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Orleans,\u201d he says, smiling over at me. \u201cIt\u2019s only about five and a half hours from here.\u201d</p><p>My face lights up. \u201cI\u2019ve actually never been to New Orleans before.\u201d</p><p>He smiles inwardly, as if excited about being the one who gets to take me there my first time. I\u2019m as excited about it as he is. But really, I don\u2019t care where we go, even if it\u2019s the mosquito swarms of Mississippi, as long as Andrew is with me.</p><p>Two hours later, after we\u2019ve exhausted the random topics which have only been a distraction from talking about what happened last night, I decide to be the one to break it. I reach out and push the down button on the volume. Andrew looks over at me curiously.</p><p>\u201cStuff like that has never come out of my mouth before, just so you know,\u201d I get it off my chest.</p><p>Andrew grins and moves his hand down on the steering wheel, letting his fingers casually steer instead. He appears more relaxed, his left arm lying across the door on the other side of him, left knee bent upward while the right foot stays on the gas pedal.</p><p>\u201cBut you liked it,\u201d he says, \u201csaying it, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Ummm, there wasn\u2019t anything about last night that I didn\u2019t like.</p><p>My face is only a little red.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did, actually,\u201d I admit.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never thought about saying something like that during sex before,\u201d he says.</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cActually, I have.\u201d I look over sharply. \u201cNot that I sit around and dream about it though, I\u2019ve just thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever do it before then, if you had the urge?\u201d He\u2019s asking me these questions, but I\u2019m pretty sure he already knows the answers.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI guess I was just chicken shit.\u201d</p><p>He laughs lightly and moves his fingers back up the steering wheel, holding it more securely as we go around a curvy section of highway.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ve just always thought of it as something Dominique Starla or Cinnamon Dreams would say in Legally Boned or Friday Night Dikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen those flicks?\u201d</p><p>My head jerks around and I gasp. \u201cNo! I...I didn\u2019t know they were real, I was just making up\u2014.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s smile becomes playful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re real, either,\u201d he says, giving in before I die of mortification, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t doubt it, really. And I get what you mean.\u201d</p><p>My face relaxes.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s hot,\u201d he says, \u201cfor the record.\u201d</p><p>I blush some more. Might as well just leave the blush on all the time because I find myself doing it around him a lot more every day.</p><p>\u201cSo, you think p*rn stars are hot?\u201d I cringe inwardly, hoping he says no.</p><p>Andrew gently purses his lips and says, \u201cNot really, well it\u2019s hot in a different way when they do it.\u201d</p><p>My brows draw together. \u201cDifferent as in how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when...Dominique Starla,\u201d he picks the name from the air, \u201cdoes it, it\u2019s just to some random guy lookin\u2019 to get off behind a keyboard.\u201d His green eyes fall on me. \u201cThat guy\u2019s not dreaming about anything with her except her face in his lap.\u201d Then he looks back out at the road. \u201cBut when someone...I-dunno...like a sweet, sexy, completely un-slutty girl does it, the guy is thinking about a lot more than her face in his lap. He\u2019s probably not even thinking about that at all, at least on a deeper level.\u201d</p><p>I definitely caught the secret meaning behind his words and he probably knows as much.</p><p>\u201cIt drove me mad,\u201d he says, glancing at me long enough to lock eyes with me, \u201cjust so you know.\u201d But then he turns away completely and pretends to be concentrating more on the road. Maybe he doesn\u2019t want me to accuse him of \u2018talking about it\u2019, even though I\u2019m the one that started this conversation. I take full blame and I don\u2019t regret it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask, stirring the brief silence. \u201cWere you ever afraid to try something sexually you had the urge to try?\u201d</p><p>He thinks about it a moment and says, \u201cYeah, when I was younger, like around seventeen, but I was only afraid to try things with girls because I knew they were....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were what?\u201d</p><p>He smiles softly, pressing his lips together and I get the feeling there\u2019s about to be some kind of comparison.</p> <p>\u201cYounger girls, at least the ones I hung out with, were \u2018grossed out\u2019 by anything unconventional. They were probably like you in a way, secretly turned on by something different than the missionary position, but too shy to admit it. And at that age it was risky to say: \u2018Hey let me do you in the ass,\u2019 because chances are she\u2019d be freaked out by it and think you\u2019re some sexually disturbed pervert.\u201d</p><p>A laugh pushes through my lips.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re right,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, I was grossed out when Natalie would tell me things she let Damon do to her. I didn\u2019t start actually finding them hot until I lost my virginity at eighteen, but...,\u201d my voice starts to trail thinking about Ian, \u201c...but even then, I was still too nervous. I wanted to...umm...,\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nervous admitting it now.</p><p>\u201cGo on, just say it,\u201d he says, but not with any measure of playfulness. \u201cYou should know by now you can\u2019t run me off.\u201d</p> <p>That takes me aback (and makes my heart flutter). Is the truth written all over my face, that I\u2019m afraid of giving him any bad impressions of me? He smiles gently as if to give me that much more assurance that nothing I can say to him will give him a bad impression.</p><p>\u201cOK, if I tell you, do you promise not to think it\u2019s an invitation?\u201d Perhaps it is, even though I\u2019m not sure about that myself yet, but I definitely don\u2019t want him to think that. Not right now, maybe never. I don\u2019t know....</p><p>\u201cI swear,\u201d he says, his eyes serious and not at all offended, \u201cI won\u2019t think that at all.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>Ugh! I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to tell him this. I\u2019ve never told anyone; well, except for Natalie, in a roundabout way.</p><p>\u201cAggression.\u201d I pause, still feeling embarrassed to go on. \u201cMost of the time when I daydream about sex, I\u2019m...,\u201d</p> <p>His eyes are grinning! When I said \u2018aggression\u2019 something triggered in his features. It almost seems as if...no, surely that can\u2019t be right.</p><p>He softens his eyes once he notices.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he says, smiling gently again.</p><p>And I do, because for some reason I\u2019m less afraid to finish than I was seconds ago:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually dreaming about being...manhandled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRough sex turns you on,\u201d he says evenly.</p><p>I nod. \u201cThe thought of it does, but I\u2019ve never really experienced it, not in the way I think about it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He seems faintly surprised, or, is that contented?</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s what I meant when I told you I always end up with tame guys.\u201d</p><p>Something just clicked in my head: Andrew knew before me what I really meant back in Wyoming when I said I \u2018end up with\u2019 tame guys. Without realizing it, I basically expressed that ending up with them was unfortunate, something I didn\u2019t prefer. He may not have known my definition of \u2018tame\u2019 until now, but he knew before I did that it wasn\u2019t something I wanted.</p><p>But I loved Ian, and right now I feel awful for thinking this way. Ian was tame sexually, and the thought of having any bad thoughts of him at all makes me feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cSo, you like hair-pulling and...,\u201d he starts to say inquiringly, but his voice trails when he notices my eristic expression.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but more aggressive,\u201d I say suggestively, trying to get him to say it so I don\u2019t have to. I\u2019m getting nervous again.</p><p>He shifts his chin sideways, his eyebrows rise a little. \u201cWhat, like....wait, how aggressive?\u201d</p><p>I swallow and look away from his eyes. \u201cForce, I guess. Not like flat-out rape or anything extreme like that, but I have a very sexually submissive personality, I think.\u201d</p><p>Andrew can\u2019t look at me now, either.</p><p>I turn enough to see that his eyes are slightly wider than seconds ago, and full of shrouded intensity. His Adam\u2019s Apple moves gently as he swallows. Both of his hands are on the steering wheel now.</p><p>I change the subject:</p><p>\u201cYou never did technically tell me what you were afraid to ask a girl to do.\u201d I smile, hoping to bring the playful atmosphere back from before.</p><p>He relaxes and grins looking back over at me. \u201cYeah, I did,\u201d he says and adds after an odd pause, \u201canal sex.\u201d</p><p>Something tells me that\u2019s not what he was really afraid of. I can\u2019t put my finger on it, but that whole mention of anal sex I think is just a smokescreen. But why would Andrew, out of the two of us, be the one afraid to admit the truth? He\u2019s the one pretty much helping me to be more comfortable with myself sexually. He\u2019s the one who I thought wasn\u2019t afraid to admit anything, but now I\u2019m not so sure.</p><p>I wish I could read his mind.</p><p>\u201cWell, believe it or not,\u201d I say, glancing at him, \u201cIan and I did try that once, but it hurt like hell and needless to say, I mean \u2018once\u2019 in the most literal way possible.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs lightly.</p><p>Then he looks up at the road signs and seems to be making a quick route decision in his head. We ease off the highway and onto another one. More fields are sprawled out on both sides of the road. Cotton and rice and corn and no telling what else; I really don\u2019t know the difference in most crops except the obvious: cotton is white and corn is tall. We drive for hours and hours until the sun starts to set and Andrew pulls off the side of the road. The tires grind to a stop onto the gravel.</p><p>\u201cAre we lost?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He leans across the seat towards me and reaches for the glove box. His elbow and the under part of his lower arm grazes my leg as he pops the glove box and pulls out a rather worn road map. It\u2019s folded awkwardly as if after it had been opened it was never folded back into the same creases. He unfolds the map and lays it against the steering wheel, examining it closely and running his finger along it. He twists the right side of his mouth in his teeth and makes an inquisitive clicking noise with his lips.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lost, aren\u2019t we?\u201d I want to laugh, not at him, just at the situation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault,\u201d he says, trying to be serious, but failing miserably seeing as how his eyes are smiling.</p><p>I let out a spat of air. \u201cAnd how is it my fault?\u201d I argue. \u201cYou\u2019re the one driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t being so \u2018distracting\u2019, talkin\u2019 about sex and secret desires and pornography and that slut, Dominique Starla, I would\u2019ve noticed I was taking 20 instead of staying on 59 like I should have.\u201d He flicks the center of the map with the snap of his finger and shakes his head. \u201cWe drove two hours in the wrong direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hours?\u201d I laugh this time and slap the dashboard. \u201cAnd you\u2019re just now realizing this?\u201d</p><p>I hope I\u2019m not bruising his ego. Besides, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m mad or disappointed; we can drive ten hours in the wrong direction and I wouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>He looks wounded. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s faking it, but I grab a hold of this opportunity and take a chance at doing something I\u2019ve wanted to do since our time together in the rain on the roof in Tennessee. Reaching over my waist, I unlock my seatbelt and slide across the seat and sit next to him. He seems quietly surprised, but inviting as he lifts his arm so that I can curl myself underneath it. \u201cI\u2019m just messing with you about being lost,\u201d I say, laying my head against his shoulder. I feel a little bit of reluctance before his arm comes down around me.</p><p>It feels so right to be here like this. Too right....</p><p>I pretend not to notice how comfortable both of us feel right now and be as nonchalant as before. I look up into the map with him, running my finger along a new route.</p><p>\u201cWe can just go this way,\u201d I say, running my finger south, \u201cand hit 55 straight into New Orleans. Right?\u201d I tilt my head over to see his eyes and my heart jumps when I notice how close his face is to mine now. But I just smile, waiting for him to answer.</p><p>He smiles back, but I get the feeling he really didn\u2019t hear much I said. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll just hit 55.\u201d His eyes search my face and briefly skim my lips.</p><p>I reach out and start to fold the map back together and then I turn the volume back up. Andrew moves his arm from around me to put the car in gear.</p><p>When we pull away, he rests his hand on my thigh pressed next to his and we ride like that for a long time; the only time he moves his hand is to take better control of a sharp curve or to adjust the music, but he always puts right back.</p><p>And I always want him to.</p><p>21</p><p>\u201cARE YOU SURE WE\u2019RE still on 55?\u201d I ask much later after dark and haven\u2019t seen any headlights coming or going in either direction in forever, it seems.</p><p>All I see are fields and trees and the occasional cow.</p><p>\u201cYes, babe, we\u2019re still on 55; I\u2019ve made sure of that.\u201d</p><p>Just as he says that, we pass another highway sign that actually reads: 55.</p><p>I lift away from Andrew\u2019s arm, which my head has been pressed against for the past hour, and start to stretch my arms and legs and back. I lean over and massage my calf muscles afterwards; I think every muscle in my body has infused like cement around my bones.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get out and stretch your legs for a while?\u201d Andrew says.</p><p>I look over to see his face in shadow; a light blue hue is washed over his skin. His sculpted jawline looks more pronounced in the dark.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say and lean up toward the dashboard to get a better look out the windshield at what the landscape looks like. Of course. Fields and trees and\u2014there goes another cow\u2014I should\u2019ve known. But then I notice the sky. I press myself up further against the dash and look upward at the stars wrapped in the infinite blackness, noticing how easy they are to see and how many of them there are without any light pollution for miles.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get out and walk around?\u201d he asks, still waiting for the rest of my answer.</p><p>Getting an idea of my own, I smile brightly at him and nod. \u201cYes, I think that\u2019s a great idea\u2014is there a blanket in the trunk?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me curiously for a moment. \u201cActually, yes, I keep one in that box back there with the rest of my emergency roadside supplies\u2014why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it might be clich\u00e9,\u201d I begin, \u201cbut it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do\u2014have you ever slept under the stars?\u201d I feel a little silly asking, I guess because it is kind of clich\u00e9 and nothing about Andrew thus far has come anywhere near clich\u00e9.</p><p>His face spreads into a warm smile. \u201cAs a matter of fact, no, I have never slept under the stars\u2014are you gettin\u2019 all romantic on me, Camryn Bennett?\u201d He looks at me with a playful sideward stare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d I laugh. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m serious; I just think it\u2019s the perfect opportunity.\u201d I motion my hands toward the windshield. \u201cLook at all of the fields out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we can\u2019t lay a blanket out in a cotton or corn field,\u201d he says, \u201cand most of the time those fields are saturated with ankle-deep water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the ones covered with grass and cow bombs,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou want to sleep in a field where cows shit?\u201d he says casually, but equally humored.</p> <p>I snicker. \u201cNo, just the grass. Come on...,\u201d then I glare at him teasingly. \u201cWhat, are you afraid of a little cow shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaha!\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cCamryn, there\u2019s nothing little about a pile of cow shit.\u201d</p><p>I scoot back over next to him and lay my head right dead-center on his lap, looking up at him with a pouty face. \u201cPlease?\u201d I bat my eyes.</p><p>And I try hopelessly to ignore what my head is actually lying on.</p><p>ANDREW</p> <p>I ABSOLUTELY FUCKING MELT when she looks up at me like that. How would I ever say no to her? Whether it was about sleeping next to a pile of cow shit or under a bridge overpass next to a homeless drunk\u2014I would sleep anywhere with her.</p><p>But that\u2019s the problem.</p><p>I think this became a problem the second she decided to sit next to me in the car. Because that\u2019s when she changed, when I think she started to believe she wants more from me than or*l s*x. I may have done that for her back in Birmingham, but I can\u2019t let her want more than that. I can\u2019t let her touch me and I can\u2019t sleep with her.</p><p>I do want her, I want her in every way imaginable, but I can\u2019t bear to break her heart\u2014that little body of hers, that\u2019s another story; I could bear to break that. But if she ever lets me have her, breaking her heart (and mine) is what will happen in the end.</p><p>It\u2019s harder since she told me about her ex....</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she says one more time.</p> <p>Despite just giving myself the third-degree, I reach down and brush my fingertip along the side of her face and say very gently, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>I never was one to listen to reason when it came to something that I wanted, but with Camryn, I\u2019m finding myself telling reason to f**k off a lot more than usual.</p><p>Another ten minutes of driving and I find a field that looks like a flat, endless sea of grass and I park the car on the side of the road. We are literally in the middle of nowhere. We get out and lock the doors, leaving everything inside the car. I pop the trunk and rummage that roadside box for the rolled-up blanket, which smells like old car and somewhat like gasoline.</p><p>\u201cIt stinks,\u201d I say, taking a whiff.</p><p>Camryn leans in and sniffs, wrinkling her nose at it. \u201cOh, well, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t, either. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll make it smell better.</p><p>Without even thinking about it, I grab her hand and we walk down a small slope through a ditch and up the other side to the low-lining fence separating the field from us. I start looking for the easiest way for her to get over it. Next thing I know, her fingers are falling away from mine and she\u2019s climbing over the damn thing.</p><p>\u201cHurry!\u201d she says as she lands on the other side in a crouched position.</p> <p>I can\u2019t wipe the grin off my face.</p><p>I leap over the fence and land beside her and we take off running into the wide open; her like a graceful gazelle, me like the lion chasing after her. I hear her flip-flops slapping against her feet as she runs and see the way wisps of stray blonde strands of hair appear illuminated around her head as the breeze stirs it. I\u2019ve got the blanket in one hand as I run behind her, letting her stay a few steps ahead of me so if she happens to fall I\u2019ll be there to laugh at her first and then help her up afterwards. It\u2019s so dark with only the light from the moon bathing the landscape. But there\u2019s enough light that we can see where we\u2019re stepping and not fall into a chasm or trip over a tree on our way.</p><p>And I don\u2019t see any cows, which means this might be a shit-free field and that\u2019s a plus.</p><p>We get so far away from the car that the only part of it I can see anymore is the reflective glint from the silver rims.</p><p>\u201cI think this is good enough,\u201d Camryn says coming to a winded stop.</p><p>The nearest trees are thirty or forty yards out in every direction.</p><p>She raises her arms high above her head and tilts her chin back, letting the breeze rush over her. She\u2019s smiling so hugely, her eyes closed, that I\u2019m afraid to say anything and disturb her moment with nature.</p><p>I unroll the blanket and lay it on the ground.</p><p>\u201cTell me the truth,\u201d she says, curling her fingers around my wrist and guiding me to sit down on the blanket with her, \u201cyou\u2019ve never spent the night under the stars with a girl before?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>She seems to like that. I watch her smile in at me as a light wind moves between us and brushes loose hair across her face. She reaches up and moves a few pieces from in-between her lips, slipping her finger behind them carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really the rose petals-on-the-bed kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d she asks, a bit surprised. \u201cI think you\u2019re probably a really romantic guy, actually.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. Is she fishing? I think she\u2019s fishing.</p><p>\u201cI guess it depends on your definition of romantic,\u201d I say. \u201cIf a girl expects a candlelit dinner and Michael Bolton playing in the background, she\u2019s definitely got the wrong guy.\u201d</p><p>Camryn giggles.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a little too romantic,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I bet you\u2019ve had your share of romantic gestures though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d I say, honestly not really coming up with any at the moment.</p><p>She looks at me with her head cocked to one side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of those,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cOne of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys that don\u2019t like to talk about their exes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to know about my exes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She lies down on her back, leaving her bare knees drawn up and she pats the blanket beside her.</p><p>I lie next to her in the same position.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your first love,\u201d she says and already I feel like this isn\u2019t a conversation we should be having but if it\u2019s what she wants to talk about, I\u2019ll do my best to tell her what she wants to know.</p><p>I guess it\u2019s only fair since she told me about hers.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, looking up at the star-filled sky, \u201cher name was Danielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you loved her?\u201d Camryn looks over at me, letting her head fall to the side.</p><p>I keep looking at the stars.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I loved her, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you together?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m wondering why she wants to know this; most girls I know snap into that jealousy-fueled mood-swing stuff that makes me want to cover my nuts when it comes to talking about exes.</p><p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d I answer. \u201cThe break-up was mutual; we started checking out other people and I guess realized we didn\u2019t love each other as much as we thought we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, you just fell out of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we were never in love to begin with.\u201d</p><p>I look over at her this time.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know the difference?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I think about it for a moment, searching her eyes just about a foot from mine. I can smell the cinnamon toothpaste she brushed with this morning when she breathes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever really fall out of love with someone,\u201d I say and see a flicker of thought move through her eyes. \u201cI think when you fall in love, like true love, it\u2019s love for life. All the rest is just experience and delusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were so philosophical.\u201d She grins. \u201cI should tell you, that counts as romantic.\u201d</p><p>Usually, it\u2019s her doing the blushing, but she got me this time. I try not to look at her, but that\u2019s not so easy to pull off.</p><p>\u201cSo, who were you ever in love with, then?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I straighten my legs out in front of me, crossing my ankles and locking my fingers together over my stomach. I look up at the sky and from the corner of my eye see Camryn do the same.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell yeah,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m just curious.\u201d</p><p>I stare at a bright cluster of stars and say, \u201cWell, no one.\u201d</p><p>A tiny burst of air escapes her lips. \u201cOh please, Andrew; thought you were going to be honest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d I say, glancing over, \u201ca few times I thought I was in love, but\u2014why are we talking about this anyway?\u201d</p><p>Camryn lets her head fall sideways again and she isn\u2019t smiling anymore. She looks sort of sad.</p><p>\u201cI guess I was using you as my shrink again.\u201d</p><p>My eyes draw inward. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She looks away; her pretty blonde braid falls away from her shoulder and onto the blanket. \u201cBecause I\u2019m starting to think maybe I wasn\u2019t...No, I shouldn\u2019t say something like that.\u201d She\u2019s not the happy, smiling Camryn anymore that I ran out here with.</p><p>I raise my back from the blanket and prop myself up on my elbows. I look over at her curiously. \u201cYou should say whatever you feel whenever you need to. Maybe saying it is exactly what you need.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t look at me.</p><p>\u201cBut I feel guilty even thinking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, guilt is a bitch, but don\u2019t you think if you\u2019re thinking it in the first place that it just might be true?\u201d</p><p>Her head falls to the side.</p><p>\u201cJust say it. If after you say it and it doesn\u2019t feel right, then deal with that, but if you hold that shit in, the uncertainty will be a bigger bitch than the guilt will be.\u201d</p><p>She stares up at the stars again. I do, too, just to give her some time to think about it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t ever in love with Ian,\u201d she says. \u201cI did love him, a lot, but if I was in love with him...I think maybe I\u2019d still be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good observation,\u201d I say and smile slimly, hoping she might again, too. I really hate to see her frown.</p><p>Her face is blank, contemplative.</p><p>\u201cWell, what makes you believe that you were never in love with him?\u201d</p><p>She looks right at me, searching my face and then says, \u201cBecause when I\u2019m with you, I don\u2019t think about him much anymore.\u201d</p><p>I immediately lie back down and fix my gaze on the black sky. I could probably count all of those stars if I tried, just as a distraction, but there\u2019s a much bigger distraction lying next to me than all the stars in the Universe could be.</p><p>I have to stop this, and soon.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m very good company,\u201d I say with a grin lacing my voice. \u201cAnd I had your little ass crawling across that bed the other night, so yeah I can see how you might be more inclined to think of my head between your legs than anything else.\u201d I\u2019m just trying to shift her mood back to playful, even if it means she\u2019ll smack me for it and accuse me of breaking my like-it-never-happened promise.</p><p>And she does smack me, right after lifting up and propping herself on her elbows like I had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughs. \u201cAsshole!\u201d</p><p>I laugh louder; I\u2019d throw my head back if it wasn\u2019t pressed against the ground.</p><p>Then she moves closer to my side, propped up on one elbow as she looks down at me. I can feel the softness of her hair brushing against my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d she asks and it surprises me. \u201cWhen you went down on me last night, you never kissed me. Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t kiss-kiss me,\u201d she says and she\u2019s so close to my lips that I want to kiss her now, but I don\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel about that\u2014I don\u2019t like how I feel about it, but I\u2019m not sure how I should feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t feel bad, that much I do know,\u201d I say, being as vague as I can.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she probes and her expression is beginning to harden.</p><p>I give in and say, \u201cBecause kissing is very intimate.\u201d</p> <p>She cocks her head. \u201cSo, you won\u2019t kiss me for the same reason you won\u2019t f**k me?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m instantly hard. I hope like hell she doesn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say and before I have a chance to say anything else, she\u2019s crawling on top of my lap. Shit, if she didn\u2019t know I was as hard a rock then, she definitely knows now. Her bare knees are pressed against the blanket on each side of me and she leans over, her arms holding up her weight and I f**king die when she brushes her lips across mine.</p><p>She looks right into my eyes and says, \u201cI won\u2019t try to make you sleep with me, but I want you to kiss me. Just a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She really needs to move off my lap. Oh shit...it\u2019s not helping that my dick is pressed between her ass cheeks right about now. If she moves just an inch backward\u2014</p> <p>\u201cBecause I want to know what it feels like,\u201d she whispers onto my mouth.</p><p>My hands move up her legs and then her waist where I grip my fingers around her form. She smells so damn good. She feels amazing and all she\u2019s doing is sitting on me. I can\u2019t even begin to understand what she would feel like inside; the thought makes me crazy.</p><p>Then I feel her pressing herself against me through our clothes, her little h*ps moving gently, just once to persuade me, and then she stops and holds herself there. I\u2019m throbbing painfully. Her eyes search my face and my lips and all I want to do is rip off her clothes and bury my c*ck inside of her.</p><p>She leans in and places her lips over mine, slipping her warm tongue into my reluctant mouth. My tongue moves against hers slowly, tasting it first, feeling the warm wetness of it as it begins to tangle with mine. We breathe deeply into each other\u2019s mouths and, unable to resist her or deny her this one kiss, I grab each side of her face and press her forcefully against me, locking my lips around hers with ravenous intent. She moans into my mouth and I kiss her harder, wrapping one arm around her back and pulling the rest of her body closer.</p><p>And then the kiss breaks. Our lips linger on one another for a long moment until she lifts away and looks down at me with an enigmatic expression I\u2019ve never seen before, one that does something to my heart that I\u2019ve never felt before.</p><p>And then her face falls and the expression withers into the darkness, replaced by something confused and wounded, but she tries to hide it by smiling down at me.</p><p>\u201cWith a kiss like that,\u201d she says, grinning playfully as if to mask something deeper, \u201cyou\u2019d probably never have to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh; it is kind of ridiculous, but I\u2019ll let her believe what she wants.</p> <p>She crawls off my lap and lies beside me again, resting the back of her head in the cradle of her hands.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>I look up at the stars with her, but I don\u2019t see them really; she\u2019s all I can think about and about that kiss.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>And so are you....</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>We keep our eyes on the sky.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>She answers after a pause: \u201cFor everything: for making me shove your clothes into that bag instead of folding them and for turning the music down in the car so it wouldn\u2019t wake me up and for singing about raisins.\u201d Her head falls to the side and so does mine. She looks me in the eyes and says, \u201cAnd for making me feel alive.\u201d</p><p>A smile warms my face and I glance away and say, \u201cWell, everybody needs help feeling alive again every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says seriously, and my gaze falls back on hers, \u201cI didn\u2019t say again, Andrew; for making me feel alive for the first time.\u201d</p><p>My heart reacts to her words and I can\u2019t respond. But I can\u2019t look away from her, either. Reason is screaming at me again, telling me to stop this before it\u2019s too late, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m too selfish.</p><p>Camryn smiles gently and I return it and then we both gaze up at the stars again. The hot July night is just right with a light breeze blowing through the wide open space and not a cloud in the sky. There are thousands of crickets and frogs and a few whippoorwills singing into the night. I always did like to listen to those birds.</p><p>The quiet is shattered suddenly by Camryn\u2019s shrieking voice and she\u2019s jumping up from the blanket faster than a cat from a bathtub.</p><p>\u201cA snake!\u201d She\u2019s pointing with one hand and the other is clasped over her mouth. \u201cAndrew! It\u2019s right there! Kill it!\u201d</p><p>I jump up when I see something black slithering over the foot of the blanket. I jump back quickly to keep my distance and then I go to stomp on it.</p><p>\u201cNo-no-no-no!\u201d she screams, waving her hands in front of her. \u201cDon\u2019t kill it!\u201d</p><p>I blink back, confused. \u201cBut you just said to kill it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean it literally!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still freaking out, her back slightly hunched over as if shielding the rest of her body from the snake, which is hilarious.</p><p>I raise my hands out, palms-up. \u201cWhat, you want me to pretend to kill it?\u201d I laugh, shaking my head at how funny she is.</p><p>\u201cNo just\u2014there\u2019s no way I can sleep out here now.\u201d She grabs my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s just go.\u201d She\u2019s literally shaking and trying not to laugh and cry at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I say and lean over to snatch the blanket off the grass now that the snake has moved off it. I shake it out with one hand since Camryn\u2019s holding on for life to the other. Then I take her hand and we start to head back toward the car.</p><p>\u201cI hate snakes, Andrew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that, babe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m trying so hard not to laugh.</p><p>As we\u2019re walking across the field, she starts to pull me along a little, picking up the pace. She yelps when her almost-bare foot steps on a harmless soft mound of soil and I see we might not make it back to the car before she faints.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d I say, stopping her in mid-sprint. I pull her around behind me and help her onto my back, holding her straddled around my waist with her thighs in my arms.</p><p>22</p><p>CAMRYN WAKES ME UP the next morning adjusting her head on my lap in the front seat of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asks, rising up; the sun beams in through the car windows and pools against the inside of her door.</p><p>\u201cAbout half an hour from New Orleans,\u201d I say, reaching behind me and rubbing a muscle loose in my back.</p><p>We got back on the road last night after leaving the field and intended to just drive on to New Orleans, but I was so damn tired I almost fell asleep at the wheel. She had fallen asleep first. So, I pulled off the side of the road, leaned my head back and passed out. I could\u2019ve slept more comfortably in the backseat alone, but I would rather be stiff in the morning if it meant I was next to her when I woke up.</p><p>Speaking of stiff....</p><p>I wipe the blur from my eyes and move around some to work out a few muscles. And to make sure my shorts are loose enough in the front that my obvious hard-on isn\u2019t a blatant conversation piece.</p><p>Camryn stretches and yawns and then pulls her legs up and props her bare feet on the dashboard, causing her shorts to ride up far past her thighs.</p><p>Not a good idea first thing in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve been really tired,\u201d she says, pulling her fingers through her hair to break apart the braid.</p><p>\u201cYeah, if I tried to drive any longer we might\u2019ve ended up wrapped around a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna start letting me drive some, Andrew, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d I smirk at her. \u201cYou\u2019ll whine and lay your head on my lap and say please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked last night, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She has a point.</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t mind if you drive.\u201d I glance over at her and then start the engine. \u201cI promise, after New Orleans, wherever we go, I\u2019ll let you take the wheel for a while, OK?\u201d</p><p>A sweet forgiving smile lights up her face.</p><p>I pull back onto the highway after an SUV speeds past and Camryn goes back to working her fingers through her hair. Then she starts winding the hair back into a neater braid so fast and without having to look that I can\u2019t wrap my head around how something like that is done.</p><p>My eyes keep trailing back to her nak*d legs though.</p><p>I really need to stop doing that.</p><p>I turn away and glance out the window beside me, back and forth between it and the windshield.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find a laundromat soon, too,\u201d she says, snapping the rubber band in place around the end of her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of clean clothes.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to \u2018adjust myself\u2019 and when she starts looking down into her purse, I take it.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d she asks, looking over at me with one hand in her purse.</p><p>I move my hand away from my lap, thinking I\u2019m getting away with it appearing to be nothing more than making my shorts more comfortable when she says, \u201cThat all guys get massive hard-ons in the mornings?\u201d</p><p>My eyes grow bigger in my face. I just watch out the windshield.</p><p>\u201cNot every morning,\u201d I say, still trying not to look at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat, just like Tuesdays and Fridays or something?\u201d</p><p>I know she\u2019s smiling, but I refuse to confirm it.</p><p>\u201cIs this a Tuesday or Friday?\u201d she adds, taunting me.</p><p>Finally, I glance over at her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Friday,\u201d I say simply.</p><p>She lets out an aggravated breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a slut, or anything,\u201d she says, dropping her legs from the dashboard, \u201cand I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t think that since you are the one who has sort of pushed me to be more open with my sexuality and what I want....\u201d Her voice trails. It\u2019s as if she\u2019s waiting for me to confirm what she just said, like she\u2019s still worried of what I might think of her.</p><p>I look right into her eyes. \u201cNo, I would never think you were a slut unless you went around screwing a bunch of guys, for which then I would be in jail because I would have to beat the f**k out of all of them\u2014but no, why are you saying this?\u201d</p><p>She blushes and I swear her shoulders almost come up around her cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I was just thinking...,\u201d she\u2019s still not sure if she wants to say it, whatever it is.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you, babe?

It\u2019ll be like it never happened.\u201d</p><p>Ah, shit! Why didn\u2019t I see that coming?</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say instantly.</p><p>She flinches.</p><p>I soften my face and my voice. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do anything like that for me, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t\u2014God, I want to, you have no idea, but I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s getting seriously aggravated.</p><p>\u201cWait...,\u201d she looks at me inquiringly and turns her face at an angle, \u201cyou got some kind of \u2018issue\u2019 down there?\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cUmmm, no?\u201d I say with wide eyes. \u201cShit, I\u2019ll pull over and show you.\u201d</p><p>She throws her head back and laughs and then gets serious again:</p><p>\u201cWell you won\u2019t have sex with me, you won\u2019t let me get you off and I had to force you to kiss me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t force me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she snaps, \u201cI seduced it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed you because I wanted to,\u201d I say. \u201cI want to do everything with you, Camryn. Trust me! In just a few days I\u2019ve imagined more positions with you than there are in the Kama Sutra. I\u2019ve wanted to\u2014.\u201d I notice I\u2019m white-knuckling the steering wheel.</p><p>She looks wounded, but this time I don\u2019t break.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d I say carefully, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything like that with you or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll have to let you own me,\u201d she finishes my sentence angrily, \u201cyeah, I remember what you said, but what does that mean exactly: let you own me?\u201d</p><p>I think Camryn knows exactly what it means, but she wants to be sure of it herself.</p><p>Wait a second...she\u2019s playing games with me; either that or she still doesn\u2019t know what she wants, sexually or otherwise and she\u2019s just as confused and reluctant as I am.</p> <p>CAMRYN</p><p>HE PASSED MY TEST. I\u2019d be a liar if I said I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him, or pleasure him in other ways like he did for me\u2014I totally want to do all of those things with him. But really I wanted to see if he would take the bait. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>And now I\u2019m terrified of him.</p><p>I\u2019m terrified because of how I feel about him. I shouldn\u2019t feel this way and I hate myself for it.</p><p>I said I would never do it. I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t....</p><p>Trying to gain some sense of lighthearted normalcy back in our conversation, I smile gently at him. All I want to do is take back the offer and go back to how we were before I brought it up, except with the knowledge I have now: Andrew Parrish respects me and wants me in ways that I don\u2019t think I can give him.</p><p>I bring my knees toward me, propping my feet on the leather seat. I don\u2019t want him to answer my last question: what does it mean to let him own me? I hope he forgets that I asked at all. I already know what it means, or at least I think I do: to own me is to be with him, the way I was with Ian. Except with Andrew I believe in my heart that I could fall in love with him, true love. So easily I could. Already I can\u2019t stand the thought of being away from him. Already all of the faces in my daydreams have been replaced with Andrew\u2019s face. And already, I dread the day our road trip ends, when he has to go back to Galveston or to Wyoming and to leave me behind.</p><p>Why does it scare me? And where did this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach come from all of a sudden?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe, I really am. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. Not in any way.\u201d</p><p>I look up and over at him and then I shake my head hard. \u201cYou haven\u2019t hurt me. Please don\u2019t think you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>I go on:</p><p>\u201cAndrew, the truth is...,\u201d I take a very deep breath. He\u2019s having a hard time keeping his eyes on the road now. \u201c...the truth is that I\u2014well, first off, I won\u2019t lie and say that pleasuring you isn\u2019t something that I wouldn\u2019t do\u2014I would do it. But I want you to know that I\u2019m glad you refused me.\u201d</p><p>I think he understands. I can see it in his face.</p><p>He smiles gently and reaches out his hand to me. I take it and scoot over next to him and he wraps his arm around my shoulder. I tilt my chin upward to see him and drape my fingers over his thigh.</p><p>He is so beautiful to me....</p><p>\u201cYou scare me,\u201d I finally say.</p><p>My admission sparks a faint reaction in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI said I would never do this; you have to understand. I promised myself that I would never get close to anyone again.\u201d</p><p>I feel his arm harden around my arm and the beating of his heart has picked up speed; it thumps rapidly against the side of my throat.</p><p>Then a grin slides across his mouth and he says, \u201cAre you in love with me, Camryn Bennett?\u201d</p><p>I blush super-hard and twist my lips into a hard line, pressing my face deeper against his hard pec.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I say with a smile in my voice, \u201cbut I\u2019m gettin\u2019 there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit,\u201d he says, squeezing my arm a little tighter.</p><p>He kisses the top of my hair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I say with the same amount of jest in my voice as was in his and then my voice trails, \u201cI know....\u201d</p><p>I get my very first glimpse of New Orleans from afar: Lake Pontchartrain and eventually the sprawling landscape of cottages and townhouses and bungalows. I\u2019m in awe of it: from the Superdome, which I\u2019ll always be able to recognize after seeing it all over the news during Katrina, to the giant, expansive oak trees that are creepy and beautiful and old, and to the people shuffling along the streets of the French Quarter, though I think most of them are tourists.</p><p>And as we drive along, I\u2019m mesmerized by the familiar balconies, which wrap around the entire length of many of the buildings. They look just like they do on TV, except that Mardi Gras isn\u2019t going on and no one\u2019s flashing their boobs or throwing beads from the balconies.</p><p>Andrew smiles over at me, seeing how excited I am to be here.</p><p>\u201cI love it already,\u201d I say, curling back up next to him after practically pressing my face against the window looking out at everything for the past several minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a great city.\u201d He beams, proudly; I wonder just how intimate he is with this place.</p><p>\u201cI try to come every year,\u201d he says, \u201cusually Mardi Gras, but anytime of the year is good, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you usually come when there are boobs.\u201d I wink at him.</p><p>\u201cGuilty!\u201d he says, moving both hands from the steering wheel and holding them up in surrender.</p><p>We get two rooms at the Holiday Inn in walking distance to the famous Bourbon Street. I almost told him to just get a single room with two beds this time, but I stopped myself. No, Camryn, you\u2019re just feeding the desire. Don\u2019t move into a room with him. Stop this while you can.</p><p>And for a moment as we stood side by side at the counter when the clerk asked how he could \u2018help us\u2019, Andrew had paused and I got the strangest feeling from it. But we ended up with side-by-side king rooms, like always.</p><p>I head toward mine and he strolls over to his. We look at each other in the hallway with our keycards in our hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hop in the shower,\u201d he says, holding the guitar in one hand, \u201cbut whenever you\u2019re ready, just come on over and let me know.\u201d</p><p>I nod and we smile at each other before we disappear inside our rooms.</p><p>Not five minutes in and I hear my phone buzzing around inside my purse. Pretty sure it\u2019s my mom, I pull it out and am prepared to answer and tell her that I\u2019m still alive and I\u2019m having a good time, but I see that it\u2019s not her.</p><p>It\u2019s Natalie.</p><p>My hand just freezes around the phone as I stare down at the glowing screen. Should I answer it, or not? Well, I better figure it out quick.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam?\u201d Natalie says in a careful voice on the other end.</p><p>I can\u2019t get any words out yet. I\u2019m not sure if enough time has passed that I should be pretend-unforgiving, or if I should be nice.</p><p>\u201cAre you there?\u201d she asks when I don\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Nat, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She sighs and makes that weird whiney, moaning sound she always does when she\u2019s nervous about saying or doing something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a total f**king bitch,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that and I\u2019m a horrible best friend and I should be groveling at your feet right now for forgiveness, but I...well, that was the plan, but your mom said you were in...Virginia? What the hell are you doing in Virginia?\u201d</p><p>I plop down on the bed and kick my flip-flops off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in Virginia,\u201d I say, \u201cbut don\u2019t tell my mom or anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then where are you? And where could you be for over a week?\u201d</p><p>Wow, has it only been a week? It feels like I\u2019ve been on the road with Andrew for a month at least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in New Orleans, but it\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, well, hell-o?\u201d she says sarcastically, \u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of time.\u201d</p><p>Getting irritated with her quickly, I sigh and say, \u201cNatalie, you\u2019re the one who called me. And if I remember correctly, you\u2019re the one who called me a lying bitch and didn\u2019t believe me when I told you what Damon did. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think jumping right back into being best friends and acting like nothing happened, is the best thing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re right and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She pauses to gather her thoughts and I can hear the tab on a can of soda crack open in the background. She takes a small sip. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t believe you, Cam, I was just really hurt. Damon is a bastard. I dumped him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, because you caught him cheating in the act as opposed to believing your best friend since second grade when she tells you he\u2019s a pig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI deserved that,\u201d she says, \u201cbut no, I didn\u2019t catch him cheating. I just realized I missed my best friend and that I committed the worst crime against the Code of Best Friends. I finally confronted him about it and of course he lied, but I just kept nagging at him about it because I wanted him to admit it to me. Not because I needed the validation from him, but I just...Cam, I just wanted him to tell me the truth. I wanted it to come from him.\u201d</p><p>I hear the pain in her voice. I know she means what she\u2019s saying and I intend to fully forgive her, but I\u2019m not ready to let her know I forgive her enough to tell her about Andrew. I don\u2019t know what it is, but it\u2019s like the only person that exists in my world right now is Andrew. I love Natalie with all my heart, but I\u2019m not ready for her to know yet. I\u2019m not ready to share him with her. She has a way of...cheapening an experience, if that\u2019s fair to say. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, Nat,\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t hate you and I want to forgive you, but it\u2019s going to take some time; you really hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she says, but I detect the disappointment in her voice, too. Natalie has always been an impatient, instant-gratification kind of girl.</p><p>\u201cWell, are you alright?\u201d she asks. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you\u2019d run off to New Orleans of all places\u2014is this hurricane season?\u201d</p><p>I hear the shower running in Andrew\u2019s room.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m doing great,\u201d I say, thinking about Andrew. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Nat, I\u2019ve never felt so alive and as happy as I have been this past week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God...it\u2019s a guy! You\u2019re with a guy, aren\u2019t you? Camryn Marybeth Bennett, you f**king bitch you better not keep these things from me!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s exactly what I mean by cheapening the experience.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d She gasps loudly as though the answer to the world\u2019s mysteries just fell into her lap. \u201cYou got laid! Is he hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, please,\u201d I shut my eyes and pretend she\u2019s a mature twenty-year-old and not still stuck on the high school campus. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna talk about this with you right now, alright? Just give me a few days and I\u2019ll call you and let you know how things are going, but please\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it!\u201d she says, agreeing, but not at all getting the hint that she needs to tone her enthusiasm down a notch. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re OK and you don\u2019t still hate me, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Finally, she comes down from her horny gossip cloud:</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry, Cam. I can\u2019t say it enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I believe you. And when I call you later, you can also tell me what happened with Damon. If you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, \u201csounds good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later....and Nat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really glad you called. I\u2019ve missed you a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I just stare at the phone for a minute until my thoughts of Natalie fade into my thoughts of Andrew. Just like I said: all of the faces in my daydreams have become Andrew\u2019s face.</p><p>I take a shower and put on a pair of jeans which still haven\u2019t been washed, but they don\u2019t stink so I guess it\u2019s OK for now. But if I don\u2019t get my clothes washed soon I\u2019m going to be hitting another department store for something new. I\u2019m just glad I packed twelve pairs of clean panties in that duffle bag of mine.</p><p>I start to put on makeup and do the usual, but then I let my fingers rest on the bathroom sink and I look at myself in the mirror, trying to see what Andrew sees. He\u2019s almost seen me at my absolute worst: no makeup, circles under my eyes after being awake on the road for so long, nasty breath, wild, grungy hair\u2014I smile thinking about it and then picture him standing behind me, right now, in the mirror. I see his mouth buried in the curve of my neck and his hard arms wrapped around my body from behind, his fingers pressing against my ribs.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on my room door, snapping me out of my daydream.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Andrew asks when I open the door for him.</p><p>He comes the rest of the way into the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going, anyway?\u201d I ask walking back into the bathroom where my makeup is. \u201cAnd I need some clean clothes. Seriously.\u201d</p><p>He walks up behind me and it shocks me a little because it almost feels like that daydream I was having moments ago. I start to put on mascara, leaning over the sink toward the mirror. I squint the left eye while applying mascara to the right eye while Andrew checks out my butt. He\u2019s not being secret about it at all. He wants me to see him being bad. I roll my eyes at him and go back to my mascara, switching to the other eye.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a laundry facility on the twelfth floor,\u201d he says.</p><p>He locks his hands around my h*ps and looks at me in the mirror with a devilish grin and his bottom lip pinned between his teeth.</p><p>I swing around.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s the first place we\u2019re going,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks disappointed. \u201cNo, I want to go out, walk around the town, have a few beers, see a few bands play. I don\u2019t want to do laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quit whining,\u201d I say and turn around back to the mirror whipping my lipstick out of my bag. \u201cIt\u2019s not even two o\u2019clock in the afternoon\u2014you\u2019re not one of those beer-for-breakfast guys, are you?\u201d</p><p>He flinches and presses his palm against his heart, pretending to be wounded. \u201cAbsolutely not! I wait at least until lunch.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and push him out of the bathroom; toothy, dimpled smile and all, and then shut the door with him on the other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he says through the door.</p><p>\u201cI have to pee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t have looked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get your dirty clothes from your room, Andrew!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Andrew! Or, we\u2019re not going out later!\u201d</p><p>I can picture his bottom lip puckered out, though of course that\u2019s totally not what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s grinning a hole through that damn door.</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d he says and then I hear the room door open and then shut behind him.</p><p>When I\u2019m done in the bathroom, I gather up all of my dirty laundry and stuff it into my sling bag and I slip on my flip-flops.</p><p>23</p><p>WE DO LAUNDRY FIRST and while we\u2019re there I do fold everything after I take it out of the dryer, rather than shoving it all back into the bags. He tries to protest, but I get my way this time. Afterwards, we hit the town and he takes me everywhere, even to the St. Louis cemetery where the tombs are above ground and I\u2019ve never seen anything like that before. We walk together all the way down Canal Street toward the World Trade Center New Orleans and the ocean where we find a much-needed Starbucks. We talk forever over coffee and I tell him that I got a call from Natalie last night. And we go on and on about her and Damon, who Andrew has grown quickly to detest.</p><p>Later we pass up a steak house which Andrew tries to get me to stop with him at by throwing that deal I made with him back on the bus in my face. But I\u2019m not the slightest bit hungry and try to explain to a whimpering steak-deprived Andrew that I have to be ready for a big meal if he wants me to enjoy a steak.</p><p>And we find a mall: The Shops at Canal Place, where I am actually excited to go after being stuck wearing the same boring clothes for the past week.</p><p>\u201cBut we just did laundry,\u201d Andrew protests as we head inside. \u201cWhat do you need new clothes for?\u201d</p><p>I hoist my purse strap on the opposite shoulder and grab him by the elbow.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going out tonight,\u201d I say, dragging him along, \u201cthen I want to find something cute that looks halfway decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what you\u2019re wearing now is cute as hell,\u201d he argues.</p><p>\u201cI just want a new pair of jeans and a top,\u201d I say then stop and look at him. \u201cYou can help me pick it out.\u201d</p><p>That got his attention.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, smiling.</p><p>I pull him along again. \u201cBut don\u2019t get your hopes up,\u201d I say, jerking his arm in emphasis, \u201cI said you can help, not choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure are getting your way a lot today,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should know, babe, I\u2019ll only let you get away with so much before I start playing my cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat cards do you think you have to play exactly?\u201d I question with confidence because I think he\u2019s bluffing.</p><p>He purses his lips when I glance over and my confidence is starting to drain.</p><p>\u201cIf you recall,\u201d he says all sophisticatedly, \u201cyou\u2019re still on whatever-I-say duty.\u201d</p><p>Confidence lost.</p><p>He grins and jerks my arm towards him this time.</p><p>\u201cAnd since you already let me go down on you once,\u201d he adds and my eyes widen, \u201cI think I could tell you to lie back and spread your legs and you\u2019d have to listen, right?\u201d</p><p>I can barely move my eyes around to see if anyone walking by had heard him. Andrew didn\u2019t exactly say that in a whisper, but I wouldn\u2019t expect as much.</p><p>Then he slows our pace and leans in toward my ear and says quietly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t let me have my way with something simpler soon, I might have to torture you again with my tongue between your legs.\u201d His breath on my ear, combined with his wetness-inducing words, sends shivers up the side of my neck. \u201cBall\u2019s in your court, babe.\u201d</p><p>He pulls away and I want to slap that grin off his face, but he\u2019d probably like it.</p><p>Dilemma? Let him have his way with something simple, or keep getting my way and him \u2018torture\u2019 me later? Hmmm. I guess I\u2019m more of a masochist than I thought.</p><p>The night falls and I\u2019m ready for our night out. I\u2019m wearing a new pair of tight jeans, a sexy black strapless top that hugs my waist and the cutest black heels I\u2019ve ever found in any mall.</p><p>Andrew gawks at me in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI should play my card right now,\u201d he says coming into the room.</p><p>I\u2019ve braided my hair into two loose braids this time, one resting over each shoulder, stopping just above my br**sts. And I always leave a few strands of blonde hair to fall freely about my face because I always thought it was cute on other girls, so why not me?</p><p>Andrew seems to like it. He reaches up and slides each one within his fingers.</p><p>I blush inwardly.</p><p>\u201cBabe, no f**king joke, you are smokin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks....\u201d Oh my God, did I just...giggle.</p><p>I look him up and down, too, and although he\u2019s back to jeans and a simple t-shirt and his black Doc Martens, he\u2019s the sexiest thing I\u2019ve ever seen no matter what he\u2019s wearing.</p><p>We head out and I turn a few old guy\u2019s heads in the elevator and down the hall. Andrew is eating the hell out of that, I can tell. He\u2019s beaming walking next to me and it just makes my face beet red.</p><p>We hang out at d.b.a first and watch a band play for about an hour. But when I get carded and it looks like I\u2019m not going to get to drink here, Andrew takes me farther down the street to another bar.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hit or miss,\u201d he says as we approach the bar, hand in hand. \u201cMost of them will card you, but every now and then you get lucky and they don\u2019t bother if you look twenty-one enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be twenty-one in five months,\u201d I say, gripping his hand as we cross a busy intersection.</p><p>\u201cI was worried you were seventeen when I met you on the bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeventeen?!\u201d I hope like hell I don\u2019t actually look that young.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says glancing over once, \u201cI\u2019ve seen fifteen-year-olds that look twenty\u2014hard to tell anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I look seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you look about twenty,\u201d he admits, \u201cI\u2019m just sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s a relief.</p><p>This bar is slightly smaller than the last and the people in it are a mixture of fresh-out-of-college and early thirty-something\u2019s. A few pool tables are set side by side near the back and the lighting is dim in the place, mostly localized over the pool tables and in the hallway to my right, leading into the restrooms. The cigarette smoke is thick unlike the last place where it was non-existent, but it doesn\u2019t bother me much. I\u2019m not fond of cigarettes, but there\u2019s something natural about cigarette smoke in a bar. It would almost seem nak*d without it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some kind of familiar rock music is playing from the speakers in the ceiling. There\u2019s a small stage to the left where bands usually play, but no one\u2019s playing tonight. That doesn\u2019t diminish the party-like mood in the atmosphere though, because I can barely hear Andrew talking to me over the music and the shouting voices all around me.</p><p>\u201cCan you play pool?\u201d he leans in, shouting near my ear.</p><p>I shout back, \u201cI have a few times! But I suck at it!\u201d</p><p>He tugs my hand and we walk toward the pool tables and the brighter light, pushing our way carefully through people standing around in just about every available walkable space.</p> <p>\u201cSit here,\u201d he says, able to lower his voice a little with the speakers in front of us. \u201cThis\u2019ll be our table.\u201d</p><p>I sit down at a small round table pressed against a wall where just over my head and to my left there is a staircase leading up to a second floor on the other side of me. I nudge the cigarette-laden ashtray across the table and away from me with the tip of my finger as a waitress walks up.</p><p>Andrew is talking to a guy a few feet away next to the pool tables, probably about joining a game.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d the waitress says, taking the ashtray and replacing it with a clean one, setting it upside-down upon the table. She washes the top of the table off afterwards with a wet rag, lifting the ashtray to get the spot under it.</p><p>I smile up at her. She\u2019s a pretty black-haired girl, probably just turned twenty-one herself and she\u2019s holding a serving tray on one hand.</p> <p>\u201cCan I get yah anything?\u201d</p><p>I only have one chance to act like I\u2019m asked that question a lot without being carded, so I say almost immediately, \u201cI\u2019ll have a Heineken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake that two,\u201d Andrew says stepping back up with a pool stick in his hand.</p><p>The waitress does a double-take when she notices him, and like Andrew in the elevator with me, I\u2019m eating the hell out of it. She nods and glances back down at me with that you-are-one-lucky-bitch look before walking away.</p><p>\u201cThat guy\u2019s got one more game and then we\u2019ve got the table,\u201d he says, sitting down on the empty chair.</p><p>The waitress comes back with two Heineken\u2019s and sets them in front of us.</p> <p>\u201cJust wave if yah need anything,\u201d she says before leaving again.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t card you,\u201d he says, leaning across the table so no one will hear.</p><p>\u201cNo, but that doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t eventually get carded\u2014that happened once in a bar in Charlotte; Natalie and me were almost drunk by the time we were carded and sent packing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then just enjoy it while you can.\u201d He smiles, bringing his beer to his lips and taking a quick drink.</p><p>I do the same.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to wish I hadn\u2019t brought my purse so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep up with it, but when it\u2019s our turn to play a game of pool, I set it on the floor under our table. We\u2019re kind of off in a cubby-hole so I\u2019m not too worried about it.</p><p>Andrew takes me over to the stick rack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d he asks, waving his hands across the space in front of the rack. \u201cYou have to pick one that feels right.\u201d</p> <p>Oh, this is going to be fun; he actually thinks he\u2019s teaching me something.</p><p>I play coy and clueless, scanning the pool sticks like one might books on a shelf and then take one down. I run my hands along the length of it and hold it out like I would to hit a ball, as if to get the feel of it. I know I look totally dumb-blonde right about now, but that\u2019s exactly how I want to look.</p><p>\u201cThis one\u2019s as good as any,\u201d I say with a shrug.</p><p>Andrew racks the balls in the triangular rack, switching solid for stripe all around until he gets the sequence right and then slides them across the table and into position. Carefully, he removes the rack and shoves it in a slot underneath the table.</p><p>He nods. \u201cWant to break em\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, you can.\u201d</p><p>I just want to see him lookin\u2019 all sexy, concentrating and leaning over the table.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d he says and positions the cue ball. He spends a few seconds twisting the head of his stick into a square of chalk and then sets the chalk on the side of the table.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve played before,\u201d he says, moving back around in position with the cue ball, \u201cthen I\u2019m sure you know the basics.\u201d He points the end of the stick at the cue ball. \u201cObviously, you only hit the white ball.\u201d</p><p>This is funny, but he\u2019s got this one comin\u2019.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re stripes, the only balls you want to sink in any pockets are the striped balls\u2014hit one of the solids and you\u2019re only helping me beat you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that black ball?\u201d I point at the 8 ball near the center.</p><p>\u201cIf you sink that one before all of your stripes,\u201d he says with a grim face, \u201cyou lose. And if you sink the white ball, you lose your turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d I ask, twisting the head of my stick in a square of chalk now.</p><p>\u201cFor now, yeah,\u201d he says; I guess he\u2019s letting me slide about the few other basic rules.</p><p>Andrew takes a couple steps back and leans over the table, arching his fingers on the blue felt and resting the stick strategically within the curl of his index finger. He slides the stick back and forth a couple of times to steady his aim before pausing and then slamming the head of it into the cue ball, scattering the others all over the table.</p><p>Good break, baby, I say to myself.</p><p>He sinks two\u2014one stripe, one solid.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll it be?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll what be?\u201d I continue to play dumb.</p><p>\u201cSolids or stripes? I\u2019ll let you choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say as if I\u2019m just getting it, \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter; I\u2019ll take the ones with stripes, I guess.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re straying a little from the proper way to play 8 Ball, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s doing it for my benefit.</p><p>My turn comes and I walk around the table searching for that perfect shot. \u201cAre we calling them, or what?\u201d</p><p>Andrew looks at me curiously\u2014maybe I should\u2019ve said it more like: Do I hit any of my balls that I want? Surely, he\u2019s not onto me already.</p><p>\u201cJust pick any striped ball you think you can sink and go for it.\u201d</p><p>OK, looks like I\u2019m still hustling his clueless butt.</p><p>\u201cWait, aren\u2019t we going to bet something?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks surprised, but then surprise turns to devious.</p><p>\u201cSure, what do you want to bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy freedom back.\u201d</p><p>Andrew frowns. But then his delicious lips turn upward again once he realizes that I apparently don\u2019t know how to play pool.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little hurt you would want it back,\u201d he says, switching the stick back and forth between his hands with one end of it standing against the floor, \u201cbut sure, I\u2019ll take that bet.\u201d</p><p>Just when I think the agreement has been made he adds, putting up one finger: \u201cHowever, if I win, I get to take that do-whatever-I-say to a whole new level.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to raise a brow.</p><p>\u201cA whole new level how?\u201d I ask in a leery, sidelong glance.</p><p>Andrew rests his stick against the table and props his hands on the edge, leaning into view of the light. His deep-set grin, just the shear intent behind it, sends a shiver up my back.</p><p>\u201cIs it a bet, or not?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure I can beat him, but now he kind of has me scared shitless. What if he\u2019s better than me and I lose this bet and end up eating those bugs or hanging my bare ass out of the moving car? Those were the types of things I wanted to keep him from eventually trying to force me to do\u2014I never did forget that he said: we\u2019ll get to that. Sure, I could refuse anything he told me; he assured me of that before we left Wyoming, but not having to go through all that in the first place is all I wanted.</p><p>Or...wait...what if it\u2019s sexual in nature?</p><p>Oh, it\u2019s on now...I almost hope that he does win.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d</p><p>He smiles wickedly and pulls away from the table, taking his stick with him.</p><p>A small group of guys and two girls just finished their game at the table next to ours and a few of them have started watching us.</p><p>I lean over the table, position my stick much the same way Andrew had, slide it back and forth through my fingers a few times and smack the cue ball dead-center. 11 smacks into 15 and 15 smacks into 10, sinking both of them into a corner pocket.</p><p>Andrew just looks at me, his pool stick resting vertically between his fingers in front of him.</p><p>He raises a brow. \u201cWas that beginner\u2019s luck, or am I being hustled?\u201d</p><p>I grin and walk around to the other side of the table to gauge my next shot. I don\u2019t answer. I just smile faintly and keep my eyes on the table. Purposely taking the shot closest to Andrew, I bend over the table in front of him (covertly glancing down to make sure my boobs aren\u2019t in full view of the guys watching directly across from me) and measure my shot before hitting the 9 hard into the side pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being hustled,\u201d Andrew says behind me, \u201cand teased.\u201d</p><p>I rise up and skim my grinning eyes across his as I make my way to the end of the table.</p><p>I miss this shot on purpose. The table is set almost perfectly and I might actually be able to pull off an easy win, but I don\u2019t want it to be easy.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell no, babe,\u201d he says stepping up, \u201cnone of that pity-shot bullshit\u2014you could\u2019ve sank the 13 easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy finger slipped.\u201d I look at him coyly.</p><p>He shakes his beautiful head at me and narrows his eyes, knowing full-well I\u2019m lying.</p><p>Finally, we just go at it: he sinks three balls flawlessly, one turn after the next, before missing the 7. I sink another one. Then he sinks one. And we do this back and forth, taking our time with each shot, but both of us missing every now and then to keep the game going.</p><p>Now it\u2019s down to business. It\u2019s my turn and the only balls left on the table are his 4, the cue and the 8. The 8 is six inches too far from a perfect corner shot in either direction, but I know I can bank it on one side of the table and let it come back to this side and sink it in the left.</p><p>Two more guys have started watching, no doubt because of the way I\u2019m dressed (I\u2019ve been listening to their quiet comments about my \u2018t-n-a\u2019 the whole time, especially when I bend over to take a shot), but I don\u2019t let them distract me. Though, I\u2019ve noticed Andrew\u2019s eyes on them a lot and it excites me that he\u2019s at all jealous.</p><p>I point my stick at the table and call it, \u201cLeft pocket.\u201d</p><p>I move around to the side and crouch down at eye-level with the table to see if my lining is off. I stand back up and check the lining of the cue and the 8 again from another perspective and then lean over the table. One. Two. Three. On the forth slide-back, I smack the cue gently and it hits the 8 at just the right angle, sending it against the right side of the table where it bounces back a few inches over and sinks flawlessly into the left pocket.</p><p>The few guys watching on the other side of me make various noises of tamed excitement as if I can\u2019t hear them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andrew is on the other side of the table grinning wide at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good, babe,\u201d he says racking the balls again. \u201cI guess you\u2019re free now.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but notice that he seems a little sad about that fact. His face may be smiling, but he can\u2019t hide the disappointment in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d I say, \u201cI don\u2019t want that freedom unless it comes to eating bugs or hanging my ass out the car window\u2014I kind of like you being in control of the rest.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew smiles.</p><p>24</p><p>WE PLAY ANOTHER GAME, which he wins fairly, and afterwards I decide to sit back down at our table before these new shoes start rubbing blisters on my feet. I\u2019m on my second Heineken and still am only feeling it in my toes and the bottom of my stomach. It\u2019ll take another one to get me a good buzz.</p><p>\u201cWant a game, man?\u201d a guy asks stepping up to Andrew just as he starts to sit down with me.</p><p>Andrew looks over and I wave him on.</p> <p>\u201cGo on, I\u2019m fine\u2014gonna check my messages and rest my feet for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, babe,\u201d he says, \u201cjust let me know if you\u2019re ready to go before I\u2019m done and we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I say, urging him, \u201cgo on and play.\u201d</p><p>He smiles in at me and walks back over to the table not more than fifteen feet away. I get my purse from underneath the table and set it in front of me, rummaging inside in search of my phone.</p><p>Just as I suspected: Natalie has blown my phone up with text messages, sixteen in all, but at least she hasn\u2019t tried to call. My mom hasn\u2019t called, either, but I remember she was going on that cruise with her new boyfriend this weekend. I hope she\u2019s having a great time. I hope she\u2019s having as great of a time as I am.</p><p>A new song starts funneling through the speakers in the ceiling and I notice the amount of people inside the bar have tripled since we got here. Even though Andrew isn\u2019t that far away, I can only see his lips moving when he says anything to the guy he\u2019s shooting pool with. The waitress comes back and I ask for another beer and she goes off to get it, leaving me to the Text Message Queen. Natalie and I go back and forth a few times about what she did today and where she\u2019s going tonight, but I know it\u2019s all just filler-conversation, taking place of what she\u2019s dying to know more about: me in New Orleans with this \u2018mystery guy\u2019, who he looks like (not \u2018what\u2019 because she always compares guys to famous people) and if I\u2019ve \u2018bent over for him\u2019 yet. I keep everything vague just to torture her. She still deserves it, after all. Besides, I\u2019m still not ready to go into Andrew with her. Not with anyone, really. It\u2019s like if I talk about him at all, even just to confirm he exists and that I\u2019m with him, that this whole experience will go up in a puff of smoke. I\u2019ll jinx it. Or, I\u2019ll wake up and realize that Blake slipped something in one of the drinks he served me that night before I went out onto the roof with him and I\u2019ve just been hallucinating this entire road trip with Andrew.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Mitchell,\u201d a voice says above me, accompanied by a strong waft of whiskey and cheap men\u2019s cologne.</p><p>The guy is of average build, the buff-but-not-too-buff kind. His eyes are bloodshot like the blond-haired guy standing next to him.</p><p>I smile back squeamishly and glance at Andrew who is already walking this way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with someone,\u201d I say gently.</p><p>The buff guy looks at the other chair and then back at me as if to make note of how empty it is.</p><p>\u201cCamryn?\u201d Andrew says standing behind them. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I say.</p><p>The buff guy turns at the waist to see Andrew.</p> <p>\u201cShe said she\u2019s fine,\u201d he says and I hear the challenge in his voice.</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean \u2018I\u2019m fine, leave me alone, Andrew\u2019 and Andrew knows as much, but these guys apparently do not.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s with me,\u201d Andrew says, trying to remain calm, though probably only for my sake\u2014he already has that unmistakable look of aggression in his eyes.</p><p>The blond guy laughs.</p><p>The buff guy looks at me again, a bottle of Budweiser in one hand. \u201cIs he your boyfriend or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>The buff guy smiles tauntingly and looks back at Andrew, cutting me off. \u201cYou\u2019re not her boyfriend, so back off, man.\u201d</p><p>Aggression just shifted into murderous rampage. Andrew isn\u2019t going to be able to hold back much longer.</p><p>I stand up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wants to talk to us,\u201d the buff guy says and takes another swig of his beer. He doesn\u2019t look drunk, just buzzed.</p><p>Andrew steps up closer and cocks his head to one side, staring the guy down. Then he looks at me:</p><p>\u201cCamryn, do you want to talk them?\u201d</p><p>He knows that I don\u2019t, but this is his way of adding vinegar to the wound he\u2019s about to give this guy.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Andrew rounds his chin and I can see his nostrils flare as he gets in the buff guy\u2019s face and says, \u201cBack the f**k off or you\u2019re eatin\u2019 your teeth.\u201d</p><p>The small crowd from around the pool tables is gathering at a distance.</p><p>The blond guy, the smarter one of the two, puts his hand on his shoulder. \u201cCome on, man, let\u2019s head back over.\u201d He nods toward wherever they must\u2019ve been sitting before.</p><p>The buff guy pushes his hand off him and steps up in Andrew\u2019s face further.</p><p>That\u2019s all it took.</p><p>Andrew rears back with the pool stick and bashes it across the guy\u2019s chest, knocking him from his feet and the breath from his lungs. The guy stumbles backward, narrowly missing my table but reaches out to grab the edge of it to keep him on his feet. I yelp and yank my purse from the top of it just before it goes crashing onto the floor with him. My beer shatters against the floor. Before the guy can get up, Andrew is on top him, standing over him raining his fists down on his face.</p><p>I push myself farther away and closer to the end of the staircase, but other people are rushing in to see now and they create a barrier behind me.</p><p>The blond guy jumps on Andrew from behind, grabbing him around the neck to pull him off his friend. Then I jump on him, beating the side of his face with my flimsy little fist, my purse wrapped tightly around my shoulder hindering my blows as it flops around behind me. But Andrew gets out of the blond guy\u2019s hold easily, swings around behind him and kicks him square in the back, sending him onto the floor face-first.</p><p>Andrew grabs my wrist.</p><p>\u201cMove out of the way, baby!\u201d He shoves me back toward the crowd behind me and turns back to the two guys in a split-second.</p><p>The buff guy has finally gotten back to his feet, but not for long when Andrew comes around with two fast punches to both sides of his jaw and then one blood-splattering uppercut to the underside. I see a bloody tooth fall onto the floor. I cringe. The guy falls backward into another small table, knocking it from its metal base, too. And when the blond guy comes at Andrew again, the guy Andrew had been playing pool with jumps in and takes him on, leaving Andrew to the buff guy.</p><p>By the time the bouncers get through the crowd to break up the fight, Andrew has already blackened both the buff guy\u2019s eyes and blood is draining from his nostrils. The buff guy stumbles, holding his hand over his nose as the bouncer pulls him by the shoulder toward the crowd.</p><p>Andrew pushes away the other bouncer\u2019s hand that comes after him. \u201cI got it,\u201d he threatens, putting up one hand telling the bouncer to back off, and wiping a trickle of blood from his nose with the other. \u201cI\u2019m out of here, no need to help me see the door.\u201d</p><p>I run over to him and he takes my hand.</p><p>\u201cCamryn, are you OK? Did you get hit?\u201d He\u2019s looking me over everywhere, his eyes fierce and uncontrolled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d</p><p>He tightens his hand around mine and pulls me beside him, pushing our way through the parting crowd.</p><p>When we make it outside into the night air, the funneling music from the bar shuts off once the door closes. The two idiot guys from the fight are already outside walking down the street, the buff guy still with his hand pressed over his bloodied face. I\u2019m convinced Andrew broke his nose.</p><p>Andrew stops me on the sidewalk and takes my upper-arms into his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, baby, did you get hurt anywhere? I swear to f**king God if you did I\u2019m going after them.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s melting my heart, calling me \u2018baby\u2019. And that concerned, fierce look in his eyes...I just want to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I actually hit that one guy a few times myself when he jumped you from behind.\u201d</p><p>He moves his hands from my arms and cups my face in his palms, looking me all over as if he still doesn\u2019t believe me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hurt,\u201d I say one last time.</p><p>He presses his lips hard against my forehead.</p><p>Then he grabs my hand. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I argue, \u201cwe were having a good time and dammit I lost my buzz because of that.\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head to one side and softens his gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to go then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to another club,\u201d I suggest. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe a more laid back one?\u201d</p><p>Andrew sighs heavily and squeezes my hand. Then he looks me up and down again: first my feet where my painted toenails are peeking through the front of my heels and then up my body straight to my tight strapless black top that could use a little adjusting.</p><p>I pull my hand from his and grasp the fabric above my boobs and pull the top up a little so that it feels better in place.</p><p>\u201cI love you in that,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you have to admit, it\u2019s a distraction for douchebags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to walk all the way back to the hotel just to change my top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d he says, reaching for my hand again. \u201cBut if you want to go to another club, you\u2019re gonna have to do something for me, alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust pretend you\u2019re my girlfriend,\u201d he says and a little smile spreads across my lips. \u201cAt least that way no one will f**k with you, or they\u2019re less likely to try, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and looks at me and says, \u201cUnless you want guys to hit on you?\u201d</p><p>It takes no time at all for my head to start shaking. \u201cNo. I do not want any guys to hit on me. Innocent flirting, fine\u2014it does wonders for my confidence\u2014but not douchebags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, then it\u2019s settled. You\u2019re my sexy girlfriend for the night, which means I get to take you back to the room later and make you squeal a little.\u201d There\u2019s that boyish grin of his again that I love so much.</p><p>I\u2019m tingling between the legs now. I swallow hard and play it off by playfully narrowing my eyes at him.</p><p>I\u2019m just glad to see his dimples again, as opposed to that wrathful\u2014although incredibly sexy\u2014expression that consumed his features moments ago.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I like it\u2014well, \u2018like\u2019 is really putting it lightly\u2014I\u2019m not going to let you do that anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looks hurt and a little shocked. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Andrew, I...well, I just won\u2019t let you\u2014now come here.\u201d I cup my hands around the sides of his neck and pull him toward me.</p><p>And then I kiss him softly, letting my lips linger on his afterwards.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, staring down into my eyes.</p> <p>I smile sweetly up at him. \u201cI\u2019m getting into character.\u201d</p><p>A grin tugs the corners of his lips. He turns me around and locks his arm around my waist as we head toward Bourbon Street.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>25</p><p>MAYBE I CAN DO this with Camryn. Why do I have to torture myself and deny myself what I want most when it should be the time when I\u2019ve earned the right to have anything I want? Maybe things will turn out differently and she won\u2019t get hurt. I could go back to Marsters. What if I do let her go and I never see her again and then afterwards, Marsters realizes his fuck-up?</p> <p>Goddammit! Excuses.</p><p>Camryn and I hit two more bars in the French Quarter and she managed to pass for twenty-one in both of them. Only one asked to see her I.D. and I guess since her birthday is in December the waitress decided to let her slide.</p><p>But now she\u2019s drunk and I\u2019m not sure if she\u2019ll be able to walk back to the hotel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a cab,\u201d I say, holding her up beside me on the sidewalk.</p><p>Couples and groups of people come and go from the bar behind us, some stumbling from the doorway.</p><p>I\u2019ve got my arm tight around Camryn\u2019s waist. She reaches up a hand and drapes it over my shoulder from the front; she can hardly hold her head up straight.</p> <p>\u201cI think a cab is a good idea,\u201d she says with heavy eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s either going to pass out or throw up soon. I just hope she waits until we get back to the hotel.</p><p>The cab drops us off at the front of the hotel and I help her out of the backseat, finally just lifting her in my arms because she can barely walk on her own anymore. I carry her to the elevator with her legs dangling over one arm and her head lying against my chest. People are staring.</p><p>\u201cFun night?\u201d a man in the elevator asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I nod, \u201csome of us can hold our liquor better than others.\u201d</p><p>The elevator dings and the man walks out after the doors slide open. Two more floors up and I carry her out and toward our rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your key babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my purse,\u201d she says weakly.</p> <p>At least she\u2019s coherent.</p><p>Without putting her down, I pull her purse around from her arm and unzip it. Normally, I would crack some joke about what the hell she carries in this thing and if anything in it is going to bite me, but I know she\u2019s not in the joking mood. She\u2019s miserable.</p><p>This is going to be a long night.</p><p>The door shuts behind us and I carry her right over to the bed and lay her down.</p><p>\u201cI feel like shit,\u201d she moans.</p><p>\u201cI know, babe. You\u2019ll just have to sleep it off.\u201d</p><p>I take off her shoes and set them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to be\u2014.\u201d She throws her head over the side of the bed and starts puking.</p><p>I reach over to grab the trash can pressed against the nightstand and catch most of it, but it looks like the housekeeper is going to be pissed in the morning. She throws up everything in her stomach, which surprises me because she didn\u2019t really eat much today. She stops and falls back against the pillow. Tears, caused by the vomiting, stream from the corners of her eyes. She tries to look at me, but I know she\u2019s too dizzy to focus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so hot in here,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I say and get up to turn the AC on full blast.</p><p>Then I go into the bathroom and run a wash cloth under the cold water and then ring it out. I go back in the room and sit beside her on the bed, swabbing her face with the cloth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she mumbles. \u201cI should\u2019ve stopped after the vodka shot. Now you\u2019re cleaning up my puke.\u201d</p><p>I wipe her cheeks and forehead some more, pushing away the loose strands of hair stuck to her face and then I swipe the cold rag over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo apologies,\u201d I say, \u201cyou had a good time and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d I add, grinning, \u201cBesides, I can take complete advantage of you now.\u201d</p><p>She tries to smile and reach up and hit me on the arm, but she\u2019s too weak even for that. Her almost-smile turns into something anguished and sweat instantly beads on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cOh no....\u201d She raises herself from the bed. \u201cI need the bathroom,\u201d she says, holding onto me trying to get up and so I help her.</p><p>I walk her to the bathroom where she practically throws herself over the toilet, both hands gripping the sides of the porcelain. Her back arches and falls as she starts to dry-heave and cry harder.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve had that steak with me, babe.\u201d I stand over her from behind, making sure her braids don\u2019t get hit in the crossfire and I keep the cold rag pressed to the back of her neck. I hurt for her, just watching her body heave violently like that, but hardly anything being produced from it. I know her throat and chest and insides are going to hurt after this.</p><p>When she\u2019s done, she lies against the cool tile floor.</p><p>I try to help her up, but she protests softly:</p><p>\u201cNo, please...I want to lay here; the floor is cooler on my skin.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing is shallow and her lightly-tanned skin is as sickly pale as a pneumonia patient. I get a clean rag, soak it and keep wiping down her face and neck and bare shoulders. Then I unbutton her pants and carefully pull them off, relieving her stomach and legs from the pressure of how tight they were.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t molest you,\u201d I say, jokingly, but she doesn\u2019t answer this time.</p><p>She\u2019s passed out on her side with her face pressed against the floor.</p><p>I know if I move her right now she\u2019ll probably wake up and start dry-heaving again, but I don\u2019t want to leave her like this lying next to the toilet. So, I lay down beside her and I swab her forehead and arms and shoulders with the cloth for hours until eventually I fall asleep with her.</p><p>Never thought I\u2019d intentionally sleep on a bathroom floor next to a toilet while sober, but I meant it when I said I would sleep anywhere with her.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>THE DOOR TO MY room opens. Bright sunlight is shining in through a slim opening in the curtain on the other side of me. I flinch like a vampire at it, squinting long enough to turn away. It takes me a second to realize that I\u2019m lying on my bed in the strapless top I wore last night and my purple bikini panties. The bed has been stripped of everything but the sheet I\u2019m lying on and a top sheet that smells and feels like it had recently been washed. I guess I puked on the other one; Andrew must\u2019ve gotten this one from housekeeping.</p><p>\u201cFeeling any better?\u201d Andrew asks coming into the room with an ice bucket in one hand and a stack of plastic cups and a bottle of Sprite in the other.</p><p>He sits down beside me and places the stuff on the nightstand, breaking the seal on the Sprite.</p><p>My head is pounding and I still feel like I could throw up again at any moment. I hate hangovers. I would rather fall down shitfaced drunk and bust my nose or something than deal with a hangover of this magnitude. I\u2019ve had one like this before; it\u2019s so bad that it\u2019s not much different from alcohol poisoning. At least, according to Natalie, who actually had alcohol poisoning once and described it as \u2018being shit on by Satan himself the next morning\u2019.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d I finally answer and my own words send pain shooting through the back of my head and around behind my ears. I close my eyes tight when the room starts to double.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it bad, babe,\u201d Andrew says and then I feel a cool cloth dab the side of my neck.</p><p>\u201cCan you close that curtain? Please?\u201d</p><p>He gets up immediately and I hear him walk over and then the sound of the thick fabric being moved until he gets it into place. I draw my bare legs up toward my chest, taking the sheet with me to keep myself partially covered and I lay in the fetal position against the softness of the pillow.</p><p>Andrew removes a plastic cup from its wrapping and I hear the ice shuffling into it afterwards. He pours the Sprite over the ice and then I hear a bottle of pills moving around in his hand.</p><p>\u201cTake these,\u201d he says and I feel the bed move as he sits back down and rests his arm over my leg.</p><p>My eyes crack open slowly. There\u2019s already a straw poking from the top of the plastic cup so I won\u2019t have to try lifting from the bed too much to get a sip. I reach out and take three Advil from the palm of his hand and pop them in my mouth, afterwards sipping enough of the Sprite just to wash them down with.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me I didn\u2019t do or say anything completely humiliating at the bars last night.\u201d</p><p>I can only look at him through slit eyelids.</p><p>I sense him smiling. \u201cYeah, actually you did,\u201d he says and my heart sinks. \u201cYou told this one guy that you were happily married to me and that we were gonna have like four kids\u2014or maybe you said five, I don\u2019t remember\u2014and then this chick came over later and was hitting on me and you shot up from the chair and got in her face all white-trash-like\u2014it was hilarious.\u201d</p><p>I think I\u2019m going to throw up now for sure.</p><p>\u201cAndrew you better be lying\u2014how embarrassing!\u201d</p><p>My head hurts worse. I didn\u2019t think it could get any worse.</p><p>I hear him laugh lightly and I open my eyes a little more so I can see his face more clearly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m lying, babe.\u201d He reaches up and moves the cool rag over my forehead. \u201cActually, you handled yourself very well, even all the way up here with me.\u201d I notice him look my body over. \u201cSorry, I had to strip you down\u2014well I enjoyed the opportunity personally, but it was in the line of duty. It had to be done, you see.\u201d He looks all pretend-serious now and I can\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>I shut my eyes and sleep another couple of hours until the housekeeper knocks on the door.</p><p>I wonder if Andrew has left my side much.</p><p>\u201cYeah, come on in and let me take her next door to my room so you can clean.\u201d</p><p>An older lady with a bad red dye-job on her hair enters the room wearing her housekeeping uniform. Andrew walks over to me on the bed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe,\u201d he says, lifting me into his arms with the sheet still wrapped around my lower half, \u201clet\u2019s let the lady clean.\u201d</p><p>I could probably walk over there on my own, but I\u2019m not about to protest. I rather like being right where I am.</p><p>As we walk past my purse on the TV stand I reach out for it and Andrew stops, picking it up for me and carrying it out with me. I lay my head against his chest and drape my arms around his neck.</p><p>He stops in the doorway and looks back at the housekeeper.</p><p>\u201cSorry about the mess beside the bed.\u201d He nods in that direction with a grimace. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a good tip in it for you.\u201d</p><p>He walks out with me and takes me over to his room.</p><p>First thing he does is close the curtains after he lays me against his pillow.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re better before tonight,\u201d he says walking about the room as if he\u2019s looking for something. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother bar,\u201d he says.</p><p>He finds his MP3 player beside the recliner cushion by the window and sets it on the TV stand beside his bag.</p><p>I moan in protest. \u201cOh no, Andrew, I refuse to go to another bar tonight. I will never drink again for as long as I live.\u201d</p> <p>I catch him flash me a grin from across the room.</p><p>\u201cEverybody says that,\u201d he declares. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t let you drink tonight if you decided you wanted to. You need at least one night in-between hangovers or you might as well get your AA card stamped early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope I feel good enough to do something besides hang around in bed all day\u2014but the prospect isn\u2019t lookin\u2019 too good right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have to eat, that\u2019s mandatory. As much as the thought of food right now probably makes you sick, if you don\u2019t eat something you\u2019ll feel like shit all day for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, feeling nauseous, \u201cIt does make me sick just thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToast and eggs,\u201d he says, walking back over to me, \u201csomething light\u2014you know the drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know the drill,\u201d I say blankly, wishing I could just snap my fingers and be better already.</p><p>26</p><p>BY LATE-AFTERNOON, I do feel better; not one hundred percent, but good enough to ride around New Orleans with Andrew in a streetcar to a few places we didn\u2019t get to see yesterday. After I managed to get down some eggs and two pieces of toast we took the Riverfront Streetcar to the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas and walked through a thirty-foot long tunnel with water and fish all around us. And we hand-fed parakeets and worked our way through rain forest exhibits. We fed stingrays and took pictures together with our cell phones, the stupid-looking kind with our arms out in front holding the phone. I later looked closer at the pictures we took, how our cheeks were pressed together and the way we smiled into the camera as if we were any other couple having the time of our lives.</p><p>Any other couple...but we\u2019re not a couple and I realize I just had to remind myself of that.</p><p>Reality is a bitch.</p> <p>But then again, so is not knowing what you want. No, the truth is that I do know what I want. I can\u2019t force myself to doubt it anymore, but I\u2019m still afraid of it. I\u2019m afraid of Andrew and what kind of pain he could inflict if he ever hurt me, because I get the feeling it wouldn\u2019t be any kind that I could bear. Already it\u2019s unbearable and he hasn\u2019t even hurt me yet.</p><p>I sure got myself knee-deep in a mess, no doubt.</p><p>By the time the night falls over New Orleans again and the party-people have come out of their dwellings, Andrew has me crossing the Mississippi by ferry and walking to a place called Old Point Bar. I\u2019m glad I decided to wear my black flip-flops again, rather than the new heels. Andrew sort of insisted, especially since we would be walking.</p><p>\u201cI never leave New Orleans until I\u2019ve come here first,\u201d he says, walking alongside me with my hand clasped within his.</p><p>\u201cWhat, so you\u2019re a regular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you can say that; a once or twice a year regular, anyway. I\u2019ve played there a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guitar?\u201d I assume, looking over at him curiously.</p><p>A group of four people walk past from the opposite direction and I move closer to Andrew to give them space on the sidewalk.</p> <p>He moves his hand from mine and slips it around my waist from behind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been playing the guitar since I was six.\u201d He smiles over at me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at six, but you have to start somewhere\u2014didn\u2019t play anything worth listening to until I was about ten.\u201d</p><p>I let out an impressed spat of air. \u201cYoung enough to be musically talented, I\u2019d say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so; I was the \u2018music boy\u2019 when we were growing up and Aidan was the \u2018architect boy\u2019 (he glances at me) because he used to build things\u2014built a massive tree house in the woods once. And Asher, he was the \u2018hockey boy\u2019. My dad loved hockey, almost more than he did boxing (he glances at me again), but only almost. Asher gave up hockey after the first year\u2014he was only thirteen (he laughs lightly); Dad wanted it more than Asher did. All Asher ever really wanted to do was mess with electronics\u2014tried to communicate with aliens on a contraption he built out of random stuff lying around the house after he saw the movie Contact.\u201d</p><p>We laugh gently together.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your brother?\u201d he asks. \u201cI know you told me he\u2019s in prison, but what was your relationship like with him before that?\u201d</p><p>My face sours delicately.</p><p>\u201cCole was an awesome big brother until he went into eighth grade and started hanging out with the neighborhood trash\u2014Braxton Hixley; I always hated that guy. Anyway, Cole and Braxton started doing drugs and all kinds of crazy stuff. My dad tried putting him away in a home for troubled youths to get him some help, but Cole ran away and just got into even more trouble. It got worse from there.\u201d I look back out ahead as more people come shuffling toward us along the sidewalk. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s where he deserves to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll be more like the big brother you remember once he gets out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I shrug, highly doubting it.</p><p>We make our way to the end of the sidewalk and onto the corner where Patterson runs into Olivier and there\u2019s Old Point Bar that from the outside looks more like a historic two-story house with an add-on apartment on the side. We pass under the elongated old sign where next to the building there are a couple of plastic tables and chairs with several people smoking and talking really loud.</p><p>I can hear a band playing inside.</p><p>Andrew holds the door open after a couple comes out and he takes my hand. It\u2019s not huge a place, but it\u2019s cozy. I look up at the tall ceilings, noticing the many photographs and license plates and beer lights and colored banners and old signs hanging around on every inch of space. Several ceiling fans hang low from the wooden ceiling. And to my right is the bar that, like just about any bar, has a TV on the back wall. Even through a mild throng of people a woman working behind the bar raises her hand and it appears she\u2019s waving at Andrew.</p><p>Andrew smiles at her and waves back with two fingers as if to say \u2018talk to you in a few\u2019.</p><p>It looks like all of the tables are taken and there are people dancing on the floor. The band playing along the back wall is really good; some kind of blues rock, or something. I like it. There\u2019s a black man strumming a silver guitar sitting on a stool and a white man singing with an acoustic secured to his front by the guitar strap. A heavyset man is on drums and there\u2019s a keyboard on the stage, though it\u2019s unoccupied.</p><p>I do a double-take when my gaze skims the floor and I see a scruffy black dog looking up at me and wagging its tail. I reach over and scratch it behind the ears. Satisfied, it waddles over next to its owner sitting at the table next to me and lies at his feet.</p><p>After waiting a few minutes, Andrew notices three people get up from a table not far from where the band is playing and pulling me along, we walk over and get it.</p><p>I still feel off from the hangover and my head isn\u2019t completely free of pain, but surprisingly enough, as loud as it is in here, it\u2019s not making my headache worse.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not drinking,\u201d Andrew points at me and says kindly to the woman who had been standing behind the bar.</p><p>She had weaved her way through the people and over to our table by the time I sat down.</p><p>The woman, with soft brown hair pulled behind her ears, looks to be in her early forties and she\u2019s smiling so hugely as she takes Andrew into a bear hug that I\u2019m starting to wonder if she\u2019s his aunt or a cousin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ten months, Parrish,\u201d she says, patting his back with both hands. \u201cWhere the hell have you been?\u201d</p><p>She smiles down at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d She looks at Andrew playfully, but I detect something else in her smile: assumption, perhaps.</p><p>Andrew takes my hand and I stand up to be properly introduced. \u201cThis is Camryn,\u201d he says. \u201cCamryn, this is Carla; she\u2019s been working here for at least six of my atrocious performances.\u201d</p><p>Carla pushes him on the chest, laughing, and she looks back at me. \u201cDon\u2019t let him lie to you,\u201d she points at him and raises both brows, \u201cthis boy can sing.\u201d She winks at me and then shakes my hand. \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I smile at her likewise.</p><p>Sing? I thought he played guitar here; I didn\u2019t know he sang, too. I guess it doesn\u2019t surprise me. He already sort of proved to me that he can sing back in Birmingham when he hit that \u2018alibis\u2019 note in Hotel California. And every now and then while we were riding in the car he would forget I was there\u2014or not care\u2014and let his vocals loose on any number of classic rock songs funneling from the speakers.</p><p>But I never expected that he has actually performed somewhere. Too bad he didn\u2019t bring his guitar; I\u2019d love to see him perform tonight.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s good to see you again,\u201d Carla says and then points to the black man on the stage. \u201cEddie will be glad to know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Andrew nods and smiles as Carla makes her way back through the small crowd and to the bar.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a soda or anything?\u201d</p><p>I wave my hand at him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He remains standing and when the band stops playing, I realize why. The black man with the silver guitar notices Andrew and smiles as he sets the guitar against the chair and comes over. They hug much in the same way he and Carla had and I stand up again to be introduced, shaking \u2018Eddie\u2019s\u2019 hand.</p><p>\u201cParrish! Been gone a long time,\u201d Eddie says in his thick Cajun accent. \u201cWhat it been, a\u2019yea?\u201d</p><p>Carla had sounded somewhat Cajun, too, but not as much as Eddie.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Andrew says, beaming.</p><p>Andrew seems really happy to be here, like these people are some long-lost family members and he\u2019s never been at odds with any of them. Even his smile is warmer and more inviting than I\u2019ve ever seen it before. In fact, when he introduced me to both Carla and Eddie, his smile lit up the room. I felt like I was the one girl he finally decided to bring home to meet the family and by the looks in their eyes when he introduced me, they felt like that, too.</p><p>\u201cGon\u2019 play t\u2019night?\u201d</p><p>I take my seat again and look up at Andrew, as curious about his answer as Eddie seems to be. Eddie has that won\u2019t-take-no-for-an-answer look on his smiling face, the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth deepening.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t bring my guitar this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie shakes his head; \u201cyou know betta\u2014play me a cooyon?\u201d He points at the stage. \u201cGot plent\u2019 guita\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear you play,\u201d I say from behind.</p><p>Andrew looks down at me, unsure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m asking you.\u201d I tilt my head gently to one side, smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cUh huh, dat girl got dem eyes, she does.\u201d Eddie grins at Andrew from the side.</p><p>Andrew gives in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlright, but only one song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnl\u2019 one, no?\u201d Eddie tightens his wrinkly chin and says, \u201cGon\u2019 be one it gon\u2019 be my pick.\u201d He points to himself, just above his white button-up shirt. A pack of cigarettes are poking from the top left pocket on his chest.</p><p>Andrew nods, agreeing. \u201cOK, you pick then.\u201d</p><p>Eddie\u2019s grin deepens and he looks down at me with a suspicious sidelong glance. \u201cOne ta woo da\u2019 ladies wit like you did las\u2019time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRolling Stones?\u201d Andrew asks.</p><p>\u201cUh huh,\u201d Eddie says. \u201cDat da one, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask, propping my chin on top of my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cLaugh, I Nearly Died,\u201d Andrew answers. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably never heard that one before.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019s right. I shake my head gently. \u201cNo, can\u2019t say that I have.\u201d</p> <p>Eddie nods to Andrew for him to follow him towards the stage. Andrew leans down and surprises me with a soft peck on the lips and then leaves the table.</p><p>I sit nervous, but excited on the chair with my elbows propped on the table. There are so many conversations going on all around me that it all sounds like a consistent hum of noise floating on the air in the room. Every now and then I hear a glass or a beer bottle clink against another, or against a table. The whole space is rather dark, lit only by the filtering lights from the numerous beer signs and the tall sections of glass windows that allow in the moonlight and light from the street to wash through them. Every now and then a burst of yellow light shines from behind the stage on the right side when people come and go from what I\u2019m assuming are the restrooms.</p><p>Andrew and Eddie make it to the stage and start setting up: Andrew takes another barstool from somewhere behind the drum set and places it center stage right in front of the standing microphone. Eddie says a few words to the drummer\u2014probably telling him what song to play\u2014and the drummer nods. Another man emerges from a shadow behind the stage with another guitar, or maybe that one\u2019s a bass; I\u2019ve never really paid attention to the difference. Eddie gives Andrew a black guitar, already plugged into a nearby amp and they exchange words that I can\u2019t hear. And then Andrew takes a seat on the stool, propping one booted foot on the lower spindle. Eddie sits on his afterwards.</p><p>They start adjusting this and tuning that and the drummer hits his cymbals a few erratic times. I hear a pop-squeal as another amp is either turned on or just turned up and then a thump-thump-thump when Andrew taps his thumb on the microphone a few times.</p><p>My stomach is already fluttering, nervous as though I\u2019m the one up there about to sing in front of a bunch of strangers. But mostly, my stomach flutters because it\u2019s Andrew. He glances at me from the stage, locking eyes with me once and then the drummer starts to play, just barely hitting the cymbals a few times in tune. And then Eddie starts to play the guitar; a slow, catchy tune that easily makes most of the people all standing around turn and take notice of a new song beginning\u2014obviously one that they\u2019ve all heard before and never get tired of. Andrew plays a few chords along with Eddie and already I feel my upper-body gently swaying with the music.</p><p>When Andrew starts to sing it feels like there\u2019s a spring in my neck. I stop swaying and jerk my head back, not believing what I\u2019m hearing; so bluesy and captivating. He keeps his eyes closed as he sings on, his head moving in time with the sultry, soulful beat of the music.</p> <p>And when the chorus starts Andrew takes my breath away...</p><p>I feel my back gently pressing into the chair behind me and my eyes growing wider as the music picks up and Andrew\u2019s soul comes out with every word. His expression shifts with each intense note and calms when the notes calm. No one is talking in the bar anymore. I can\u2019t look away from Andrew to see, but I can tell that the atmosphere changed in that second when Andrew started that powerful chorus, that sexy bluesy timbre coming out of him that I never could\u2019ve imagined he possessed.</p><p>By the second verse when the beat slows again, he\u2019s already got the complete attention of every person in the room. People are dancing and swaying all around me, couples getting close with their h*ps and lips because there\u2019s no other way to do it to this song. But me...I just stare breathless across the space, letting Andrew\u2019s voice course through every loft and bone in my body. It\u2019s like irresistible poison: I\u2019m mesmerized by the way it\u2019s making me feel though it has the potential to crush my soul and I drink it down anyway.</p><p>Still, he keeps his eyes closed as if needing to shut out the light around him to feel the music. And when the second chorus comes, he gets even more into it, almost enough to raise himself from the stool, but he stays put, his neck stretched out toward the microphone and every passionate emotion etched on his face as he sings and plays the guitar on his lap.</p><p>Eddie, the drummer and the bass player start to sing two lines with Andrew, and the audience joins in faintly.</p><p>By the third verse, I want to cry but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s like it\u2019s there, sitting dormant in the pit of my stomach, but it wants to torture me.</p><p>Laugh, I Nearly Died....</p><p>Andrew sings on and on, so passionately that I nearly die, my heart beating faster and faster. And then the band starts singing again and the music slows to drums only; a deep, rough rapping of the bass drum that I feel underneath my feet within the floor. And the audience stomps against the floor in time with the bass drum and they start singing along to the repetitive chorus. They clap once at the same time sending a shear ripple through the air as their palms smack together. One more time. And Andrew sings: \u201cYeah-Yeah!\u201d and the music ends abruptly.</p> <p>There are shouts and high-pitched whistles and plenty of \u2018yeah\u2019s\u2019 and a few \u2018holy shit\u2019s\u2019. Chills are running up my spine and spreading through the rest of my body.</p><p>Laugh, I Nearly Died...I will never forget that song for as long as I live.</p><p>How can he be real?</p><p>I\u2019m waiting for the jinx to go into effect any moment, or for me to wake up in the back of Damon\u2019s car with Natalie hovering over me saying something about how Blake roofied me at The Underground.</p><p>Andrew sets the borrowed guitar down against the stool and walks over to shake Eddie\u2019s hand and then the drummer and lastly the bass player. Eddie walks with him halfway toward me, but stops and winks at me before going back to the stage. I really like Eddie. There\u2019s something honest and good and soulful about that man.</p><p>Andrew doesn\u2019t get all of the way back to our table without a few people from the audience stopping to shake his hand and probably to tell him how much they liked his performance. He thanks them and slowly but surely makes his way back to me.</p><p>I see a few women watching him with a little more than appreciation.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask, halfway just messing with him.</p><p>Andrew sort of blushes and moves an empty chair around so that he can sit in front of me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing, Andrew. I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s very modest. I sort of halfway expected him to joke around by calling me his groupie and asking me to go behind the building with him or something. But he really doesn\u2019t seem up for talking about his talent at all, as if he\u2019s uncomfortable with it. Or perhaps uncomfortable with real praise?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d I say, \u201cI wish I could sing like that.\u201d</p><p>That gets a reaction out of him, although slight.</p><p>\u201cSure you could,\u201d he says.</p><p>I draw my head back and shake it heavily. \u201cNo-no-no-no,\u201d I stop him before he gets any ideas. \u201cI can\u2019t sing very well. I don\u2019t think I suck, but I\u2019m not stage material, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Carla brings him over a beer, smiles at me and goes back to her customers. \u201cStage fright?\u201d</p><p>He places the bottle to his lips and tips his head back.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never given it any thought past singing in the car to a stereo, Andrew.\u201d I lean back against my chair. \u201cI\u2019ve never gone far enough with the idea to be personal with something like stage fright.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shrugs and takes another sip before setting his beer on the table. \u201cWell, for the record, I think you have a pretty voice. I heard you in the car.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and cross my arms over my chest. \u201cThanks, but it\u2019s easy to sound like you can sing when you\u2019re singing along to someone else\u2019s voice. Get me alone without music and you\u2019ll probably cringe.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward toward him and add:</p><p>\u201cHow did this get turned around on me, anyway?\u201d I narrow one eye playfully at him. \u201cYou\u2019re the one we should be talking about\u2014where did that come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInfluence, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no one can sing it like Jagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I beg to differ,\u201d I say, drawing my chin back. \u201cWhat, is Jagger your musical idol or something?\u201d I ask half-joking and he smiles warmly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s up there with my influences, but no, my musical idol is a little older than him.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s something secret and deep hiding behind his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask, completely immersed.</p><p>Without warning, Andrew leans forward and grabs me around the waist, lifting me onto his lap facing him. I\u2019m a little shocked, but not at all rejecting of the gesture. He peers up into my eyes as I sit straddled on his lap.</p><p>\u201cCamryn?\u201d</p><p>I smile at him, only able to wonder what brought this on. \u201cWhat?\u201d I tilt my head to one side gently; my hands are resting on his chest.</p><p>A flicker of thought moves across his face and he doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask, more curious now.</p><p>I feel his hands lock around my waist and then he leans up and brushes his lips across mine. My eyes shut softly, taking in his touch. I feel like I could kiss him, but I\u2019m not sure really if I should.</p><p>My eyes come open when he pulls his lips away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Andrew?\u201d</p><p>He smiles and it literally warms my insides.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he says, slapping my thighs gently with the palms of his hands and so quickly back to being playful, not-so-serious Andrew. \u201cI just wanted you on my lap.\u201d He grins wickedly.</p><p>I go to wiggle my way away\u2014not really\u2014and he wraps his arms around my waist and just holds me there. The only time he lets me up from his lap the rest of the night is when I need to use the restroom and he stood outside the door and waited for me. We stayed at Old Point watching Eddie and the band play blues and blues rock and even a few old jazz songs before we left to go back to the hotel after eleven.</p><p>27</p><p>BACK AT THE HOTEL, Andrew stays with me over in my room long enough to watch a movie. We talked for a long time and I could feel the reluctance between both of us: he wanted to say something to me as much as I wanted to say things to him.</p><p>I guess we\u2019re too much alike and so neither of us stepped over that line.</p><p>What\u2019s stopping us? Maybe it\u2019s me; maybe whatever this is between us can\u2019t go any further until he senses that I know it\u2019s what I want. Or, it could just be that he\u2019s not sure of anything, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how can two people who are undeniably more than just attracted to one another not give in? We\u2019ve been on the road together for almost two weeks. We\u2019ve shared intimate secrets and we\u2019ve been intimate in some ways. We\u2019ve slept next to each other and touched one another, yet still here we are, standing on opposites sides of a thick glass wall. We reach up and touch our fingers to the glass, we look into each other\u2019s eyes and we know what we want but that glass won\u2019t f**king budge. This is either inviolable discipline or pure, unadulterated self-torture.</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m in any hurry to leave,\u201d I say as Andrew gets ready to head back to his room, \u201cbut how long will we be staying in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>He picks his cell phone up from the nightstand and checks the screen briefly before wrapping it in the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re paid up until Thursday,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it\u2019s up to you; we can leave tomorrow, or stay longer if you want.\u201d</p> <p>I purse my lips, smiling, pretending to be deeply contemplating the decision, tapping my index finger on my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say standing up from the bed. \u201cI kind of like it here, but we still have to go to Texas eventually.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looks at me curiously. \u201cOh? So, you\u2019re still set on Texas, huh?\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, contemplating it for real this time. \u201cYeah,\u201d I answer distantly, \u201cI think I am\u2014it started out as Texas...,\u201d and then the words: maybe it\u2019ll end in Texas, enter my mind and my face suddenly falls.</p><p>Andrew kisses my forehead and smiles.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>And I let him go because that glass wall is too thick and intimidating for me to reach out and stop him.</p><p>Hours later, well into the dark early morning when most are asleep, I wake up swiftly and sit up in the center of the bed. I\u2019m not sure what woke me, but it feels like it might\u2019ve been a loud noise. As my mind comes together, I gaze around the pitch-dark room, letting my eyes adjust to the darkness and look to see if anything had fallen. I get up and walk around, opening the curtains just a sliver to let in more light. I look toward the bathroom and then the TV and lastly the wall. Andrew. It\u2019s coming to me now: I think what I heard was something from his room, right behind my head.</p><p>I slip my white cotton shorts on over my panties and take my card key and the extra one he gave me to his room and I walk barefooted out into the brightly-lit hallway.</p><p>I raise my knuckles and knock lightly at first.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p> <p>No answer.</p><p>I knock again a little harder and call out his name, but still get no response. After a pause, I slide his key in the door and open it quietly in case he\u2019s still asleep.</p><p>Andrew is sitting on the edge of his bed with his elbows on his knees and his hands folded together draped between his legs. His back is slumped over forward in an arch where his head has fallen to where he can only be looking at the carpeted floor.</p><p>I glance to my right and see his cell phone on the floor with a shattered glass front. I know immediately that he must\u2019ve thrown it at the wall.</p><p>\u201cAndrew? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask, approaching him slowly, not because I\u2019m afraid of him, but because I\u2019m afraid for him.</p><p>The curtains have been pulled wide open, letting the moonlight in and bathing the entire room and Andrew\u2019s half-naked body in a grayish-blue haze. He\u2019s wearing only a pair of boxers. I step up to him and slide my hands from his arms down to his hands, taking them gently into my fingers. \u201cYou can tell me,\u201d I say, but I already know what it\u2019s about.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look up at me, but he takes my fingers into his and cradles them.</p><p>My heart is breaking....</p> <p>I move closer, standing in-between his legs and he doesn\u2019t hesitate to wrap his arms tightly around my body. Feeling my chest begin to shudder as I take on his pain, I wrap my arms around his head and pull him toward my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby,\u201d I shudder out the words, tears are streaming from my face, but I try my best to hold my composure. I grip his head gently and he presses his forehead deeper into my belly. \u201cI\u2019m here, Andrew,\u201d I say carefully.</p><p>And he cries quietly into my stomach. He never makes a sound, but I can feel his body trembling gently against my own. His father has died and he\u2019s allowing himself to grieve the way he should. He holds me here for the longest time, his arms constricting around me when the worst waves of pain move through him and I hold him tighter, my hands locked within his hair.</p><p>Finally, he raises his eyes and looks up at me. All I want to do is take away that pain in his face. Right now, it\u2019s all that I care about in this world. I just want to take away his pain.</p><p>Andrew pulls me by the waist over onto the bed with him and just holds me here, gripped within the hardness of his arms with the entire length of the back of my body pressed against the front of his. Another hour passes and I watch the moon move from one point to another in the sky. Andrew never says a word and I don\u2019t try to prompt him because I know he needs this moment and if neither of us ever speaks again, I can live with that as long as we stay just like this.</p><p>Two people unable to cry finally cry together and if the world ended today, we would be fulfilled.</p><p>The early morning sun begins to wash away the moonlight, and for a time, both of them are hidden in the same vast expanse of sky so that neither dominates the other. The atmosphere is bathed in dark purple and gray with splashes of pink, until the sun finally prevails and wakes up our side of the world.</p><p>I roll over onto my other side, facing Andrew. He\u2019s still awake, too. I smile at him softly and he welcomes me when I lean in to kiss him softly on the lips. He reaches his hand out and brushes the back of his finger across my cheek and then touches my mouth, the pad of his thumb barely skimming the center of my bottom lip before falling away. I move closer and he grips my hand within his, both of them resting between our pressed bodies. His beautiful green eyes smile gently at me and then he lets go of my hand and wraps that arm around my waist, pulling me so close that I can feel the warmth of his breath on my chin as he breathes in and out.</p><p>I know he doesn\u2019t want to talk about his father and to bring it up might ruin this moment, so I don\u2019t. As much as I want to and as much as I believe he needs to talk about it to help him grieve, I will wait. He needs time.</p><p>I bring up my free hand and trace the outline of the tattoo on his right upper-arm. And then my fingers make a delicate trail to his ribs.</p><p>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d I whisper softly.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m talking about the tattoo of Eurydice down his left side, which is still pressed into the bed beneath him.</p><p>Andrew gazes at me, but his face is unreadable. His eyes stray for a long moment before he rises up from the bed and crawls over onto the other side so that the tattoo is visible. He lies on his side just like before and pulls me a little closer, afterwards moving his arm away from his ribs. I lift up to get a better look and run my fingers along the intricate artwork that is so beautiful and lifelike. The head of the woman begins about two inches from underneath his arm and extends to her bare feet to the middle of his sculpted hip and a few inches onto his stomach. She\u2019s wearing a long, flowing see-through white gown which presses against her body as if a strong wind is pushing against her. Wisps of long fabric blow behind and all around her within the invisible wind.</p><p>She\u2019s standing on a ledge, looking downward with one arm drifting delicately behind her.</p><p>But then it gets weird.</p><p>Eurydice is reaching out with the other arm, but the ink stops at her elbow. Another arm has been added in on the other side, but it\u2019s not hers; it appears to come from someone else and it looks more masculine. Streams of fabric also appear out of place within the image; it\u2019s blowing in the wind like hers. And just below it, propped upon the same ledge is a foot on the end of a muscular calf where the ink cuts off just below the knee.</p><p>I run my fingers along every inch of the tattoo, mesmerized by the beauty of it, but at the same time trying to understand the complexity and why the missing pieces.</p><p>I look up at Andrew and he says, \u201cYou asked who my musical idol was last night and the answer is Orpheus\u2014kind of weird, I know, but I\u2019ve always loved the story of Orpheus and Eurydice\u2014especially the one told by Apollonius of Rhodes and it just kind of stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>I smile softly and gaze at the tattoo again; my fingers still resting on his ribs. \u201cI know of Orpheus, but not so much Eurydice.\u201d I feel a little ashamed that I don\u2019t know their story, especially since it seems to mean so much to Andrew.</p><p>He begins to explain:</p><p>\u201cOrpheus\u2019 musical ability was unrivaled being the son of a Muse, and when he played his lyre or sang, every living thing listened. There was no musician greater than him, but his love for Eurydice was even more powerful than his talent; he would do anything for her. They married, but soon after the wedding Eurydice was bitten by a Viper and died. Stricken with grief, Orpheus went into the Underworld, determined to bring her back.\u201d</p><p>As Andrew tells this story, I can\u2019t help but be selfish and picture me in Eurydice\u2019s place. Andrew in place of Orpheus. I even compare the silly moment in the field that night with Andrew when the snake slithered across our blanket. So selfish and stupid of me to think this way, but I can\u2019t help it....</p><p>\u201cIn the Underworld, Orpheus played his lyre and sang and everyone there was enchanted by him, brought to their knees with emotion. And so they let Eurydice go into Orpheus\u2019 care, but only under one condition: Orpheus could not look back at Eurydice even for a moment on their way back to the Upper World.\u201d Andrew pauses. \u201cBut on the way up, he couldn\u2019t fight that desire, that need to turn around to make sure that Eurydice was still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked back,\u201d I say.</p><p>Andrew nods sadly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he did just a moment too soon and he saw Eurydice in the dim light from the top of the cave. They reached their hands out to each other and just before their fingers touched, she faded into the darkness of the Underworld and he never saw her again.\u201d</p><p>I swallow down my emotions and just stare longingly into Andrew\u2019s face. He isn\u2019t looking at me, but seems lost in thought, staring past me instead.</p><p>Then he snaps out of it.</p><p>\u201cPeople get deep, meaningful tattoos all the time,\u201d he says, looking at me again. \u201cThis one happens to be mine.\u201d</p><p>I glance down at it again and then up into his eyes, recalling something I remembered his father say that night in Wyoming.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, what did your father mean when he said that in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>His eyes soften and he briefly looks away. Then he moves his arm back down and takes my hand into his, running his thumb along the side of my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou caught that?\u201d he asks, smiling gently.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I sort of did.\u201d</p><p>Andrew kisses my fingers and then releases my hand.</p><p>\u201cHe used to mess with me about it,\u201d he says. \u201cI got the tattoo and told Aidan what it meant and why it wasn\u2019t technically complete and then he told our father.\u201d Andrew rolls his eyes. \u201cI never lived it down, that\u2019s for damn sure. For the last two years, my father has cracked my ass about it, but I know he was just being Dad: tough-guy that doesn\u2019t cry and doesn\u2019t believe in emotions. But he told me once when Aidan and Asher weren\u2019t around, that as \u2018pussified\u2019 as the meaning behind my tattoo was, that he understood\u2014he said to me: (Andrew twirls his fingers in the air harmoniously) \u2018Son, I hope you find your Eurydice one day\u2014as long as she doesn\u2019t turn you into a p**sy, I hope you find her.\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I try to push the little smile off my lips, but he sees it and smiles, too.</p><p>\u201cBut why is it unfinished?\u201d I ask, looking at it again and moving his arm away from the top of it. \u201cAnd what exactly is the meaning behind it?\u201d</p><p>Andrew sighs, though he knew all along that I would get to those questions. I get the sense that he might have been hoping that I would just let it go.</p><p>Not a chance.</p> <p>Suddenly, Andrew raises himself from the bed and guides me to sit up with him. He curls his fingers at the bottom of my tank-top and starts to lift it off my body. Without question, I raise my arms above me as he slips my shirt off and I sit nak*d from the waist up in front of him. Only a small part of me feels self-conscious and instinctively my shoulder moves inward as if to cover my nak*dness with its shadow.</p><p>Andrew guides me back down upon the bed and he pulls me so close to him that my bare br**sts are crushed between our bodies. Guiding my arms around his arms the same way his are around mine, he pulls me tighter against him, tangling our nak*d legs below. Our ribs are touching, my body fitting into his like two smooth-edged puzzle pieces.</p><p>And suddenly, I\u2019m starting to understand...</p><p>\u201cMy Eurydice is only half of the tattoo,\u201d he says and his eyes trail downward to where the tattoo is in relation to my body next to it. \u201cI thought that one day, if I ever got married, my girl would get the other half and reunite them.\u201d</p><p>My heart is in my throat. I try to swallow it down, but it\u2019s wedged there swollen and warm.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s crazy, I know,\u201d he says and I feel his arms around me begin to loosen.</p><p>I grip him a little tighter, holding him in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not crazy,\u201d I say, my voice low and intent. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not pussified; Andrew it\u2019s beautiful. You\u2019re beautiful....\u201d</p><p>A solitary emotion that I can\u2019t place flits across his face.</p><p>Then he gets up and reluctantly, I let him.</p><p>He plucks his dark brown cargo shorts from the floor next to the bed and slips them on over his boxers.</p> <p>Still a little stunned about how quickly he got up and why, it takes me a moment longer before I slip my tank-top back on.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I think maybe my dad was right all along,\u201d he says standing in front of the window, looking out at the city of New Orleans below. \u201cHe was onto something and using that whole real-men-don\u2019t-cry bullshit to cover it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo cover what up?\u201d</p><p>I step up behind him, but this time I don\u2019t touch him. He\u2019s unreachable in the sense that I\u2019m getting the feeling he doesn\u2019t want me here. It\u2019s not disinterest or a faded attraction, but it\u2019s something else....</p><p>He answers without turning around, \u201cThat nothing lasts forever.\u201d He hesitates, still looking out the window with his arms crossed over his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s better to shun emotion than to fall for it and let it make you its bitch\u2014and since nothing lasts forever, in the end everything that was once good, always hurts like hell.\u201d</p><p>His words slice right through me.</p><p>Any part of me that had been changed during my time with Andrew, all of the walls that I let down for him, just shot right back up around me.</p><p>Because he\u2019s right and I f**king know he\u2019s right.</p> <p>That logic is what kept me from jumping fully into his world all this time. And in a matter of seconds the truth in his words made me submissive to that logic once again.</p><p>I decide to drop it. There\u2019s an issue far more important than mine right now and I make sure I don\u2019t treat him any differently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll...need to go to your father\u2019s funeral, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andrew swings around at the waist, his eyes full of resolve.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t be going to the funeral.\u201d</p><p>He slips a clean shirt on down over his abs.</p><p>\u201cBut Andrew...you have to.\u201d My eyebrows deepen heavily within my forehead. \u201cYou\u2019ll never forgive yourself if you don\u2019t go to your own father\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>I see his jaw moving as if he\u2019s gritting his teeth. He looks away from me and sits on the end of the bed, bending over and wedging his bare feet down inside his low black running shoes, not bothering to untie them so they\u2019ll loosen.</p><p>He stands up.</p><p>I can only stand here in the center of the room, unbelieving. I feel like I should know something to say that will make him change his mind about the funeral, but my heart tells me that this is one argument I\u2019m not going to win.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something I\u2019ve gotta do,\u201d he says, shoving his car keys down inside his shorts pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a little while, alright?\u201d</p><p>Before I can answer, he steps up to me and cradles both sides of my head within his hands and leans in, touching his forehead to mine. I just look into his eyes, seeing so much pain and conflict and indecision among a storm of other things that I can\u2019t even begin to put a name to.</p><p>\u201cWill you be alright?\u201d he asks softly with his face inches from my own.</p><p>I lean away and look at him and nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be alright,\u201d I say.</p><p>But it\u2019s all that I can bring myself to say. I\u2019m as conflicted and indecisive as he seems to be. But I\u2019m also hurting. I feel like something is happening between us, but it\u2019s pulling us further apart than together like this whole trip had been doing. And it scares me.</p><p>I understand the logic. My walls are back up. But it scares me unlike anything ever has before.</p><p>He leaves me standing here as I watch him slip out of the room.</p><p>This is the first time since he came back for me in that bus station that he\u2019s left me. We have been together, practically inseparable, this whole time and now...since he walked out that door, I feel like I\u2019m never going to see him again.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>28</p><p>\u201cSTARTIN\u2019 EARLY, AREN\u2019T YAH?\u201d the bartender says as he slides a shot across the bar top and into my hand.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re open and serving already, then it\u2019s not too early.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s already three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. I left Camryn alone early this morning, well before eight. Kind of odd that we\u2019ve been on this trip together all this time and neither of us ever thought to, or wanted to, bring up anything about swapping phone numbers. I guess it didn\u2019t matter much since she and I were always together. I\u2019m sure by now she\u2019s long past wondering if I\u2019m ever coming back, maybe wishing she had my number so she can find out if I\u2019m alright\u2014the glass on the cell is broken, but it still works. I\u2019m starting to wish that it didn\u2019t though because Asher and my mom have tried calling dozens of times already.</p><p>I intend to go back to the hotel, but I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019ll only be to get Aidan\u2019s guitar from the room and to leave a plane ticket for Camryn on my bed. The room is paid up for two more days, so she\u2019ll be alright. I\u2019ll leave her money for a cab ride to the airport, too. It\u2019s the least I can do. I\u2019m the one that talked her into this shit with me. I\u2019ll be the one making sure her way home is paid in-full and that it\u2019s not a bus this time.</p><p>It ends today.</p><p>I never should\u2019ve let it go this far, but I was delusional and blinded by my painfully forbidden feelings for her. But I think she\u2019ll be alright; we didn\u2019t sleep together and no one said those three damning words that would definitely make things more complicated, so yeah...I think she\u2019ll be just fine.</p><p>After all, she never gave in to me. I basically laid the option out on the table for her: If you were to let me f**k you, you would have to let me own you. If that wasn\u2019t a blatant invitation then I don\u2019t know what is. Not very romantic, but it is what it is.</p><p>I pay for my shot and leave the bar. I just needed something to take the edge off. Though, for it really to do any good at taking this kind of edge off I would\u2019ve had to drink the whole damn bottle. I slide my hands down inside my pockets and walk the length of Bourbon Street and Canal Street and eventually down streets I don\u2019t even recall the names of as I go past the signs. I walk forever, everywhere, much like on mine and Camryn\u2019s sporadic road trip with no direction or purpose. I just go.</p><p>I think I\u2019m not trying to waste time so that the night falls and I can slip in and out quietly while she sleeps, but I\u2019m wasting time hoping I\u2019ll change my mind. I don\u2019t want to leave her, but I know I have to.</p><p>I end up at Woldenberg Riverfront Park, sitting along the bank of the Mississippi and watching the ships and the ferry as it travels back and forth to and from Algiers. The night falls. And for the longest time my only company is a statue of Malcolm Woldenberg, until two girls, obviously tourists judging by the I Love NOLA t-shirts, walks up.</p><p>The blonde one smiles coyly at me while the brown-haired one goes in for the kill.</p><p>\u201cPartying anywhere tonight?\u201d She cocks her head to one side looking down at me. \u201cI\u2019m Leah and this is Amy.\u201d</p><p>The blonde, \u2018Amy\u2019, smiles at me in a way that I know all I\u2019d have to do is ask her to f**k me and she would.</p><p>I nod, trying to be polite, but don\u2019t offer my own name.</p><p>\u201cSo? Partying tonight, or not?\u201d the brown-haired one asks, sitting down next to me on the concrete.</p><p>I\u2019ve already forgotten their names.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually I\u2019m not,\u201d I say and leave it at that.</p><p>The blonde sits down on the other side, drawing her knees up so that her shorts hike way up her bare thighs.</p><p>Camryn looks better in shorts like that.</p><p>I just shake my head and look back out at the Mississippi.</p><p>\u201cYou should come with us,\u201d the brown-haired girl says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of action going on over at d.b.a tonight; you look bored as hell.\u201d</p><p>I glance over at her. She\u2019s pretty hot, just like the blonde, but I find myself completely turned off the more she talks. All I can think about is Camryn. The girl has wounded my soul. It\u2019ll never be the same.</p><p>I scan the brown-haired girl\u2019s legs and then watch how her lips move when she says, \u201cWe\u2019d really like you to join us; it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>I could...if I\u2019m leaving and intend never to see Camryn again, maybe I should leave with these two, get a room somewhere else and f**k them both. I\u2019m pretty sure at the rate things are going that they would do each other in front of me. Been there, done that a few times and it never really gets old.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. \u201cI was waiting for someone.\u201d</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019m saying, or why I\u2019m saying it.</p><p>The brown-haired girl leans over and puts her hand on my thigh.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be better company,\u201d she says in a sultry sort of whisper with all of the obvious overtones of a girl who has had way too many one-night stands.</p><p>I move her hand off me and stand up, thrusting my hands back inside my pockets and leave. Any other time I might be on it, but not today.</p><p>Yeah, my soul is probably wounded beyond repair. I\u2019ve got to get out of this city.</p><p>As I walk away from the two girls without saying a word, I hear their voices fluttering on the air behind me. I don\u2019t give a shit what they\u2019re saying, or how rejected they feel. In an hour they\u2019ll be riding some other guy\u2019s c*ck and will forget they ever spoke to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s after midnight now. I already stopped at an internet caf\u00e9 and purchased Camryn\u2019s plane ticket to North Carolina online and afterwards stopped at an ATM and withdrew more than enough cash to pay her cab ride to the airport and one home from the airport in North Carolina.</p><p>On my way into the front lobby of our hotel, I ask the front desk clerk for an envelope, a piece of paper and something to write with and then I sit down on a couch in the lobby and write Camryn a note:</p><p>Camryn,</p><p>I\u2019m sorry I left like I did, but I know I couldn\u2019t say goodbye face-to-face. I hope you\u2019ll remember me, but if forgetting me is easier then I can live with that, too.</p> <p>Never hold back, Camryn Bennett; be sure to do what you want in life, say what you feel and never be afraid to be yourself. Fuck what everybody else thinks. You\u2019re living for you, not them.</p><p>The code below is what you\u2019ll need to give to the airport to get on your plane home. All you\u2019ll need is your I.D. The plane leaves tomorrow morning. The cash is for your cab.</p><p>Thank you for best two weeks of my life and for being there for me when I needed you the most.</p><p>-Andrew Parrish</p><p>KYYBPR</p> <p>I read the note over five times before I\u2019m satisfied with it and finally fold it and place it with the cash into the envelope.</p><p>I make my way to the elevator. One last hurdle is slipping out without Camryn knowing about it. I hope she\u2019s still asleep. Please just let her be asleep. I can do this if I don\u2019t have to see her, but if she sees me...No. I have to be able to do this either way.</p><p>And I will.</p><p>I step out of the elevator on our floor and make my way through one long, brightly-lit stretch of hallway past several rooms. Seeing our rooms out ahead makes my stomach swim nervously. I walk past quietly; worried that my shoes shuffling across the floor might be enough to let her know I\u2019m out here. There\u2019s a DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging on her doorknob and I don\u2019t know why but seeing it causes my stomach to twist up in knots. Maybe because the only time I\u2019ve ever hung one of those on a hotel door was when I was inside getting laid. The thought of Camryn being f**ked by some other guy....</p><p>I grind my teeth together and walk past. How insanely pathetic was that? She\u2019s not even mine and I just got raped by a crazy-jealous reaction.</p><p>The sooner I get out of New Orleans, the better.</p> <p>I slide my card-key in my door and slip inside the room. It looks exactly the way I left it: clothes strewn near my bags and Aidan\u2019s guitar propped against the wall underneath the mounted light fixture. I move through the room, gathering up everything and have an oh-yeah moment when I realize I probably would\u2019ve left my chargers in the wall if I hadn\u2019t of seen them at the right angle when I passed. I unplug them and shove them along with my clothes down into my bag. Lastly, I hurry into the bathroom to get my toothbrush from the sink.</p><p>Camryn is standing in the doorway when I walk back out.</p><p>CAMRYN</p><p>29</p><p>\u201cANDREW? ARE YOU ALRIGHT?\u201d I look across at him, crossing my arms as the room door clicks closed softly behind me.</p><p>I\u2019ve been so worried about him...worried because I was afraid he\u2019d left without saying goodbye, but more worried because of the state of mind he was in when he left. Because his father just died.</p><p>I catch my breath quietly and he walks past me towards his bags sitting on the end of the bed.</p><p>Why won\u2019t he look at me?</p> <p>I glance at the bags again and realize instantly what he\u2019s doing. I let my arms fall back to my sides and I walk closer to him.</p><p>\u201cPlease talk to me,\u201d I say gently. \u201cAndrew, you scared the shit out of me\u2014.\u201d He shoves his toothbrush into his duffle bag, keeping his back to me. \u201c\u2014if you need to go to the funeral, that\u2019s good. I can go back home. Maybe we can talk\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andrew whirls around.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the funeral or my father, Camryn,\u201d he says and his words hurt me without knowing the meaning behind them first.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>He turns away from me again, pretending to rummage through one of his bags though I know it\u2019s just a distraction. I see an envelope sticking out of his back pocket. RYN is written across the front; the first half of what I\u2019m guessing is my name is covered by the fabric of his pocket.</p><p>I reach out and take it.</p><p>Andrew turns around again and his face falls.</p><p>\u201cCamryn...,\u201d he breathes a sad breath and looks briefly down at the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I ask looking down at my name.</p><p>Already I\u2019m pulling out the top flap from inside the envelope with my finger.</p><p>Andrew doesn\u2019t answer; he just stands there waiting for me to read the contents of the note because he knows I\u2019m going to anyway.</p><p>He wants me to.</p><p>I see the cash and leave it in the envelope without touching it and I set it aside on the foot of the bed. All I care about is the note in my hands that already is crushing my heart and I haven\u2019t even read it yet. I look up at him and down at the note a few times before finally unfolding it.</p><p>My hands are shaking.</p><p>Why are my hands shaking?</p><p>And as I read, a hot lump wedges itself in the center of my throat. My eyes are burning with anger and hurt and tears.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you knew this trip had to end sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me babe,\u201d I snap, gripping the note tightly within my fingertips now down at my side. \u201cIf you\u2019re leaving, you no longer have that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>I glare back up at him, my face full of pain and questions and confusion. Why am I so mad, so hurt? Andrew is right: it had to end sometime, but why am I letting it affect me like this?</p><p>Tears begin to stream from my eyes. I can\u2019t hold them back, but I\u2019ll be damned if I let myself bawl like a baby. I just look at him, my face tight and consumed by pain and ire. My hands are clenched at my sides, the top half of Andrew\u2019s note crushed in my fist.</p><p>\u201cIf you were leaving like this because of your father, because you needed time alone, and the number on the bottom of this note was yours instead of a ticket confirmation, then I could understand.\u201d I raise the crushed note up in front of me and let it fall back at my side. \u201cBut to leave because of me and pretend that nothing between us ever happened...Andrew, that hurts. It f**king hurts.\u201d</p><p>I see his jaw twitch.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell said I could ever pretend that it never happened?\u201d he rips the words out, clearly stung by mine. He drops the duffle bag handle and moves away from the bed toward me. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to forget any of this, Camryn! That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t face you!\u201d He slashes the air between us with his hands.</p><p>I step backward and away from him. I can\u2019t deal with this. My heart hurts too much. And I\u2019m pissed off that I can\u2019t make myself stop crying. I look down at the note in my hand and then back up at him and finally I walk around him to the bed and drop it down beside the envelope and the money.</p><p>\u201cFine. Go ahead and leave. But I\u2019ll pay my own way home.\u201d</p><p>I wipe my eyes and walk to the door.</p><p>\u201cStill afraid,\u201d he calls out behind me.</p><p>I whirl around. \u201cYou don\u2019t know shit!\u201d And I push open the door, dropping his extra key on the floor and go back into my room.</p><p>I pace. And pace. And pace. I want to hit a wall or tear something up, but I settle with finally bawling like a baby.</p><p>Andrew storms inside my room, letting the door smack the wall on his way in. He grabs me by my upper-arms, digging his fingers into my muscles.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still afraid?!\u201d Tears lace his eyes: furious, painful tears. He shakes me. \u201cSAY WHAT YOU FEEL!\u201d</p><p>His thunderous voice makes my body go rigid for a moment, but I shove his hands off me. I\u2019m so confused. I know what I want to say. I don\u2019t want him to go, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cCamryn!\u201d His face is full of wrath and desperation. \u201cSay whatever it is that you feel! I don\u2019t care how dangerous or stupid or hurtful or hilarious\u2014TELL ME HOW YOU FEEL!\u201d His voice sears through me.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t stop:</p><p>\u201cBe honest with me. Be honest with yourself!\u201d His hands wave outward toward me in gesture. \u201cCAMR\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, goddammit!\u201d I scream at him. \u201cThe thought of you leaving and never seeing you again tears-me-up-inside!\u201d My throat burns like fire. \u201cI can\u2019t f**king breathe without you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSAY IT! Son-of-a-bitch,\u201d he says, exasperated, \u201cjust say it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to own me!\u201d I can hardly stand on my own anymore. Sobs rock my entire body. My eyes sting and my heart hurts like it never has before.</p><p>Andrew grabs me, twisting my wrists together behind my back with one of his hands. He pulls my back harshly into his chest. \u201cSay it again, Camryn,\u201d he demands, the heat of his breath bathing the side of my neck, sending chills throughout my limbs. I feel his teeth graze the flesh just below my ear. \u201cFucking say it, baby.\u201d His hand tightens painfully around my wrists.</p><p>\u201cI belong to you, Andrew Parrish...I want you to own me....\u201d</p><p>He coils the fingers from his other hand tightly within my hair, pulling my neck back and exposing my throat to him. He bites my chin and then down along my neck. I feel his c*ck pressing into me from behind through the barrier of our clothes.</p><p>\u201cPlease...,\u201d I whisper, \u201cdon\u2019t let me go....\u201d</p><p>With my back still pressed into his hard body and my wrists in his hand, he slips his fingers behind my shorts and panties and tears them off. He forces me around toward the bed where my knees are pressed against the mattress and he lifts my arms above my head, slipping off my tank-top.</p><p>I don\u2019t look behind me when I sense him kicking off his shoes and removing his clothes. I\u2019ll only move when he allows it.</p><p>His rock-hard abs press firmly into my back. I feel his warm arms slip around my nak*d waist; one hand moving up to fully squeeze one breast, the other sliding down in-between my legs. My neck falls back against his chest when he slips a finger between my throbbing lips below and teases me with it. I gasp, tilting my neck back so that I can reach his mouth. His tongue snakes out to touch mine; the fleshy warm wetness of it drives me insane. He crushes his lips against mine and kisses me ravenously, to the point that neither of us can breathe. And then he forces me forward onto the bed. My hands burrow into the sheets, my fingers curling into the fabric until he presses all of his weight on my back and my arms can\u2019t hold my body up anymore. He grabs my wrists again and pulls them around behind me, pressing himself against me.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, please f**k me, Andrew...please,\u201d I beg, my voice shuddering with my breath. I say what I feel this time without his prompt.</p><p>And it feels so right.</p><p>Andrew leans fully over me; I feel his hardness forceful and persistent. I want him inside of me so bad, but he\u2019s keeping it from me on purpose, making me feel like any moment he\u2019s going to shove it in me, but he never does.</p><p>Shivers attack my body again when I feel the tip of his tongue trace a path along the back of my neck. One side of my face is pressed against the mattress, the hard weight of his body on top of me forbidding me to move. I bite my lip when the sting of his teeth clamps down on my back, enough to cause pain, but not breaking the skin. And after he bites me he kisses and licks each spot to ease the tender pain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if my weight is nothing to him, Andrew flips my body over with one hand onto my back and slides me up to the center of the bed. He crawls in-between my legs, bumping them apart with his knees so that I\u2019m completely exposed to him. He presses the palms of his hands on the under-part of my thighs, forcing my legs to stay open.</p><p>His green orbs flash on me once and then he looks down at me spread open before him. He probes me teasingly, sliding the length of one finger between my lips and then around the edges of my clit. I gasp and shudder, feeling my insides squirm with every touch. He looks up at me again under dangerous hooded eyes and slides his fingers inside so deep. I move my hand down to join his and he lets me touch myself for a moment before refusing me anymore. He fingers me furiously now, touching every possible spot sensitive to touch and I start to writhe gently, my head pressing back into the pillow. And as if he knows I\u2019m going to come soon, he pulls his hand away to keep me from it.</p><p>He crawls his way on top of me, kissing and licking and biting my skin from my thighs all the way up to my throat and he holds my arms above my head so that I can\u2019t grasp him. His wolfish eyes study my mouth and then find my eyes and he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to f**k you so hard...God, you have no f**king idea.\u201d His words cut a path of pleasure from my ear all the way down into the throbbing wetness between my legs. He bites my tongue and then kisses me violently and we breathe heavily into each other\u2019s mouths, moaning against each other\u2019s lips.</p><p>His right hand moves down without breaking the kiss and he takes his c*ck into his hand and finds me, just barely entering me so that it drives me mad. I thrust my h*ps toward him, trying to force it deeper, kissing him harder and finally getting one hand around the back of his head. I grip his hair in my hand so hard that I feel like I\u2019m pulling it out. He doesn\u2019t care. Neither do I. He enjoys the pain as much as I do.</p><p>And then very slowly, so that I can feel every painfully searing sensation shiver through my body, he slides himself inside of me. My neck arches back on the pillow, my lips part open. I gasp and moan and whimper. My eyes are tingling so much that they\u2019re heavy and I can barely pry my lids apart. His c*ck feels like it\u2019s swelling inside of me and my thighs are trembling against his body.</p><p>He f**ks me slowly at first, forcing my eyes open to see his. He takes my bottom lip between his teeth and pulls back and then traces the full length of it with the tip of his tongue.</p><p>I crush my mouth against his, pushing against him with my h*ps and forcing him deeper.</p><p>My legs are shaking now. I can\u2019t control them. He starts to f**k me harder and I can\u2019t maintain the kiss anymore. My neck arches away from the pillow again, my back starts to lift, pushing my br**sts toward him where he licks my n**ples hungrily. I wrap my arms and legs around his body, digging my fingernails into his back, feeling his sweat bead underneath them. I break the skin. It just makes him f**k me harder.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d he whispers hotly into my ear and kisses me again.</p><p>Seconds later, I do. My body trembles and quivers as I feel myself constrict around him. \u201cDon\u2019t pull out,\u201d I whisper while we come together. And he doesn\u2019t. A deep, shuddering moan moves through his chest and I feel the warmth of him releasing inside of me. I tighten my legs around his waist until I can\u2019t anymore and slowly let my legs give way. He doesn\u2019t stop pushing himself inside of me until his body begins to relax.</p><p>He lies next to me; his face on my heart, my leg draped over his waist. And we lie like this for a while, curled into one another, letting our breathing steady and our bodies calm. But twenty minutes later, we\u2019re at it again. And before the night is over and we\u2019ve fallen fast asleep in each other\u2019s arms, he\u2019s had me in more ways than I\u2019ve ever been had.</p><p>The next morning, as the sun beams in through the curtains, he shows me that he\u2019s not always rough and aggressive by waking me up with sweet kisses. He kisses each of my ribs and massages my back and my thighs before making love to me softly.</p><p>I could die in this bed with him right now, wrapped in his arms and I would never know that I had died.</p><p>Andrew squeezes me against him within his arms and kisses my jawline.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go anywhere now,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cI never wanted to.\u201d</p><p>I turn around to lie facing him, tangling my nak*d legs around his. He touches his forehead to mine.</p><p>\u201cBut you were going to,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, I was going to because...,\u201d his thoughts trail.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. \u201cBecause I was too afraid of the obvious?\u201d</p><p>I know that must be why. I think. I hope....</p><p>Andrew\u2019s gaze strays downward. I lift my hand and brush the length of his eyebrow beneath my fingertip and then the bridge of his nose. I lean forward just a little and kiss his lips softly.</p><p>\u201cAndrew? Is that why?\u201d</p> <p>My heart tells me that it\u2019s not.</p><p>His eyes begin to smile and he pulls me closer, wrapping me up tighter in his arms and kissing me hard.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want this?\u201d he asks, as though he doesn\u2019t believe I could ever want him in this way, which is utterly absurd to me.</p><p>I struggle to find the meaning behind his thought-process, and I come up short.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d I say. \u201cAndrew, I meant what I said: I can\u2019t breathe without you. Last night, after you had been gone all day, I sat down on the edge of this bed and was literally breathless. I thought you had already left and I started thinking about how I didn\u2019t even have your phone number and that I would never be able to find you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He touches my lips with his finger, calming me. \u201cI\u2019m here now and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I smile longingly and lay my head against his chest. His chin rests upon my head. I listen to his heart beating and the sound of his breath as it comes out through his nose in an even, quiet motion above me. We lay like this for hours, hardly saying a word. I realize this is exactly where I\u2019ve wanted to be since I spoke to him on that bus that day.</p><p>I\u2019ve broken every rule...Every. Single. One.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>30</p><p>THE HEART ALWAYS WINS out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way. The mind may be what\u2019s best, but I don\u2019t give a shit what my mind is telling me anymore. Right now, I just want to live in the moment.</p><p>\u201cGet up, baby,\u201d I say, patting Camryn on the ass.</p><p>She fell asleep in my arms again after we woke up together earlier this morning. I think maybe I did too at some point, but all I\u2019ve thought about since last night is her and if I was ever asleep at all I\u2019ll never know.</p><p>She moans in protest and rolls over to face me, her body tangled in the white sheet, her blonde hair a matted mess, but still sexy as hell.</p><p>\u201cOh come on, baby,\u201d she says and my heart thumps hard a few times hearing her call me that, \u201clet\u2019s sleep all day.\u201d</p><p>I throw on my t-shirt and step into my shorts and sit on the bed beside her, grounding one arm on the other side of her body.</p><p>I lean over and press my lips against her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI want to do everything with you,\u201d I say, smiling so big that I realize how awkward it feels, but I don\u2019t care. \u201cWe can go everywhere, do whatever idea falls into our laps.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been this happy before. I didn\u2019t know happiness like this existed.</p><p>Camryn smiles so sweetly up at me, her blue eyes glistening still with that just-woke-up innocence. It\u2019s like she\u2019s studying me, trying to figure me out, but enjoying the process.</p><p>She reaches out both of her arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to carry me around everywhere,\u201d she says.</p><p>I reach out and take her arms into my hands and she lifts to sit upright on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have no problem with that,\u201d I laugh. \u201cI will totally f**king carry you around\u2014it\u2019ll get a reaction out of people, but so what\u2014But why do I need to carry you?\u201d</p><p>She kisses me on the nose.</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I can walk.\u201d</p><p>Realization teases my smile into a dark grin.</p><p>She starts to get up from the bed, letting her legs fall over the side and I see the discomfort in her face.</p><p>\u201cOh shit, baby, I am so sorry.\u201d I really am sorry, but I can\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>Neither can she, really.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying this to stroke that sexual ego of yours,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I have never been f**ked like that before.\u201d</p><p>I laugh out loud, throwing my head back once.</p><p>\u201cThe shit that comes out of your mouth!\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she points up at me, \u201cthat\u2019s all your fault. You\u2019ve turned me into a foul-mouthed, perverted, nymphomaniac that will apparently be walking funny for a day or two.\u201d She nods her head once to underline these facts.</p><p>Carefully, I lift her into my arms, both legs over one arm instead of making her straddle me in her \u2018condition\u2019.</p><p>\u201cSorry babe, but you were already kind of foul-mouthed when I met you,\u201d I say, grinning down at her looking up at me with a puffed-out upper-lip. \u201cPerverted? Maybe. But that was already in you, I just helped bring it out. Now nymphomaniac? That would mean you want to do it all the time, even if you\u2019re walking funny for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes grow wider and wider. \u201cNo, I am definitely out of commission, at least until tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>I kiss her forehead and carry her into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d I say, trading jokes for a softer expression. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you anyway. Today, Camryn Bennett, you will be pampered. And first on the agenda is a long, hot bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith bubbles?\u201d she asks with a Bambi-eyed pouty face.</p><p>I smile down at her. \u201cYes, with bubbles.\u201d</p><p>I run the bath water while she sits on the counter where I put her, nak*d to boot.</p><p>\u201cBubbles might be a problem, babe,\u201d I say, squeezing what\u2019s left of the shampoo in the trial-sized bottle the hotel provides.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d she says, swinging her feet back and forth with her hands propped on the edge of the counter. \u201cI\u2019m out of just about everything\u2014my toothpaste tube is flat and I could use some body wash, or somthin\u2019.\u201d She reaches down and feels her bare legs. \u201cI practically have scales.\u201d She makes a face.</p><p>Twisting the inside of my mouth between my teeth I say, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the store.\u201d Letting the tub fill up behind me I turn to her and check out the stuff she has lying on the counter. Then I go back into the room and come back with a tiny hotel pencil and a palm-sized square notepad. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>While she\u2019s thinking about it I write down what she already mentioned.</p><p>\u201cToothpaste, body wash\u2014.\u201d I look up at her, \u201cthat\u2019s just liquid soap, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not really,\u201d she says and I\u2019m trying not to check out her boobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not hand soap, it\u2019s\u2014well, you\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I jot down: not liquid hand soap</p><p>I look back up at her. \u201cOK, what else can you think of?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She purses her lips contemplatively. \u201cShampoo and conditioner, I prefer L'Or\u00e9al; it\u2019s in a pink bottle, but it doesn\u2019t matter really, just none of that shampoo+conditioner stuff\u2014left the bottles I recently bought in the last motel. Oh! Also, get me a small bottle of Baby Oil.\u201d</p><p>I raise a very interested brow. \u201cBaby Oil? You have something in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She hits me gently on the arm with the back of her fingers, but all I notice is how her boob jiggled when she did it. \u201cDefinitely not! I just like to use it in the shower.\u201d</p><p>I jot down: large bottle of baby oil (just in case)</p> <p>\u201cAnd maybe some snacks and a six-pack of water or non-lemon tea\u2014something besides soda\u2014and, oh!\u201d She points her finger upwards. \u201cSome beef jerky!\u201d</p><p>I grin and jot that down, too.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t think of anything else yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you do,\u201d I say, pulling my phone from the leg pocket of my cargo shorts, \u201ccall me and let me know\u2014what\u2019s your number?\u201d</p> <p>She smiles and happily tells me while I call her from my phone. Her voice mail picks up and I say: Hey, babe, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ll be back in a bit; right now I\u2019m a bit pre-occupied staring at this incredibly hot blonde sitting nak*d on a counter.</p><p>Camryn grins and blushes and pulls me between her suspended legs and kisses me hard.</p><p>\u201cOh shit! The water!\u201d she says, noticing the tub close to overflowing.</p><p>I turn the water off quickly.</p><p>I set the phone and my grocery list on the counter and lift her into my arms.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, I\u2019m not crippled.\u201d But she\u2019s not exactly arguing with me, either.</p> <p>I help her into the tub and she leans back into the warmth of it, letting her hair fall around her shoulders and into the water, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few,\u201d I say as I go to leave.</p><p>\u201cYou promise this time?\u201d</p><p>That stops me in my tracks. I turn back to look across at her and this time she\u2019s not joking. It makes me feel bad that she even has to ask, not because it offends me, but because I had to give her any reason to ask in the first place.</p><p>I look at her very seriously.</p><p>\u201cYes, I promise, babe. You\u2019re kind of stuck with me, y\u2019know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She smiles sweetly, though it\u2019s laced with mischief. \u201cDamn the things I get myself into.\u201d</p><p>I wink at her and leave.</p> <p>CAMRYN</p><p>SEX ALWAYS CHANGES EVERYTHING. It\u2019s like you\u2019re living in a bubble where everything is safe and flirty and often predictable. An attraction to the right kind of person can last forever when that intimate mystery is left in-tact, but the moment you sleep with someone, safe, flirty and predictable often become their opposites. Will the attraction die out now? Will we still want each other as much as we did before we had sex? Are either of us secretly thinking that we made a huge mistake and should\u2019ve left things the way they were? No. Yes. And no. I know this because I feel it. It\u2019s not overconfidence or the delusional dreams of a young, inexperienced woman with insecurity issues. It\u2019s a blatant fact: Andrew Parrish and I were meant to meet on that bus in Kansas.</p><p>Coincidence is just a safe conformist for fate.</p><p>I soak in the bath for a while, but decide to get out before I start pruning. I am sore down there, but I\u2019m perfectly capable of walking. I just think it\u2019s sweet the way he feels the need to take care of me.</p><p>I slip on my gray pair of cotton shorts I bought on the road and a black tank-top. I make up the bed and straighten the room a little before grabbing my phone to check my messages: same random stuff from Natalie. Still nothing from my mom. I always leave my phone on vibrate. I can\u2019t stand to hear a phone ring. It doesn\u2019t matter if I could have any kind of ring tone I wanted; a ringing phone is like nails down a chalkboard to me. I head over to the window and pull the curtains open wide to let the bright sun flood the room and I lean on the windowsill, gazing down at New Orleans. I\u2019ll never forget this place.</p><p>I think about Andrew and his father briefly, but shut it out of my mind. I\u2019ll give him a few more days before I try talking to him about it again. He\u2019ll hurt for a while, but I don\u2019t want him unintentionally using me as a barrier. He has to deal with it sometime.</p><p>I set my phone down on the windowsill and scroll through my music. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve listened to any of my stuff; surprisingly, I\u2019ve not missed it much. Andrew\u2019s classic rock has more than just grown on me; he\u2019s made me kind of love it.</p><p>Barton Hollow by The Civil Wars. I stop on that one\u2014my favorite for the past two months\u2014and turn the speaker on, letting the music filter into the room with that folky-country style that is my guilty pleasure. I\u2019m not much of a country music girl, but this band is an exception. I sing along with John and Joy, letting myself loose since I\u2019m in the privacy of my room and I sing as loud as I can. I dance a little standing in front of the window. And when Joy\u2019s solo begins, I sing along with her like I always do, trying to work my untrained voice to sound as velvety as hers does. I could never sound like her, but it makes me feel good to sing along.</p><p>My lips snap shut and my dancing body freezes when I notice Andrew leaning against the wall by the door, watching me. Grinning, of course.</p><p>I literally melt under the blush of my face.</p><p>He walks the rest of the way into the room now that he\u2019s been caught and sets two plastic bags down on the TV stand.</p><p>\u201cFor someone oh-so-sore,\u201d he mocks, his dimples deepening, \u201cyou sure were workin\u2019 those hips.\u201d</p><p>Still blushing, I try to distract from my little performance as much as possible by making my way over to the bags. \u201cYeah, well you shouldn\u2019t be sneaking up on me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sneaking,\u201d he says, \u201cjust enjoying myself\u2014you really do have a sweet voice.\u201d</p><p>I blush harder, turning my back to him and rummaging through one bag.</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby, but I think you\u2019re kinda biased.\u201d I look back just long enough to playfully smirk at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d he says and he seems serious, \u201cyou aren\u2019t as bad as you think you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as bad?\u201d I turn around, holding a large bottle of Baby Oil. \u201cWhat does that mean exactly, that you think I\u2019m only a little bad?\u201d I scoff at him and hold up the Baby Oil. \u201cI said a small bottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they were out of small bottles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh.\u201d I smirk again, setting the bottle on the TV stand.</p><p>\u201cWell, no I don\u2019t think you\u2019re bad at all,\u201d he says and I hear the bed squeak as he sits on the end of it.</p><p>I look at him through the mirror in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWell you did good on the shampoo and conditioner,\u201d I say, plucking the bottles out and setting them next to the Baby Oil. \u201cBut the body wash, not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He looks truly disappointed. \u201cYou said not liquid hand soap. That clearly says body wash across the front.\u201d He points at it as if to justify.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding,\u201d I say, smiling gently at his reaction. \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d</p><p>He looks relieved, letting his hand drop to his side on the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou should perform. At least once. Just to see what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>I do not like that light-bulb moment he seems to be having right now. Not one bit.</p><p>\u201cUmmm, yeah...no.\u201d I shake my head at him through the mirror. \u201cKind of like eating bugs or becoming an astronaut for a day, that ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>I reach inside the bag and pull out...oh no he didn\u2019t....</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019ll be an experience, something you never thought you\u2019d do, but afterwards you\u2019ll feel exhilarated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat-the-hell-is-this?\u201d I ask turning around, holding up a box of Vagisil in my fingers.</p><p>He looks incredibly uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s...well, you know,\u201d he winces, \u201cfor your...girly parts.\u201d He nods uneasily towards my \u2018girly parts\u2019.</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cYou think I smell? Have you seen me itching?\u201d I\u2019m trying not to laugh.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s eyes pop wide open. \u201cWhat\u2014No! I just thought it might help with the soreness.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen him look so embarrassed, and at the same time, shocked. \u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t exactly a comfortable thing standing in that particular aisle reading the labels and being a guy.\u201d He starts gesturing with his hands. \u201cI saw it was for that general area and I tossed it in the basket.\u201d</p><p>I set the Vagisil down and walk over to him. \u201cWell, that stuff isn\u2019t exactly going to help with soreness due to...,\u201d I purse my lips, \u201c...\u2018excessive friction\u2019, but it\u2019s the thought that counts.\u201d I sit on his lap, straddling his waist and lean in to kiss him.</p><p>He wraps his arms around my back.</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess it\u2019s safe to assume we don\u2019t need separate rooms anymore,\u201d he says, smiling up at me.</p><p>With my hands locked around the back of his neck, I lean in and kiss him again. \u201cI started to go over there to get your stuff myself while you were gone until I realized I threw your extra key on the floor when I stormed out of there last night.\u201d</p><p>He slides his big hands down and grips my butt, pulling me closer. Then he kisses me in the hollow of my neck and stands up, taking me with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get it now,\u201d he says, letting me slide carefully out of his grasp. \u201cI figure it\u2019ll take me a couple of days to learn to play that song and to learn the lyrics\u2014you seem to have it down.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh...</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him in a sidelong glare. \u201cLearn it why?\u201d</p><p>His dimples deepen again. \u201cIf I do recall, you gave up your freedom after winning it at that game of pool.\u201d</p><p>His expression is all but pure evil.</p><p>I shake my head slowly at first and then gradually harder as the realization of the situation starts to sink in.</p><p>\u201cYour words were,\u201d he nods once, \u201cand I quote: I don\u2019t want that freedom unless it comes to eating bugs or hanging my ass out the car window\u2014sorry, babe, but you should learn when to keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Andrew,\u201d I step away from him, crossing my arms, \u201cyou can\u2019t make me sing in front of people. That\u2019s just cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you or the audience?\u201d</p><p>He grins.</p><p>I stomp on his foot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding! I\u2019m kidding!\u201d He laughs out loud.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t make me do it.\u201d</p><p>He cocks his head to one side, green eyes lit up with a little bit of everything that makes him irresistible. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t force you to do anything, but...,\u201d Oh great, now he\u2019s fake-pouting. But worse, it\u2019s working! \u201c...I really, really, really wish that you would.\u201d He cups my elbows in his hands and draws me close.</p><p>I snarl at him and grit my teeth behind my tightly-closed lips.</p><p>One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi.</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>His face lights up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut just once!\u201d I point one finger. \u201cAnd if anyone laughs at me you better not leave me in jail!\u201d</p><p>He grabs my face, squishing my cheeks in his hands and kisses my fish-lips.</p><p>31</p><p>MINUTES LATER, ANDREW\u2019S COMING back through the door with his bags and his brother\u2019s acoustic guitar.</p> <p>He is really excited about this.</p><p>I\u2019m utterly terrified and already kicking myself for agreeing to it. But I have to admit, there\u2019s also a tiny pang of excitement in me, too. I\u2019m not totally afraid to be in front of a crowd\u2014had no problem giving a speech on endangered wildlife in eleventh grade, or playing the part of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest on stage my senior year. But singing is different. My acting isn\u2019t all that bad. My singing, especially a duet with someone like Andrew who sings like a blues-rock god who melts panties, is another story.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to hear my kind of music, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Andrew sets his bags on the floor and goes to the bed with the guitar.</p><p>\u201cWell, whatever that song was you were so cutely dancing and singing to, I will let slide\u2014I was diggin\u2019 it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Civil Wars\u2014my flavor-of-the-month, I guess,\u201d I say, coming out of the bathroom with wet hair, drying the ends with a towel (decided to rewash it after Andrew came back with the goods). \u201cThe song is called Barton Hollow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery modern-folksy,\u201d he says, strumming the guitar a few times. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>He adds, looking up at me: \u201cWhere\u2019s your phone?\u201d</p><p>I walk over and get it from the windowsill, scroll the progress bar back to the beginning and hand it to him. He sets it beside him on the bed and hits play. I go back to drying my hair while he does his learn-by-ear thing, stopping and starting the music over again and again, curling his fingers around the neck of the guitar and testing the sound of the strings until he finds the right ones that match the music. In a matter of minutes, after a few out-of-tune chords, he starts to play the first riff easily.</p><p>And by nightfall he\u2019s pretty much got the whole song down pat, with the exception of one short riff he keeps mixing up with another. Wanting to learn it as quickly as possible, he ended up looking for the music online and once he found it that definitely sped the progress up.</p><p>The lyrics were easier.</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve almost got it,\u201d he says sitting on the windowsill against a dark and cloudy, rainy background. It started raining around eight and has been ever since.</p><p>Every now and then I would join in and sing some with him, but I\u2019ve been too nervous. I really don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pull something crazy like this off if I\u2019m nervous with only him in the room. So much for not being afraid in front of crowds. I predict an extreme case of stage fright, after all.</p><p>\u201cCome on, babe,\u201d he says with a nod, his fingers draped over the guitar, \u201cjust because you already know all the words doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t practice with me.\u201d</p><p>I plop down on the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t make any of your goofy faces at me, or grin, or smile, or\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t even breathe,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI swear! Come on.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and get up from the bed, putting my half-eaten strip of beef jerky on the nightstand. Andrew positions the guitar on his thigh and takes a quick sip of bottled tea to get his mouth ready to sing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d he says as I\u2019m slowly walking over, \u201cthe guy has way more lines by himself to sing than the girl\u2014she only has that one solo, the rest you\u2019ll be singing right along with me.\u201d</p> <p>I shrug nervously. \u201cTrue,\u201d I admit. \u201cAt least through most of the song your voice will help drown mine out.\u201d</p><p>He places the guitar pick in-between his lips and reaches his hand out to me. \u201cBaby, come here.\u201d</p><p>I walk over and take his hand and he pulls me between his legs, the guitar between us. Once I\u2019m still and where he wants me, he takes the pick from his mouth. \u201cI love your voice, alright? But even if I thought you couldn\u2019t sing I\u2019d still want you to do this. What anyone else thinks doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>My lips lift into an unsure, demure smile. \u201cOK,\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ll do it for you, but it\u2019s only for you; better remember that.\u201d I point sternly at him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna owe me.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t want you doing it just for me, but since practicing is more important than arguing with you about it, I\u2019ll wait until after you sing at Old Point to ask you if you got anything out of it other than giving me my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s fair enough.\u201d</p><p>He nods once and positions himself again and then starts to put the pick against the chords.</p><p>\u201cW-Wait...maybe if you stand up, too, I won\u2019t feel so singled out.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and stands up from the windowsill. \u201cDamn, girl\u2014alright, however you want to do it. If you decide you want to do it with a bag over your head, you can.\u201d</p><p>I look at him as if entertaining the stupid idea.</p><p>\u201cNo way, Camryn, no bags. Now let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>We practice well into the night until we\u2019re forced to quit because apparently we were disturbing the hotel guests on either side of us. And just when I was really starting to get the hang of it and letting loose a lot more, not worried what Andrew might be thinking of my singing.</p><p>I think I was doing pretty well.</p><p>We go to bed earlier tonight since our practice got cut short and we lay curled up next to one another and just talk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you got fed up with my shit,\u201d I say lying in the fold of his arm. \u201cOtherwise, I might be back in North Carolina right now.\u201d</p><p>I feel his lips press into the side of my hair.</p><p>\u201cI have to confess something,\u201d he says.</p><p>My ears perk up. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, looking up at the ceiling where lights from the moving city outside move in strange patterns every now and then. \u201cBack in Wellington, Kansas, in that first motel we got, when you were in the bathroom the next morning and I gave you two minutes to get ready...,\u201d He pauses and I feel his head move slightly as if looking down at me.</p><p>I draw my head away from his arm so I can look up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember; what did you do?\u201d</p><p>He smiles nervously.</p><p>\u201cI sort of took a picture of your driver\u2019s license with my phone.\u201d</p><p>I blink back the mild stun.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d I rise up a little higher so I can look at him without risking my eyes getting stuck in the top of my head like that.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad?\u201d</p><p>I let out a spat of air. \u201cI guess it depends on what you planned to do with the rather personal information.\u201d</p><p>He looks away, but I catch the blush on his face even in the darkness of the room.</p><p>\u201cWell, it definitely wasn\u2019t so I could find you later and cut you up into little pieces or anything.\u201d</p><p>My mouth falls open. \u201cWell that\u2019s a comfort!\u201d I laugh.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, though, why\u2019d you take it?\u201d</p><p>He looks back at the ceiling again, seeming lost in thought.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to make sure I knew how to find you again,\u201d he confesses, \u201cyou know...just in case we did decide to go our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>My eyes smile at him, but my mouth doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m not mad that he took the photo for that reason\u2014I kind of want to kiss him for it\u2014but I\u2019m not sure I like the whole \u2018just in case\u2019 part, either. It makes me feel more than I already did that he planned to leave at some point, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019re not telling me?\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cNo. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>I look at the ceiling, too.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve just always sort of felt this strange...reluctance from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReluctance?\u201d he says, surprised. \u201cWas I reluctant to talk you into going on this road trip with me? Or reluctant to go down on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamryn, the only thing I\u2019ve ever been reluctant about is wondering if it was right that we be together.\u201d</p><p>I lift up from the bed and turn fully at the waist to see him. The shadow across his face makes his eyes fiercer. He\u2019s shirtless and lies with one arm bent behind his head.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re not right?\u201d</p><p>This conversation is starting to make my stomach fall in on itself.</p><p>He reaches out the hand not propped behind his head and takes my wrist gently. \u201cNo, babe, I...I think we are right in every way...and that\u2019s why I thin\u2014that\u2019s why I thought it was better we didn\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me down to him and I lay on the top of my hands on his chest.</p><p>\u201cI just wasn\u2019t sure if we should go through with it,\u201d he says, combing his fingers through the hair beside my ears. \u201cBut, babe, you weren\u2019t exactly sure of anything, either.\u201d</p><p>I lay back down beside him. He\u2019s got me on that one.</p><p>The only thing I still don\u2019t quite understand is what were his reasons for being so careful to get involved, exactly? He knows why I left home and all about Ian\u2019s death. I have a laundry list of valid reasons stuck to the fridge by a banana magnet for all to see. Andrew\u2019s reasons are still hidden in a shoebox somewhere labeled Christmas Cards.</p><p>And I think it\u2019s more than just his dad.</p><p>He moves his arm out from underneath my head and climbs on top of me, a leg on each side, his body propped up by his muscular arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you can\u2019t sleep to music,\u201d he says, apparently recalling the first thing I ever said to him and then he leans in and kisses me.</p><p>I lift my arms and cradle his beautiful face in my hands, pulling him down to kiss me again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad that Idaho is famous for potatoes.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows scrunch up in his forehead.</p><p>I just smile and pull him toward my lips again. He kisses me deeply, tangling his tongue with mine. And then he starts to kiss his way down toward my stomach. He traces a circle around my bellybutton with the tip of his tongue and curls his fingers behind the elastic of my panties.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can....\u201d I say softly, gazing down at him.</p><p>He licks my stomach and then kisses my fingers as my hands move to his face and then into his hair.</p><p>\u201cNo sex,\u201d he says, \u201cand I promise I\u2019ll lick you carefully.\u201d He slides my panties off and I lift my ass a little to make it easier for him.</p><p>He kisses my inner thigh. And then the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my tongue really wet so it doesn\u2019t sting,\u201d he says gently and kisses my inner thighs again, getting closer to my warmth.</p><p>I gasp a little when his fingers touch me very carefully and spread my lips apart.</p><p>\u201cDamn, baby, you really are swollen.\u201d His comment is heartfelt and not at all teasing.</p><p>It does sting slightly, but my God I want this so bad....</p><p>I feel his breath hot between my legs. \u201cI\u2019ll be very gentle,\u201d he says and my breath catches when his very wet tongue licks me once slowly, his fingers still holding me apart but without putting any pressure on the area. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My body melts into the sheets as he licks me over and over, putting just enough pressure on me that I feel no pain, but complete and uninhibited ecstasy.</p><p>We\u2019ve been practicing Barton Hollow for two days, mostly in our room at the Holiday Inn, but we walked out by the Mississippi river at the end of Canal Street and did some practicing there, too. I think Andrew came up with the idea to sneakily try to get me more comfortable singing in public. There weren\u2019t many people out there at the time, but I was still nervous as hell. Most just walked past without stopping to check us out (we weren\u2019t in full performance-mode and often stopped and started over at different parts of the song, so it wasn\u2019t really much to listen to), but one or two here and there lingered as they walked past. A woman smiled at me. But I don\u2019t know if it was a pity smile because I\u2019m horrible, or if she happened to like my voice.</p><p>I guess it could go either way.</p><p>By day three, Andrew is sure that we both have it down and is set on heading to Old Point soon to perform.</p> <p>Me, not so much. I need another week or month or year or two.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna do fine,\u201d he says while tying his boots. \u201cActually, you\u2019re gonna do great. By the end of the song, I\u2019ll have to beat the guys off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up,\u201d I say, slipping on a black open shoulder top with cute chain straps. I\u2019m definitely not wearing the strapless one on a night like this. \u201cI saw the way the girls were lookin\u2019 at you that night\u2014I think having you up there with me is the only thing I\u2019ve got going for me because everyone will be too preoccupied with you to notice my screw-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you know the song better than I do,\u201d he says. \u201cStop being so negative.\u201d His black t-shirt tumbles down over his abs. He\u2019s wearing a black and silver belt, but only tucks the shirt in a little around the buckle, letting the rest hang freely around the top of his chiseled hips. Dark jeans, the front of his tousled hair spiked up a bit\u2014What was he saying?</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you really need to try to remember,\u201d he goes on as he applies a layer of deodorant, \u201cis not to sing every line in the song\u2014got an opportunity not to sing as much but you still sing my parts, too.\u201d He raises a brow looking over at me. \u201cNot that I mind, I just figured it would make you more comfortable having to sing less.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m just so used to singing along to the whole song\u2014kind of hard to get the hang of not singing certain parts.\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>I slip my feet down into my new heels and go to check myself out in the tall mirror over the TV stand.</p><p>\u201cYou are so damn sexy,\u201d Andrew says coming up behind me.</p><p>He slips his hands on my waist and kisses my neck, then slaps me on the butt of my tight almost-skinny-jeans and I yelp a little because it stings.</p><p>\u201cAnd as always, babe, I love the braids.\u201d He reaches up and slides the two braids lying over each shoulder down the length of his thumbs and then kisses me playfully on the cheek.</p> <p>I recoil and push him away teasingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll mess up my makeup.\u201d</p><p>He walks away smiling and grabs his wallet from the nightstand and slips it into his back pocket.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess this is it,\u201d he says.</p><p>He moves to the center of the room and extends one hand far out to me, placing his other arm horizontally across his back and bows, grinning. The tips of my fingers inch their way across his and then he encloses my hand and pulls me along with him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guitar?\u201d</p><p>We stop just before he opens the door and he looks at me thankfully.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that might help,\u201d he says, taking the guitar up by its neck. \u201cIf Eddie isn\u2019t there, we might\u2019ve been shit out of luck with no guitar to play with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well then I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head and pulls me with him out the door.</p><p>32</p><p>THIS TIME WE TAKE the Chevelle. Andrew took one look at my shoes and knew I wouldn\u2019t make it all the way into Algiers wearing these babies and he wasn\u2019t about to carry me and the guitar. We take the freeway instead of the ferry and make our way across the Mississippi and are there by nightfall. Walking the rest of the way to Old Point like we did the first time would\u2019ve been better, because right now as we drive closer, I know we\u2019ll be there in no time.</p><p>I\u2019m starting to feel sick to my stomach.</p><p>We park along Olivier Street and get out. My feet are cemented to the road.</p><p>Andrew comes around to my side and pulls me into his arms, gently squishing me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t make you do this,\u201d he says, having a change of heart. I\u2019m pretty sure I look like I\u2019m about to lose the late lunch we had not long ago.</p><p>Pulling me away from his chest, he takes my face into his hands and gazes into my eyes. \u201cI mean it, baby, all joking aside\u2014I don\u2019t want you to do it if you absolutely don\u2019t want to, not even for me.\u201d</p><p>I nod nervously and inhale a deep breath; my face still cupped within his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can do this,\u201d I say, still nodding, trying to pull my courage together. \u201cI want to do it.\u201d</p><p>He brushes my cheeks under the pads of his thumbs. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smiles in at me with those green eyes, which I\u2019m starting to believe are bewitching me in some way, and then takes my hand. He plucks the guitar out of the back seat and we walk into Old Point together.</p><p>\u201cParrish!\u201d Carla says from behind the bar. She raises her hand and waves us towards her.</p><p>Still hand in hand, Andrew weaves us through the thick crowd and over to her. The TV behind her head is playing commercials; the light from it casts a white glow around her.</p><p>\u201cHey Carla,\u201d Andrew says, leaning over the bar to hug her, \u201cis Eddie here tonight?\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her h*ps and smiles over at me.</p><p>\u201cHe sure is,\u201d she says, \u201che\u2019s around here somewhere. Hi Camryn, good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>I smile back at her. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>Andrew sits on a barstool and motions for me to take the one next to him. I hop up and sit here nervously. All I can think about is how many people there are in this place. My eyes scan the room uneasily, over the tops of moving heads and through people standing up now that the band has started playing again. As the music picks up, Andrew and Carla are practically shouting at each other over the bar:</p><p>\u201cGot any room for us tonight?\u201d Andrew asks.</p><p>Carla leans in further toward him. \u201cUs?\u201d she says, glancing at me once. \u201cOh wow, are you both going to sing?\u201d She looks excited.</p><p>My heart just jumped ship and fell into my knees.</p><p>I swallow down a nervous knot looking between them, but then another one just forms in its place.</p><p>Carla tilts her head and her already huge smile warms. \u201cOh honey, you\u2019ll do great\u2014no need to be nervous; everybody here will love you.\u201d She reaches somewhere behind the bar and pulls up a shot glass. A man sits at the bar on the other side of me, obviously a regular since he doesn\u2019t have to tell her what he wants and Carla is already pouring him a drink.</p><p>She keeps her attention mostly on me and Andrew, though.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to tell her,\u201d Andrew says, \u201cbut this is her first time, so I have to cut her some slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first and last time,\u201d I correct him.</p><p>Carla grins secretly over at Andrew and then says to me, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not the violent type, but if you have any problems with anyone out there, just come get me and I\u2019ll throw them out the side door just like you see it done in the movies.\u201d She winks at me and then turns back to Andrew.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Eddie now,\u201d she says, nodding in the direction of the stage.</p><p>Eddie is walking through the crowd, wearing the same sort of thing I saw him in the first time I met him: button-up white shirt, black slacks, shiny black shoes and a deep, wrinkly smile.</p><p>\u201cGa, dere come Parrish!\u201d Eddie says gripping Andrew\u2019s hand and pulling him into a hug. Then he looks at me. \u201cGalee! You look like dem lad\u2019es in dem magazines, you do!\u201d And he hugs me, too. He smells like cheap whiskey and cigarettes but I can only feel comforted by it for some reason.</p><p>Andrew is beaming.</p><p>\u201cCamryn\u2019s going to sing with me tonight,\u201d Andrew says proudly.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s eyes get real big, like bright white balls of excitement fixed within the dark brown backdrop of his skin. It should make me more nervous like when Carla found out, but Eddie\u2019s presence is actually helping to ease my mind some. Maybe I should shackle him to my wrist while I sing.</p><p>\u201cOh sha,\u201d Eddie says, grinning in at me, \u201cah bet you sing as preddy as you are.\u201d</p><p>I blush hard.</p><p>\u201cWell get\u2019own up dere!\u201d He points at the stage. \u201cWhen dem\u2019s done playin\u2019 dis song \u2018ere!\u201d</p><p>Andrew takes my hand and pulls me to his side. I feel like Eddie is like another father to Andrew and Andrew is happy that he seems to like me so much.</p><p>Eddie walks beside the stage and holds up three fingers at us. \u201cTeree more minutes!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I am so frickin\u2019 nervous!\u201d</p><p>Yep, Eddie should\u2019ve stayed nearby.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s hand tightens around mine. He leans in to my ear. \u201cJust remember: all these people here are just having a good time; no one\u2019s here to judge you\u2014this ain\u2019t American Idol.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep, relaxing breath.</p><p>We listen to the band finish up their last song and then the music stops, followed by the usual sound of instruments being moved or tuned or just knocked against something the wrong way. A wave of chattering voices becomes louder without the music to drown it out, rolling through the space like an amplified, irregular humming. A thick layer of cigarette smoke makes the air feel stuffy, mixed with all of the bodies packed into the area.</p><p>When Andrew starts to pull me toward the stage my hands start shaking and I look down, realizing my nails are digging into the skin around his knuckles.</p><p>He smiles gently and I walk up with him.</p><p>\u201cDo I look OK?\u201d I whisper to him.</p><p>If I get through this without having an anxiety attack I\u2019ll be surprised.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you look perfect.\u201d</p><p>He kisses my forehead and then sets his guitar next to the drum set so he can position the microphone.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to share the mic,\u201d he says. \u201cJust don\u2019t head-butt me.\u201d</p><p>I narrow my eyes at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny,\u201d he laughs softly, \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>Several people in the crowd are already looking up at us, but most everybody else is doing their own thing. I can\u2019t do anything but stand here and that in itself is making me more nervous. At least Andrew is able to preoccupy himself with his guitar. I\u2019m just twirling my thoughts around in my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asks beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo, but let\u2019s get it over with.\u201d</p><p>We look at each other and he quietly mouths: \u201cOne. Two. Three\u2014\u201d</p><p>We sing together:</p><p>\u201cOoooh...oooh...oooh...oooh!\u201d A one-second pause. \u201cOoooh...oooh...oooh...oooh!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guitar.</p><p>Dozens of heads turn all at the same time and the wave of conversations ceases like turning off a faucet.</p><p>While Andrew plays the first riff and he\u2019s gearing up to sing the first verse, I\u2019m so terrified inside that I feel like I can\u2019t move anything but my eyes.

They\u2019re nodding to one another, the kind of nod that says: They\u2019re really good, and I feel my face just light up as I start to sing my part with Andrew again and with gradual confidence. I\u2019m moving my body more naturally to the music now and I think I\u2019ve almost completely shed the fear, but my solo...oh my God, my solo is next...</p><p>Andrew locks eyes with me as if to use his gaze as a means to concentrate and stay calm and he strums the guitar.</p><p>He stops right in time with the music and taps the edge of the wood before my first line, strums the guitar and stops again, tapping the wood after my second and so on until I hit my last note and Andrew starts to play fully again while he says in a whisper to me: \u201cFlawless,\u201d and then he starts to sing again. He\u2019s grinning so wide. So am I. We press our faces close as we sing our hearts out into the mic during the faster interlude.</p><p>\u201cWoooh...ooooh...ooooh!\u201d</p><p>The guitar slows and we sing the last chorus together softly and he kisses me on the mouth after we both say: \u201c...soul....\u201d And the song ends.</p><p>The audience erupts into claps and cheers. I even hear one guy say: \u201cEncore!\u201d from somewhere in the back.</p> <p>Andrew pulls me close and kisses me again, pressing his lips hard against mine in front of everyone.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, baby, you did awesome!\u201d His eyes are bright, his entire face lit up by them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did it!\u201d I\u2019m practically screaming at him because the voices all around us are so loud.</p><p>I\u2019ve got chill bumps from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWant to do it again?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I swallow.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not ready! But I\u2019m glad I did once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you!\u201d</p> <p>A few older men walk up with beers clutched in their hands. The one with the beard says, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta dance with me!\u201d He holds his arms up at his sides and does an embarrassing little jig.</p><p>My face flushes and I catch Andrew\u2019s grinning eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s no music!\u201d I say to the man.</p><p>\u201cThe hell there ain\u2019t!\u201d He points at someone across the room and a few seconds later the jukebox kicks on next to the vending and gaming machine.</p><p>I\u2019m so excited that I just got through singing that song on stage that it, along with how bad I\u2019d feel if I told this guy no, makes dancing with him mandatory.</p><p>I glance back once more at Andrew and he winks at me.</p><p>The bearded man takes my hand, holds it high above my head and I instinctively twirl around. I dance with him through two songs before Andrew \u2018saves me\u2019 by smoothly cutting in and pressing my body as close to his as it will go and moves his h*ps around with me on them. His hands are on my waist. We dance and chat with people and even play a game of darts with Carla before finally leaving the bar after midnight.</p><p>On the car ride back, Andrew looks over at me and says, \u201cSo, how do you feel?\u201d His lips ease into a knowing grin.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d I say. \u201cI feel...I don\u2019t know, different, but in a good way\u2014I never thought I would do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you did.\u201d He smiles warmly.</p><p>I unhook my seatbelt and move over next to him. He drapes his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to sing tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I could\u2014.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOk, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, rubbing my arm. \u201cOne time is more than I expected, so I\u2019m not going to hound you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, lifting away and turning at the waist to see him. \u201cYou know what? I do. I want to do it again.\u201d</p><p>His chin draws back in a surprised motion.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d I smile with teeth at him.</p><p>He does the same.</p><p>\u201cAlright then,\u201d he says, hitting the steering wheel softly, \u201cwe\u2019ll play tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Andrew takes me back to the hotel and we have sex in the shower before going to bed.</p><p>We stay in New Orleans for two more weeks, playing at Old Point and then making our way to several other bars and clubs all around the city. A month ago, singing and performing live at clubs was probably so far down on the list of things I could ever see myself doing that it would seem ridiculous, but there I was singing my heart out to Barton Hollow and a few other songs where I could mostly shadow Andrew and not be the center of attention. But everybody loved us. So many people stopped us after each performance and shook our hands and asked if we could sing this or that song, to which all of them Andrew declined. I\u2019m still too nervous with this stuff to be able to play by request. And to my dumbfounded surprise, I was even asked for an autograph and a photo with random people more than a couple of times. They must\u2019ve just been really drunk. That\u2019s what I made myself believe because anything else would just be weird.</p><p>By the end of those two weeks, Andrew had a new favorite band to add to his list. He loves The Civil Wars as much as I do. And last night, our last night in New Orleans, we lay in bed together and sang along to Poison &amp; Wine coming from the phone beside the bed...and...I think we told each other things through those lyrics that we\u2019ve been wanting to say...</p><p>I think we did....</p><p>I cried myself quietly to sleep in his arms.</p><p>I died and went to heaven. Yeah...I think I\u2019ve finally died.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>33</p><p>\u201cYOU NEED TO DO IT, just to make sure,\u201d Marsters said sitting in his clich\u00e9d black rolling chair in his clich\u00e9d office wearing a clich\u00e9d coat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d I said, sitting on the other side. \u201cWhat more is there to say? What more is there to find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you know what?\u2014Fuck you.\u201d I stood up, pushing the chair back across the floor and into a plant behind me. \u201cI won\u2019t put myself through that shit.\u201d</p><p>I left, slamming his office door behind me so hard the glass shuddered in the frame.</p><p>\u201cAndrew! Baby, wake up,\u201d I hear Camryn\u2019s voice. My eyes pop open. I\u2019m still on the passenger\u2019s side of the car. I wonder how long I\u2019ve been asleep.</p><p>I lift up and crack my neck to both sides and run a hand over my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s night. I look over to see Camryn\u2019s concerned gaze fixed on me until her eyes are forced to look at the road out ahead.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say, nodding, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I guess I was having a nightmare, but I don\u2019t even remember what it was about,\u201d I lie again.</p><p>\u201cYou punched the dashboard,\u201d she says, chuckling a little. \u201cYour fist just shot out of nowhere; it scared the shit out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d I lean over smiling and kiss her on the cheek. \u201cHow long have you been driving?\u201d</p><p>She glances at the glowing numbers on the clock.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, a couple of hours maybe.\u201d</p><p>I look up at the next highway sign to see if she did what I said to do and stayed on 90.</p><p>\u201cPull over up there.\u201d I nod to indicate a flat clearing alongside the highway.</p><p>She eases off the road and onto broken asphalt, putting the car in park. I start to get out, but she takes my arm and stops me.</p><p>\u201cWait...Andrew.\u201d</p><p>I look over at her. She turns the engine off and slips out of her seatbelt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drive for a while and let you get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she says looking over at me somberly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She drapes the fingers of both hands over the steering wheel and leans back against the seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about Texas anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I scoot over next to her.</p><p>Finally, she looks at me.</p><p>\u201cBecause what then?\u201d she asks. \u201cIt feels like the last stop. You live there. What is there left to do?\u201d</p><p>I know where she\u2019s coming from and I\u2019ve been sharing these fears secretly with her for a while now.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left is whatever we want to do,\u201d I say.</p><p>I turn around on the seat and reach out, taking her chin within my fingertips. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She does. I see a longing in her eyes, something scared and tortured. I know this because I\u2019m feeling the same thing.</p><p>I swallow and then lean in and kiss her carefully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out when we get there, OK?\u201d</p><p>She nods reluctantly. I try to force a smile, but it\u2019s hard to do when I know I can\u2019t give her any of the answers she\u2019s looking for. I can\u2019t give her the ones I want to give her.</p><p>Camryn moves across the seat and into the passenger\u2019s side while I get out and walk around the car. Two cars pass by, blinding us with their high-beams. I shut the door and sit here for a moment. Camryn\u2019s gazing out her side window, her thoughts undoubtedly in the same frame as most of mine are: lost and uncertain and maybe even afraid. I\u2019ve never felt a connection to anyone like I have with her and it\u2019s killing me slowly. Reaching out to turn the key, I pause with my fingers pressing around the brass. I sigh heavily. \u201cWe\u2019ll take the long route,\u201d I say softly, not looking at her, and then the engine roars back to life.</p><p>I feel it when she turns her head to look at me.</p><p>I glance over. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile gives her face life again. She nods.</p><p>I press the power on the CD player and the CD switches itself over. Bad Company starts playing through the speakers. Remembering our agreement, I go to change the music to something else, but Camryn says, \u201cNo, leave it,\u201d and her small smile grows even warmer.</p><p>I wonder if she remembers that first night we met on the bus, when I asked her to name any song by Bad Company. She had said Ready For Love. And then I said: \u201cAre you?\u201d I didn\u2019t know why I said it then, but I\u2019m realizing now that it wasn\u2019t so wrong, after all. Odd how that\u2019s the song playing right now.</p><p>We drive through much of the bottom half of the state of Louisiana and then we stay on 82 all the way into Texas. Camryn is all smiles this morning\u2014despite being in Texas\u2014and seeing her like this only makes me smile. We\u2019ve been driving with the windows rolled down and she\u2019s had her bare feet hanging out for the past hour; all I\u2019ve seen through her side mirror when I try to glimpse the traffic are her cute painted toenails. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a road trip unless you dangle your feet out the window driving down the highway!\u201d she yells over the music and the wind rushing through the car. Her hair is pulled into one braid this time, but the wind keeps pushing the stray strands all around her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say, pressing on the gas, \u201cand on a true road trip you also have to f**k with a truck driver.\u201d</p><p>Her hair slaps her across the face again when she turns her head.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p> <p>I grin. \u201cYep.\u201d I tap my fingers on the steering wheel to the music. \u201cIt\u2019s mandatory. Didn\u2019t you know\u2014you have to do one of three things: one\u2014.\u201d I hold up one finger. \u201cYou have to moon one.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes grow big in her head.</p><p>\u201cTwo: we have to drive next to one while you pretend to be touching yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes get even bigger and her mouth falls open.</p><p>\u201cOr three: simply pump your arm\u2014,\u201d I raise my arm up and down with my fist in the air, \u201cto get him to blow his horn.\u201d</p> <p>Relief washes over her.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d she says and a mysterious smile curves the corners of her lips, \u201cthe next one we see, I\u2019ll consummate this road trip by f**king with a truck driver.\u201d She says it indisputably.</p><p>Ten minutes later, our victim\u2014well, \u2018lucky bastard\u2019 is more like it; it is Camryn, after all\u2014comes into view out ahead. We\u2019re on a long stretch of straight highway tearing through a flat, treeless landscape on each side. We gain on the semi and keep a steady sixty-five-mile per hour pace behind him. Camryn, wearing those skimpy-as-hell white cotton shorts that I love so much, unfolds her legs from the seat and drops her feet onto the floorboard. She\u2019s grinning wickedly and it\u2019s kind of turning me on.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I ask, turning the music down a little.</p><p>Camryn nods and I look out my rearview and side mirrors first and then out ahead at the oncoming lane to make sure no vehicles are coming in either direction.</p><p>As I pull out from behind the semi and move over into the oncoming lane, Camryn slides her right hand down inside the front of her shorts.</p> <p>I have an instant hard-on.</p><p>I thought she\u2019d do the safe horn-pulling thing for sure!</p><p>I grin darkly over at her with all kinds of perverted thoughts swimming around in my head and she grins right back at me. I press the gas a little harder and gradually speed up until we\u2019re level with the truck driver\u2019s window.</p><p>Oh my f**king God....</p><p>Camryn\u2019s hand moves gently, but visibly underneath the thin fabric of her shorts; the index finger and thumb of her left hand is wedged behind the elastic, pulling it down enough to see her bare stomach. She leans her head back against the seat and slides down a little further. I\u2019m almost too distracted to keep my eyes on the road. She bites her bottom lip and moves her fingers more furiously underneath her shorts. I\u2019m starting to think she\u2019s not pretending at all. I\u2019m so hard right now my dick can cut diamonds.</p><p>The semi is keeping pace, too. Distracted by Camryn, I didn\u2019t notice when my foot was slowly releasing on the gas and when the speedometer started to drop a couple of notches, so did the semi\u2019s speed.</p><p>A howling, gruff voice shouts from the semi\u2019s window: \u201cHoly hot-damn! Gonna\u2019 give me a fuckin\u2019 heart attack, baby! Whoo-hoo!\u201d He pulls on his loud horn excitedly.</p><p>Feeling a pang of possession, I drop from sixty-five to forty-five and fall back behind the truck. Just in time, too, as a van is coming up in the opposite lane.</p> <p>I look over at Camryn knowing I must have crazy eyes. She pulls her hand from her shorts and just smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I did it,\u201d she says, propping her feet back on the car door and blocking the side mirror with her toes.</p><p>\u201cWere you really...actually touching yourself?\u201d</p><p>Forty-five miles per hour has dropped to forty now. My heart is humming against my ribcage.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t doing it for the truck driver.\u201d</p><p>Her grin deepens as she pulls away a few strands of hair that have blown between her lips. I can\u2019t help but watch her lips, studying them, wanting to bite and kiss them.</p><p>\u201cWell, not that I\u2019m complaining,\u201d I say, trying to pay attention to the road and not get us killed, \u201cbut now I have a...bit of a problem.\u201d</p><p>Camryn\u2019s gaze falls on my lap and then she looks up at me again, cocking her head to one side with a look of mischief and seduction. Then she moves across the seat toward me and grabs a handful between my legs. Now my heart is banging against my ribcage. I\u2019m white-knuckling the steering wheel with both hands. She kisses my neck and then my jawline and moves her lips to the shell of my ear. Goosebumps rape me.</p><p>She starts to unzip my shorts.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve helped me with my \u2018problems\u2019,\u201d she whispers into my ear and then bites my neck again. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair that I return the favor.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me.</p><p>I just nod stupidly because I can\u2019t think with the head on my shoulders long enough to form a sentence right now.</p><p>I press my back further against the seat as she takes the length of me into her hand and lowers her head between my stomach and the steering wheel. My body lurches a little when I feel her tongue snake out to lick it. Oh my f**king God...Oh my f**king God...I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to drive....</p><p>When she slides me into the back of her throat I shudder, my head falls back some, still trying to keep my eyes on the road, and my mouth falls open. I\u2019m only white-knuckling the wheel now with my left hand; as she sucks me harder and faster, my right hand has slid away from the wheel and is gripping the back of her head, her blonde hair wedged within my clinging fingers.</p><p>Forty miles per hour has become fifty.</p><p>By sixty, my legs are shaking and I can\u2019t see straight. I grip the wheel with both hands again, trying to maintain some kind of control over something, especially the damn car, and I let out a gasp and moan as I come.</p><p>I managed not to kill us on the highway after Camryn\u2019s toe-curling head-job. We\u2019re in Galveston by morning and she\u2019s still passed out across the seat with her legs hanging partially on the floorboard. I don\u2019t bother to wake her yet. I drive slowly past my mom\u2019s house first, noting that her car isn\u2019t in the driveway so that means she\u2019s working at the bank today. To kill time, I drive the long way to my apartment, passing down 53rd. Camryn didn\u2019t get much sleep last night, but I guess the car moving slower than usual is enough to wake her anyway. She starts stirring before I pull into my complex at Park at Cedar Lawn.</p><p>She raises her beautiful blonde head from the seat and when I see her face, a ripple of laughter bursts lightly through my lips.</p><p>She cocks her already crazy-just-woke-up head to one side and grumbles, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, babe, I tried to keep you from falling asleep like that.\u201d</p><p>She leans up, pressing her face into the rearview mirror and rolls her eyes once she sees the three long striped indentions stretching across one cheek all the way to her ear. She probes the indentions in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cWow, that kind of hurts,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still beautiful even with stripes.\u201d I laugh and she can\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re here.\u201d I finally say and pull into a parking space and shut off the engine, dropping my hands beside me.</p><p>The car is uncomfortably quiet. Even though neither one of us has ever actually said that our trip will end in Texas, or that things between us are going to change, it\u2019s like both of us can feel it.</p><p>The only difference is...I\u2019m the only one who knows why.</p><p>Camryn sits perfectly quiet and still on her side, her hands folded loosely within her lap.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside,\u201d I say to stir the silence.</p><p>She forces a smile over at me and then opens her door.</p><p>\u201cWow, this place looks more like a campus dorm than an apartment complex.\u201d She shoulders her bag and purse, looking out at the historical building and giant oak trees sprawled across the landscaping.</p><p>\u201cIt was a U.S. Marine Hospital in the 1930\u2019s,\u201d I say, lifting my bags from the trunk.</p><p>Camryn grabs Aidan\u2019s guitar from the backseat.</p><p>We make our way down one curvy chalk-white sidewalk and come to my one-bedroom on the bottom floor. I fumble my key in the door and open it into the large living room area. The smell of un-lived-in space hits me as soon as we step inside; nothing funky, just vacant.</p><p>I drop my bags on the floor.</p><p>Camryn stands there at first, checking out the place.</p><p>\u201cSet your stuff wherever you want, babe.\u201d</p><p>I move over to the couch and pluck my jeans from it hanging sloppily over the back and then grab a pair of boxers and a t-shirt from the chair and matching ottoman.</p><p>\u201cThis is a really nice apartment,\u201d she says, gazing around.</p><p>Finally she sets her stuff on the floor and props Aidan\u2019s guitar against the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cNot much the bachelor pad,\u201d I say heading into the dining room, \u201cbut I like it here and I wanted to be closer to the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo roommates?\u201d she asks following in behind me.</p><p>I shake my head and step into the kitchen and pop the fridge open; the various bottles and jars in the side-door jangle against one another. \u201cNot anymore. My friend Heath lived with me for about three months when I first moved in, but he ended up moving to Dallas with his fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Shutting the fridge door, I pull out a two liter bottle of Ginger Ale. \u201cWant a drink?\u201d I hold it up to show her. \u201cSee? I have non-soda or beer in my fridge and you see that I wasn\u2019t even here to plant it in advance.\u201d</p><p>She smiles sweetly and says, \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not thirsty right now\u2014what\u2019d you buy it for: hangover, stomach bug?\u201d</p><p>I smirk at her and take a swig from the bottle itself. She doesn\u2019t cringe like I halfway expected her to.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you got me,\u201d I admit, twisting the cap back on.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to get a shower,\u201d I say as I leave the kitchen and point down the hall, \u201cbathroom\u2019s just right there; I\u2019m going to give my mom a call so she doesn\u2019t worry and pick up some around here before I get one myself. My plant is probably dead.\u201d</p><p>Camryn looks slightly surprised. \u201cYou have a plant?\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cYeah, her name\u2019s Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Her brow rises a little higher.</p><p>I laugh lightly and kiss her softly on the lips.</p><p>While Camryn is in the shower I work my way through every visible inch of my apartment in search of anything incriminating: disgusting, crusty socks (found one at the foot of my bed), unopened condom wrappers (have a box full on my nightstand\u2014I stuff them in the very bottom of the trash), opened condom wrappers (two in the wastebasket in my room), more dirty clothes and one p*rn magazine (Shit! That\u2019s on the back of the toilet\u2014undoubtedly she\u2019s already seen it).</p><p>Then I wash the few dirty dishes that I left in the sink before I left out and sit down in the living room to give my mom a call. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CAMRYN</p><p>34</p><p>WHEN I SEE THE p*rn mag on the back of the toilet as casually placed as one on motorcycles might be, I can\u2019t help but laugh to myself.

I can\u2019t say anything; I\u2019ve looked at my fair share of p*rn on the internet.</p><p>I take a long, hot shower and dry off with the beach towel Andrew gave me and then get dressed.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like it here. In his apartment. In Texas.</p><p>Any other time and in some other circumstance, it would be different, but what I said to him the other night when we pulled over on the side of the road still holds true. This place, everything about it feels like the end. The magic of our time together on the road has all but literally evaporated with last week\u2019s rain. Not our feelings for each other...no, those are so strong that thinking about the end at all is metaphorically bringing me to my knees. How we feel about each other is...well, it\u2019s all that we have left. The open road is gone. The spontaneous stops and sometimes not knowing where we are but not giving a damn, is gone. The motels and the little things like beef jerky and Baby Oil and bubble bath, they\u2019re all gone. The soundtrack of our time together, our short life together, has faded away as the last song on the album ends. All I can hear anymore is the smooth vibration of silence coming from the speakers. I feel like all I want to do is reach out and start it over again, but my hand won\u2019t move to press the button.</p><p>And I can\u2019t understand why.</p><p>I wipe the tear from my face and push my emotions down into my lungs and hold them there, taking a deep breath before I open the bathroom door.</p><p>I hear Andrew talking on the phone when I move through the dining room:</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t f**k with me right now, Aidan. I don\u2019t need this shit. Yeah, so what? Who are you to tell me what to do with my life? What? Give me a f**king break, bro; funerals aren\u2019t mandatory. I personally would rather never go to another one again unless it\u2019s my own. I don\u2019t know why people have funerals anyway; just going to see someone you care about lying completely f**king lifeless in a goddamn box. I\u2019d rather the last time I see someone it be of them alive. Don\u2019t give me that line of shit, Aidan! You know it\u2019s bullshit!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to keep standing around the corner like I\u2019m eavesdropping, but it doesn\u2019t exactly feel appropriate to walk in there on him yet, either.</p><p>I do it anyway. He\u2019s getting way too irate and I just want to calm him down. The second he sees me, he drops the angry tone with Aidan and raises his back from the couch.</p><p>\u201cLook, I gotta go,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve already called Mom. Yes. Yeah, alright, I hear yah. Later.\u201d</p><p>He shuts the phone off and drops it on the oak coffee table next to his propped bare foot.</p><p>I sit down next to him on the split cushion.</p> <p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he says, patting my thigh and then rubbing his palm across it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never hear the end of it from him.\u201d</p><p>I move over and sit on his lap and he pulls me against his chest as if I\u2019m what he needs to calm down. I drape my arms around his neck, interlocking my fingers around his shoulder. Leaning in, I kiss the side of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cCamryn.\u201d He gazes into my eyes. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want this to be the end, either,\u201d he says, as though he had been reading my mind while in the bathroom moments ago.</p><p>Suddenly, he lifts me up and makes me sit upright on his lap facing him with my legs on either side, my knees bent into the couch. He takes each of my hands into his and looks right at me with gravity and intensity in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we...\u201d he looks away, contemplating his words deeply, though I wish I knew if it was because he wanted to say them right, or maybe not at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we what?\u201d I try to prompt him. I don\u2019t want him to back out, no matter what it is; I want him to say it. I feel some revived sense of hope again and I can\u2019t bear to let it slip away. \u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>His intense green eyes lock on mine as my voice snaps him back into the moment.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if we go away together?\u201d he says and my heart starts pounding faster. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. And I\u2019m not saying that because of my father or my brother\u2014none of that has anything to do with how I feel. Right now. Here with you. How I\u2019ve felt all this time, since the day I saw you sitting alone on that bus in Kansas.\u201d He squeezes my hands tighter. \u201cI know you lost your partner in crime, but...I want you to be mine. Maybe we should travel the world together, Camryn...I know I can\u2019t replace your ex\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tears stream from my eyes.</p><p>He takes it the wrong way. His hands slip from mine and suddenly he can\u2019t look at me anymore. I reach out and cup his face in my palms, forcing his tortured gaze.</p><p>\u201cAndrew..,\u201d I shake my head, tears rolling down my cheeks, \u201c...it was always you,\u201d I whisper harshly. \u201cEven with Ian, I felt something was missing. I told you, that night in the field; I told you that...,\u201d My voice trails. I smile and say, \u201cYou are my partner in crime. I\u2019ve known that for a long time.\u201d</p><p>I kiss his lips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything in this world I\u2019d rather do than to see it with you. We belong on the road. Together. It\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are watering, but he lets his bright smile push the tears away before they fall. And then he crushes his mouth against mine, both of us cupping each other\u2019s faces in our hands. His kiss steals my breath away, but I just kiss him deeper, drinking down as much of his own breath as I can. And without breaking the kiss his hands fall away from my face and he wraps them tight around my body, lifting me with him into a stand.</p><p>\u201cYou have to meet my mom today,\u201d he says, scanning my face, peering deeply into my eyes.</p><p>I sniffle back the rest of my tears and nod. \u201cI would love to meet your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he says, guiding me to slip away from his waist and stand on my own. \u201cI\u2019ll get a shower and we\u2019ll go do some stuff around town for a while and head over to see her after she\u2019s off work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I say, never letting the smile fade from my face.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t let it fade even if I tried.</p><p>He looks at me for a long moment like he doesn\u2019t want to pry himself away long enough even to shower, his smiling eyes as radiant as I saw them that night after our performance at Old Point. His face reads all sorts of things that one who is overwhelmingly happy might want to say, but he says nothing.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t need to.</p><p>Andrew finally leaves the room to shower and I go to check my phone messages. Mom finally called. She left a voice mail telling me all about her cruise of the Bahamas that ended up lasting eight days. It really sounds like she\u2019s into this guy, Roger. I might actually have to swing by home long enough to check him out and do my own douchebag inspection of his personality just in case my mom has been blinded by something he has that overshadows the warning signs: more money than my dad, a body sexier than Andrew\u2019s\u2014well, that\u2019s not likely\u2014or a really big...not sure exactly how I would find something like that out unless I asked Mom directly. That\u2019s not gonna happen.</p><p>My dad called, too. Said he\u2019s going to Greece in a month on a business trip and asked if I want to go along with him. I\u2019d love to, but sorry, Dad, if I go to Greece anytime in the next year or so, it\u2019ll be with Andrew. I\u2019ve always been Daddy\u2019s Girl, but you have to grow up sometime and now...now I\u2019m Andrew\u2019s Girl.</p><p>I shake the dreamy thoughts from my brain and go back to checking messages. Natalie finally called instead of biting her tongue and sending a text message. I know by now she\u2019s beyond going stir crazy wanting to know what I\u2019ve been doing and who I\u2019m with. I think maybe I\u2019ve made her squirm long enough.</p><p>Hmmm...I could just give her a morsel.</p><p>A devious grin spreads across my face. A morsel might be worse torture, but it\u2019s better than nothing at all.</p><p>When Andrew comes out of the shower, walking through the den with a damp towel around the back of his neck, I call him into the living room. He stands there, shirtless: the sexiest f**king thing I have ever seen in my life, with water dripping down his tanned abs. I want to lick it all off, but I refrain for Natalie\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cBaby, come here,\u201d I say, curling my finger at him, \u201cI want to send Natalie a picture of us. She\u2019s been on my back since New Orleans about you, but I still haven\u2019t told her anything, not even your name. She left me a voice mail.\u201d I start punching letters on my phone.</p><p>He laughs, drying the back of his hair with the towel. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s about to explode, basically. I want to mess with her head.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s dimples deepen. \u201cHell yeah, I\u2019m game.\u201d He plops down on the couch and pulls me down with him.</p><p>I snap a couple of shots of us together: one with us just looking straight into the camera, one with him kissing me fully on the cheek and one with him eyeing the camera seductively with his tongue snaking out of the side of his mouth and licking my face.</p><p>\u201cThat one\u2019s perfect,\u201d I say excitedly about the third one. \u201cShe\u2019s going to freak out. Prepare yourself; Texas might see Hurricane Natalie blow through here once she gets this pic.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and leaves me on the couch with my phone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready in a few more minutes,\u201d he says as he slips out of the living room.</p><p>I load the photo into a message and type in:</p><p>Here we are, Nat, in Galveston, Texas :-)</p><p>And then I hit send. I hear Andrew moving around in the apartment. I start to get up to spy on him when in less than one minute after sending the photo, Natalie texts me back:</p><p>OMFG! R U sleeping with Kellan Lutz?!?!!!!?</p><p>I burst into laughter. Andrew comes back around the corner, unfortunately with a shirt on this time and he\u2019s tucking the front behind his belt. And he\u2019s already replaced the shorts with a pair of jeans.</p><p>\u201cWhat, did she reply already?\u201d He seems faintly amused.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say with laughter in my voice, \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>More messages start popping up in fast succession as if a machine is on the other end:</p><p>Cam, OMFG, he is f**king RAWR! What the hell???</p><p>Call me. Like NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p>CAMNRYN MARTYBETH BENNETT! U better call me!!</p><p>I\u2019m dring over here!!!</p><p>I mean DRING</p><p>GRRR!!!!!!</p><p>DAMN AUTO-CORRECT! I f**king hate this phone.</p><p>DYING, not dring!!</p><p>I can\u2019t stop grinning. Andrew comes around behind me and snatches the phone from my fingers.</p><p>He laughs scrolling through her mumbo-jumbo.</p><p>\u201cTypo much?\u201d he says. \u201cWho the hell is Kellan Lutz?\u2014is he ugly?\u201d He looks at me with a twinge of fear in his eyes.</p><p>No...ummm, definitely not ugly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an actor,\u201d I try to explain. \u201cAnd no, he\u2019s not. Don\u2019t put too much thought into it; Natalie always, I mean always compares everyone to someone famous, usually with a serious over-exaggeration.\u201d I take the phone from him while he\u2019s halfway preoccupied by my explanation and set it on the couch. \u201cShe and I went to school with Shay Mitchell and Hayden Panettiere, Megan Fox was prom queen, Chris Hemsworth was prom king.\u201d I make a clicking noise with my tongue. \u201cAnd then there was Natalie\u2019s worst enemy, a cheerleader who tried to steal Damon away from her in tenth grade; Natalie said she was the slutty version of Nina Dobrev\u2014none of these people really looked like them, not really anyway. Natalie is just...odd.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andrew shakes his head, smiling. \u201cWell, she\u2019s definitely a character, I\u2019ll give her that.\u201d</p><p>Still hearing my phone buzzing against the couch cushion, I ignore it and step up to Andrew, wrapping my arms around his waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do this with me?\u201d</p><p>He gazes into my eyes, placing his hands on my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life, Camryn.\u201d</p> <p>Then he starts to pace.</p><p>\u201cI always felt this...this...,\u201d his eyes are intense, concentrating, \u201c...this hole...I mean it wasn\u2019t an empty hole, there was always something in it, but it was never right. It never fit. I went to college for a short time, until I sat back one day and said to myself: Andrew, what the f**k are you doing here? And it clicked in my head that I wasn\u2019t there because it\u2019s what I wanted, I was there because it\u2019s what people expected, even people I don\u2019t know, society. It\u2019s what people do. They grow up, go to college, get a job and do the same shit every day for the rest of their lives until they grow old and die\u2014just like you explained that night you told me about yours and your ex\u2019s plans.\u201d He swings his right hand out as if slapping the air. \u201cMost people never see anything outside where they grew up.\u201d He\u2019s pacing harder, stopping only every now and then when he wants to put emphasis on an important word or meaning. He hardly looks right at me; he seems to be saying all of these things to himself more, as though a river of answers he\u2019s been looking for all his life are finally flooding his mind and he\u2019s trying to take them all in at once. \u201cI was never really happy doing anything....\u201d</p><p>Finally, he looks right at me.</p><p>\u201cAnd then I met you...and it was like something just went off in my head, or it woke up, I-I don\u2019t know, but....\u201d He stands in front of me again. I want to cry, but I don\u2019t. \u201c...but I knew that whatever it was, it was right. It fit. You fit.\u201d</p><p>I go up a little on my toes and kiss his lips. There are so many things that I want to say, but I\u2019m overwhelmed by all of them and can\u2019t choose.</p> <p>\u201cI guess I need to ask you the same question,\u201d he says. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>My eyes smile warmly up at him.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, it\u2019s not even a question,\u201d I say. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Andrew smiles so brightly at me that his devilishly sexy green eyes glisten.</p><p>\u201cSo then it\u2019s official,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ll leave here tomorrow. I\u2019ve got money in the bank to get us by for a while.\u201d</p><p>I nod and smile and say, \u201cI\u2019ve not really earned the money I have in the bank and I\u2019ve always used it sparingly because of that, but for this, I\u2019ll use every dime of it and when it runs out\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore our money gets close to running out,\u201d he interrupts, \u201cwe\u2019ll work on the road, just like you mentioned before. We can play at clubs and bars and at farmer\u2019s markets.\u201d He laughs out loud at the idea, but is quite serious. \u201cAnd we can even work in bars and restaurants cooking and washing dishes and doing the server thing and...I don\u2019t know, but we\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>It all sounds like a crazy dream gone rampant, but neither of us cares. We\u2019re living in the moment.</p><p>\u201cYeah, before it runs out is definitely a better plan,\u201d I say, blushing. \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up a panhandler or sleeping behind dumpsters or standing on street corners with Will Work for Food signs.\u201d</p><p>Andrew laughs and squeezes my shoulders in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll never get to that point. We\u2019ll always work, but not in one place for too long and never doing the same thing over and over.\u201d</p><p>I look into his eyes for a moment and then wrap my arms around his neck, kissing him passionately.</p><p>Then he grabs his keys.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he says tilting his head back and holding his hand out to me. I take it. \u201cFirst thing\u2019s first: I\u2019ve got to check on my car. She must be missing me!\u201d</p> <p>Porn magazines and a car revered as a woman!</p><p>I just shake my head laughing under my breath as he pulls me toward the door. I snatch my purse from the floor nearby and we head out.</p><p>35</p><p>OUR FIRST STOP IS where Andrew left his vintage 1969 Camaro and I see my first real stereotypical Texan when we pull into the garage where Andrew apparently used to work.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019know I fired yer ass, right?\u201d a tall man wearing a cowboy hat and black cowboy boots says walking outside to meet us. He had been standing in the open bay talking to another man who actually looks more like a mechanic.</p><p>He shakes Andrew\u2019s hand and pulls him into a man-hug, patting his back.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Andrew says, patting his, \u201cbut I had to do what I had to do.\u201d</p><p>Andrew turns to me.</p><p>\u201cBilly, this is my girlfriend, Camryn. Camryn, this is my ex-boss, Billy Frank.\u201d</p><p>My heart leapt when he called me his girlfriend. Hearing him say that definitely had more of an effect on me than I imagined it could.</p><p>Billy reaches out an oil-stained, rugged hand and without hesitation, I shake it. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I smile.</p><p>He smiles back; his teeth are crooked and yellowed probably from too many years addicted to coffee and cigarettes.</p><p>\u201cWell ain\u2019t she a beaut,\u201d Billy says grinning over at Andrew. \u201cI\u2019da skipped out on m\u2019job too for a girl like that.\u201d He playfully punches Andrew on the arm. He turns back to me. \u201cHas he been treatin\u2019 ya right? Boy\u2019s got a mouth on him that\u2019ll slap yer momma backwards.\u201d</p><p>I laugh lightly and say, \u201cYeah, he does have a mouth, but he treats me wonderfully.\u201d</p><p>Andrew\u2019s eyes smile at me from the side.</p><p>\u201cWell, if\u2019n he ever gives ya any trouble, ya know where ta\u2019 find me. Ain\u2019t nobody \u2018round here that can put him in his place like I can.\u201d He grins over at Andrew.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>We leave Billy Frank and walk through the bay and then exit a side door that leads out into a fenced area where cars are kept. I know immediately which one is his even though I\u2019ve never seen it before except camouflaged in the tree bark of Andrew\u2019s tattoo. It\u2019s the nicest one on the lot. Dark gray with two black racing stripes down the center of the hood. It looks a lot like his dad\u2019s vintage Chevelle. We weave our way through a maze of cars and he opens the driver\u2019s side door after checking out the body from front to back on each side first.</p><p>\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t needed some work when I decided not to take a plane to Wyoming,\u201d he says as he runs his fingers along the door frame, \u201cI would\u2019ve driven her instead of taking that bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not to think badly of your girl here,\u201d I say, smiling and patting the hood, \u201cbut I\u2019m glad she wasn\u2019t up to drive you herself.\u201d</p><p>Andrew looks at me, his face lit up the same way I see it more and more every day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she wasn\u2019t, either,\u201d he says.</p><p>For a brief moment, I think about where either of us would be right now if that had happened, if we never met. But brief is long enough because thoughts like that wrench my stomach. I can\u2019t imagine never having known him. And I never want to.</p><p>\u201cSo, are we going to be driving this one instead of the Chevelle?\u201d</p><p>Andrew chews on the inside of his mouth, thinking it over. He stands at the open door with one palm lying flat against the roof. He pats it once gently and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? What do you want to do, babe?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s my turn to chew the inside of my mouth in contemplation. I hadn\u2019t really considered that the option would be mine to decide. I step up closer to the car and peer inside, checking out the leather bucket seats and...well, that\u2019s really the only thing that I check.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d I ask, crossing my arms.</p><p>He nods.</p><p>I look back at the Camaro again, mulling it over.</p><p>\u201cI kind of like the Chevelle,\u201d I say. \u201cI love this car\u2014it\u2019s badass\u2014but I think I\u2019m just more acquainted with the other one.\u201d To make my case more solid I point at the seats. \u201cAnd how would I lay my head on your lap, or sleep in the front with seats like that.\u201d</p><p>Andrew smiles gently and rubs the roof of the car as if to assure her that it\u2019s nothing personal. He pats it one more time and then shuts the door.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll take the Chevelle,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll just drive her home later and park her.\u201d</p><p>Andrew takes me out to eat and to a few random places he likes to go on Galveston Island. And then after rush hour traffic, he gets a call from his mom.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d I say on the passenger\u2019s side as we head toward her house.</p><p>He wrinkles his eyebrows, looking over at me and says, \u201cDon\u2019t be; my mom will love you.\u201d He looks back at the road. \u201cShe\u2019s not one of those stuck up bitches who thinks no one is good for her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitely a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if she was,\u201d he says, grinning over at me once, \u201cshe\u2019d still love you.\u201d</p><p>I fold my hands together within my lap and smile. Doesn\u2019t matter; he can talk her up all he wants about how sweet she is and it won\u2019t do a thing for the nervous feeling in my stomach.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He glances over. \u201cWhat, about leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI\u2019ll tell her, otherwise she\u2019ll worry herself over me straight into therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think she\u2019ll say?\u201d</p><p>Andrew chuckles. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m twenty-five. I haven\u2019t lived at home since nineteen. She\u2019ll be alright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just mean...you know...the nature of why you\u2019re leaving and exactly what we plan to do.\u201d I look away and back toward the windshield. \u201cIt\u2019s not like packing up and moving to a different city; even my mom could handle that kind of news. But if I told her I planned to travel all over to wherever and that I was doing it with a guy I met on a bus, she\u2019d probably be a little freaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d Andrew asks. \u201cAs in if you tell her?\u201d</p><p>I look right at him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely going to tell her. Same as you, I think she should know...but, Andrew, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do, babe,\u201d he says and flips on his left blinker and turns at the stop sign. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right; it\u2019s not exactly normal.\u201d Then he grins across at me and instantly it provokes a smile on my face. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that one reason why we\u2019re doing it? Because it\u2019s not normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, the biggest reason is because of the company,\u201d he adds.</p><p>I blush.</p><p>Two more blocks of cozy, suburban-style houses and white sidewalks with kids buzzing by on bicycles and we pull into the driveway of his mom\u2019s house. It\u2019s a one-level with a pretty flower garden that wraps around the front side and two puffy green bushes on both sides of the sidewalk leading up to the front door. The Chevelle purrs into the drive behind a white four-door family car parked inside the wide-open garage. I look at myself real quick in the rearview mirror to make sure there are no boogers on my nose or any lettuce in my teeth leftover from the chicken sandwich I had earlier and Andrew comes around and opens my door for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I see how it is,\u201d I play with him. \u201cYou only open my car door when your mother might be watching.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for my hand and bows dramatically. \u201cI will open the door for you from now on if you like that kind of thing, Milady...however...\u201d I place my hand in his, grinning hugely at his display, \u201c...I did not take you for the type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d I say in a horrible English accent and I raise my chin higher. \u201cAnd just what type did you take me for, Mr. Parrish?\u201d</p><p>He shuts the door and loops his arm through mine, keeping his back refined and his chin raised.</p> <p>\u201cI took you for the kind who didn\u2019t give a shit as long as it would open when you wanted out.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWell, you were right,\u201d I say and press against his shoulder as he walks me to the door inside the garage.</p><p>The door opens into the kitchen to the smell of pot roast. I\u2019m thinking: She had time to cook a pot roast? But then I see the Slow Cooker on the counter. Andrew walks me around the bar and into the den area just as a pretty sandy-haired woman comes around the corner from a hallway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home,\u201d she says, taking him into a big hug, practically squeezing him with her little body. Andrew must be at least three full inches taller than she is. But I see where he got his green eyes and dimples from.</p> <p>She smiles over at me with all the welcome in the world and to my surprise, takes me into a hug, too. I go all-in, pressing my arms vertically against her back.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Camryn,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I know you already.\u201d</p><p>That strikes me as odd. I didn\u2019t know she knew I existed until today. I glance covertly at Andrew and his lips pull into a secretive smile. I guess he had plenty of opportunities to talk about me while we were on the road, especially before we started sharing a room, but what surprises me the most is why he would have said much about me at all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Miss\u2014.\u201d My eyes grow wide as I look to Andrew for the information that I\u2019m going to kick him in the shin for not giving me sooner. My lips tighten in aggravation at him, but he just keeps smiling.</p><p>\u201cCall me Marna,\u201d she says, letting her hands fall downward to grasp a hold of mine. She raises my hands up within hers, looking me over all the while with that glittering smile of hers.</p><p>\u201cHave you two eaten?\u201d she asks, looking at Andrew and then back at me.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Mom, we had something earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you should eat. I made a pot roast and green bean casserole.\u201d She only lets go of one of my hands, the other she keeps grasped gently in hers and I follow her into the living room where a giant television is mounted over the fireplace. \u201cHave a seat and I\u2019ll fix you a plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, she\u2019s not hungry, trust me.\u201d</p><p>Andrew comes in behind us.</p><p>My head is kind of whirling already. She knows about me, apparently enough to make her feel like she knows me. She\u2019s so kind and all-smiles as if she actually loves me already. Not to mention, she held my hand and not Andrew\u2019s to escort me through her house. Am I missing something here, or is she just the sweetest person with the most charming personality on the planet? Well, whatever the case, my feelings about her are mutual.</p><p>She looks at me and tilts her head to one side, waiting for me to speak up. I wince a little because I don\u2019t want to hurt her feelings and I say, \u201cI really appreciate the offer, but I don\u2019t think I could eat anything else just yet.\u201d</p><p>Her smile softens. \u201cWell how about something to drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great; do you have tea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she says. \u201cSweet, un-sweet, lemon, peach, raspberry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sweet will be great, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the center cushion of her burgundy-colored sofa.</p><p>\u201cHoney, what would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as Camryn.\u201d</p><p>Andrew sits down next to me and before she leaves to go back into the kitchen, she looks at us both for a moment, smiling with some kind of quiet thought. And then she slips around the corner.</p><p>I turn to Andrew swiftly and whisper, \u201cWhat did you tell her about me?\u201d</p><p>Andrew grins. \u201cNothing really,\u201d he says, trying to look casual but it\u2019s not working. \u201cJust that I met this really sweet, unimaginably sexy girl that has a dirty mouth and a tiny birthmark on her inner left thigh.\u201d</p><p>I smack him on the leg. His grin just gets bigger.</p><p>\u201cNo, babe,\u201d he says, being serious now, \u201cI just told her that I met you on the bus and we\u2019ve been together since.\u201d He rubs his hand across my thigh reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to like me a little too much for that to be all you said to her.\u201d</p><p>Andrew shrugs lightly and then his mom comes back into the room with two glasses of tea. She sets them down in front of us on the coffee table. They have little yellow sunflowers imprinted on the side.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say and then take a sip, setting the glass back down gently. I scan the coffee table for a coaster to put it on, but there isn\u2019t one.</p><p>She sits down on the matching chair across from us.</p><p>\u201cAndrew tells me you\u2019re from North Carolina?\u201d</p><p>Uh huh...that\u2019s all he told her, my butt! I can just hear him grinning inside; it\u2019s as loud anything audible. He knows I can\u2019t glare at him, or smack him, or do anything I normally would do, really. I just smile like he\u2019s not sitting right next to me.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I answer. \u201cI was born in New Bern, but have lived in Raleigh most of my life.\u201d I take another sip.</p><p>Marna crosses her legs and folds her ring-decorated hands within her lap. Her jewelry is simple, with two small rings on each hand and a pair of little gold stud earrings and a matching necklace draped in the folds of her button-up white blouse.</p><p>\u201cMy oldest sister lived in Raleigh for sixteen years before she moved back to Texas\u2014it\u2019s a beautiful state.\u201d</p><p>I just nod and smile. I\u2019m guessing that was just the icebreaker topic because there\u2019s a bout of awkward silence hanging in the air now and I notice her glancing at Andrew a lot. And he isn\u2019t saying anything. I\u2019m getting a strange feeling from the silence, as if I\u2019m the only one in the room who doesn\u2019t know what thoughts are passing between everyone else.</p><p>\u201cSo, Camryn,\u201d Marna says, letting her eyes stray from Andrew, \u201cwhat were you traveling for when you met Andrew?\u201d</p><p>Oh great; I didn\u2019t expect that. I don\u2019t want to lie, but the truth isn\u2019t exactly something you just casually talk about over tea with someone you just met.</p><p>Andrew takes a big gulp of tea and sets the glass down.</p><p>\u201cShe was kind of in the same boat as me,\u201d he answers for me and his answer shocks me into silence. \u201cI was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place.\u201d</p><p>Marna\u2019s eyes light up with curiosity. She tilts her chin to one side, glances at me first and then back at Andrew and then looks at both of us. There\u2019s something warming, but very mysterious in her face and not the confused, skepticism I expected.</p><p>\u201cWell, Camryn, I want you to know that I\u2019m very glad that the two of you met. It seems your company has helped Andrew through some hard times.\u201d</p><p>Her bright smile fades a little after her comment and I notice Andrew from the corner of my eye looking at her cautiously. I\u2019m assuming she has said enough, or maybe he\u2019s worried she\u2019s going to say something that\u2019ll embarrass him in front of me.</p><p>Feeling slightly uncomfortable being the only one here without all of the obvious information, I force a slim smile for his mother\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve helped each other a lot, to be honest,\u201d I say, smiling more now because what I\u2019m saying is so true.</p><p>Marna gently pats her thighs once with the palms of her hands, smiles happily and stands up.</p><p>\u201cI need to make a quick call,\u201d she says with the flourish of her hand. \u201cI completely forgot to tell Asher about that motorcycle he\u2019s trying to buy from Mr. Sanders. I better call him before I forget again; excuse me for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes secretly skirt Andrew just before she leaves the room. I saw it, surely neither one of them thinks I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s something else going on that I\u2019m obviously not supposed to know about. I can\u2019t tell if she secretly dislikes me and has been putting on a show in front of me so as not to make Andrew uncomfortable, or if it\u2019s something entirely different. It\u2019s driving me crazy, and I\u2019m not as relaxed as I quickly came to be upon first meeting her.</p><p>And sure enough, a few seconds after she slips out of the room, Andrew stands up.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I ask lightly.</p><p>He looks down at me and I get the feeling he knows I\u2019m not going to ignore this forever. He\u2019s fully aware that I\u2019ve been more observational than he wanted me to be.</p><p>His eyes scan my face, but he doesn\u2019t smile, he just looks upon me as one might a person they\u2019re about to say goodbye to. Then he leans over and kisses me. \u201cNothing\u2019s going on, babe,\u201d he says, now deciding to be the smiling, playful Andrew I know so well, but I\u2019m not buying it.</p><p>I know he\u2019s lying and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to drop this. I will for now while we\u2019re here, but afterwards, that\u2019s another story.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d he says and follows the path his mom took.</p><p>ANDREW</p><p>36</p><p>I PROBABLY SHOULDN\u2019T HAVE brought Camryn here because she\u2019s smart and I knew she would pick up on the tiniest fluctuation in the conversation. Mom didn\u2019t exactly make it difficult for Camryn, either. But this is an important meeting between them and I did what I had to do.</p><p>I walk through the den and down the hallway to my mom\u2019s bedroom. She\u2019s standing there waiting for me. She\u2019s in tears.</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t do this, please.\u201d I take her into a hug, cupping the back of her head in my hand.</p><p>She sniffles and chokes and tries to stop crying.</p><p>\u201cAndrew, will you please just go to the appointment and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, no. Listen.\u201d I carefully pull her away from my chest and I look at her, my hands secured to her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long. I waited too long and you know it. I admit I should\u2019ve gone eight months ago, but I didn\u2019t and now it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d Tears stream down her face.</p><p>I soften my expression, but I know she won\u2019t listen to me no matter how convincing I sound.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse,\u201d I say. \u201cLook, all I want is for you to know her. She is very important to me. You\u2019re both very important to me and I think you should know each other\u2014\u201d</p><p>My mom pushes her hand into my view and shakes it at me. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this,\u201d she chokes out, \u201cI just can\u2019t. I\u2019ll do whatever you want me to do, and son, I already love her. I can tell she\u2019s a wonderful girl. I can tell she\u2019s so very different from any girl you\u2019ve ever been involved with. And she\u2019s important to me not only because she\u2019s important to you, but because of everything she has given you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say and try not to cry myself.</p><p>My hands fall away from her shoulders.</p><p>I reach into my back pocket and pull out a folded envelope and I put it into my mother\u2019s reluctant hand. I kiss her forehead.</p><p>She refuses to look down at it. To her, it\u2019s a finality. To me, it says all of the things I won\u2019t be able to say.</p> <p>My mother nods and more tears pour from her eyes. She sets the envelope on her tall dresser and grabs a tissue from a box next to her bed. Dabbing the tears from her cheeks and sniffling back the rest, she tries to gain her composure again before going back into the living room with Camryn.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just tell her, Andrew?\u201d she says turning back to look at me in front of the bedroom door. \u201cYou should let her know so the two of you can do the things you\u2019ve always wanted to do before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I say and my own words rip a hole through my chest. \u201cI want everything to happen how it normally would and not be forced to happen sooner because of something else.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t like my answer, but she understands it.</p><p>We walk back out together and she\u2019s smiling as much as she can for Camryn\u2019s sake when we enter the living room again.</p> <p>Camryn keeps her smile, too, but it\u2019s plain in her face that she knows my mother has been crying.</p><p>Mom walks over to Camryn and instinctively Camryn stands up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I have to cut this visit short,\u201d my mom says, taking Camryn into a hug, \u201cbut I received some unfortunate news about a family member while I was on the phone with Asher. I hope you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Camryn says, her expression hardened by worry. She glances at me briefly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I hope you\u2019ll be OK.\u201d</p><p>My mom nods and pushes a smile through her teary eyes. \u201cThank you, honey. Have Andrew bring you back anytime; you\u2019re always welcome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Camryn says softly and takes it upon herself to hug my mom again.</p> <p>\u201cAndrew, what was that all about?\u201d she asks before I even get my car door shut.</p><p>I sigh and turn the key in the ignition. \u201cIt\u2019s just sibling rivalry stuff,\u201d I say, trying not to look at her next to me. I start the car and put the gear in reverse. \u201cMom gets upset when Aidan and I are fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>I am and I\u2019ll continue to.</p><p>I look over at her briefly and back the car out onto the street.</p><p>\u201cShe just didn\u2019t want to drag you into it,\u201d I begin and the rest of the lie just starts to fall into place. \u201cBut it has everything to do with my father\u2019s funeral. Notice she didn\u2019t bring it up in front of you. Taking me into the back room to talk about it was her way of sparing you.\u201d</p><p>She still doesn\u2019t believe me, but I can tell she\u2019s starting to.</p><p>\u201cSo, then what was this news about a family member?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any,\u201d I say. \u201cShe just wanted to talk to me and I told her about the argument I had with Aidan on the phone before we left my apartment and it upset her.\u201d</p><p>Camryn sighs and faces her window.</p><p>\u201cMy mom really likes you.\u201d</p><p>She looks over. At first I get the feeling she wants to further the conversation about Aidan, but she drops it.</p><p>\u201cWell she\u2019s a very sweet woman,\u201d Camryn says. \u201cMaybe you and Aidan (she puts emphasis on his name as if she still doesn\u2019t fully believe my lie) should try to get along better so you two don\u2019t upset her so much.\u201d</p><p>Although misplaced, it\u2019s still not bad advice.</p><p>\u201cBaby, look, I\u2019m sorry; maybe I should\u2019ve waited to bring you to meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d she says and scoots over to sit next to me. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did. It made me feel...special.\u201d</p><p>I think she believes me now, or maybe she\u2019s just trying to push her gut feeling into the back of her mind because she realizes I\u2019m not going to crack the truth anytime soon.</p><p>I slip my arm around her.</p><p>\u201cWell you are special.\u201d</p><p>She lays her head on my chest. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her about leaving tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I will. I might call her later tonight and fill her in.\u201d I squeeze her gently. \u201cNow that she\u2019s met you and definitely loves you, I think she won\u2019t be as worried about me doing something so abnormal.\u201d</p><p>Camryn slips her hand in-between my thighs and smiles up at me. \u201cYeah, now I just have to tell my mom.\u201d She lifts up suddenly like a thought just dawned on her. \u201cI could just wait to tell her when we drive through North Carolina and drop in so you can meet her.\u201d</p><p>That beautiful blue-eyed smile of hers is beaming.</p><p>I smile back and nod. \u201cYou want to take someone like me home to meet your mom? What if she takes one look at my tats and steals you away from me?\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d she says, laughing lightly. \u201cIf anything, she\u2019ll be enamored by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh oh, gonna get me some cougar action!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes bug out of her head and I throw my head back and laugh.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m kidding!\u201d</p><p>She snarls at me and takes a deep, aggravated breath, but she\u2019s not hiding the humor from her face very well, either.</p><p>\u201cHey, have you ever...you know...?\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t say it out loud and I think it\u2019s hilarious.</p><p>\u201cBeen with an older woman?\u201d I say, smirking.</p><p>This topic is clearly uncomfortable for her, but she\u2019s the one that asked and so I\u2019m at complete liberty to torture her with it as much as possible.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have.\u201d</p><p>Her head snaps around and her eyes are even wider than before. \u201cYou have not!\u201d</p><p>I laugh while at the same time saying, \u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was she? Or...they?\u201d Her head turns at an angle, but her eyes never move.</p><p>The plural version looks like dangerous territory all of a sudden, but I do want to be completely honest with her. Well, about this sort of thing, anyway....</p><p>I put my hand on her leg. \u201cA couple of times. One was only about thirty-eight which to me is not much different from twenty-eight. But I also slept with a woman who was around forty-three.\u201d</p><p>Camryn\u2019s face is hot from blushing, but she\u2019s not jealous or pissed off in any way. Though I think she might be a little...worried.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like better?\u201d she asks very cautiously.</p><p>I try not to grin.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s not about age,\u201d I admit. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m not into grannies or anything and I think any woman, no matter how old she is, who keeps herself lookin\u2019 hot is totally fuckable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Camryn laughs. \u201cTalk about the dirty mouth on me!\u201d</p><p>She shakes off the stun of my words and then says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically I did,\u201d I mess with her some more. \u201cYou asked what I like better and there\u2019s really not a solid answer to your question, just a generality.\u201d</p><p>I know exactly what her question really meant and I\u2019m sure she knows as much. But I never pass up an opportunity to make her squirm.</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me.</p><p>I laugh and finally give in.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you are the best sex I have ever had,\u201d I say and she purses her lips as if to say: Yeah, right, you\u2019re just saying that because you\u2019re currently biased. \u201cAnd I mean that, Camryn. I\u2019m not just filling your head with shit because you\u2019re sitting in front of me and because I cherish my nutsack.\u201d</p><p>She smiles and rolls her eyes, but believes my words now. I pull her closer to me again and she\u2019s happy to lay her head back on my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the best sex I\u2019ve ever had because I got something out of you I\u2019ve never gotten out of a girl before.\u201d</p><p>She tilts her head upward to look at me, waiting to hear what exactly that might be.</p><p>I smile back down at her and say, \u201cI de-virginized your innocence, made you more comfortable with yourself sexually. And that is so hot to me.\u201d</p><p>Camryn leans up and kisses my jawline.</p><p>\u201cYou just like me for that head-job on the highway.\u201d</p><p>I look upward and grin. \u201cWell, I did really, really, really love that, but no, babe, that\u2019s not what I like you for.\u201d</p><p>I think she finally feels validated again. She nuzzles her head against my chest and grabs me tight with her right arm across my stomach.</p><p>We ride the rest of the way back to my apartment without saying anything. I sense that her silence is less grim than my own. But I don\u2019t want her to worry or to be brokenhearted. Not right now. Not ever. It\u2019s inevitable, but I want to hold it back for as long as I can.</p><p>We spend four hours watching movies in the living room, both of us sprawled out across the couch. I hold her in my arms and kiss her when she\u2019s trying to pay attention to an important scene and I stick my tongue in her ear just to make her scream about how gross it is. She\u2019s so cute when she\u2019s \u2018grossed out\u2019, so it\u2019s her own damn fault that I enjoy doing it so much. We throw popcorn into each other\u2019s mouths and take score. She won, six to my four, before we gave up and actually started eating the popcorn instead of playing with it. And I introduced her to my plant, Georgia, who didn\u2019t die while I was gone. Camryn told me about a mix-breed dog she adopted from an animal shelter that she named BeeBop, and I told her how sorry I felt for that dog to have been given such a f**ked up name. Coincidently, BeeBop died of congestive heart failure just like my dog and best friend, Maximus. I showed her pictures of him and she happened to have one of BeeBop with her, too. It was so ugly, it was cute.</p><p>We talk for hours and hours until she crawls onto my lap on the couch, straddling me. She lays her body against mine and says so softly that it makes my insides shiver, \u201cLet\u2019s go to bed....\u201d</p><p>I stand up with her legs still wrapped around my waist, her ass propped within my hands and I carry her to the bedroom. I slip out of my clothes, all of them, and lay down in the center of the bed. I was rock-hard before I brought her in here. And I watch her as she slowly undresses in front of me, stripping not only her clothes but her usual shy demeanor. She crawls on top of me from the foot of the bed and positions herself on my lap so that I feel myself pressing in-between her warm lips below. She never takes her eyes off mine as she leans her body over to bring her mouth closer to mine, kissing my chest and circling my n**ples with the tip of her tongue. I keep the heat of her thighs underneath my hands until she kisses me and I reach up and fill them with her br**sts.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d I whisper against her mouth just before she steals my breath with her kiss.</p><p>I press gently into her below and she presses back a little harder, teasing me and making me want to shove myself deep inside of her. But right now, she\u2019s the one in control and I\u2019ll gladly let her have it.</p><p>She breaks the kiss and then she kisses one side of my neck and then the other, always moving her h*ps so slowly that it makes me want her that much more.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you wet first,\u201d I whisper up at her, my hands locked around her little hips. She\u2019s already wet, but that\u2019s beside the point. \u201cCrawl up here, baby,\u201d I say, lifting my chin to indicate my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She licks my lips first and then when she starts to move up, I push myself down a little further upon the bed to give her room.</p><p>I waste no time when her thighs press down around my head and I start to lick her furiously, sucking on her cl*t so hard that she begins to grind her h*ps against my face, her fingers clutched around the top of the headboard. She\u2019s so f**king wet. When she starts to moan and whimper, I stop. And she knows why. She knows I want her to get off with me.</p><p>She crawls back down over the length of my body and sits on my lap, rubbing herself across my c*ck before reaching down and taking it into her hand.</p><p>When she slides herself down over me slowly, we both gasp and shudder.</p> <p>After a night of making love, she passes out in my arms and I hold her here, never wanting to let her go.

Waking myself up further, I lift my head slowly to see that he isn\u2019t there.</p><p>I smell bacon.</p> <p>I think about the night we had and can\u2019t wipe the obvious smile off my face. I untangle myself from the sheets and get out of bed and slip on my panties and t-shirt.</p><p>Andrew is standing at the stove when I walk into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBaby, why are you up so early?\u201d</p><p>I walk over to the fridge and open it, searching for anything to wet my mouth. I need to brush my teeth, but if he\u2019s cooking breakfast I don\u2019t want to make it taste funky mixed with toothpaste.</p><p>\u201cThought I\u2019d bring you breakfast in bed.\u201d</p><p>It took him a few seconds longer to answer than I feel like it should have and his voice sounded off. I look up from the fridge and over at him. He\u2019s just standing there, staring into the grease.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, are you alright?\u201d</p><p>I let the fridge door close without getting anything from it.</p><p>He barely lifts his head to glance at me.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d</p><p>My heart is beating faster and faster, though I\u2019m not sure why.</p><p>I move over next to him and put my hand on his arm. He lifts his gaze from the grease and looks at me slowly.</p><p>\u201cAndrew....\u201d</p><p>In a sort of cruel slow motion, Andrew\u2019s legs give way and his body crashes against the white tile floor, the spatula he had in his hand hits the floor with him, splattering hot grease. I reach out to grab him but I can\u2019t keep him on his feet. Everything is still moving in slow motion: my scream, my hands as they grab at his shoulders, his head as it bounces against the tile. But then when his body begins to shake and convulse uncontrollably, slow motion becomes fast and terrifying.</p> <p>\u201cANDREW! OH MY GOD, ANDREW!\u201d</p><p>I want to help him up but his body won\u2019t stop shaking. I see the whites of his eyes and his jaw clenched in a horrific display. His limbs have locked up stiffly.</p><p>I scream out again, tears barreling from my eyes. \u201cSomebody help me!\u201d And then I snap into my senses and run for the nearest phone. His cell phone is on the nearby counter. I dial 911 and in the two seconds it takes for them to answer, I\u2019m turning the fire off from the stove.</p><p>\u201cPlease! He\u2019s having a seizure! Please, someone help me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, the first thing you need to do is calm down. Is he still seizing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>I watch in horror as Andrew\u2019s body shakes against the floor. I\u2019m so scared I feel like throwing up.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I want you to move anything nearby that could hurt him. Is he wearing glasses? Is his head in danger of hitting furniture or any other objects?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! B-But he hit his head when he fell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, now find something to put under his head, a pillow, something to protect it from hitting anything else.\u201d</p><p>I look around the kitchen first but see nothing and then I run frantically into the living room and grab a small couch pillow and bring it back. I set the phone down long enough to slide the pillow underneath his jerking head.</p><p>Oh no....oh my God, what\u2019s happening to him?!</p><p>I put the phone back to my ear.</p><p>\u201cOK, I put the pillow under his head!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright ma\u2019am,\u201d the 911 operator says calmly, \u201chow long has he been seizing? Does he have a known condition that causes seizures?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I d-don\u2019t know, about...maybe two minutes, three at the most. And no, I\u2019ve never seen him do this before. He\u2019s never told me about any....\u201d It starts to dawn on me: he never told me. All sorts of things start attacking my mind, only causing me to lose my calm again. \u201cPlease send an ambulance! Please! Hurry!\u201d I\u2019m choking on my own tears.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s body stops jerking.</p><p>Before the 911 operator has a chance to respond, I say, \u201cHe\u2019s stopped! W-What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, ma\u2019am I need you to help roll him over onto his side\u2014we\u2019re going to send an ambulance. What is your address?\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m rolling him onto his side, I freeze with her question.</p><p>I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t f**king know! Goddammit!</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know the\u2014.\u201d I shoot up from the floor and rush over to the counter where a stack of mail has been sitting and I find the address on the top piece and read it off to her.</p><p>\u201cAn ambulance is on its way. Would you like to stay on the phone with me until it arrives?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what she said, or if she ever really said anything at all and I\u2019m just imagining it, but I don\u2019t respond. I can\u2019t tear my eyes away from Andrew, lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s unconscious! Oh my God, why isn\u2019t he waking up?!\u201d My free hand lingers on my lips.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon,\u201d she says and I finally snap back into her voice. \u201cWould you like me to remain with you until the ambulance gets there?\u201d</p><p>\u201c...Yes, please don\u2019t hang up. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019m right here,\u201d she says and her voice is my only comfort. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t think straight. I can\u2019t speak. All I can do is watch him. I\u2019m even too scared to sit on the floor next to him for fear of him seizing again and me being in the way.</p><p>Minutes later I hear sirens blaring up the street.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re here,\u201d I say into the phone distantly.</p><p>I still can\u2019t look at anything but Andrew.</p><p>Why is this happening?</p><p>There\u2019s a knock at the door and finally I get up and run over to it to let the EMT\u2019s in. I don\u2019t even remember dropping Andrew\u2019s phone on the floor with the 911 operator still on the other end. The next thing I know, Andrew is being lifted onto a stretcher and strapped down.</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d a voice asks and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s one of the EMT\u2019s, but I can\u2019t see his face. All I see is Andrew\u2019s as he\u2019s being wheeled out the door.</p><p>\u201cAndrew Parrish,\u201d I answer quietly.</p><p>I vaguely hear the name of the hospital the EMT tells me they are taking him. And when they leave, I just stand here, staring at the door where I last saw him. It takes me several long minutes to get my head together and the first thing I do is grab his cell phone and search for his mother\u2019s number. I hear her start to cry on the other end when I tell her what happened and I think she dropped her phone.</p><p>\u201cMs. Parrish?\u201d I feel the tears stinging the back of my eyes. \u201cMs. Parrish?\u201d But she\u2019s gone.</p><p>Finally, I throw on some clothes\u2014I have no idea what I\u2019m even wearing\u2014and grab Andrew\u2019s car keys and my purse and rush out the door. I drive the Chevelle around for a few minutes until I realize I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going or where I\u2019m at. I find a gas station and stop to ask for directions to the hospital and they give them to me, but I still barely find my way there without getting lost. I can\u2019t think straight.</p><p>I slam the car door and run into the emergency room with my purse sloppily over my shoulder. I could drop it and not know the difference. The nurse at the desk types on her keyboard for information and then points me in the right direction where I end up in a waiting room area. And I\u2019m all alone.</p><p>I think an hour has gone by, but I could be wrong. One hour. Five minutes. A week. It doesn\u2019t make any difference; it would all feel the same to me. My chest hurts, I\u2019ve cried so much. I\u2019ve paced the floor so hard that I\u2019ve started counting the specks in the carpet on my way back and forth.</p><p>Another hour.</p><p>This waiting room is so incredibly insipid with brown walls and brown seats lined neatly in two rows down the center of the room. A clock high on the wall above the door ticks around and around and even though it\u2019s too faint for me to hear, my mind believes that I can hear it. There\u2019s a coffee pot and a sink nearby. A man\u2014I think\u2014just walked in through a side door and fills a small Styrofoam cup and then walks back out.</p><p>Another hour.</p><p>My head hurts. My lips are chapped and broken. I keep licking them, only making it worse. I haven\u2019t seen a nurse walk by in a while and I\u2019m starting to wish I would\u2019ve stopped the last one I saw before she slipped down the long, sterile fluorescent lit hallway outside the waiting area.</p><p>What\u2019s taking so long? What\u2019s going on?</p><p>I hit my forehead in the palm of my hand and just as I go to reach for Andrew\u2019s phone in my purse, I hear a familiar voice:</p><p>\u201cCamryn?\u201d</p><p>I turn swiftly at the waist.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s younger brother, Asher, is walking into the room.</p><p>I want to be relieved that someone has finally come to talk to me, to lift this deep sense of painful nothingness, but I can\u2019t be relieved because I only expect him to tell me something horrible about Andrew. Asher wasn\u2019t even in Texas as far I know and if he\u2019s here suddenly then that must mean he took the first flight out of wherever he was and people only do that when something bad has happened.</p><p>\u201cAsher?\u201d I say, tears straining my voice.</p><p>I don\u2019t even hesitate and I run over into his arms. He hugs me tightly.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d I say, tears streaming from my eyes all over again. \u201cIs Andrew alright?\u201d</p><p>Asher takes my hand and leads me to a seat and I sit next to him, squeezing my purse in my lap just to have something to hold onto.</p><p>Asher looks so much like Andrew it hurts my heart.</p><p>He smiles gently at me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine right now,\u201d he says and that small sentence is enough to fill my entire body with a surge of energy. \u201cBut he probably won\u2019t stay that way.\u201d</p><p>And just as quickly, that hopeful energy drains right back out of me, taking other parts of me with it: my heart, my soul, that tiny bit of hope that I had maintained all this time since this happened. What is Asher saying...what is he trying to tell me?</p><p>My chest shudders with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I barely get the words out.</p><p>He takes a calm breath.</p><p>\u201cAbout eight months ago,\u201d he says carefully, \u201cmy brother found out he has a brain tumor\u2014\u201d</p><p>My heart is gone. My breath is gone.</p><p>My purse falls onto the floor, spilling everything with it, but I can\u2019t move to pick it up. I can\u2019t move...anything.</p><p>I feel Asher\u2019s hand take up mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause of our father\u2019s condition Andrew refused to get further tests. He was supposed to go back to see Dr. Marsters that same week, but he wouldn\u2019t go. Our mom and our brother, Aidan, tried everything to get him to go. As far as I know, he agreed at one point, but he never went through with it because our father\u2019s condition worsened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...,\u201d I shake my head over and over again, not wanting to believe the things he\u2019s telling me, \u201cno....\u201d I just want to force his words out of my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why Andrew and Aidan have been at each other\u2019s throats,\u201d Asher goes on. \u201cAidan just wanted him to do what he needed to do, and Andrew, as stubborn as he is, fought Aidan at every turn.\u201d</p><p>I look toward the wall and say, \u201cIt\u2019s why he never wanted to see his father in the hospital....\u201d The realization numbs me further.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Asher says quietly, \u201cit\u2019s also why he wouldn\u2019t go to the funeral.\u201d</p><p>I look right at Asher now, my eyes boring into his, my fingers dancing on my lips. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s afraid the same thing is going to happen to him, that his tumor is inoperable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I shoot up from the seat, a tube of lipstick cracks underneath my shoe.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it\u2019s not as bad?\u201d I say frantically. \u201cHe\u2019s in the hospital now; they can do what they need to do.\u201d I start to march toward the exit. \u201cI\u2019ll make him get the tests. I\u2019ll force him! He\u2019ll listen to me!\u201d</p> <p>Asher grabs my arm. I turn around.</p><p>\u201cFrom what they can tell right now, his chances are very small, Camryn.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m going to throw up. My cheeks feel like there are thousands of tiny pins prickling them as more tears push their way to the surface. My hands are shaking, too. My whole f**king body is shaking!</p><p>Asher adds softly, \u201cHe let it go too long.\u201d</p><p>Both of my hands come up and cover my face and I sob into them, my body trembling uncontrollably. I feel Asher\u2019s arms wrap tightly around me.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to see you.\u201d</p> <p>His words cause me to look up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve already got him in a room; I\u2019ll take you to him. Just wait here for a few more minutes until my mom leaves his room and I\u2019ll walk you back.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I just stand here, wordless...dying inside, the worst pain I have ever felt.</p><p>Asher looks at me once more to be confident that I heard him clearly and then he says carefully, \u201cI\u2019ll be back shortly for you. Just wait here.\u201d</p><p>Asher leaves and to keep from collapsing I grab the nearest chair and sit down. I can\u2019t even see straight, the tears are burning my eyes, rushing down my cheeks. My chest feels like someone literally reached inside of it and ripped out my heart.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to see him without going completely out of my mind.</p><p>Why did he do this?!</p><p>Why is this happening?!</p> <p>Before I go completely f**king crazy and start breaking shit or hitting something and hurting myself, I crawl on my hands and knees to my purse on the floor. I didn\u2019t even notice that Asher had picked everything up and put it back inside for me and then set my purse on the chair. I dig for my phone and call Natalie.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, I-I need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCam...are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, please listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, yes, I\u2019m here. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my best friend,\u201d I say, \u201cand I need you to come to Galveston. As soon as possible. Will you come? I need you. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Camryn, what the hell is going on? What happened? Are you alright?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing happened to me, but I need you here. I need someone and you\u2019re all I have. My mom won\u2019t un\u2014Natalie, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-Alright,\u201d she says with deep worry in her voice. \u201cI\u2019m on the first flight out. I\u2019ll be there. Just keep your phone on you.\u201d</p><p>I drop my hand to my side, my phone crushed in my fist and I stare at the wall for what seems like forever until Asher\u2019s voice pulls me out of myself. I look up at him. He walks toward me and reaches out for my hand, knowing I\u2019m going to need it. My legs feel fragile, like I\u2019m walking on prosthetics and I don\u2019t have full use of them. Asher holds my hand so tight. We step out into the brightly-lit hallway and head toward an elevator.</p><p>\u201cI have to calm myself,\u201d I say out loud, but more to me than Asher. I pull my hand from his and wipe my face and run my fingers through my hair, over the top of my head. \u201cI can\u2019t see him in hysterics. That\u2019s the last thing he needs right now is to be trying to calm me down.\u201d</p><p>Asher doesn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t look at him. I see our reflections in the elevator door, warped and discolored. I notice the number on the elevator moving up two floors and then the elevator stops. The door opens. I just stand here at first afraid to walk out, but then I take a very deep breath and wipe my eyes again.</p><p>We walk to the middle of the hall to a room with a large wooden door that has been left cracked open. Asher pushes the door open the rest of the way, but I look down at the floor and at the invisible line that separates me in the hallway from Andrew inside the room and I\u2019m so scared to walk over it. I feel like once I do I will see that all of this is real and there really is no turning back. I squeeze my eyes shut and force back a new rush of tears, breathing deeply with my fists clenched around my purse.</p><p>And then I open my eyes when Andrew\u2019s mom steps out.</p><p>Her soft face is exhausted by emotion, just as I know mine must be. Her hair is tangled. Her eyelids are enflamed. But she manages to smile lovingly at me, placing her gentle fingers on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Camryn.\u201d</p><p>And then she walks away from the room hand in hand with Asher.</p><p>I watch them for a brief moment as they slip farther down the hall, but their figures appear blurred into their surroundings.</p><p>I look into the room from the doorway and see the end of the bed where I know Andrew is lying.</p><p>I step inside.</p><p>\u201cBaby, come here,\u201d Andrew says when he sees me.</p><p>At first, I\u2019m frozen here in this spot, but when I look into his eyes, those unforgettable green eyes that have such a hold on me, I drop my purse on the floor and rush over to his bed.</p><p>38</p><p>I PRACTICALLY FALL OVER his body and into his arms. He holds me so tight, though not as tight as I want him to. I want him to crush me to death and never let me go, to take me with him. But he\u2019s still weak. I can tell that what he\u2019s going through is quickly draining him.</p><p>Andrew holds my face in his hands and he pushes my hair away from my eyes and he kisses away the tears that I tried so hard to keep hidden for his sake, so he wouldn\u2019t have to waste any of his strength on me. But the heart has a mind of its own and it always gets what it wants, especially when it\u2019s dying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he says in a painful, desperate voice; my face still framed by his hands. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you, Camryn...I didn\u2019t want our time together to be anything but what it was.\u201d</p><p>Tears pour from my eyes, dripping over his fingers and down his wrists.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Andrew...\u201d I choke back a few tears, \u201c...I understand why; you don\u2019t have to explain. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t tell me....\u201d</p><p>He seems surprised, but happy about it. He pulls my face toward him and kisses my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you would\u2019ve told me then our time together would\u2019ve been dark and...I-I don\u2019t know, but it would\u2019ve been different and I can\u2019t bear the thought of different\u2014but Andrew, I wish you would\u2019ve told me for one reason alone: I would\u2019ve done anything, anything to get you to a hospital sooner.\u201d My voice begins to rise as the sad truth of my words hurts me to say them. \u201cYou could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>Andrew shakes his head. \u201cBaby, it was already too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that! It\u2019s not too late now! You\u2019re still here, there\u2019s still a chance.\u201d</p><p>He smiles gently and his hands finally fall away from my cheeks, resting at his sides on the white knit hospital blanket that covers him. An IV snakes from the top of his hand and to a machine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being realistic, Camryn. They\u2019ve already told me that my chances don\u2019t look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s still a chance,\u201d I argue, forcing back more tears and wishing I controlled their off switch. \u201cSmall is better than no chance at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I let them operate on me.\u201d</p><p>I feel like I was just slapped in the face.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, if?\u201d</p><p>His eyes stray from mine.</p><p>I reach out and take his chin vigorously in my hand, turning him back to face me. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018if\u2019, Andrew\u2014you can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>Andrew reaches out for me and moves himself to one side of the bed. He guides me to lie down next to him and as I curl my body into his lying on his side, he lays one arm over me and pulls me close.</p><p>\u201cIf I had never met you,\u201d he says, peering into my eyes just inches from his, \u201cI never would have gone through with it. If you weren\u2019t here with me right now, I wouldn\u2019t do it. I would think it was a waste of money and time and would only put my family through a false sense of hope, dragging out the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re going to let them do the surgery,\u201d I say suspiciously, though it\u2019s more like a question.</p><p>He brushes my cheek with the pad of his thumb.</p><p>\u201cI will do anything for you, Camryn Bennett. I don\u2019t care what it is, I don\u2019t care...anything you ever ask me to do and I would do it. No exceptions.\u201d</p><p>Sobs rattle my chest.</p><p>Before I have a chance to say anything else, Andrew moves his hand across my cheek, pushing back my hair. He looks deeply into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I crush my mouth over his and we kiss feverishly.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose you,\u201d I say. \u201cWe have the open road ahead of us. You\u2019re my partner in crime.\u201d I force a smile through my tears.</p><p>He kisses my forehead.</p><p>We lie together for a little while and talk about the surgery and the tests that still need to be done and I tell him that I won\u2019t leave his side. I\u2019ll stay here with him for as long as it takes. And we go on and on about the places we want to see and he starts picking songs out of the air that he wants me to learn so we can sing them together on the road. I\u2019ve never been so willing to sing with him as I am right now. I would try to belt out Celine Dion or an opera singer\u2014I don\u2019t care. I would do it. I would most certainly send everyone screaming for the exits, but I would do it. A nurse comes in to check on him at one point and Andrew gains back some of his playful personality and he messes with her head, telling her she could join us if she wanted in a little \u2018two on one\u2019 action.</p><p>The nurse just smiled, rolling her eyes and went about her business. It made her feel good about herself and that\u2019s all he was aiming for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a time, as I lay in this bed with Andrew, it feels like it did when we were on the road. We don\u2019t think about sickness or death, and we don\u2019t cry. We just talk and laugh and every now and then he tries to touch me in all the right places. I giggle and push his hands away because I feel like I\u2019m doing something wrong. That he should be resting.</p><p>Eventually, I give in and let him. Because he\u2019s persistent. And, of course, he\u2019s irresistible. I let him finger me underneath the blanket and then I do the same for him with my hand.</p><p>After another hour, I get up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cBabe, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing is wrong,\u201d I say smiling warmly and then I take off my pants and my shirt.</p><p>He\u2019s grinning from ear to ear. I knew that the perverted gears in his head would start churning before anything else.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I would love to have sex with you in a hospital room,\u201d I say as I crawl back into the bed with him, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna happen; you need all your strength for your surgery.\u201d I would totally have sex with him in this bed, but right now, it\u2019s not about sex.</p><p>He looks at me curiously as I lie back down next to him wearing only my panties and bra and I curl my body against his like before. All he\u2019s wearing underneath the knit blanket are a pair of thin blue hospital pants. I press my chest firmly against his and tangle my legs around his. Our bodies are perfectly aligned, our ribs touching.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asks, growing more curious and impatient, but loving every second of it.</p> <p>I move my free arm down and trace his tattoo of Eurydice with my fingers. He watches carefully. And when my index finger finds Eurydice\u2019s elbow where the ink stops, I move it along my skin to pick up where his left off.</p><p>\u201cI want to be your Eurydice, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>His face lights up and his dimples deepen.</p><p>\u201cI want to get the other half,\u201d I go on, touching his lips with my fingers now. \u201cI want to get Orpheus on my ribs and reunite them.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s overwhelmed. I can see it in his glistening eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, you don\u2019t have to do that; it hurts like hell on the ribs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I want it and I don\u2019t care how much it hurts.\u201d</p><p>His eyes begin to water as he looks at me and then his mouth covers mine and our tongues dance with one another for a long, loving moment.</p><p>\u201cI would love that,\u201d he whispers onto my lips.</p><p>I kiss him softly and whisper back, \u201cAfter your surgery, when you\u2019re well enough then we\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYeah, Gus will definitely need me there to make sure the placement of your tattoo lines up with mine\u2014he laughed at me when I went in to get this on my ribs.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cHe did, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cHe accused me of being a hopeless romantic and threatened to tell my friends. I told him he sounded like my father and to shut the f**k up. Gus is a good guy and one helluva tattoo artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew spears his fingers through my hair, constantly brushing it back over the top of my head. And as he watches me, scanning my face, I wonder what\u2019s going through his mind. His beautiful smile has vanished and he looks more intent and careful.</p><p>\u201cCamryn, I want you to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, you have to do this for me,\u201d he says with worry in his gaze. \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself believe one hundred percent that I\u2019m going to live through this. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew please. Just stop.\u201d</p><p>He puts four fingers on my lips, hushing me. I\u2019m already crying again. He\u2019s trying to be as gentle with the truth as he possibly can be, holding back his own tears and his own emotions even better than I can my own. He\u2019s the one who might die and I\u2019m the one with no strength. It pisses me off, but I can\u2019t do anything but cry and be pissed at myself.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me that you\u2019ll continue to tell yourself that I might die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make myself say something like that!\u201d</p><p>He squeezes me tighter.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth, feeling my jaw grind harshly behind my cheeks. My nose and my eyes sting and burn.</p><p>Finally I say, \u201c...I promise,\u201d and it wrenches my heart.</p><p>\u201cBut you have to promise me that you\u2019ll pull through this,\u201d I say, pressing my head underneath his chin again. \u201cI can\u2019t be without you, Andrew. You have to know that I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, baby...I know.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cWill you sing to me?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to sing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d he answers.</p><p>\u201cNo. I won\u2019t sing that song. Don\u2019t ever ask me that again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>His arms tighten around me.</p><p>\u201cThen sing anything,\u201d he whispers, \u201cI just want to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>And so I start to sing Poison &amp; Wine, the same song that we sang together back in New Orleans when we lay in each other\u2019s arms that night. He sings along with me a few verses, but I can tell just how weak he really is inside because he can barely hold a note.</p><p>We fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cGot some tests to run,\u201d I hear a voice say above the bed.</p><p>I open my eyes to see the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois nurse standing at the side of the bed.</p><p>Andrew stirs awake, too.</p><p>It\u2019s late afternoon and I can tell by the view from the window that it\u2019ll be getting dark soon.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably get dressed,\u201d the nurse says with a knowing smile.</p><p>She probably thinks Andrew and I got it on in here at some point considering I\u2019m half-naked.</p><p>I crawl out of the bed and slip on my clothes while the nurse checks Andrew\u2019s stats and apparently gets him ready to leave the room with her. There\u2019s a wheelchair near the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of tests?\u201d Andrew asks weakly.</p><p>The weakness in his voice causes me to look up. He doesn\u2019t look good. He looks...disoriented.</p><p>\u201cAndrew?\u201d I go back over to the bed.</p><p>Carefully, he raises one hand to ward me off. \u201cNo, baby, I\u2019m alright; just a little dizzy. Trying to wake up.\u201d</p><p>The nurse turns to me and even though they are trained to appear relaxed and not show the true measure of concern in their faces, I can see it in her eyes. She knows something\u2019s not right.</p><p>She forces a smile and goes around to help him sit up, moving his IV out of the way.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be gone for an hour or two, maybe more, while they run more tests,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should go grab a bite to eat, stretch your legs and come back in a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I-I don\u2019t want to leave him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what she says,\u201d Andrew mumbles and the more I hear him try to talk, the more fearful I become. \u201cI want you to go eat.\u201d He manages to turn his head to see me this time and he points a stern finger. \u201cBut no steak,\u201d he demands playfully. \u201cYou still owe me a steak dinner, remember? When I get out of here, that\u2019s the first thing we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>He gets the smile out of me that he was shooting for, although it\u2019s weak.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I agree, nodding reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few hours and I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>I move back over and kiss him softly. He looks deeply into my eyes when I pull away. All I can see is pain in his eyes. Pain and exhaustion. But he tries to be strong and a tiny smile tugs one corner of his mouth. He gets into the wheelchair and looks back at me once before the nurse wheels him out of the room.</p><p>My breath catches.</p><p>I feel like I want to scream out to him that I love him, but I don\u2019t say it. I love him with all my heart, but deep down I feel that if I say it, if I finally admit it out loud, that everything will come crashing down. Maybe if I keep it within me, just never say the words, then our story will never be over. Saying those three words can be a beginning, but for me and Andrew, I fear it will be the end.</p><p>39</p><p>I WOULDN\u2019T BE ABLE to eat if my own life depended on it. I only told Andrew that I would to satisfy him. Instead, I venture outside and sit in the front of the hospital for a while. I just don\u2019t want to leave the premises while he\u2019s inside. It took everything in me to let that nurse wheel him away from me.</p><p>I get a text message from Natalie:</p><p>Just landed. Taking a cab. Be there soon. Love you.</p><p>When I see the cab pull up to the front of the hospital, it takes me a second to go to my feet. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen her; since we had our Damon issue.</p><p>But none of that matters to me anymore. It hasn\u2019t for a while. Best friends, no matter what they do or how much they hurt you, it only hurts as much as it does because they are your best friend. And none of us are perfect. Mistakes were made for best friends to forgive; it\u2019s what makes being a best friend official. In a way like Andrew, I can\u2019t imagine not having Natalie in my life. And right now I need her more than any time I have ever needed her.</p><p>She runs across the concrete when she sees me, her chocolate-colored long hair blowing freely behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve missed you so much, Cam!\u201d She practically squeezes me to death.</p><p>All it took was for her to be here and I\u2019m taking advantage of her hug and sobbing into her chest. I just couldn\u2019t keep the tears contained. I\u2019ve never cried as much in my life as I have in the past twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cOh, Cam, what is going on?\u201d I feel her fingers comb through my hair as I cry softly into her shirt. \u201cLet\u2019s go sit down.\u201d</p><p>Natalie walks me to a stone bench sitting underneath an oak tree and we sit together.</p><p>I tell her everything. From why I left North Carolina to meeting Andrew on the bus in Kansas and all the way up to this point, sitting with her on this bench. She cried and smiled and laughed with me as I told her about my time with Andrew and I\u2019ve rarely seen her this serious about anything before. Only when my brother Cole got sent to prison and after my parents divorced. And after Ian\u2019s death. Natalie may be a crazy, outspoken, party-girl that usually doesn\u2019t know when to shut up, but she knows there\u2019s a time and place for everything and in a time like this, all she gives me is her heart.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going through this after what you went through with Ian. It\u2019s like some cruel f**king joke that fate is playing on you.\u201d</p><p>It does feel like that in a way, but with Andrew, it feels much worse than some cruel joke.</p><p>\u201cGirl,\u201d she says, laying her hand on my leg, \u201cthink about it: what are the chances that everything that happened the way it did, were just coincidence?\u201d She shakes her head at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cam, but that\u2019s just too much coincidence\u2014you two were meant to be together. It\u2019s like some wicked f**king fairytale love story that you just can\u2019t make up, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything; I just contemplate it. Normally, I would comment on her dramatic usage of words, but this time I can\u2019t. I just don\u2019t have it in me.</p><p>She forces my gaze. \u201cSeriously, do you think you would be put through all this only to watch him die?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her using that word stings, but I hold it down.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I look out at the trees on the lawn, but I don\u2019t really see them. All I see is Andrew\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d Natalie cups my face in her hands and stares into my eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll get through this, you just have to tell death to piss off, that you got this one, y\u2019know?\u201d</p><p>She surprises me sometimes. Right now is one of those times.</p> <p>I smile gently and she wipes the tears from my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find a Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>Natalie stands up with her giant black leather purse dangling from one arm and reaches out her hand to me.</p><p>I\u2019m reluctant.</p><p>\u201cI...Natalie, I really want to stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you need to get away from this bad energy for a while\u2014hospitals suck the hope out of everything\u2014come back when he\u2019s back in his room and then you can introduce me to that sexy piece of Kellan that I\u2019m oh-so-f**king jealous of you for.\u201d She smiles a huge, toothy smile.</p><p>She always gets me to smile, too.</p><p>I take her hand.</p><p>\u201cAlright,\u201d I give in.</p><p>We take the Chevelle to the nearest Starbucks. Natalie drooled all over the car all the way here.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cam, you really hit the jackpot with this one.\u201d She sits across from me sipping her iced latte. \u201cGuys that perfect are rare.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s not perfect,\u201d I say, sloshing my straw around in my cup. \u201cHe\u2019s got a dirty mouth, he\u2019s stubborn, he forces me to do shit I don\u2019t want to do and he always gets his way.\u201d</p><p>Natalie grins and sucks on her straw.</p><p>Then she points at me briefly. \u201cSee, like I said: perfect.\u201d She laughs and then she rolls her brown eyes. \u201cAnd pu-lease\u2014makes you do shit you don\u2019t wanna do, my ass. Something tells me you love it when he tells you what to do.\u201d She slaps her hand upon the table and her eyes bug out. \u201cOoooh, he\u2019s rough in bed, isn\u2019t he? Isn\u2019t he?!\u201d She can hardly contain herself.</p><p>I did tell her that we had sex, but I didn\u2019t exactly give her the juicy details.</p><p>My eyes stray downward at the table.</p><p>She slaps the table again and a guy sitting behind her looks over at us.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, he is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is!\u201d I hiss, trying not to laugh. \u201cNow will you be quiet?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, you have to give me an itsy-bitsy detail.\u201d She presses her thumb and index finger together to show just how itsy-bitsy and she squints one eye.</p><p>Ah, what the hell? I shrug and lean across the table and look to both sides of me to see if anyone seems to be listening.</p><p>\u201cThe first time,\u201d I start to say and her head looks frozen in time, eyes bugged out, mouth parted, \u201che practically forced himself on me...you know what I mean...of course I wanted him to, you know.\u201d</p><p>She nods like a bobblehead, but doesn\u2019t speak because she wants me to continue.</p><p>\u201cI can tell he is naturally dominant and wasn\u2019t just doing it because I told him it\u2019s what I like. I can also tell that he was still being careful, not to go too far because he wanted to be sure if it was OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he ever take it any further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know he will.\u201d</p><p>Natalie smiles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a freaky little sexual deviant,\u201d she says and I blush so hard I can\u2019t look up for a moment. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s exactly what you needed in every aspect. He brought shit out of you that Ian and Christian couldn\u2019t.\u201d She looks upward as if at the heavens and says quickly, \u201cYou know I love you, Ian,\u201d and kisses two fingers and pushes them toward the sky. She looks back at me quickly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not why I love him.\u201d</p><p>Natalie\u2019s mouth snaps shut. So does mine. I think all of the air was just sucked right out of the room. I didn\u2019t even realize what I was saying.</p><p>Why did I have to say that out loud?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him?\u201d she asks, though she doesn\u2019t seem so surprised.</p><p>I don\u2019t say anything. I just swallow down any other words I had been prepared to say.</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t in love with him after everything you\u2019ve been through with him, I\u2019d think you were the one with the brain tumor.\u201d</p><p>Even though I hate that she used those two cruel and horrific words, I know she didn\u2019t mean anything by it.</p><p>But regardless of her lighthearted banter and her way with so easily making me forget that things aren\u2019t so great right now, I\u2019ve already exhausted my ability to play along with her anymore. I\u2019m grateful for her helping me to lift my mind of the depression and fear for Andrew, even if only for a few minutes with her talking about sex and being like we used to be.</p><p>I can\u2019t anymore.</p><p>I just want to get back to the hospital and be with him.</p><p>Natalie and I head back after sundown and we walk together through the front doors and hitch a ride on the elevator.</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s already done,\u201d I say nervously, staring at that blurred reflection on the elevator door again.</p><p>I feel Natalie\u2019s hand slip around mine. I look over at her to see her smiling gently at me.</p><p>The elevator opens up and we head down the hallway.</p><p>Asher and Marna are walking towards us in the opposite direction.</p><p>The look on their faces causes my heart to fall into the pit of my stomach. I squeeze Natalie\u2019s hand so tight I\u2019m probably crushing it.</p><p>When Asher and Marna stand face to face with us, tears slip relentlessly down her cheeks. She grabs me into a hug and shudders out the words:</p><p>\u201cAndrew fell into a coma...they don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it.\u201d</p><p>I step back away from her.</p><p>Every little sound, from the air filtering through the vents in the ceiling to the people shuffling past us in the hallway, it\u2019s all shut out in an instant. I feel Natalie\u2019s hand go for mine, but I absently push it away and stumble back further, my hands pressed over my heart. I can\u2019t breathe...I can\u2019t breathe. I see Asher\u2019s eyes, glistening with tears as he looks at me, but I look away. I look away because he has Andrew\u2019s eyes and I can\u2019t bear it.</p><p>Marna reaches into her purse and pulls out an envelope. She steps up to me carefully and takes both of my hands, putting the envelope into them.</p><p>\u201cAndrew wanted me to give this to you if anything happened to him.\u201d She folds my fingers over the envelope with her own fingers. I don\u2019t look down at it; I just look at her, tears drenching my face.</p><p>I can\u2019t breathe....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Marna says, her voice trembling, \u201cI have to go.\u201d She pats my hands motherly. \u201cYou\u2019re always welcome in my home and in my family. Please know that.\u201d</p><p>She nearly falls and Asher wraps his arm around her waist and walks her away down the hall.</p><p>I just stand here in the center. A few nurses walk by, but go around me. I feel the wind brush my face lightly when they walk past. It takes me an eternity to gather the courage to look down at the envelope in my hands. I\u2019m shaking. My fingers fumble the flap on the envelope.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d I hear Natalie say and I\u2019m too outside of myself to protest.</p><p>She slips the envelope from my fingers carefully and opens it for me, slowly unfolding the letter inside.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to read it for you?\u201d</p><p>I look at her, my lips quivering uncontrollably and I shake my head as I finally understand her question. \u201cNo...let me....\u201d</p><p>She hands me the letter and I unfold it the rest of the way, my tears falling onto the paper as I read:</p><p>Dear Camryn,</p><p>I never wanted it to be this way. I wanted to tell you these things myself, but I was afraid. I was afraid that if I told you out loud that I loved you, that what we had together would die with me. The truth is that I knew in Kansas that you were the one. I\u2019ve loved you since that day when I first looked up into your eyes as you glared down at me from over the top of that bus seat. Maybe I didn\u2019t know it then, but I knew something had happened to me in that moment and I could never let you go.</p><p>I have never lived the way I lived during my short time with you. For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve felt whole, alive, free. You were the missing piece of my soul, the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins. I think that if past lives are real then we have been lovers in every single one of them. I\u2019ve known you for a short time, but I feel like I\u2019ve known you forever.</p><p>I want you to know that even in death I\u2019ll always remember you. I\u2019ll always love you. I wish that things could\u2019ve turned out differently. I thought of you many nights on the road. I stared up at the ceiling in the motels and pictured what our life might be like together if I had lived. I even got all mushy and thought of you in a wedding dress and even with a mini me in your belly. You know, I always heard that sex is great when you\u2019re pregnant. ;-)</p><p>But I\u2019m sorry that I had to leave you, Camryn. I\u2019m so sorry...I wish the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was real because then you could come to the Underworld and sing me back into your life. I wouldn\u2019t look back. I wouldn\u2019t f**k it up like Orpheus did.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, baby...</p><p>I want you to promise me that you\u2019ll stay strong and beautiful and sweet and caring. I want you to be happy and find someone who will love you as much as I did. I want you to get married and have babies and live your life. Just remember to always be yourself and don\u2019t be afraid to speak your mind or to dream out loud.</p><p>I hope you\u2019ll never forget me.</p><p>One more thing: don\u2019t feel bad for not telling me that you loved me. You didn\u2019t need to say it. I knew all along that you did.</p><p>Love Always,</p><p>Andrew Parrish</p><p>I fall to my knees in the center of the hall, Andrew\u2019s letter clutched in my fingertips.</p><p>And that\u2019s the last thing I remember about that day.</p><p>Two months later...</p><p>40</p><p>THE SUN IS SHINING and there\u2019s not a cloud in the sky. I even hear birds chirping. I guess it\u2019s kind of perfect for a day like this. The heel of my shoe presses against a soft patch of grass. I\u2019m dressed in a cute white and yellow sundress that falls just above my knees. My hair is braided around to one side, how Andrew always insisted I wear it. My hands are folded together down in front of me as I stare down at the gravestone that reads: PARRISH in big chiseled letters across the back. It was hard to come here, but it has been a long time coming.</p><p>I keep my eyes down, staring absently at the mound of clay-like dirt that still seems fresh after two months since the burial. Not even the rain pounding on it over and over again seems to help flatten it any. I glance out at all of the other graves, most of them already covered by grass and I can\u2019t feel sad, only comforted as though these people here, although long gone to all of us, have each other\u2019s company.</p><p>A pair of hands slip around my waist from behind.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming here with me, babe,\u201d Andrew says into my ear and then kisses my cheek.</p><p>I take his hand and pull him around to my side and we look down one last time at his father\u2019s grave together.</p><p>We leave Wyoming later that night, but we go by plane. Our plans to travel around the world have only been put on hold. After Andrew\u2019s coma and surgery, he began to recover within three weeks. The doctors were as surprised as the rest of us, but he still has needed time to recover fully and so I\u2019ve been with him ever since, living in Galveston. He goes to physical therapy once a week, but already it seems as if he doesn\u2019t need it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andrew insisted that we get up off our asses and get on the road like we planned\u2014he\u2019s suffering from that elated second-chance-at-life feeling which makes him more eager than ever to do just about everything. Hell, he enjoys washing dishes and doing laundry. But his mom, Marna, and I have strictly forbidden him to do too much, or to over exert himself. Andrew doesn\u2019t like it, but he knows better than to stand up to both of us at once.</p><p>We will, quite literally, kick his ass.</p><p>But Andrew and I still plan to travel the world and keep our promise not to stay grounded to the monotony of life. None of that has changed and I know that it never will.</p><p>Natalie went back to North Carolina and we talk every single day. She\u2019s dating Blake now, the guy Damon attacked that night on the roof. It makes me smile to know they are together. When I talk to them on Skype, I can just tell they were made for each other. At least for right now; with Natalie, one never knows what\u2019ll happen. Damon, on the other hand, ended up getting busted for drug possession. It\u2019s his second offense and he\u2019s probably going to be spending a year in prison this time. Maybe he\u2019ll learn from his mistakes, but I doubt that.</p> <p>My brother, Cole, however, I think Andrew was right about him. Andrew and I took a plane to North Carolina to visit my mom and while there we went with her to see Cole in prison. He seems different, sincerely remorseful. I could see it in his eyes. He and Andrew hit it off really well. I think maybe my brother will be like the big brother I used to know once he gets out. And with Andrew\u2019s help, I have forgiven Cole for what he did. I\u2019ll always hurt for that family he destroyed when he killed that man in the wreck, but I\u2019ve realized that forgiveness cures a lot of things.</p><p>My mom is still dating Roger. In fact, they\u2019re getting married in the Bahamas in February. I\u2019m so happy for her. I did manage to meet Roger and run him through my douchebag inspection and am happy to say that he passed with honors. Mom is rarely home anymore; he\u2019s always sweeping her off to somewhere.</p><p>And she deserves every bit of it.</p><p>Andrew\u2019s mom and brothers welcomed me into the family with open arms. Asher and I are really close. And regardless of how standoffish I always thought Aidan was, I love him to death. He was never really a jerk to Andrew. Honestly, Andrew deserved it. Aidan and his wife, Michelle, talk to me and about me as if I\u2019m Andrew\u2019s wife. It always makes me blush. More importantly, Andrew and Aidan have been getting along. Before Aidan and Michelle went back to Chicago after a quick visit last week, I just beamed watching them mess with each other and wrestle in the living room. They almost broke the television, but me and Michelle just sat back and laughed and let them show each other up with their alpha male testosterone.</p><p>And today...well, today is going to be a little different than Andrew is used to.</p> <p>I walk into the living room where he\u2019s kicked back on the couch watching Prometheus.</p><p>He reaches out for me as I walk toward him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, shaking my head, \u201cI need you to get up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d He lifts from the couch and reaches up to scratch his head. His hair has started growing back, but he\u2019s still not used to how it feels, especially around the scar where he had the surgery.</p><p>He drops his legs onto the floor to sit upright fully and I step in-between them, running my hands over his head. He kisses one of my wrists and then the other.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d I nod my head back, take his fingers into my hand and he follows me to the bedroom.</p> <p>As always, when I take him into the bedroom he automatically thinks it\u2019s sexual and his sexy green eyes light up like a boy.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to lay down with me for a little while,\u201d I say, taking off all of my clothes.</p><p>He seems a little confused, but it\u2019s so cute.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cYou want me nak*d, too? I\u2019ll definitely get nak*d. What the hell am I asking for?\u201d He starts to strip.</p><p>He lies down next to me and we face each other, pulling our bodies close and tangling our legs. He wraps his arms around me and then his fingers trail across my tattoo of Orpheus that I got two weeks ago. It\u2019s perfect, lined up with Andrew\u2019s flawlessly. When we lie next to each other like this, the two pieces become one.</p><p>\u201cAre you OK, baby?\u201d Andrew gazes at me curiously, his fingertips brushing softly across my ribs.</p><p>I smile and kiss his mouth.</p><p>Then I pull away just a little and take his hand, sliding it to my tattoo, toward the area that extends over onto my belly.</p> <p>\u201cI love my tattoo, baby,\u201d I whisper into the small space between our faces, \u201cbut I think in about seven and a half more months, Orpheus might be a little bit stretched out.\u201d</p><p>Andrew blinks confusedly and it takes him a few seconds to understand what I\u2019m saying.</p><p>His head draws back in a slightly stunned motion and then after a pause, he lifts up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m due in May.\u201d</p><p>His eyes grow wide first; he\u2019s stunned and wordless, but then he manages to say, \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d His hand immediately goes to my stomach.</p><p>His reaction makes me smile even bigger.</p><p>His dimples deepen as he looks down at me and the next thing I know his tongue is in my mouth. His kiss steals my breath away and he lifts me into his arms in the center of the bed.</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he says and now I\u2019m the one stunned wordless. \u201cI was going to ask you tomorrow night when we went out, but I can\u2019t wait now. Marry me.\u201d</p><p>I start to cry and he wraps me in his arms again and kisses me some more.</p><p>When he finally pulls away and looks into my eyes again, I answer: \u201cYes, I\u2019ll marry you, Andrew Parrish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so f**king much,\u201d he says, kissing me again. He grabs my face. \u201cNow let\u2019s have pregnant sex.\u201d</p><p>What can I say? That\u2019s Andrew and I wouldn\u2019t want him to be any other way. </p> </body></html>"]
