And better yet, how had I let him talk me into making a two-hundred dollar bet that he would win? I didn\u2019t know jack about racing and if I had to guess, Dane didn\u2019t either. Sure, his parents bought him a fast, new Porsche for graduation, but that didn\u2019t mean he knew how to race it.</p> <p>I stopped at a red light just before we entered Collinsville, Jessie\u2019s old stomping ground, and looked up in my rearview mirror at him sitting in my backseat. \u201cHey, Jessie, do you know this guy Dane is going to race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I went to school with Hawke at Collinsville. We were in the same class and I\u2019ve helped him out with his car before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke?\u201d I laughed and the only thing I could picture was some guy with a big hooked nose like a bad cartoon. \u201cWhat kind of name is Hawke? His mom is wrong for doing that to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Nick Hawke, but everyone calls him Hawke and the name suits him pretty well. He\u2019s very well known for his predatory nature.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound like a compliment. \u201cA predator? Like a hunter?\u201d</p> <p>I watched Jessie laughing in my mirror. \u201cNo, girls are his chosen prey.\u201d</p><p>Claire twisted around in her seat to look at Jessie. \u201cThat\u2019s funny because I was under the impression that the Collinsville ladies\u2019 man left when you came to East Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Hawke was always the favorite among the chicks. They love his pretty face. I swear he can sweet talk himself into any girl\u2019s pants, so I want you to keep your distance from him. I don\u2019t want you falling for any of his Jedi sex tricks.\u201d</p><p>What tha\u2019? I spun around to look at Jessie sitting in the backseat behind Claire. \u201cDid you just say Jedi sex tricks?\u201d</p><p>Somehow in the midst of spinning around to look at Jessie, I forgot I was the one in the driver\u2019s seat and my foot accidentally slipped from the brake to the accelerator.</p><p>\u201cPayton, look out!\u201d Claire squealed just before I rammed into the back of the car stopped in front of us.</p> <p>The whole thing happened in a split second. Shit. My parents were going to kill me. I didn\u2019t have the best driving record ever, but at least I\u2019d never gotten into an accident. So much for my clean accident-free driving history.</p><p>Jessie leaned toward me in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cYes, I said Jedi sex tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I barked as I looked at the car in front of us to assess the damage but I couldn\u2019t tell anything from inside the car. I watched the driver sling his door open and get out to look at the back of his car before he turned and stared at me with narrowed eyes.</p><p>Oh. My. Gosh. I just mated my Lexus with a P.O.S. Camaro being driven by quite possibly the hottest guy I\u2019d ever seen. The problem other than the obvious? He was pissed about it, like really pissed, and he was staring at me like he could strangle me.</p><p>\u201cUmm, I don\u2019t think you should get out of the car. He looks really mad. Maybe we should just call in the accident and wait on the police to come,\u201d Claire suggested.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ve got this.\u201d Jessie opened the door and was out of my car before Claire could object. He was Claire\u2019s knight in shining armor and because I was the bestie without a boyfriend, he took it upon himself to be my protector as well. That was just Jessie.</p><p>I cracked my window as he walked by. \u201cHey, Kimosabe, do you think you can manage to not take a gunshot wound or knife to the gut? You know you don\u2019t have a really great track record with confrontation.\u201d</p><p>Without looking back, he flipped me off over his shoulder and I looked at Claire. \u201cYou really need to teach your boyfriend some manners.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes as she shook her head. \u201cApparently I\u2019m not very successful at that. I haven\u2019t managed to teach you any over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have manners, but you know my motto. Why be difficult, when with only a little bit of effort, you can be impossible?\u201d</p><p>Claire shifted uncomfortably in her seat as she watched Jessie talking to the guy I just hit. I couldn\u2019t tell anything by the expression on his face as he put his hands on his hips and turned back to look at me in the car. \u201cThere are a lot of other things you could excel at besides being a smart ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry you find my normal behavior to be so highly inappropriate, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, you know that you don\u2019t get to call me that. Jessie is the only one with that privilege.\u201d</p><p>Jessie turned from talking with \u2018hot guy I just slammed into\u2019 and walked around to Claire\u2019s side of the car. She rolled down her window and Jessie leaned in with his arms resting on top of my car as he looked at Claire. \u201cWarning. This is going to go over like a turd in the punchbowl.\u201d</p><p>I leaned around Claire to see Jessie because that clearly meant I was about to be pissed about something. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says that he won\u2019t sue if you\u2019ll go out with him.\u201d He was laughing and Claire punched him with her hand as she mouthed, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jessie and waited for the punchline. \u201cYou need to stop trying to be a clown, Bro, because there\u2019s no circus in town.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up like he was an innocent party, but he was still laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Don\u2019t shoot the messenger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell to the naw,\u201d I announced as I waved my hand back and forth. Now it was me slinging my car door open. \u201cI only need a minute to take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down and play nice, Payton. Keep in mind that you just ran into the back of his car,\u201d Claire graciously reminded me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t play nice when I\u2019m given ultimatums.\u201d I slammed my car door shut and straightened my short skirt before I walked toward Mr. Prince of Nothing Charming in my four inch wedge heels. This was going to be the most fun I\u2019d have all night so I planned to take advantage.</p><p>Damn. The closer I got, the more I realized how great looking this jack off was and frankly it was a little unnerving. His hair was dark and longer than I liked, but it suited him so perfectly the way the untamed tendrils curled and stuck to the perspiration along his forehead. He reached to shove a lock out of his face and his dark chocolate brown eyes pierced mine through his long sooty lashes as though he saw straight through to my soul.</p><p>His shoulders were broad, just the way I like them and his black T-shirt fit his chest tightly so I was able to see how well defined his chest was beneath it. I could tell he worked out. A lot.</p><p>He caught me looking and my own heart betrayed me as it began to race without my permission. My breath was held hostage in the back of my throat as my eyes moved from his chest up to his face and I wondered what his semi-scruffy chin would feel like against my throat as it slid lower.</p><p>Hey, Self! Stop having a lady boner moment! This guy is trying to coerce you into a date by the means of a threat. Don\u2019t crack just because he\u2019s eye candy.</p><p>I stood in front of him with my arms folded and waited for him to say the first word, but he didn\u2019t. Good thing I didn\u2019t mind speaking up. \u201cSo, I have to go out with you if I don\u2019t want to get sued, huh? Are you kiddin\u2019 me, dude? That\u2019s called blackmail and it\u2019s illegal.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a big lopsided seductive grin and I was certain it wasn\u2019t the first time he had used it to get what he wanted. \u201cSome might call it extortion, but I think a date would be adequate compensation for any damage that may have occurred.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at the back of his car and saw that neither of our vehicles had suffered any damage during my unfortunate Jedi sex trick mishap. I could have argued that there was nothing to be compensated for, but I felt like having a little fun with this guy. \u201cDo you have something I could use to write my contact information on?\u201d</p><p>His lopsided grin oozed with satisfaction and turned up on both sides to reveal two of the cutest dimples I had ever seen. He reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell. \u201cDon\u2019t need it. I\u2019ll put you in my phone,\u201d he said as he stood there waiting to hear my digits.</p><p>He was going to add me in his cell phone, today\u2019s version of the Little Black Book. He didn\u2019t see the smirk on my face because he was busy looking at his phone while I called off, \u201c5-5-5-3-9-8-5. Vivian Archer, Attorney at Law. She\u2019s my mother and your attorney may contact her so they may discuss the conditions of your claim against me.\u201d</p><p>Okay, that was a little bit of a lie. My mother had not practiced law in years, but he didn\u2019t have to know that. His sexy little grin faded and mine spread bigger. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have money riding on a race and I\u2019d like to be there to collect my winnings.\u201d</p><p>That lopsided grin made a reappearance. \u201cA race, huh? I heard about that. I hope you bet on Hawke instead of that spoiled rich kid from East Franklin or you can expect to kiss your money good-bye.\u201d</p><p>So, he was a \u2018know it all\u2019 also. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I did not bet on anyone named after a bird. My money is riding on the brand new Porsche.\u201d</p><p>In his fitted black T-shirt and dark washed jeans, he stepped back and leaned against his old black Camaro. He crossed his arms and I suspected he did so to call attention to his muscular, tanned biceps. Mission accomplished.</p><p>\u201cYou placed a bet on a car with no consideration for the driver? That\u2019s known as bad betting, Doll Face. I hope you didn\u2019t wager a lot of money because you are going to lose.\u201d</p><p>I shifted my weight to one leg and kept my arms crossed over my chest. \u201cI have two Benjamins on the Porsche that is going to win.\u201d</p><p>He let out a high pitched whistle. \u201cWow, you seem very confident in your car, so how would you feel about upping your ante since you\u2019re so positive the Porsche will leave Hawke in the dust?\u201d</p><p>I wish I could, but I didn\u2019t have cash on me and I doubted this jerk took credit. \u201cSorry, no can do unless I can swipe my Visa up your ass crack.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and laughed. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect anything like that to come out of a beautiful little delicate mouth of yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His statement alone showed he didn\u2019t know all he thought he did because it was a rare occasion that anything delicate came out of my mouth. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head slightly and rubbed his scruffy chin with his hand, a sure sign that he was intrigued by my less than ladylike statement. \u201cI love surprises.\u201d</p><p>I heard a car honk its horn in the distance. \u201cIn case you forgot, we\u2019re in the middle of the road holding up traffic.\u201d</p> <p>He displayed his lack of concern with the traffic by the wave of his hand in their direction. \u201cThey can wait. I have a proposal for you.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly thought of Demi Moore and Robert Redford in Indecent Proposal. \u201cAnd what might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Doll Face. It\u2019s a decent proposal.\u201d Did he just read my mind? \u201cI\u2019d like to make a side bet with you. If your Porche wins, I\u2019ll give you two-hundred bucks in addition to the winnings you\u2019ll receive from the pot on the bet you have already placed.\u201d</p><p>Wait for it. Wait for it. Where was the catch? \u201cI\u2019m listening, but I didn\u2019t hear what you are proposing I wager?\u201d</p><p>There was that seductive lopsided grin again. \u201cI only ask that you agree to one night with me.\u201d</p> <p>Was he kiddin\u2019 me? There was no way that could be considered a decent proposal. The way he said it was so seductive and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what he meant by \u2018one night with him.\u2019 I was speechless. I was breathless. I was curious.</p><p>His expression became smug as he lifted one eyebrow and said, \u201cI guess you\u2019re not as confident as you claim to be or this would be a no-brainer.\u201d</p><p>Shizzle, that eyebrow lift thing he did was sexy. I mentally pimp slapped myself and doused my face with ice water. I managed to gather some words but I wasn\u2019t sure how convincing I sounded when I squeaked them out. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that my driver is going to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, prove it then. Accept my bet.\u201d</p><p>There it was. He challenged me and got my competitive juices flowing. I knew I shouldn\u2019t agree to it because it would prove nothing, but it sure would be funny to wipe that grin off his face. Plus, it never hurt to make an extra two-hundred bucks. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, so I\u2019ll take your challenge.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand out to me and I looked at it like it was the snake in the Garden of Eden. Once I decided it wasn\u2019t going to bite me, I reached to take it. \u201cCan I safely assume that you will be at the race and that you won\u2019t run off with my money after Dane wins?\u201d</p> <p>He laughed at me and I might have been pissed about it except I got to see his gorgeous dimples again. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any running off with your money, Doll Face. I\u2019ll be looking for you so we can settle up on our night together.\u201d</p><p>His cockiness pissed me off so I was the one to pull my hand free from his. \u201cI think you\u2019ve delighted me long enough with your trash talk. I have a race to watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I have a race to win.\u201d He winked at me before he got into his car. Once inside, he started the engine and it roared loudly, just like a race car. I stood frozen in the middle of the road and watched him pull away as I realized I never asked his name.</p><p>Shit! Was that Nick Hawke and had I just unknowingly been preyed upon by the Sex Tricks Jedi? I did not want to admit it, but I think I had just been bested. I walked with my tail tucked between my legs and got into my car.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Payton?\u201d Claire asked when I didn\u2019t volunteer an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI think Hell just froze over,\u201d I said as I stared ahead at the spot once occupied by a Camaro and its driver.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit!\u201d I heard Jessie groan from the back seat. \u201cI know that look.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and said, \u201cThat was him, wasn\u2019t it? Nick Hawke? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a chance to tell you anything before you jumped out of the car with promises of man handling him. You said that you only needed a minute to straighten him out and I believed you,\u201d Jessie reminded me.</p><p>I held the bridge of my nose and Claire recognized that as my signature move when I was stressed. \u201cYou\u2019re pinching your nose. What\u2019s wrong? What did he say to you?\u201d</p><p>I felt stupid and played and I wasn\u2019t telling them about my ignorant bet with Nick Hawke unless I had to, meaning if I lost.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Claire. Let\u2019s just go watch this race and get it over with.\u201d And hope Dane drove that Porsche like he stole it.</p><p>2 Not So Fast, Doll Face</p><p>Nick</p><p>Damn, that girl excited me. She was one hot piece of ass and I couldn\u2019t resist watching her in my rearview mirror as I drove away from her while she stood staring after me. Not only was she hot, she was entirely different from every other girl I\u2019d ever met and I was thoroughly fascinated by the unusual way she was unaffected by my interest in her.</p><p>I would have gladly blown that race off without a moment\u2019s wesitation to work on getting into those panties, but I knew I would be seeing her at the race soon enough. She would be watching me and hoping I wouldn\u2019t win. Something about knowing she would be there rooting against me intrigued me and the challenge she presented fascinated me beyond simple curiosity.</p><p>Because of our run in at the red light, I got to the dead end road we all referred to as \u2018The Strip\u2019 later than normal. Everyone was waiting on me and onlookers were lined up along each side of the road. I looked at my clock and saw that there was still fifteen minutes before all bets were closed, but I had already made the only wager that counted in my book.</p><p>I immediately saw the new black Porsche in position at the start. I admit it was a total badass, but it wasn\u2019t a 911 as I expected. It was a Cayman and I smiled because I knew I had this one in the bag.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the money making me smile, although a cool grand would hit the spot. It was the beautiful blonde with the light golden brown eyes the color of honey that provoked my good mood. Honey was a flavor I liked very much.</p><p>I realized that I had not gotten her name because I had gotten so hot and bothered by her, but that was okay. I wasn\u2019t letting her get away again without making good on the night she would owe me.</p><p>I stopped dead even with the Porsche on the starting lineup. I got out to meet the rich kid I was going to race and wondered if the object of my new fascination was here to support him or strictly here for the prospect of making a little cash.</p><p>He offered his hand and I took it as I said, \u201cNick Hawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDane Wickam.\u201d He greeted me with a smile and I found that unusual because my opponent and I usually both played the tough guy card. This kid was different; he seemed nice.</p><p>\u201cSweet ride,\u201d I complimented. It was fancy and expensive, but it was no match for the illegal bells and whistles I had added to the motor in my Camaro.</p><p>He shrugged as though it was no big deal. \u201cThanks. It was a graduation gift from the parents.\u201d</p><p>Wow, that was some graduation gift. I didn\u2019t even get a \u2018congratulations\u2019 from my old man, but I didn\u2019t have time to dwell on my dad\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for long because I felt arms creep around my waist from behind. I turned my head to look over my shoulder to identify the friendly female and saw Samantha Hodges. Shit, I had forgotten about her and the plans we had made.</p><p>Samantha was like a song on a playlist I always skipped, but never deleted. She was my permanent backup plan for a booty call.</p><p>She and I had plans to get together after the race, which translated in Hawke language as her dropping her panties for me. It seemed like a good idea when I made the date with her, but it couldn\u2019t seem less interesting now that I had met Doll Face.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to give my Hawke a good luck kiss before the race,\u201d she said as she locked her fingers above the waist of my jeans and rubbed her body against my back.</p><p>I nudged her arms from my waist and stepped away because I wasn\u2019t into her at the moment. I wasn\u2019t cool with a kiss and I sure wasn\u2019t into her one-sided public display of affection. \u201cNah, I\u2019m not cool with you doing that in front of everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she pouted. \u201cMaybe a congratulatory kiss afterwards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d My answer was robotic as I searched \u2018The Strip\u2019 for any sign of the mysterious girl I wanted to get with tonight. I didn\u2019t see her anywhere but I zeroed in on her Lexus parked in the distance and I smiled when I confirmed that she hadn\u2019t skipped on me.</p><p>\u201cI have something special for you tonight,\u201d Samantha promised seductively.</p><p>I\u2019m sure she did since she chased me relentlessly, but I couldn't have been less interested as I continued my search for Jessie\u2019s lovely chauffeur. I backed further away from her and sat on the hood of my car. \u201cI told you we would see.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I was being rude, but she was distracting me and it was irritating.</p><p>\u201cHawke, I can tell that you\u2019re nervous about the race, but you\u2019ll be in a better mood after you win. I\u2019m going to see to it personally,\u201d Samantha promised as she leaned between my parted legs and rubbed her body against my crotch.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I warned. I didn\u2019t want her, but that didn\u2019t mean my body wouldn\u2019t respond to stimulus like that.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I just want to give you a little taste of what\u2019s to come later.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head away from Samantha and my eyes found the one I sought. She was standing next to Jessie, his girlfriend and my opponent. I watched her body language carefully, looking for any show of affection toward Dane Wickam. When I failed to detect a sign of attraction of her part, I was glad and I found myself smiling in her direction.</p><p>As I stood there feeling triumphant, she turned to look at me and made of face of disgust when she saw Samantha bumping and grinding me on the hood of my car. This chick was going to ruin my chance with Doll Face if I wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>I reached for her hips and pushed her away. \u201cI need to concentrate on the race, so I\u2019ll catch you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Hawke. I\u2019ll wait for you afterwards,\u201d she called out as I walked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I joined a group of friends from Collinsville and made small talk about my car while I waited for race time. As I stood with my buddies, I occasionally looked in the direction of Jessie\u2019s friend and was disappointed to see that she wasn\u2019t checking me out.</p><p>\u201cBets will be closing in three minutes,\u201d I heard my brother, Jake, yell out and I knew that was my cue to start heading to my car.</p><p>I had to walk by Doll Face on the way and I couldn\u2019t resist speaking to her so I could look into her honey eyes again. \u201cI forgot to introduce myself earlier. I\u2019m Nick Hawke, but all of my friends call me Hawke.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t give me the polite return of telling me her name so I prompted her. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>I think she was seriously contemplating how she could withhold that information from me but came up empty handed so she finally answered, \u201cPayton Archer.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I mentally repeated her name in my head. \u201cWell, Payton Archer, it\u2019s almost time for the race. How do ya\u2019 feel about a good luck kiss?\u201d</p><p>I saw a gleam enter her eyes. \u201cI think a good luck kiss is an excellent idea.\"</p><p>Wow. That was easy and her receptive response was completely unexpected but then I figured out why. I watched her walk over to my opponent and tap him on the shoulder. When he turned around, she put her arms up over his shoulders and kissed him hard, causing the crowd to erupt into cheers and cat calls.</p> <p>When she finished, she turned back to me. \u201cI figured it was only fair for Dane to have a good luck kiss since you got a good luck hump on the hood of your car.\u201d</p><p>This girl was unbelievable and like nothing I had ever come across. I watched her strut to the roadside in her short skirt and jacked up heels and I knew winning this race had nothing to do with the money anymore; I had to win this race so I could have my night with her.</p><p>I got into my car and watched all the spectators take their places at the finish line. Jake stood between our cars with a white flag in his hand and I watched for him to lower it as a signal to take off.</p><p>When the white flag dropped, I slammed my foot onto the accelerator a little too suddenly and briefly got sideways, giving the Porsche a jumpstart on me. It was a stupid beginner\u2019s mistake on my part but once I got straightened out I laid the hammer down and we were neck and neck for the next 700 yards until I flipped the nitrous switch. With only 100 yards to spare, I cruised ahead of the Porsche and crossed the finish line as the winner.</p><p>When I got out of the car, a congratulatory crowd rushed toward me and I was so bombarded I couldn\u2019t find Payton in the sea of faces. I searched the crowd, but knew she wouldn\u2019t be pushing through to find me, so I shoved my way toward Dane since I suspected that was where she would be and I was right.</p><p>She saw me coming toward her and tried to escape by mixing into the crowd, but I was faster. With her back turned to me, I grabbed her around the waist and pulled her close until her back was pressed against my chest. In her hellaciously tall heels, her ear was level with my mouth and I leaned forward to whisper, \u201cNot so fast, Doll Face. We had a bet and you owe me.\u201d</p> <p>God, she smelled great. It was some kind of fruity mix I couldn\u2019t identify so I placed my nose in her hair and breathed in deeply, but then I quickly pulled away because she turned to peer at me over her shoulder. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s Payton, not Doll Face. And second, you misrepresented yourself when you made that bet with me. You did not tell me you were Nick Hawke, therefore you tricked me into making that wager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're cute when you're mad.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away. \u201cThen you\u2019re about to see me look downright adorable.\"</p><p>I pulled her closer. \u201cI may not have told you who I was, but there was no trickery involved. I would have given you your two-hundred bucks if I had lost. This was an upstanding bet whether you like it or not, so are you going to give me the night you owe me?</p><p>I decided I faired a better chance of her feeling guilty and saying \u2018yes\u2019 if she was looking me in my eyes, so I spun her around to face me. \u201cTonight works for me.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her face, but I watched it closely as she thought about her answer. I saw a hint of a smile and then she lifted her eyes to mine. Just as she opened her mouth to give me her verdict, I felt Samantha\u2019s arms slide around my waist again.</p><p>\u201cHey, Hawke. You ready to go so I can give you your grand prize?\u201d Samantha blurted out and then not so innocently added, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Who\u2019s your friend here?\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth and squeezed my eyes shut tightly. I might not know Payton Archer well, but that wasn\u2019t a requirement for me to predict that Samantha had just blown this deal for me.</p> <p>\u201cHello, my name is Justa Leavin\u2019 so feel free to put your grand prize up on Poppycock here.\u201d She shook her head in disgust and I watched her back as she walked away.</p><p>It was probably useless to attempt any kind of damage control after what Samantha just pulled, but I couldn\u2019t help myself. Payton Archer wouldn\u2019t be swayed easily so I had my work cut out for me, but I was prepared to do it because I was going to have my night with this girl.</p><p>3 Long Nights and Long Islands</p><p>Payton</p><p>Ugh! How humiliating was that? I was about to tell that jerk that I would keep my end of the bargain and go out with him and then that \u2018ho\u2019 started haunching on him all up in my face. I adamantly reminded myself that it was a stupid bet he tricked me into, so technically I didn\u2019t owe him anything, right?</p><p>Jessie and Claire were busy talking to some of Jessie\u2019s old classmates and I wanted to be alone, so I took the opportunity to hide out in my car and lick my wounds. I sat in my car and looked toward the direction of the finish line but all I could see was a crowd of people looking to collect their earnings and I definitely didn\u2019t fall into that category.</p><p>I reached for my iPod and turned on \u201cAll The Same To Me\u201d by Anya Marina and then rolled my windows down because it was a little stuffy in my car. I shut my eyes after I leaned my head back against the seat and I tapped my index and middle fingernails against the armrest to the beat of the music as I waited for Jessie and Claire.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to, but I couldn\u2019t manage to stop thinking about the way that girl had her hands all over Nick Hawke. She looked so familiar with his body. It was disgusting how he was so obviously screwing her, yet he pursued me openly for her to see. Jessie was right about him. He was a full on Playah.</p><p>I was three songs in when Claire opened the passenger door and startled me. \u201cFinally! I thought you\u2019d never come on. I\u2019m ready to blow this popsicle stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnxious to get out of here, are we?\u201d Jessie asked as he slid into my backseat and I heard the amusement in his voice. I bet Nick told him about the whole bet thing and how he tricked me.</p><p>I refused to look at either of them and didn\u2019t respond to Jessie because I didn\u2019t want to have that conversation. I pulled out of my parking place onto the road toward the only way out and turned the music up loudly as we fell into the line of traffic leading away from \u2018The Strip.\u2019</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap. I was startled and jumped when I heard knuckles knocking on my driver\u2019s side window. I turned to see Nick Hawke motioning for me to let my window down. My brain screamed for me to drive away but my insides pleaded for me to lower the window. I\u2019m positive I chose wrong, but I sided with my guts and pushed the button to lower my window a few inches.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I rudely asked through the three inch crack in my window.</p><p>He motioned with his head toward the back door. \u201cUnlock it. I\u2019m riding with you.\u201d</p><p>I did that forehead scrunching thing my mom always told me not to do because it would cause me premature wrinkles. \u201cRiding where with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the club in Franklin,\u201d he answered.</p><p>How did he know where we were going? I looked from Claire to Jessie and gave him my What the Hell look. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talkin\u2019 about, Kimosabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invited Nick to meet us at Shenanigan\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it isn\u2019t so,\u201d I gritted through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cJessie hasn\u2019t seen Nick in a while,\u201d Claire explained. \u201cThey want to catch up.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. I knew what he wanted to catch and it didn\u2019t involve anything with his long lost pal. Against my better judgment, I unlocked the door and he smiled victoriously at me before getting into my backseat.</p><p>Nick and Jessie made small talk on the drive to the club and I listened as they laughed and talked about old times at Collinsville. I could hear the amusement in Nick\u2019s voice as he recalled a particular stunt Jessie pulled on the librarian when they were in sixth grade. I knew I would be able to see his dimples again if only I lifted my eyes to look in my rearview mirror, but I forced myself to not do it because I refused to expose myself like that.</p><p>We entered the club and found a table near the dance floor. It only took a minute for my eyes to find ex-hole, Cooper, dancing with Allie Bumphis and I felt my heart speed like a rocket. Why had I agreed to come here with Jessie and Claire? I knew they would be here together.</p><p>Claire saw the happy couple on the dance floor and placed a supportive hand on my arm. \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I did but I wasn\u2019t going to ruin Claire and Jessie\u2019s good time because of my own stupidity. \u201cNo, I want to stay because I need to have a good time. I think it will take my mind off what happened.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to see Cooper and Allie coming off of the dance floor in our direction. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m going to visit the ladies\u2019 room for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I pushed my way through the crowd and into the bathroom. I stood in front of a mirror and pulled my lip gloss from my bag and gave my lips a fresh coat of shine as I thought about the ultimatum Cooper had given me. It was humiliating and hurtful, but I\u2019d never admit that to anyone but Jessie and Claire.</p><p>I perfected the gloss on my cupid\u2019s bow with my finger and then stood a little taller. \u201cI can do this,\u201d I said to my reflection. I didn\u2019t have a choice; I had to do it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I returned to find Cooper and Allie sitting at our table. Cooper\u2019s arm was resting possessively around the back of Allie\u2019s chair and I wondered if that was something he did often or if it was because Mr. Sex on a Stick was sitting with us.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jessie whispered when I sat next to him and Claire.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d I lied as I gave him my best faux smile. It was weird how Jessie had fallen into the role of my protector. He was like a big brother to me, only much more. The guy I once regarded as a tatted up Collinsville skank was now my best friend too.</p> <p>He leaned over so no one would hear him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>What was I supposed to do? \u201cI have to get over them being together because they\u2019re an item and it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to change anytime soon. I can\u2019t keep pretending I have to leave every time I see them somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Claire leaned over to be part of the conversation. \u201cWill you tell us if you change your mind and want to go?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYes, Mother. Yes, Father. I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u2018Single Ladies\u2019 came on and a flock of girls headed for the dance floor. I usually begged Claire to dance with me, but tonight was different because I didn\u2019t have my usual good mood or a drink in my hand.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s your turn to drive tonight. I don\u2019t want you to worry about it because I\u2019ve got it covered. I want you and Claire to have a good time,\u201d Jessie offered. \u201cWhat do y'all want to drink?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if it was the tats or what, but Jessie never got carded anywhere and he always got us as many drinks as we wanted. Claire ordered her usual Cosmopolitan and I thought for a second before I knew the only cure for what ailed me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got hers,\u201d Nick announced from across the table as he stared at me. \u201cI\u2019ll get you anything you want.\u201d</p><p>It felt more like a challenge than an offer. Was I imagining his underlying tone or was he simply offering to buy me a drink? I finally answered, \u201cA Long Island.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mistake the big brother look Jessie shot me. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a good idea? You know it doesn\u2019t take much for those to put you on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten and that\u2019s what I\u2019m shooting for.\u201d He didn\u2019t give me any further argument, but I knew he would be watching me like a hawk the rest of the night.</p> <p>The guys returned with our drinks and Nick chose to sit in the chair next to me instead of across the table. \u201cYour drink, Milady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I politely said before I took a long suck on the straw.</p><p>Nick watched me suck down a quarter of my Long Island. \u201cI believe you are looking to be on your ass or your back tonight.\u201d</p><p>I immediately became defensive with the mention of me on my back. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t ever be on my back for you. Sorry if that\u2019s why you bought me the drink or why you came with us.\u201d</p><p>I could tell that took him back. \u201cI came because I was invited by a friend, one I\u2019ve known longer than you have, I might add. I also just won a lot of cash so I wanted to celebrate. As for the drink, I bought it for you out of courtesy. I was trying to be a chivalrous gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you no matter your motive,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>Nick leaned a little closer to me. \u201cWhat have I done to make you question my motive?\u201d</p><p>I was thankful the music was loud enough that Jessie and Claire couldn\u2019t hear the conversation between me and Nick. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it was the way you tried to blackmail me into going out with you or maybe it was the way you tricked me into making a bet to quote spend one night with you unquote. I\u2019m not sure I even know what one night with you means. It could even be the way that girl was all over you at \u2018The Strip\u2019 like she knew every inch of your body or maybe it was the way you grabbed me around my waist and pulled me against you like you had done it a million times. Maybe it was the way you so expertly whispered against my ear to bring chills all over my body.\u201d</p> <p>That lopsided grin returned. \u201cSo you liked it when I pulled you close against me and whispered in your ear?\u201d</p><p>Hell yeah, I liked it, but I wasn\u2019t telling him that. \u201cI think you\u2019re hearing what you want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I am because I definitely want to hear that you liked being close to me, but I\u2019m also hearing that you\u2019re jealous of Samantha.\u201d</p><p>This guy was unbelievably arrogant. \u201cNow, you\u2019re really dreaming,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to get together after the race, but I ditched her to come here with you.\u201d He said it so matter of fact, like he deserved some kind of reward for ditching the girl with a mattress tied to her back.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to mess up you getting laid tonight,\u201d I said sarcastically.</p><p>He looked at me seductively before he turned his beer up for a gulp. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>What was that supposed to mean?</p><p>Cooper and Allie headed back to the dance floor and Claire leaned over as Jessie stood up. \u201cOur song is playing so we\u2019re going to dance if you think you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>They always had to dance to that sappy song. \u201cSure, take your time.\u201d I nodded toward Nick. \u201cI have the Jedi here to keep me company.\u201d</p><p>I expected Nick to ask me what my Jedi crack was all about but he didn\u2019t. He leaned back in his chair. \u201cSo, they\u2019re in love, huh?\u201d</p><p>I put my straw to my lips and took another big gulp. Three-quarters down and all was still well. I was going to have to drink faster than this. \u201cYep, they\u2019re in love and it\u2019s the real thing. I predict that they\u2019ll be Mr. and Mrs. within two years.\u201d</p><p>And I was going to be the ceaseless third wheel. I wondered if they\u2019d invite me to go with them on their honeymoon. I put my drink to my lips and finished it off.</p><p>\u201cWant another?\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>\u201cUmm, yes please,\u201d I said as I reached for my purse to get some cash since I had gone by the ATM on the way to the club.</p><p>\u201cNope, I\u2019ve got it covered. Another Long Island?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a friendly smile because I felt like I owed him that much. \u201cYes, please. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on who makes it, you know Long Islands are almost all alcohol, right?\u201d</p><p>I called off the ingredients. \u201cVodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila, Triple Sec, Sour Mix and a splash of Coke, depending on who makes it.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as though he was thoroughly entertained. \u201cHmm. Something else I didn\u2019t expect to come out of your delicate mouth. You\u2019re just full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you knew me, you wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised.\u201d</p><p>He studied me like I was some kind of ancient mystery and I wanted to ask him what he was thinking but I didn\u2019t because I was afraid he might actually tell me. When the awkward silence and stare passed, he got up from the table. \u201cBe right back. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>I sat at our table waiting for Nick to come back with our drinks and watched the couples on the dance floor. When Jessie and Claire\u2019s song ended, another sappy love song replaced it and I knew the lovebirds wouldn\u2019t be coming off the floor before it was over.</p><p>Like a guard dog, Jessie monitored me closely from where he danced with Claire. He took notice of me sitting alone and gave me his questioning thumb up signal. He seemed satisfied by my nod and reassuring smile so he returned his concentration to my best friend in his arms.</p><p>Nick had been gone for a while, so I looked toward the bar to see if he was still waiting in line for our drinks and I saw him talking to a girl in a revealing halter top with her boobs all pushed up. He was buying her a drink and I caught myself huffing as I thought about how he was such a Playah. It oozed from his every pore the way he stood leaning onto the bar and then it hit me. He really wasn\u2019t kidding when he told me that I wasn\u2019t getting in the way of him getting laid tonight.</p><p>I turned my head in disgust and a few minutes later Nick returned to our table with our drinks. \u201cHere\u2019s your deuce.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but it pissed me off that he was lining up an appointment to get laid while he was buying a drink for me. The more I thought about it, the more pissed I got but I didn\u2019t say anything because this guy didn\u2019t owe me monogamy.</p><p>I simply put my straw to my lips and began to suck down my second Long Island.</p><p>I saw Nick watching my glass. \u201cHey, you might want to take it easy there or some guy might be getting a drunk dial later tonight.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if it was me or if the alcohol was beginning to talk, but I didn\u2019t have Claire here to be my filter. \u201cWhy would you care if I drunk dialed some guy? Jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mind because you\u2019re mine tonight and I don\u2019t plan to share you with anyone.\u201d</p><p>4 Truly Madly Deeply</p><p>Nick</p><p>There. Let\u2019s see what she thought about that.</p><p>I managed to shock her and I enjoyed her mixed expression of anger, excitement and bewilderment, but my amusement was short lived because she didn\u2019t hesitate in her retaliation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you. Why would you want to waste your time with me because it\u2019s clear that you plan on adding yourself to Miss Black Halter Top\u2019s list of suspects for her next pregnancy scare? Is collecting your debt really that important to you?\u201d</p><p>Miss Black Halter Top? Oh, she was talking about my brother\u2019s girlfriend, Gabbi. I opened my mouth to explain, but didn\u2019t get the opportunity because the two deliriously happy couples returned to our table from the dance floor.</p><p>Jessie looked at Payton and then gave me what I recognized as a warning. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely nothing is going on here,\u201d Payton quickly answered as she watched my eyes for a reaction. She lifted her drink and gave her straw another big suck and I noticed she was over half finished with it. She was definitely drinking to forget something or somebody and I wanted to know which.</p><p>Jessie leaned over to say something to his girlfriend and I took the opportunity to straighten Payton out about Gabbi. \u201cFunny, I sort of thought something was going on here and I don\u2019t mean with my brother\u2019s girlfriend, the girl wearing the black halter top.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I watched her eyes and waited for her reaction, but again we were interrupted when Dane Wickam walked up and sat at our table. \u201cHey, Hawke, I didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to you after the race. Nice job blowing the doors off of my Porsche. Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t recall ever being congratulated by an opponent before. \u201cThanks, Wickam, but you had me for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I turned back to Payton and watched her look in every direction, except for mine, causing her long blonde hair to dance across her shoulders and upper back. I wanted to reach out to touch it just to see if it was as soft as it looked and wondered if she would be surprised if I did.</p> <p>\u201cDane, I feel like dancing,\u201d Payton said as she reached for his hand with one of hers and used the other to bring her drink to her glossy lips so she could finish it off.</p><p>\u201cBreak Your Heart\u201d by Taio Cruz and Ludacris was playing and I was glad because I didn\u2019t want Dane holding her close during a slow song. I watched them walk toward the dance floor and Jessie leaned toward me with a warning. \u201cDon\u2019t look at her like that. She\u2019s not your kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>Who was this guy? He couldn\u2019t be the Jessie Boone I knew. \u201cNot my kind of girl, Boone? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton doesn\u2019t do one night stands like the chicks you\u2019re used to. She\u2019s a different kind of caliber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m looking for a one night stand?\u201d</p> <p>Jessie laughed at me. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for a long time and I know you, Hawke. You\u2019re always looking for a piece but she\u2019s not gonna be it.\u201d</p><p>Things were becoming more and more suspicious of Jessie being the one Payton was trying to forget with the liquor. \u201cWhy are you being so protective of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton has been Claire\u2019s best friend forever.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cNow, she has become one of my best friends and I protect her from guys like you. She\u2019s nursing a wound and she doesn\u2019t need a Playah like you to add fuel to the fire.\u201d</p><p>I watched her dancing with Dane. \u201cI can see that she\u2019s different. I knew it the second she got out of her fancy car and strutted toward me in the middle of the road where she plowed into my car.\u201d I turned back to Jessie. \u201cI want to ask her out on a real date. What\u2019s it gonna take for you to be okay with that since you seem to be her acting bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in disapproval. \u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 that would make me be okay with that.\u201d</p><p>The arrogant bastard acted as though he was so much different from me. Before this Claire chick came along, I distinctly remember that he was just like me. \u201cCome on, Boone. I promise I won\u2019t try anything with her.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head again. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t trust you with her.\u201d</p><p>He was being such a pain in the ass. \u201cShe\u2019s a big girl and you\u2019re not her daddy. She can make up her own mind about going out with me.\u201d</p><p>He sat back and crossed his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve already warned her about you so she\u2019ll never agree.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that he had cock blocked me wasn\u2019t news. \u201cYeah, I gathered that from the way she questions my every move.\u201d</p><p>He looked pleased with himself. \u201cGood. That means she listened to me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need his permission. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you think or what you told her. I\u2019m asking her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had two Long Islands in under an hour. She doesn\u2019t handle liquor well and she\u2019s going to be trashed any minute so I\u2019m giving you the courtesy of a warning. You and I are friends, but we won\u2019t be for long if you take advantage of her. You got it?\u201d</p><p>I held my palms up innocently. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, man. I give you my word that I won\u2019t take advantage of her. I will not try to get into her panties tonight.\u201d Tonight was the only promise I would make regarding that.</p> <p>I looked up and saw Claire sitting down at our table. \u201cYou\u2019ll have me to answer to if you do. Then, I\u2019ll turn you over to this one and I promise she\u2019ll make it very painful for you.\u201d</p><p>I heard a slow song beginning to play and I killed the rest of my beer before I was on my feet stalking toward Payton and Dane. \u201cI\u2019m cutting in.\u201d</p><p>Dane shrugged and looked at Payton for her permission, letting me know they were definitely only friends.</p><p>She\u2019ll rolled her eyes and shook her head. \u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Dane let go of Payton and I stepped closer to take her in my arms. She looped her arms loosely around my neck as I placed my hands on her hips and we began to sway to the beat of the music. She peered up into my eyes and with one look I could tell the alcohol was beginning to hit her pretty hard because she had that drunken glaze coming over her eyes.</p><p>She leaned back a little so she could focus on my face better. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re twice as hot when I\u2019m seeing double.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d be thrilled to hear that if she wasn\u2019t trashed or if I hadn\u2019t promised Jessie I wouldn\u2019t get into her panties tonight. \u201cDrinks kicking in, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe they are and it\u2019s \u2018bout time. I have things I need to forget.\u201d</p><p>Jessie said that she was nursing a wound and I wondered what idiot could have been stupid enough to hurt this beautiful girl.</p><p>She tightened her grip around my neck a little more and hung on tighter although I suspected it was more for support than flirtation. \u201cI love this song.\u201d</p><p>I had not been paying it any attention, so I carefully listened, but didn\u2019t recognize it. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard it before. What\u2019s the name of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Heaven\u2019 by The Fire Theft.\u201d</p><p>I listened to it a little more. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool song. I like it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back a little and searched my face with unsteady vision. \u201cWhy did you ask me to dance? I\u2019ve been a total bitch to you since the moment we met.\u201d</p><p>Because I can\u2019t resist your beauty or your smart ass mouth, but mostly because you intrigue me. \u201cYou\u2019re different, nothing like the girls I usually go for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve always been different. I tried being normal once. It was the worst five minutes of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Stuff like that is what I really like about you. You\u2019re so damn honest about who you are and you aren\u2019t afraid to call me out on my bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Man, I liked that about her. Probably more than I should. She hadn\u2019t made tonight easy for me. Simply trying to talk to her had proven to be difficult and I guessed that the alcohol could be thanked for the friendly nature of the conversation we were currently having.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me, Saint Nick. I\u2019ve never been afraid to call bullshit on anyone.\u201d</p><p>Saint Nick? I felt my entire body stiffen. I hated being called that, but she made it sound so sweetly intoxicating the way it rolled off of her tongue and I almost forgot the painful reason I hated it so much.</p><p>I stopped dancing and stared at her face looking for the answer. \u201cWhy did you call me Saint Nick? I thought I was Jedi or Poppycock or something like that.\u201d I tried to be casual about it and I hoped she couldn\u2019t see the way she shook me to my core.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not near as funny if I have to explain it. I was being a smart ass because you\u2019re the total opposite of a Saint, or at least that\u2019s what Jessie told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to be called that,\u201d I whispered, but I wasn\u2019t sure she heard me and I wasn\u2019t sure I meant for her to. I reached for a lock of hair in her face and pushed it away. As I stared at her, I thought she couldn\u2019t be more beautiful than she was in that moment, but then she smiled as she began to sway to the music again and proved my whole theory wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d I blurted it out without thinking and was shocked by my own absentmindedness. Where had that come from? I had never told a girl anything like that before.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word as she stared into my eyes with a determination to figure me out and the thing she thought I was hiding.</p><p>This was a night of firsts for me. I told a girl she was beautiful and I meant it. Now, I was about to ask her out on a date because I liked her and she was interesting, not because I was planning to get her in my backseat.</p><p>\u201cI would really like to take you out. I know Jessie has told you to be leery of me, but I promise to be on my best behavior. I\u2019ll be a saint and you can choose where we go and what we do. Dinner? Movie? You name it. We\u2019ll do anything you want.\u201d</p><p>Pleading with a girl for a date wasn\u2019t my scene and it sort of made me feel like a loser, but then I realized how ridiculous I looked standing there hoping she\u2019d agree. She searched my face for a moment and then whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I just thought I felt ridiculous before. Now, I felt downright humiliated. \u201cNo? You\u2019re turning me down just like that without any consideration? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like this is the first time you\u2019ve ever been told \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy a girl, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She stopped swaying and looked me straight in my eyes. She was trashed, but managed to not slur too badly. \u201cHow many girls have you gone through?\u201d</p><p>My experience with chicks had always made me proud and maybe even a little arrogant, but suddenly I wasn\u2019t so thrilled by the notches on my bedpost because I could feel that it was about to cost me this girl. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrugged, feeling defeated.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I can\u2019t go out with you. I\u2019m not going to become a number you can\u2019t identify. It\u2019s not what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><p>I was sure I didn\u2019t have a shot in hell at being what she wanted, yet I needed the confirmation in case I was wrong. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was breathtakingly beautiful. \u201cI want truly, madly, deeply.\u201d</p><p>Oh, of course. She wanted lovey dovey. She wanted her kisses to be slow and romantic instead of fast and needy. She wanted everlasting love, which was something I didn\u2019t offer. Love was overrated and nature used it to kick us in the gut and trick us into reproducing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want what Claire has with Jessie.\u201d</p><p>I should run from any girl openly telling me she wanted love, but I found I didn\u2019t want to. There was something about her that drew me in and wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>If I was going to talk her into going out with me, I needed her to see that I was no different than Jessie used to be. This could quite possibly play out in my favor. \u201cJessie and I aren\u2019t that different. I can promise you that he couldn\u2019t give Claire a number if she asked for it.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled the sweetest smile and I wondered what had crossed her mind. \u201cMaybe not, but she\u2019s the only number that counts. His last.\u201d</p><p>I pushed another stubborn strand of hair from her face. \u201cJessie and Claire had to start somewhere, right? I\u2019m sure there was a first date somewhere in the mix.\u201d</p><p>I knew it would be laying it on a little thick, but I went ahead and threw in, \u201cBesides, you don\u2019t know that you aren\u2019t my only number that counts. Maybe you\u2019re my last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She shifted her jaw to the side. \u201cYou\u2019re not as bad as Jessie said. You\u2019re much, much worse.\u201d</p><p>Jessie may have cock blocked me, but I knew how to manipulate this situation. I was educated on how to get the girl because I had done it so many times. I also knew that the alcohol was getting to her a little more and I shamelessly planned to use that to my advantage. I slid my palms from the sides of her hips to the small of her back and pulled her closer. I leaned in to her ear and whispered against it because she had already as much as admitted how much it turned her on.</p> <p>\u201cWe have this crazy attraction thing going on and we didn\u2019t even have to work for it. It just happened naturally. It\u2019s more work to keep it under control than it is to just go with it. What if we\u2019re perfect for each other and we missed out on the opportunity because we didn\u2019t try things out? That would be a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give me an immediate \u2018no,' so I took that as a good sign and continued my attempt to persuade her. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is a chance. One date and I vow to be on my best behavior. Cross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Our slow song ended and \u2018Scream\u2019 by Usher came on, but I didn\u2019t let her go as we stood in the middle of the dance floor and I waited for her to agree.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d That was all she gave me as she pushed away from me and then I watched her as she left me on the dance floor without looking back.</p><p>5 Sweet Dreams Doll Face</p><p>Payton</p> <p>Gah, I could hurl at any moment. Yeah, I definitely drank those Long Islands too fast, but I couldn't blame Cooper entirely for this whirlwind drunk. What started as a mission to forget about him quickly turned into something else. Something called Nick Hawke and I wasn\u2019t ready for that so soon after Cooper.</p><p>When I stumbled back to our table, Jessie took one look at my face and knew something had happened between me and his Collinsville friend. \u201cWhat did Hawke do to you?\u201d</p><p>He really did assume the worst out of his friend and I almost felt obligated to defend him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything except ask me out on a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you turned him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, I did.\u201d I nodded as I answered and that was a mistake because it made me feel like I needed to worship the porcelain god. My alcohol level had climbed suddenly and the room began to spin so I reached for the table to steady myself. I shouldn\u2019t have had those Long Islands that fast. My mistake.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Claire asked as she got up from her seat to stand at my side and I grabbed her arm for support.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m going to step outside for a minute and get a little fresh air.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to be in this club when my stomach contents decided to blow.</p><p>Jessie got up from the table to act as my escort. \u201cYou\u2019re not going outside to a club parking lot alone, so don\u2019t even think about it. You\u2019re not badass enough for that no matter what you think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d I heard Nick volunteer from behind me. \u201cStay and have a good time with your girl.\u201d</p><p>No way. I didn\u2019t want Nick with me when I blew chunks. \u201cI really don\u2019t want you to be a witness to what\u2019s probably going to happen out there, Dude.\u201d</p><p>He took me by the arm and started walking me toward the exit without my permission or objection. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider it a bonding experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing you should consider yourself is warned because I\u2019m predicting this will get ugly,\u201d Once outside, I was a little disoriented, but Nick led me in the direction of my car. \u201cIt\u2019s so freakin\u2019 hot out here. All I want to do is sit in my car with some cold air blowing on my face. I think that will make me feel better.\u201d</p><p>I used my keyless entry to unlock my car and Nick opened my door for me. I started the engine and turned the A/C to full blast with the vents aimed right at my face. My hair was blowing wildly in every direction but I didn\u2019t try to tame it. I was just too freakin\u2019 sick to care.</p><p>He walked around to the passenger side and sat next to me. He turned to look at me as my hair blew wildly. \u201cYou\u2019re wasted and you better not try to drive tonight or I\u2019ll beat you black and blue.\u201d</p><p>Did this guy think I was suicidal? \u201cI may be drunk but I\u2019m not stupid. Jessie isn\u2019t drinking because he\u2019s our driver tonight. It was my turn to be the DD but apparently he thought I needed to get trashed and take a vacation from my pathetic life for a brief moment in time.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and turned his passenger side vents in my direction. \u201cYeah, what\u2019s up with that? Anyone can see that you\u2019re looking to drown the thoughts of someone. Who\u2019s the lucky bastard?\u201d</p><p>I leaned in closer to the vents in the center. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer to me toward the center of the car and I\u2019d almost swear he sniffed my hair. \u201cLet me guess. Some dumb ass hurt you and you\u2019re drinking to forget about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that. I got dumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out of his mind, whoever he is. Who should I be thanking?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but Nick had this way of making me want to tell him what had gone down with Cooper. \u201cMy Ex-holes\u2019s name is Cooper Sinclaire. He was the guy sitting at our table hanging all over the brunette.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re shitting me, right? You mean that pansy sitting at the table with us? You can\u2019t mean that you got dumped by a guy that chose to dress in Polo khakis and a Polo button-up for a dance club? Doll Face, his plaid shirt is pastel. I said pastel and he\u2019s wearing loafers. I bet he\u2019s even wearing lacy panties under his wrinkle-free twills.\u201d</p><p>I pictured Cooper in a pair of frilly panties and began laughing. If Nick was trying to make me feel better, it was definitely working.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave me an ultimatum. Have sex or get dumped. The funny thing is that I was ready. I was going to do it until he told me I had to and something snapped in me. I\u2019m not known for giving in to other peoples\u2019 demands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have really low standards if you went out with that dude so it gives me hope that you will eventually say \u2018yes\u2019 to me. I\u2019m gonna ask you again when I think you\u2019re ready, but not tonight because my poor heart can only take rejection in small doses.\u201d That caught my attention and I turned to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize it yet, but we\u2019re gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>His persistence was sexy. Hell, everything about this guy was sexy and I felt like I wanted to...puke. I quickly reached for the handle on my door and hung my head out of my car just in time to miss spraying the inside of my car like \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d Nick quickly sprung into action and was on my side of the car holding my hair out of the line of fire in a flash.</p><p>I felt wretched. I heaved time and time again in the direction of Nick\u2019s shoes but they stayed firmly planted, prepared to endure a punishment they clearly did not earn.</p><p>I felt like I was finished heaving, but I was afraid to move for fear of the motion bringing on another round. I was still looking at the ground when it struck me to ask Nick about his motives. \u201cWhy do you want to go out with me? You\u2019ve only known me a few hours and in that time I\u2019ve insulted you, rejected you, told you my sob story and now you\u2019ve been forced to hold my hair for me while I hurled pizza and Long Islands dangerously close to your shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t force me to hold your hair. I did it because I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Classic. He managed to flex his tough guy muscle and dodge answering my question at the same time.</p><p>Some of my hair fell forward and Nick situated it into a ponytail on top of my head held in place by his fist. I was certain anyone walking by would have thought he was impersonating a caveman holding on to his woman.</p><p>I took some deep breaths and felt like I could finally lift my head without yacking. Nick let go of my hair as I straightened up and I looked for a place clear of partially digested pizza and Long Islands so I could step out of my car.</p><p>I was sure I looked like hell with mascara raccooning under my eyes, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to care. \u201cI\u2019m getting in the backseat since Jessie is driving.\u201d</p><p>He moved back so I could step over the puddle of puke. \u201cYou could at least be honest about it. You\u2019re getting in the backseat so you can pass out.\u201d</p><p>I could see that I would never have to wonder what this guy was thinking. We could be dangerous for another. He opened the back door behind the driver\u2019s seat and motioned with his hand like a chauffeur. He was honest so I guess I would be, too. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m getting in the backseat so I can pass out, but I don\u2019t need you to stay with me. I\u2019ll lock the doors and you go back inside. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you out here alone.\u201d He shut my door and then got into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cI\u2019m moving your car to a different parking space so Jessie doesn\u2019t unknowingly wade through your puke to get in. That would not be cool.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled my car around to the back of the club and then turned on some music before he got out and slid into the backseat next to me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to try anything with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried.\u201d I had done a bang up job of preventing this thing with Nick from going any further tonight because no one wanted a post puke kiss, no matter how hard up they were.</p><p>I shut my eyes as I leaned my head against the cool window and felt Nick grab my upper arm and gently tug me in his direction. \u201cHere, put your head in my lap. You\u2019ll be more comfortable and you\u2019ll sleep better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut. Your. Head. On. My. Lap. Stubborn. I\u2019m not going to try anything with you,\u201d he promised.</p><p>I hated being bossed, but I did as he said and lay on my side, putting the side of my face against his thighs. I told myself I did it because I was tired and needed the sleep so I wouldn\u2019t be so hung-over the next day, not because it was what he ordered me to do.</p><p>My favorite Amos Lee song was playing and it helped me relax. As I lay there with my eyes closed, Nick began to stroke my hair and it felt really good. I began to relax more and was almost on the verge of nodding off when he asked, \u201cWhat song is this?\u201d</p><p>I loved his interest in my music. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Southern Girl\u2019 by Amos Lee.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really into music, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Amos was singing about Mississippi mornings and angels in flight. \u201cYeah, you could say that I\u2019m musically slutty. My taste in music gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this song because Amos got it spot on. There\u2019s definitely something about a Southern girl that makes me feel right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to Amos while you stroke my hair like that is going to put me in a coma if you\u2019re not careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving so you can go to sleep if you want. It\u2019s probably a good idea for you to sleep because you\u2019re going to feel like shit tomorrow and I\u2019m guessing Jessie and Claire aren\u2019t leaving the club anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>I probably needed to rest, but my current curiosity was stronger than my need for sleep. \u201cI will, but I want to ask you something first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to turn onto my back so I could see his face, but I was too scared so I stayed on my side. \u201cWhy do you call me Doll Face?\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time and I decided he wasn\u2019t going to answer, but then he shocked me. \u201cBecause I think you\u2019re the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know how to respond to that coming from him. I had been told my whole life how beautiful I was, but there was something different about the way he said it. It felt intimate, like he was talking about more than my physical appearance and I suddenly felt completely bared to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else and I didn\u2019t either as he sat with my head in his lap but things felt different between us. Neither of us voiced recognition regarding it, but we both knew that we had made a connection.</p><p>He continued to stroke my hair and I have no idea how long he did it because I eventually dosed off but not before I heard him whisper, \u201cSweet Dreams, Doll Face.\u201d</p><p>6 Brotherly Advice</p><p>Nick</p> <p>I could sit forever with this beautiful girl\u2019s head in my lap and stroke my hand over her long silky hair as she slept. I leaned over to sniff the fruity scent of her hair. My shift of position caused her to stir and then she turned onto her back to face me.</p><p>Her breath was slow and steady, assuring me that she was sleeping deeply, and I couldn\u2019t resist my urge to touch her face. I stroked the back of my fingers against her baby soft cheek and she turned toward my hand and nestled against it.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be the last time I was with this amazing girl. I had to see her again because I would go crazy if I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Jessie had already made his stand on the issue clear and I couldn\u2019t count on him to help me out so I started brainstorming on a way to get her digits. I looked over at her opened purse within my reach and knew what I had to do. I was going to get her number by calling my own phone from hers. It felt wrong to ramble through her personal belongings, but it didn\u2019t stop me from doing it.</p><p>I found her cell and pushed the power button. Shit. I should have known she\u2019d have it on lockdown with a pass code. I put her phone back in her purse without a minute to spare as Jessie, Claire and Dane walked toward her car at the back of the building.</p><p>Jessie angrily slung the car door open and immediately tore into me. \u201cThis isn\u2019t where Payton\u2019s car was parked. What have you been doing with her?\u201d</p><p>I recognized his unspoken accusation and knew he was insinuating that I moved the car behind the building so I could screw Payton in the backseat. Any other time he would have been right, but not tonight, not with her.</p><p>\u201cChill out, Boone. I had to move the car because she puked a river by the driver\u2019s side door. I didn\u2019t want you to have to walk in it and this was the only parking spot open.\u201d</p><p>He accepted my explanation, but I could tell that he still wasn\u2019t thrilled about finding me in the backseat with Payton\u2019s head in my lap.</p><p>\u201cClaire\u2019s ready to go. Do you need a lift home?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at Payton. I didn\u2019t want to leave her but it would be stupid for them to drive me all the way back to Collinsville when I could catch a ride home with my brother. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll ride home with Jake and Gabbi.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and gently lifted Payton\u2019s head as I got out of the car. Dane Wickham stepped around me and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d as he replaced me in the backseat. I\u2019ll be damned. I\u2019d have taken Jessie up on the ride if I\u2019d known another dude was going to climb into the backseat with her.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to meet you, Nick,\u201d Claire said as she got into the car. \u201cAnd thanks for staying with Payton so Jessie and I could have a good time.\u201d</p><p>I definitely had my own agenda for doing it. \u201cNo problem and it was nice to meet the only girl in this world that could settle this guy down.\u201d</p><p>Claire was inside the car with the door shut and Jessie told me, \u201cThanks again, Hawke. I know that babysitting Mouth of the South couldn\u2019t have been much fun when you could have been finding a chick to nail later tonight.\u201d</p><p>It was crazy to think that I preferred to have this sleeping girl\u2019s head in my lap rather than finding someone to bone, but there was no place I would have rather been. \u201cReally, it was no problem at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna get her upstairs.\u201d</p><p>He was out of his mind if he was going to take her inside her house. \u201cYou\u2019re going to carry her into her house? Aren\u2019t you afraid of what her parents will do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s spending the night with us because her parents are out of town.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? \u201cWhat do you mean by spending the night with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been living with Claire and her parents for the last six months, so that means we get to carry her up the stairs to Claire\u2019s bedroom and pray we don\u2019t wake The Deverauxs.</p><p>That lucky bastard. He and Claire were definitely sneaking into each other\u2019s beds every night after the parents were asleep.</p><p>Jessie put his fist out and I bumped it with mine. \u201cGood running into you, Hawke.\u201d He looked at Payton passed out across the back seat. \u201cTonight was fun even if she did show her ass. We should get together again soon.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s window was down. \u201cHey, I\u2019m having a party at my house tomorrow night. You should come.\u201d</p><p>There was only one reason I\u2019d step foot at a party at East Franklin. \u201cIs Payton going to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the Social Butterfly never misses a party.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t miss an opportunity to see her again. \u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><p>Sure, Payton told me she wouldn\u2019t go out with me, but she was wrong about that. She just didn\u2019t know it yet.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I stared at my ceiling thinking of Payton for hours after I got home. Thinking about her was far better than any dream that might have invaded my head during sleep.</p><p>She was beautiful, that was a given, and her beauty certainly didn\u2019t hinder my interest but that wasn\u2019t what fueled my attraction to her. It was her immediate distaste for me and her smart ass mouth. Oh, how I loved to hear the sarcastic wit spilling from those venomously, glossy lips.</p><p>I was surprised I was able to sleep at all, but when I woke the next morning I rolled over and immediately reached for my phone on the nightstand. I guessed I hoped that Payton had gotten my number from Jessie and had texted or called, maybe to say thank you for sitting with her or something. Any form of contact would have made my day, but I had no such luck. All I had was a text from Samantha Hodges that read, \u201cGet 2gether 2nite? Make it worth your while.\u201d</p><p>There was no way in hell that Samantha and I were ever happening again, so I quickly thumbed, \u201cGot plans,\u201d and hit the send button. Maybe she would take the hint and get lost.</p><p>I looked at the time and saw that I had slept later than I thought because it was a little after eleven. Anything after ten should be considered neutral ground, so I scrolled to Jessie\u2019s contact in my phone and hit the call button. It rang once, twice and then a third time before Jessie answered on the fourth ring, \u201cWaddup, Hawke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was calling to see how everything went after you left last night. I mean, did you get Payton to bed okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she didn\u2019t make it easy on me and Claire. Shit, I didn\u2019t realize how trashed she was, but we lucked out and got her in without the Deverauxs waking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m working at the garage today but I went by Claire\u2019s room this morning before I left for work and she was asleep on Claire\u2019s bathroom floor. I\u2019m betting she\u2019s still in bed taking it easy.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t gonna like this, but I had to give it a shot. \u201cI wanna call her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I heard him huff through the phone. \u201cI think Payton made it clear she doesn\u2019t plan on going out with you and I\u2019m not letting you hold her to that hinky bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Boone, she was too trashed for us to have a real conversation last night and all I need is half a chance to convince her to go out with me. I bet there wasn\u2019t anyone who thought you were right for Claire and look how wrong they were.\u201d</p><p>I heard silence on the other end and I knew he was thinking it over. \u201cI\u2019ll give you her number, but I\u2019m telling you now that she doesn\u2019t do Collinsville dudes. She likes her guys preppy and rich so be prepared for rejection because she doesn\u2019t sugar coat anything for anybody.\u201d</p> <p>I was positive that there was a time when Claire didn\u2019t do Collinsville guys either, but look at who was living with her and climbing into her bed every night. \u201cConsider me forewarned.\u201d</p><p>I hung up from making plans with Jessie about meeting up before Dane\u2019s party and looked at Payton\u2019s number. I felt nervous when I thought about calling her but it didn't stop me from dialing her number. I listened to five rings before it went to voicemail and then realized calling her this early after the drunk she pulled last night was a stupid idea because she was probably still in bed nursing a hellacious headache.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t convince myself to hang up before I had the chance to listen to her sweet voice on her voicemail recording say, \u201cHi, leave me a message and if I don\u2019t call you back, it means I\u2019m not interested.\u201d Even her voicemail greeting was smart ass.</p><p>I hung up without leaving a message. I told myself it was probably better to wait and see her tonight at Dane\u2019s party instead of waking an angry beast but the truth was that I was scared. I was afraid of leaving a message and never hearing back from her because she wasn\u2019t interested in me.</p><p>I was busy thinking about my next move when I heard Jake tap on my bedroom doorway. \u201cHey, Dickhead! I\u2019m taking the boat out on the lake today. You wanna come?\u201d</p> <p>I probably needed a way to pass the day so I didn\u2019t spend it fixated on a beautiful blonde with honey brown eyes. \u201cSure, I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m leaving in half an hour if you\u2019re riding with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, we were on the water. I always had a blast at the lake with Jake, Gabbi and her hot friends but today was different. It seemed to drag as I impatiently waited for Dane\u2019s party tonight.</p><p>I felt a fist to my upper arm. \u201cDayum, little brother. What is with you today? You haven\u2019t said two words and you\u2019re not hitting on any of Gabbi\u2019s friends. What gives?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head but stared ahead. I was not telling him that I had become obsessed with a chick. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Jake plopped down in the sand next to me and I knew that meant he wasn\u2019t leaving without an answer. He shook his head like a dog and then shoved his wet hair away from his face. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, you little Piss Ant. Something is up with you and I want to know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Fine, he could laugh if he wanted. \u201cIt\u2019s a chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. The leggy blonde you were with on the dance floor last night at the club?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t care for his description of her, even if it was dead on. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was one smokin\u2019 hot chick, but is she hot enough for you to break your own rule?\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly what he was talking about, but I pretended I didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd what rule would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Nick. Everyone knows that you don\u2019t have any use for a chick after you screw her and I know for a fact that you walked out the front door with her and didn\u2019t come back for almost two hours.\u201d</p><p>I could see how he might get the wrong idea about me and Payton. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with her.\u201d</p> <p>Jake started laughing at me. \u201cSince when do you call it sleeping with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I met her, okay?\u201d I reached for my sunglasses on top of my head and put them over my eyes so I could hide behind them. \u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get why you\u2019re sniffing around her but she\u2019s not the right kind of different for you, kiddo. She\u2019s a hot piece but what makes her different from the chicks you usually do is that she\u2019s a different breed. I took one look at her and knew she was rich and uppity. Take my advice and stick to what you know and what won\u2019t get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head as I shook it and stared at the wet sand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stay away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike always, you\u2019re thinking with the wrong head, Little Brother, but make no mistake. Your fascination with screwing this uptown girl is going to get you into serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about sleeping with her. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I definitely would, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know this chick. You just met her. You can\u2019t possibly think you\u2019re falling for her.\u201d</p><p>I continued to look ahead and didn\u2019t comment either way but I could see his stare out of my peripheral vision. \u201cShit, Nick. She\u2019s just like Mom and look at how things turned out between her and Dad. He was never good enough for her or her rich family and she left all of us because of it. You and Dallas don\u2019t remember what it was like when she left because y'all were so young, but I won\u2019t ever forget it. This chick is trouble and you\u2019d be doin\u2019 yourself a favor to not forget that anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted, Brother\u201d I replied through my clenched teeth as I refused to look at him.</p><p>The rest of my day at the lake consisted of avoiding Jake because I didn\u2019t want to hear how he thought he knew everything about Payton Archer and her type. He didn\u2019t have a clue what he was talking about when it came to her. Payton was nothing like Mom, even if she did call me Saint Nick.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I met Jessie and Claire at a convenience store in Franklin and followed them in her fancy convertible to Dane\u2019s house on the most Eastern side of town. As we drove, it became more and more apparent that the further east you lived, the richer you were so it was an understatement to say that Dane\u2019s family was very Eastern.</p><p>After we parked on the side of the driveway stretching to Dane\u2019s house, I looked at the enormous mansion before me. I studied it as we walked up the drive and wondered why anyone would need a house that size. I looked at every luxury car we passed on the walk toward the house, but not a one of them was Payton\u2019s Lexus. \u201cIs Payton already here?</p><p>\u201cShe should be. Dane and his brother, Paxton, came by around four and picked her up.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sit well with me that Payton left Claire\u2019s house with two guys but I guess I didn\u2019t have much of a say about it.</p><p>We walked around to the back of the house through a gate where there was a huge crowd of people hanging out. I immediately began to scan the crowd looking for the only one that drew me here, but I didn\u2019t see her anywhere.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m gonna have a bigger turnout than I expected.\u201d</p><p>I recognized Dane\u2019s voice and turned to see him standing next to us with two red plastic cups of beer in his hands. They both were fresh pours because each had huge foamy heads floating just below the rims and he passed one to me. \u201cHere, have a beer.\u201d</p><p>There was no way I\u2019d be able to fit all these people at my place. \u201cYeah, this is a pretty big crowd to have at your house at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they keep showing up, I may have to send my bro\u2019 for another keg. Speaking of which, I probably should check on it and see how fast the beer is going because it would totally suck to run out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, ya\u2019 know where Payton is?\u201d I called out to Dane as he walked toward the keg.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d he called over his shoulder and pointed to a window to my left.</p><p>I looked through the window and saw Payton in the kitchen. She was sitting up on the countertop picking at the label on the bottled water in her hand and I took that as a sure sign she was probably still not feeling well from last night\u2019s attempt to forget the pansy in the pastel shirt.</p><p>She looked as though there were a thousand places she\u2019d rather be and I dreamed of how I might be the one to take her to any one of them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled by her moping act.\u201d I turned and saw Claire by my side. \u201cShe was never into Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to convince her of that,\u201d I argued.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a smart girl. She\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>I looked back at Claire\u2019s beautiful best friend through the window and winced.</p><p>\u201cIt would take a little while for her to get over all of this nonsense on her own, but I think a little help from the right guy could have her over it by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? Was she encouraging me to go after Payton? \u201cWhat are you telling me, Claire?\u201d</p><p>She took a drink from her glass, peered over the rim at me and then nodded in Payton\u2019s direction. \u201cI\u2019m telling you to be the right guy. Be the one that makes her see that she never cared \u2018bout Cooper and she\u2019s mourning something that was never there.\u201d</p><p>I was sure I looked like a deer in headlights as I stared at her and I wondered what Jessie would say about all of this. \u201cWhy would you encourage me to go after your best friend when I know Jessie has told you about me? I\u2019m not known for being inexperienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what Jessie has said because I\u2019ve seen the way you look at her.\u201d</p><p>What could she possibly know about the way I looked at Payton? \u201cAnd just how do I look at her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way Jessie looks at me.\u201d A feather could have knocked me over as she described her observations to me. \u201cLike just now when you were watching her through the window, you were smiling and I bet you didn\u2019t even realize it.\u201d</p><p>No, I hadn\u2019t realized I was smiling, but I had realized how happy I was to find her.</p><p>I was sure that Claire didn\u2019t know about the things Payton and I had discussed last night. Her best friend didn\u2019t want me because of the way I had treated girls in the past and I didn\u2019t blame her. She had no guarantee she wouldn\u2019t become the next unidentifiable number and it was my own stupid fault. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI asked her out and she turned me down cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re gonna accept her first refusal and give up on her, just like that? I didn\u2019t take you for such an easy defeat.\u201d</p><p>In no form or fashion was I an easy defeat and I recognized a challenge when I heard one. \u201cNo, I hadn\u2019t planned to give up. I just hadn\u2019t made a plan B yet. Since you seem to be so determined I do this, do you have any ideas for me?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIt drives me insane but she\u2019s a total textaholic. I think you should send her a cutesy message.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at her. \u201cNo way. I don\u2019t do cutesy messages.\u201d</p><p>She cocked her head to the side and narrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t ask for my advice if you\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d</p><p>Yikers, this side of Claire was a little scary. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll send her a cutesy text,\u201d I relinquished and then realized I had no idea what constituted cutesy. \u201cExplain cutesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? Jessie told me you were a ladies\u2019 man. Do you really not know how to woo a girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t do wooing because I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton wants and needs someone romantic, so wooing will be a requirement. Be prepared.\u201d</p><p>Wooing. What a ridiculous word, but I guessed I could go along with it. \u201cAny more suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Here comes Jessie so you\u2019ll have to figure it out on your own.\u201d</p><p>7 Is Bullshit One Word or Two?</p><p>Payton</p> <p>I still felt like crap and it really sucked to be a drinking party when you couldn\u2019t drink. I was debating blowing the whole thing off when my phone vibrated with a new text from an unknown. \u201cU look beautiful 2nite.\u201d</p><p>My forehead unconsciously wrinkled as confusion and curiosity set in. 555-9143. I didn\u2019t know who the number belonged to but I recognized it as the number for the missed call I had this morning.</p><p>I could ignore it, but I was like a cat too curious for its own good. \u201cHow would U no?</p><p>My phone vibrated. \u201cCuz I CU.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I didn\u2019t know if I should feel flattered or creeped out, but I was leaning more toward creeped out. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, \u201cSaint Nick,\u201d appeared on my phone.</p><p>A smile crept across my face when I remembered calling him that last night. I also vaguely remembered something about him telling me he didn\u2019t like it and I wondered why he was so touchy.</p><p>I looked up from my phone to scan for him, but he wasn\u2019t in the kitchen so I slid off the countertop and walked into the living room. No luck. He could see me, but wasn\u2019t making an appearance, so that meant he was hiding from me.</p> <p>I quickly texted back,\u201cWhere RU Stalker?\u201d</p><p>I continued looking around the house as I waited for his next text.</p><p>Buzz. \u201cOutside.\u201d</p><p>I never liked hide and seek. I went outside to the backyard and didn\u2019t see him anywhere. I made my rounds through the crowd of people until I passed the pool and still didn\u2019t find him. He wanted to be chased, but I wasn\u2019t into that kind of thing and he had wasted enough of my time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t CU. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d I hit the send button.</p><p>My phone quickly beeped and vibrated again. \u201cFront of house.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I thought he\u2019d get more specific if I threatened to leave. Guys were so predictable and like putty in girls\u2019 hands.</p><p>Rather than go back through the house and come out the front door where he expected, I walked around the side of the house so I could catch him off guard; just the way I wanted him. I was all about equality. If he could spy on me, I could spy on him.</p><p>I found him casually leaning against a column on the front of the house as he waited for me to come through the front door to meet him. He tried to look nonchalant with his arms folded across his chest but he was entirely unsuccessful because there could never be anything casual about how sexy he was.</p><p>I huffed at my inner thoughts and mentally slapped my own hand. Gah! Why did I have to be so attracted to this guy? He was a street racing man-whore and I\u2019m sure the only future he looked forward to was his next race and his next lay.</p><p>The music was loud so he didn\u2019t hear me sneak up behind him and I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to goose him so I reached out and poked my finger right into that ticklish spot everyone has on their ribs. \u201cHere I am! Now what are your other two wishes?\u201d</p><p>He jumped and whipped around as I backed away and then he smiled that lopsided grin. \u201cYou little sneak! You think that was funny, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t control my laughter. \u201cYep, I sure do and you would too if you could have seen the way you jumped.\u201d</p><p>He came down the front steps and stood in front of me with his hands stuffed in the front pockets of his jeans as he looked at my purse on my shoulder. \u201cLeavin\u2019 so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided. I was kicking the idea around when I got your text.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should definitely leave this party. With me, that is.\u201d</p><p>This guy was a piece of work. He really expected me to take off with him. \u201cI just met you last night and I don\u2019t recall getting to know you all that well so why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, you owe me two more wishes according to your own admission, Genie. Second, you could use the time to get to know me better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I need to know you better?\u201d</p><p>There they were; those dimples I adored and I wondered what provoked them to make their appearance. \u201cSo our first date won\u2019t be so awkward.\u201d</p><p>He was hot, but I wasn\u2019t falling for his routine. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I could fool myself into thinking you might be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>He took his hands out of his pockets and reached for mine. \u201cMany great ideas have happened by mistake.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at his hands grasping mine. That might be true, but I wasn\u2019t willing to take that chance because my last mistake was still fresh on my mind. \u201cI don\u2019t need more mistakes in my life.\u201d</p><p>He let go of one of my hands and put two of his fingers under my chin to lift it. He had the dreamiest brown eyes and I was jealous of his long lashes. \u201cPayton, we\u2019re gonna happen. You should know that up front.\u201d</p><p>No! I would not be fooled by the likes of a Playah like Nick Hawke. \u201cIs bullshit one word or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have one smart ass mouth on you and I\u2019m not gonna lie about it; I really want to kiss it, but I won\u2019t because you\u2019re not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019ll ever be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m choosing to use my second wish on you leaving this party with me, so that means I only have one wish left and I\u2019ll be saving it for our first kiss. I\u2019ll let you know when I\u2019m ready to redeem it. So, do you need to let Claire and Jessie know that you\u2019re leaving with me?\u201d</p><p>Geez, he was presumptuous. I should have told him I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere with him, but that wasn\u2019t what I did at all.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll text Claire.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to have that discussion right now. I mean the one where I had to explain how I had lost my mind when I decided to leave with the Sex Tricks Jedi.</p><p>\u201cLeaving w/ Nick. Call U Later.\u201d</p><p>My thumb hesitated over the send button. Gah! She and Jessie were going to go apeshit about me leaving with him and that\u2019s why I waited to hit the send button until Nick and I were getting into his car.</p><p>He pulled the big heavy door open for me and I felt like I ungracefully fell into the seat when I got in because it was so much lower than my Lexus. \u201cWhoa, I wasn\u2019t expecting that kind of drop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You mean my car being low profile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow profile?\u201d I laughed. \u201cSure, we\u2019ll say low profile if that\u2019s what you want to call it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you call it?\u201d</p><p>I definitely wasn\u2019t a short, little petite girl like Claire. \u201cAss dragging on the ground is what I\u2019d call it.\u201d I stretched out one of my long legs toward Nick. \u201cHave you seen how long my legs are? I\u2019m five-seven and most of that is in these legs.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darted down to my ankle and slowly followed my leg up to where my shorts started, making me decide that my move might not have been such a great idea.</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me? There\u2019s no way I could miss these legs, Doll Face,\u201d he laughed and I quickly pulled my leg back into the car. My face immediately felt like throbbing fire. I was blushing, by gosh, actually blushing for the first time in my life.</p><p>Nick shut my door and then he walked around and got in on the driver\u2019s side. He started the car and it roared loudly the way I always imagined a NASCAR would.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no sneaking in or out at night for you in this loud bad boy, is there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s no way I would be able to pull that one off so I guess it\u2019s a good thing I don\u2019t have to sneak around. There\u2019s not a lot of rules at my house.\u201d</p><p>Geez, I hoped he didn\u2019t have parents like Jessie\u2019s mom and grandmother.</p><p>He backed out of the spot where he was parked and did a U-turn in the street in front of Dane\u2019s. I had no idea where we were going but I didn\u2019t care because I needed some distance between me and my most recent mistake.</p><p>I got a text and I reached for my phone to silence it because I knew Claire and Jessie were about to blow it up. \u201cYour parents don\u2019t have rules for you, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I live with my dad and he doesn\u2019t really care what we do as long as it doesn\u2019t involve causing him trouble. Do your parents still have a curfew for you or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents\u2019 control isn\u2019t really about a curfew. They are much more concerned with appearances so they like to control who I\u2019m with and what I do because it reflects upon them.\u201d</p><p>Speak of the devil and he shall appear. The text was from my Mom and I shoved my phone back into my purse without replying to her. \u201cThat makes my parents sound like total Class A assholes, doesn't it?</p><p>\u201cI guess it depends on their limitations. Let me guess...they would not approve of their perfect little girl being with someone like me. Am I right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought of my parents thinking I was perfect made me laugh, but he had the disapproval part down perfectly. \u201cMy parents aren\u2019t afflicted with the misconception of thinking I\u2019m perfect. They\u2019re not delusional.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at me briefly. \u201cBut they wouldn\u2019t approve of me, would they?\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window and watched the street lights quickly passing. \u201cNo, they would not approve of me being with you and that\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201d</p> <p>He was quiet for a few seconds and I wondered what he was thinking. \u201cWhat do your parents think of Jessie?\u201d</p><p>I had heard them voice their feelings over and over but I was going to leave off the part about how they thought he was trash and would never amount to anything. \u201cThey commend the Deverauxs for helping Jessie, but they believe it\u2019s a mistake for them to take him in their home. They\u2019re pretty much outraged that they would allow their daughter to be in a relationship with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would prefer he be left to live with his drug dealing grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re not that uncaring. Their solution would have involved throwing some money at a charity and leaving someone else to do the dirty work.\u201d</p><p>He turned onto the highway leading from Franklin to Collinsville. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t mind going to Collinsville since you\u2019d probably prefer we didn\u2019t run into your parents.\u201d</p> <p>I looked in his direction. \u201cMy parents are out of town, but that\u2019s probably best so we don\u2019t run into any of their friends.\u201d I felt guilty about it, but I was glad he was taking me away from Franklin.</p><p>His expression was one I couldn't quite place but then my curiosity was forgotten when he changed the subject. \u201cDo you have brothers and sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, do you really think my parents could handle another me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re a handful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsotively. What about you? You said that your dad didn\u2019t care what \u2018we\u2019 did so does that mean you have brothers and sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of each and I have the pleasure of being the disturbed middle child.\u201d</p> <p>I squirmed in my seat to turn in Nick\u2019s direction so I could see him without twisting my neck awkwardly. \u201cTell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jake is twenty-one and he works for the water and electrical department in Collinsville. He still lives at home with us and he has a girlfriend named Gabbi. You remember her, right? I believe you referred to her as \u2018Miss Black Halter Top\u2019 last night at the club.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I remembered \u2018Miss Black Halter Top\u2019 and I also remembered the unexpected jealousy I felt when I thought he was making plans to hook up with her while he was at the bar buying a drink for me. I kept that thought to myself as he went on. \u201cMy sister, Dallas, is seventeen and she\u2019ll be a senior at Collinsville this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother isn\u2019t in college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, school wasn\u2019t really his thing.\u201d</p><p>He said it so matter of fact, like it was fine with his family that he wasn\u2019t in college. \u201cWhat about you? Is school your thing?\u201d</p><p>It would be a shame if he didn\u2019t have goals for himself. \u201cNot really, but I\u2019m going anyway because I\u2019m following in my old man\u2019s footsteps. Police force.\u201d</p><p>Shiz, Nick in a fitted uniform would probably be more than I could stand. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a cop?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, why so surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause being a police officer is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to like danger.\u201d</p><p>The street ahead of us was blocked and a police officer was directing traffic around whatever was going on. \u201cUnless you get stuck showing drivers which direction to go like this guy. That would not be dangerous or exciting. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fair is in town.\u201d</p><p>I looked over and saw the lights of the Ferris wheel as it circled. \u201cI always wanted to do that when I was a kid, but my mom would never take me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be shittin\u2019 me. You\u2019ve never been to the fair?\u201d</p><p>I looked away from the rides and flashing lights toward Nick. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019ve never eaten hotdogs, funnels cakes and cotton candy and then puked after riding the tilt-o-whirl?\u201d</p><p>Ewe...Maybe I wasn\u2019t missing much after all. \u201cNot once.\u201d</p><p>He whirled his head to look at the traffic in the outer lane and then quickly changed lanes and wheeled into the parking area on the fairgrounds. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you don\u2019t know.\u201d He smiled and I knew what he was suggesting. \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the fair.\u201d</p><p>That was ridiculous. I wasn\u2019t letting him take me to the fair. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I\u2019m too old for kiddie rides.\u201d</p><p>He pulled into a spot and then looked at me. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not but how would you know if you\u2019ve never been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he said before he got out and jetted around to open my door for me. \u201cCome on, Doll Face, this is gonna fun.\u201d</p><p>I felt ridiculous. What eighteen year-old went to the fair? Apparently me. And with the Sex Tricks Jedi, no less.</p><p>I huffed, but I couldn\u2019t prevent the smile that had been threatening to come to the surface since he told me what we were doing. He reached for my hand and grabbed it like he was afraid I might bolt at any minute. We walked toward the admission gate and I looked over at him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019re doing this. It\u2019s silly. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 wrong with being silly. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have gotten my phone out of my purse, but I did anyway. I knew I would get a million texts and calls from Jessie and Claire and I didn\u2019t want to hear all the reasons why I shouldn\u2019t have left with Nick Hawke. In this moment, no one could convince me this was wrong.</p><p>8 Let\u2019s Call It A Non-No</p><p>Nick</p><p>I had no idea where I was taking Payton Archer when I asked her to leave Dane\u2019s party with me, so it was safe to say that I never guessed we would end up at the fairgrounds in Collinsville. Better yet, I never guessed how much fun we\u2019d have riding kiddie rides and eating pink cotton candy.</p><p>We shared a seat with a couple of rug rats on the tilt-o-whirl and they looked at Payton like she was crazy when she squealed hysterically while spinning in circles as we tilted back and forth. When the ride ended, she didn\u2019t make a move to get out of her seat and looked at me with a serious expression I didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Here it came. The part I had dreaded, the part where she told me she made a mistake by leaving with me and I should take her back to Dane\u2019s house. I waited for the words but they didn\u2019t come. Instead, she squeezed her eyes tightly and began to fan her face with her hand. \u201cI should probably not do that again anytime soon. I feel like I could puke and it would be a shame to do that to you two nights in a row.\u201d</p><p>I was so relieved she wasn\u2019t telling me to take her back to Dane\u2019s that I didn\u2019t care if she puked on me again. I reached for her hand and helped steady her as she stood. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good, but I probably shouldn\u2019t have ridden that. I get car sick, so anything going in circles tends to not agree with me. I can barely make it around a circular ramp on the highway.\u201d</p><p>I held her hand and helped her down the steps of the ride. \u201cOkay, no more tilt-o-whirl for you. How \u2018bout we play some games? I could win you a huge teddy bear as a souvenir for your first fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to a fair and even I know that those games are rigged. I bet you don\u2019t win anything.\u201d</p><p>It was a challenge. \u201cHave you not learned your lesson with me yet? Don\u2019t bet against me, Doll Face. What kind of prize do you want?\u201d</p><p>She looked around and then pointed toward a huge teddy bear in overalls hanging up by the basketball goals. \u201cI want that big gaudy teddy bear.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Basketball was my game of choice. \u201cHow \u2018bout I win you that teddy bear and you give me a kiss?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and I took it as an agreement because it\u2019s what I wanted. \u201cIs that a \u2018yes\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call it a...non-no.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d gladly take a non-no if it got me a kiss from her.</p><p>The guy behind the counter noticed us showing some interest in his booth and he began to shout in our direction. \u201cThree hoops wins the little lady her choice of a prize.\u201d</p><p>I slid my wallet out of my back pocket and reached for some of my earnings from the race. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>I watched him eye Payton up and down. \u201cFive dollars for five tries. Three hoops wins her choice of prize.\u201d</p><p>I loudly slammed a five dollar bill on the counter to take his attention off of Payton\u2019s cleavage and he slowly pulled his eyes from her to look at me. \u201cBest of luck, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He tossed a basketball in my direction and I bounced it a couple of times before I confidently took the first shot and missed. The guy behind the booth laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to do better than that to impress this little lady.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything as I took the ball from his nasty hands a second time to take my next shot and then missed again. Yeah, this was definitely rigged. I had played basketball for six years and could have made this shot with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cAwe...Missed again. Now you have to make every shot left to win this little beauty a prize.\u201d He leaned over the counter to look at Payton\u2019s legs and I wanted to punch his face and knock out the last three teeth he had left in his head. \u201cWhat do you think, Beautiful? Can he do it?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to not underestimate him when there\u2019s something he wants.\u201d</p><p>I took another ball from the sleaze bag and looked at the hoop closely to judge my next shot. I heard Payton ask, \u201cSir, do many people successfully make three hoops?\u201d and I took my shot as she distracted him. A loud beep signaled my ball going into the hoop. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one.\u201d I reached in his direction for another ball.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at me and shoved a ball in my direction. I studied the hoop again and heard Payton say, \u201cIt\u2019s so hot out here tonight,\u201d and I knew she was doing something to distract him again. I really didn\u2019t want to know what so I shook it off and took my next shot. A beep signaled my second hoop and he jerked his head around to look at the hoop.</p><p>I held my hands up to signal for my next ball and again he unnecessarily shoved one in my direction. He wouldn\u2019t fall for another one of Payton\u2019s distractions unless she took off her top.</p> <p>\u201cLast shot. Better make it count if you want to win that teddy for the little lady.\u201d</p><p>It was a given that he was going to do something to move the hoop. The only question was would it be left or right? There was a 50/50 chance I would guess the right direction so I went with the left.</p><p>BEEP!</p><p>It was a lucky guess and I knew that, but it wasn\u2019t about making the shot. It was about seeing Payton walk around with one of those big, ugly bears and even better was the kiss she promised me. Sort of promised, my non-no kiss.</p><p>She squealed with excitement and threw her arms around my neck so I took the opportunity to pick her up and swing her around like we had hit the Tennessee Lottery. I knew we looked ridiculous to those around us, but I didn\u2019t care because it was a great excuse to put my arms around her.</p> <p>I put her down and looked into her eyes. This wasn\u2019t where I wanted our first kiss to happen but I would take it if she offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got players behind you, so pick your prize and move on,\u201d the sleaze bag called out.</p><p>Great job of ruining this kiss for me, Dude. I struggled to not show my irritation. \u201cShow him the one you want, Doll Face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one,\u201d she said as she pointed toward the biggest bear hanging on the wall. Her eyes lit up over that ugly stuffed bear and I knew I was giving her something she would never forget. It wasn\u2019t the bear, it was the memory.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nick,\u201d she said as she leaned over and kissed my cheek.</p><p>Damn, that was a total letdown. A brotherly peck on the cheek was not the kind of kiss I had in mind, but I smiled because I didn\u2019t want her see that I had expected more.</p> <p>\u201cGlad I could be the one to give you your first Fair Bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair Bear,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI like that. I think that should be his name.\u201d</p><p>It was starting to get late and I guessed they would be shutting things down soon. \u201cYou seem like you\u2019re feeling better. You wanna give the Ferris wheel a try before we go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m feeling much better so I definitely want to do that before we go.\u201d</p><p>The line was short because it was getting late so we were quickly loaded into the carriage that would carry us up to overlook the Collinsville fairgrounds. We rose higher into the sky each time a carriage was loaded with riders and I watched the excitement on Payton\u2019s face as we got closer to the top.</p><p>She twisted in the carriage and looked around in every direction. \u201cI know we\u2019re just on a small Ferris wheel, but it feels like we\u2019re on top of the world.\u201d She laughed as she turned to me. \u201cYou think I\u2019m being silly, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re silly at all. I think you\u2019re intriguing.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips as I stared at the shiny gloss on her lips and imagined how soft and slick her mouth would be against mine. I had never wanted to lean in for a kiss so badly in all of my life. Being on this Ferris wheel on top of the world with her couldn\u2019t be more perfect, but I couldn\u2019t do it; I was too scared.</p> <p>I, Nick Hawke, the sexpert and fearless daredevil, was scared. I was too pansy to kiss this beautiful girl because she was wonderful and perfect and different. She was special and I didn\u2019t want to blow it with her by pushing too hard, too fast.</p><p>The wheel stopped again to load another couple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t say this already, but thank you for taking care of my drunk ass last night. I didn\u2019t think I would be so wasted after only two drinks. I guess I just drank them too fast.\u201d</p><p>Without thinking, I reached for her hand and gave it a squeeze. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t mind. It was my pleasure, puke and all.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as she looked down. \u201cLiar,\u201d she laughed. \u201cThe whole thing with Cooper seems so stupid now. I tried to make him be my Jessie. That\u2019s weird, I know. I\u2019m sort of messed up that way.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why I told you that.\u201d</p><p>Claire was right. She was beginning to see that she never really loved Cooper.</p><p>All the carriages were loaded and we began to rise and fall as the wheel spun around. A gust of wind picked up as we rose to the top and a wild strand of hair blew into her face and got stuck in her lip gloss. I couldn't resist the excuse to touch a part of her so I reached forward to set it free.</p><p>All I could taste and breathe was this moment with her. Our time together would be over soon and I didn\u2019t want to go home without telling her that I had to see her again.</p><p>I twirled the wild strand in my fingers and then tucked it behind her ear. \u201cLast night, you told me you wouldn\u2019t go out with me because you were looking for something different, yet you\u2019re here with me now.\u201d</p><p>A regretful expression came across her face. \u201cNick, you\u2019ve been really sweet to me and I\u2019ve had a wonderful time with you tonight, as a friend. We can never be more than that. You\u2019ve gone through too many girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always used protection. Every time without fail. I swear I haven\u2019t caught anything if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to know you at least had the good sense to be safe, but that\u2019s not what I mean. I\u2019m looking for something lasting and you\u2019re looking for your next one night stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are and if you were really being honest with yourself, you\u2019d have to admit that you\u2019re interested in me because I\u2019m a challenge for you. I didn\u2019t flip onto my back for you and it\u2019s driving you crazy. I promise it won\u2019t be long until you see that I\u2019m right. You\u2019ll forget all about me when your next conquest comes along and both of us will walk away from this unscathed. We might even be friends when it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t be more wrong. This was me being honest with myself about what I wanted for the first time in a really long time. I truly, madly, deeply wanted Payton Archer. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me but I can see that it may take a while for you to realize that. In the meantime, if friendship is all you can give then I\u2019ll take it over nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>9 A Hawke\u2019s Prey</p><p>Payton</p><p>I rambled about nothing and everything simultaneously since our talk on the Ferris wheel, but I kept hearing Nick\u2019s words repeat over and over in my head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong about me but I can see that it may take a while for you to realize that. In the meantime, if friendship is all you can give then I\u2019ll take it over nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>I had heard all the lines of bullshit before and I knew the game like the back of my hand but none of Nick\u2019s words sounded like the kind of thing a Playah would say. Was it possible that I was wrong about him?</p><p>His fingers accidentally grazed mine as we walked to his car and it made me wish he would reach out and squeeze my hand the way he had when we were on the Ferris wheel, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t since I had just skillfully played the friend card.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re suddenly very quiet. Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I adjusted Fair Bear on my hip like a toddler. \u201cJust thinking is all.\u201d</p><p>I reached for my phone in my back pocket to read the texts I had ignored from earlier.</p><p>\u201cK. Have fun.</p><p>The next text was also from Claire. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about being DD. We\u2019re covered.\u201d</p><p>I was nearing the stage of utter shock because I had completely expected Claire to rip me a new one for leaving with Nick. \u201cK. Having fun but call if U need me,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need me to be the DD so I\u2019m free for the rest of the night.\u201d I realized that sounded like I assumed he would want to spend the rest of the night with me so I tried to back paddle on my statement. \u201cBut you can take me back to Dane\u2019s if you have something else you\u2019d like to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a thing I\u2019d rather do than be with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>That might not be the entire truth. There was at least one thing I knew he would rather be doing, but he could forget it; he wasn\u2019t getting in my pants tonight.</p><p>\u201cSo, what cha wanna do? What\u2019s there to do in Collinsville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a pool hall down the road that I hang out at sometimes. You like playing pool or darts? I could probably score us some draft.\u201d</p><p>A pool hall? I somehow doubted it would be anything similar to The Billiards Club in Franklin but I was game. Just as I was about to tell Nick that I would love to go with him, three thugs appeared behind us.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, look who we have here. If it isn\u2019t Nick Hawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for trouble, Ace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like trouble found you. You cost me a lot of money on last night\u2019s race and you\u2019re either going to make up for it on this next race or I\u2019m gonna take it out of your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the car, Payton.\u201d I opened my mouth to ask why, but Nick didn\u2019t give me the chance to say anything. \u201cNo questions. In the car, now.\u201d</p><p>I saw the seriousness on his face and knew it wasn\u2019t the time to question him so I did as he told me. He pushed the lock down on the door before he shut it and I knew that was a sign that these guys weren\u2019t pals and they weren\u2019t here to play.</p><p>My heart was pounding as I watched Nick talking to the one with tattoos from his wrists up to his neck. I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying but I could tell he was mad as hell about something.</p><p>I couldn't see Nick\u2019s face because his back was turned to me, but I could tell that he was standing his ground because both of their voices grew louder as they argued. Nick was not backing down to this guy and that clearly wasn\u2019t going over well. I thought about how Jessie had been stabbed and shot by people no different from these thugs he was arguing with now and I reached for my pepper spray in my purse, just in case. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick turned away from the threesome to walk around to the driver\u2019s side, but Ace grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around. He landed a punch on the left side of his face and Nick went down. I panicked, not knowing if he was hurt or not and opened the door.</p><p>Nick quickly sprang from the ground at Ace and his fist connected with his eye and then he stepped away from him with his fists up in defense like a boxer waiting for the next swing. While he bounced from side to side, one of Ace\u2019s thugs drug me out of the car as I scratched and clawed at him viciously. My screams distracted Nick and he took another fist to the face as Ace took advantage.</p><p>In my state of panic, I managed to remember a self defense move I learned years ago and gave him an upward slam of my palm to his nose and he immediately released me but only for the other thug to grab me by the waist from behind.</p> <p>\u201cOoh, Hawke. This one is a fighter.\u201d He leaned around and spoke against my ear. \u201cI bet she\u2019s lots of fun in bed. I may have to try her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Nick demanded. \u201cShe has nothing to do with what\u2019s between us.\u201d</p><p>I bucked violently when I thought about him trying me out and slammed the back of my head against the thug\u2019s nose several times until he released me. I turned to face him head on and saw he was wiping a profuse amount of blood from his face.</p><p>\u201cMy nose. The bitch broke my nose.\u201d</p><p>Ace pointed in my direction. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done with your boyfriend, you\u2019re next.\u201d</p> <p>Nick sprang from where he stood and took Ace to the ground. There were so many punches being thrown, I couldn\u2019t tell who was winning. I was terrified for Nick and afraid Ace might pull a knife or gun at any moment so I did the only thing I knew to do. I sprayed him with my pepper spray.</p><p>Screams were all I could hear as he rubbed his face. \u201cWhat the hell? What did you just spray me with?\u201d</p><p>I began to back away as he blindly swung in my direction. I looked at Nick and saw his reddening eyes squeezed shut and I knew I had gotten him too.</p><p>\u201cShit, Nick. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to spray you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little blew back on me. It\u2019s not so bad since you didn\u2019t get me directly.\u201d He reached up toward me. \u201cCan you help me to the car?\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand and helped him stand as he strained to get up. I felt horrible. \u201cI really am sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here. Can you drive my car for me?\u201d</p><p>I held his hand and led him to the passenger side. \u201cSure, it\u2019s the least I can do since I just set your face on fire.\u201d</p><p>He reached into his pocket and held the keys in front of me. I reached for them and unlocked the door before I opened it for him.</p><p>\u201cThis is all wrong, you know? I\u2019m supposed to be opening all the doors and driving you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let it slide this time.\u201d</p><p>I got into the driver\u2019s seat and was surprised at how powerful I felt when I turned the key to start the roaring engine. \u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house, I guess. I need to wash the pepper spray off my face.\u201d</p><p>I drove for a little while and pondered if it was a good idea to ask about those thugs but decided he would tell me that it was none of my business if he didn\u2019t want me to know. \u201cWhat did those guys want with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAce wanted me to throw the race with Dane last night. He threatened me and thought I would cave but I\u2019m a lot like a certain someone I know. I don\u2019t do ultimatums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf nothing else, that\u2019s one thing we have in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked you in the car to protect you, but I wouldn\u2019t have if I had known you were a total Chuck Norris badass. Are you ever gonna stop surprising me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not, but you could hold out hope along with my parents.\u201d</p><p>I got a laugh out of him. That meant he wasn\u2019t too pissed at me about the pepper spray, so that was good, right? I stopped at a red light and took the opportunity to search his face while his eyes were shut. Even with his eyes clammed closed he was seriously hot, ridiculously so.</p><p>I heard a horn blowing at me to go when the light turned green and I guess I gassed it a little too hard and squealed a tire. \u201cDamn, girl. What are you trying to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I\u2019m not used to this many horses. This thing will get away from you in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a thing. Her name is Ebony.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I see where Ebony fit. \u201cYour car\u2019s name is Ebony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never come across a person that named their vehicle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a sane person.\u201d</p><p>Our conversation about naming vehicles was cut short when I saw his street and I was glad because I was afraid he was about to encourage me to give my Lexus a name. \u201cYou said 2143 Forrest Drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>The drive to Nick\u2019s house from the fairgrounds wasn\u2019t far and I was grateful. I knew his skin and eyes had to be burning like crazy and he was being kind by not complaining because he didn\u2019t want me to feel worse than I already did.</p><p>I parked in the drive of a small cream brick house with black shutters and I guessed we were in the right place because there was a squad car parked on the street in front of the house. I turned to look at Nick and he sat motionless with his eyes closed tightly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d I turned off the engine and went around to the passenger\u2019s side. I put my hand out and took his in mine. \u201cHere, let me help you. Which door are we using?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well use the front door \u2018cause my old man is gonna be stretched out on the couch watching television. There won\u2019t be any sneaking past him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nick. This is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>He stopped before we in the door and grabbed my face even though he couldn\u2019t look into my eyes. \u201cStop it. This could never be your fault. You didn\u2019t have any control over Ace jumping me and you were scared I was about to get the shit kicked out of me. But for the record, I totally had him.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see the smirk on my face. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn skippy,\u201d he said as he turned to enter the front door. Just as he predicted, his dad was stretched out on the couch watching Saturday Night Live in his boxers, which I guess was better than whitey tighties. Awesome. Could this get any more awkward?</p><p>He didn\u2019t make a move at first because he thought Nick was alone but then he saw me and shot up to grab a pillow to cover his lap. \u201cDamn, Son, could you give me a little notice if you\u2019re bringing a girl home? I\u2019m in my skivvies here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad. I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my eyes to the floor and turned around as his dad got off the couch. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I guess he\u2019s been a bachelor for too many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. This is his house and it\u2019s his right to watch television in his skivvies if he wants.\u201d</p><p>We were both laughing when he came back in wearing a T-shirt and some flannel pants. He offered his hand and Nick introduced us. \u201cThis is my dad, Dutch.\u201d</p><p>Dutch Hawke. What a great cop name. \u201cDad, this is Payton.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for a minute before he said anything. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, Payton.\u201d He smiled and I saw who Nick got his dimples from. \u201cForgive me if I seem a little shocked. Nick has never brought a girl home before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>He turned to smirk at Nick and the smile left his face. \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got jumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy what?\u201d</p><p>He probably wasn\u2019t going to think too much of me after I told him I was the one to blame for his son\u2019s face looking the way it did. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault he looks like that. I sprayed the guy that jumped him with pepper spray but some blew back into Nick\u2019s face. It was a complete accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to see the other guy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m betting he looked like hell. Serves him right. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t too happy with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the kitchen. That\u2019s gonna need some milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it will cool the burn and then we\u2019ll need to wash it with dishwashing detergent. It will get better on its own in about 30 minutes but this will speed the process. It usually takes a few hours for it to wear off completely, but maybe it won\u2019t be that long since you didn\u2019t get it directly to the face.\u201d</p><p>I watched Dutch irrigate Nick\u2019s face with milk and he must have seen the puzzled look on my face. \u201cI know about pepper spray treatment because we occasionally use it in the line of duty. Sometimes we get a little of the blow back like Nick did tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That\u2019s all I could say as I thought about the dangerous situations Nick would be in after he became a cop and pepper spray would be the least of his worries when it came to dangerous criminals. Thinking about it made my stomach feel like it was in knots and I didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>I needed to hear him tell me he was better so I could feel better. \u201cIs the burning going away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not near as bad as it was at first.\u201d</p><p>Dutch mixed up a detergent and water paste and washed Nick\u2019s face with it several times before he moved to the couch to lie down. \u201cIt should get better soon but you\u2019ll have to wait for your eyes to get better on their own because detergent won\u2019t feel much better than the pepper. You should probably just go to bed and sleep it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve gotta drive Payton back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, your eyes are too swollen for you to drive. I\u2019ll take her home. Just give me a minute to grab my shoes.\u201d</p><p>Dutch went down the hall toward the back of the house and I sat next to Nick on the couch after he scooted over and patted the cushion.</p><p>He looked at me through his inflamed eyes and smiled. \u201cI had a great time tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right,\u201d I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a liar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I did. I\u2019m not kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you say...\u201d And that\u2019s all I was able to get out before Nick grabbed the back of my neck and pulled me down as he rose to meet me for a kiss. He put his lips against mine and I felt a fire growing that had absolutely nothing to do with pepper spray.</p><p>I opened my mouth a little and he slid his tongue in between my teeth to tease me so I would open wider. He sat up completely and turned his head to the side so his tongue could dance a waltz with mine. He tasted like mint but with a hint of spice, sort of like pepper. The realization made me smile and I felt his smile in return against my mouth.</p> <p>His hands were placed affectionately on each side of my face and I reveled in the moment because it was the kind of kiss I always long for. It was perfect in all ways but one. He was a total Playah.</p><p>I heard his dad start the car outside and I pulled away from Nick. How had his dad gotten past us? I didn\u2019t even hear the door open.</p><p>He still held my face and I could feel his breath against my lips. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go. Your dad is waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wait,\u201d he said breathlessly as he leaned forward to possess my mouth again but I stopped him by pressing my forehead to his.</p><p>\u201cNo, I have to go. It\u2019s rude to keep him waiting.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his thumbs up and down my cheeks. \u201cOkay. Can I call you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I only nodded and he smiled because it was the answer he wanted. I halfway expected, and maybe even hoped, he might pull me back down for another kiss before I got up but he didn\u2019t. I walked out the front door without looking back because I was afraid I might run back to him for another one of his peppery kisses.</p><p>I got my purse and Fair Bear from Nick\u2019s car and then got into the squad car with Dutch. He looked at the stuffed animal and then back at me. \u201cNick won him for me at the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much. What side of town do you live on?\u201d</p><p>I felt bad telling him he was going to have to drive me all the way to Franklin. \u201cI\u2019m not from Collinsville. I live in East Franklin.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything and pulled away from the house in the direction of the highway leading home. \u201cI suspected you weren\u2019t from here but I didn\u2019t want to make assumptions.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what that meant so I didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, how did you and Nick meet?\u201d</p><p>I doubted it was a good idea to tell him I met him on the way to see him street race since that was illegal. \u201cI ran into the back of his car with mine at a red light and it just so happened that my friend in the car with me knew Nick so he introduced us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had an accident?\u201d</p><p>Oops. \u201cSort of. I bumped him a little bit but it didn\u2019t do any damage to either of our cars so we didn\u2019t call it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows better than that.\u201d I could see him shaking his head in the dark.\u201dWho is your friend that he knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie Boone. He used to live in Collinsville and he and Nick were in the same class. Do you remember him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, I know that boy. He caused me more trouble than I like to remember when he lived here with his sorry excuse for a mother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he told us that he used to stay in trouble all the time but a good family took him in and he\u2019s got his life together now. He got a full scholarship to UT in the fall and is going to be a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lawyer? Imagine that after everything that little shit has done. I\u2019m glad to hear he\u2019s made a turn in the right direction because I don\u2019t usually hear about people making a change for the better when you\u2019re in my line of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would suspect not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I caught your last name earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArcher.\u201d</p><p>He was silent and then suddenly blurted out, \u201cWho are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrison and Vivian Archer.\u201d</p><p>Everything seem to change the moment I said my last name and I didn\u2019t understand why but discussion time was over because we were at Claire\u2019s house.</p><p>\u201cThis your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019m staying with a friend because my parents are out of town. Thank you for the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll wait here until you\u2019re inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you and have a goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome and goodnight, Miss Archer.\u201d</p><p>A car pulled up to let Claire and Jessie out as I was walking toward the house so I stopped to wait on them. Jessie took one look at the Collinsville police squad car and I could clearly see that he was pissed but he didn\u2019t say anything. At least not until the car pulled away.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble did Nick get you into and why are the police bringing you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it all wrong and if you\u2019d shut your trap for like two seconds, I\u2019ll explain what happened, Kimosabe. But let\u2019s go inside first because my dogs are barkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I slipped off my wedges and walked barefooted to the house. Jessie walked ahead and opened the door for me and Claire like he always did. \u201cWhere\u2019d you come up with that ugly bear?\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head and looked at him like he had just insulted my own offspring. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you called Fair Bear ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief. Say it isn\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what isn\u2019t so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke did not take you to the fair in Collinsville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he did.\u201d</p><p>He was laughing at me. \u201cSmooth move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a great time. That was until we got jumped by some thugs.\u201d</p><p>Jessie stopped dead in his tracks. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018we\u2019 got jumped by thugs?\u201d</p><p>I probably shouldn\u2019t have said it that way. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf as bad as it sounds isn\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>I really wanted to go to bed, but I could see he wasn\u2019t going to wait to hear my explanations so I conceded and we sat down at the table in the breakfast room. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s how the night went.\u201d</p><p>I intended on giving him two minutes worth of story but he stretched it out to twenty with all of his questions about my night with Nick Hawke.</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t try anything with you?\u201d</p><p>That was the second time he asked me that. Again, I decided to not tell him about Nick kissing me. This flame needed no fuel. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you he didn\u2019t. Besides, I\u2019m fairly certain that sex wasn\u2019t on his mind after taking a shot of pepper spray to the face.\u201d</p><p>He laughed huskily. \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled. Sex is always on a guy\u2019s mind, pepper spray or not, and he could have used his injury as a motivator for a sympathy screw.\u201d</p><p>Well, he didn\u2019t and Nick Hawke was harmless in my eyes because I was immune to his advances. My decision was made and we would never be more than friends. I admit I slipped a little, or maybe a lot, when I kissed him back tonight but my lesson was well learned and I wouldn\u2019t let it happen again.</p><p>But wow...what a way to slip. It was a mistake I couldn\u2019t afford to repeat because it was imperative I not forget who and what he was all about, otherwise I was in danger of becoming Hawke\u2019s next prey.</p><p>10 That Archer Girl</p><p>Nick</p><p>Payton let me kiss her. Hell, she didn\u2019t just let me. She threw everything she had told me out the window and kissed me back the way I wanted her to. That meant things between us were changing, right? Surely it did and what sweet change it was.</p><p>I was still on the couch when my dad rolled through the front door almost an hour after he left to drive Payton back. This should be interesting. I couldn\u2019t wait to hear what he had to say about how great she was.</p><p>It was true. Payton was the first girl I ever brought home and I\u2019m sure that alone shocked the shit out of my dad because he knew how I was. I didn\u2019t do relationships but he got it and didn\u2019t push me to talk about it. Connections with people just weren\u2019t my thing, even with my own family. I guessed he and I were sort of alike in that respect.</p><p>My eyes were still closed when I heard my dad\u2019s keys clank as he dropped them in the dish on the kitchen counter. \u201cYou awake, Son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Are you kiddin\u2019 me? Surely, he wasn\u2019t about to try to have the safe sex talk with me after all these years. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout that girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s name is Payton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, Payton Archer. I don\u2019t want you seeing her again. She\u2019s not the right kind of girl for you.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Since when did my dad give a rip about who I saw? I sat up and tried to look at my dad because I needed to look him in the eyes for this conversation. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else thinks she\u2019s wrong for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jake. He said I should forget about her. Said something about her being just like Mom, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s nothing like Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a lot more than you think and I\u2019m telling you now that this girl will only hurt you. She comes from a lot of money and you don\u2019t. Her family will never accept you and even if she goes against their wishes and chooses you over them, it won\u2019t end well for either of you. Been there and done that, Son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton is not Mom and I\u2019m 18 in case you forgot. I can see anyone I want to see.\u201d</p><p>I was looking at Dutch the cop, not Dutch the dad, as he pointed his finger at me. \u201cI can\u2019t keep you from seeing her but I can warn you. That girl will only break your heart. Mark my words.\u201d</p><p>I had complete faith in my choices, so why couldn\u2019t he? \u201cDad, you know how I am. I don\u2019t let people hurt me and Payton is no different.\u201d That was a total lie because she couldn't be more different. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve asked her out twice and she told me \u2018no\u2019 both times. She says we can only be friends.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t look like a friend telling you \u2018no\u2019 when I walked in on the two of you kissing on the couch.\u201d</p><p>I broke into a huge smile with just the mention of the kiss we shared. I shouldn\u2019t have because it was a dead giveaway for my feelings about Payton. \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be, but I can tell by that ridiculous look on your face that you\u2019ll be trying to change that as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t deny that, so I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cSon, if you don\u2019t hear anything I say, please hear this. There\u2019s only so far you can walk this road and still have the chance to turn back. There will be a point of no return with this girl. Don\u2019t go there with her because it will only ruin you for the rest of your life. Trust me; I know it all too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like Payton\u2019s gonna ruin my life or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think so but she has the power to break you. Maybe not today, but she will if you pursue this thing with her.\u201d</p><p>He made it sound like she was some kind of succubus demon. \u201cShe\u2019s just a friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFriend or not, she\u2019s a gorgeous girl and I know what you\u2019re thinking about when you look at her. Believe me, I remember and it\u2019s more dangerous than you can imagine because you don\u2019t see the power she can have over you.\u201d</p><p>He had one thing right. The decision was mine and I knew what I would choose if given the opportunity but I was done talking about this with him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><p>I walked the hallway to my bedroom with my hand on the wall as a guide and shut the door after I was in my room. I put my phone on the nightstand before I stripped down to my boxers and then crawled into my unmade bed. I reached for my phone and stared at it through blurry vision, trying to decide if I should text Payton or not. After several minutes of debate, I decided I had to.</p><p>\u201cFair Bear ok?\u201d I hit send and then thought too late about how really cheesy that message was. Ugh! Maybe my dad was right about one thing. Payton had power over me, the kind to make me act totally stupid.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good &amp; your face? Better I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. TY.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. Wouldn\u2019t want U scarred 4 the ladies.\u201d</p><p>There was only one lady I was concerned about. \u201cK to call U tom?</p><p>\u201cSure, Friend.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? Was that supposed to be her way of acting like nothing happened between us tonight? Something happened...something significant whether she wanted to admit it or not but I wasn\u2019t about to discuss it through shorthand texting.</p><p>\u201cSweet Dreams Doll Face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Nite. ;)\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to make of \u2018Sure, Friend\u2019 except that I didn\u2019t care for it. Man, I wished I hadn\u2019t texted her because now I would spend half the night thinking about her reply instead of spending the whole night thinking solely about our magnificent kiss.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p> <p>When I woke up, I couldn\u2019t imagine how I managed to go to sleep last night. My every thought was of Payton and I wondered if she was thinking of me the way I was of her. It was doubtful considering most of my thoughts were really fantasies of everything I\u2019d love to do to her to make her scream my name.</p><p>I was doing it again, thinking of things I planned on doing to Payton when Jake swung my bedroom door open without knocking, fully living up to his role as the asshole older brother.</p><p>He ran over and jerked my comforter off and started laughing. \u201cDad thinks he talked some sense into you about that chick, but I can see that he was wrong based on what you\u2019ve got covered with your hands. You definitely have Miss Fancy Pants in your head. What were you thinking about, huh? How you were going do this to her?\u201d He humped my mattress and I wanted to throw up when he started groaning with each thrust. \u201dUh. Uh. Uh.\u201d</p><p>I kicked my foot at him and nailed him in his inner thigh. \u201cGet your crotch rot off my bed, dude. Go hump your own mattress before I need a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to hump my mattress because I get to do this to Gabbi.\u201d I couldn\u2019t take it and turned my head away. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting. Get out of my room, Dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Check this move out. Even a rich girl like Miss Fancy Pants will like gettin\u2019 it this way.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look as I heard my box springs squeak and felt the motion of my mattress. I\u2019d had enough of his shit about Payton. I kicked him harder and knocked him into the floor. I wasn\u2019t trying to cause any real damage, but I would if he kept jacking around about Payton like that.</p><p>I slid off the bed and stepped over his cacklin\u2019 ass on my way to the bathroom, but he wasn\u2019t finished harassing me because I could hear him as I went down the hall. \u201cGoing to the bathroom to finish the job? It would probably help get the deed done quicker if you have a picture of her on your phone. You want me to slide it under the door for you?\u201d</p><p>I bumped into Dallas on my way down the hall and prayed she hadn\u2019t heard anything he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s that idiot carrying on about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You don\u2019t want to know. You\u2019d be scarred for life.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her brow as she looked at my face. \u201cWhat happened to you? You look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got pepper sprayed last night.\u201d</p><p>Apparently she found that to be pretty funny based on the way she was laughing and snorting. \u201cLet me guess. Some girl finally got enough of you screwing around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident?\u201d She crossed her arms and looked intrigued. She leaned against the wall, a sure sign she expected to hear the whole story. \u201cHow does one accidentally get sprayed in the face with pepper spray? Do tell.\u201d</p><p>I tried to pass by her. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t interest you.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and grabbed my arm to stop me from getting away. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you the short version. I was leaving the fair with a date and Ace Henry jumped me. She got scared and sprayed him, but some blew back in my face. See? Not an interesting story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an interesting story? Come on, Nickolas Aleksei. You had a date? Like a real date?\u201d</p><p>Ugh! I hated being called by my full name. It sounded like a nineteenth century Russian tzar. \u201cYes...no...maybe. I don\u2019t guess it qualified as a real date since it wasn\u2019t one to her.</p><p>\u201cBut you wanted it to be a real one. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never be able to guess just how much. I shrugged my shoulders like I didn\u2019t know or care, but it was a total cover. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, my ass. I can see that you really like this girl. You have to call her and ask her to spend the day with you before she makes other plans.\u201d</p><p>Ooh. I didn\u2019t know about that. What if she turned me down again? \u201cI don\u2019t know, Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. Call her. She\u2019d be crazy to turn you down.\u201d</p><p>I wish I had Dallas\u2019 confidence. \u201cWell, she must be crazy then because she\u2019s turned be down twice already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t turn you down last night.\u201d</p><p>Things with Payton were so back and forth, I didn\u2019t know where I stood with her, but I guess there was only one way to find out. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll call her but this is all your fault if she tells me \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. She won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>11 The Green Eyed Monster</p><p>Payton</p><p>I woke up to Claire thumping the end of my nose the way she did when we were little kids. \u201cWhat the hell, Claire? Cut it out. You wouldn\u2019t want to be woken up by me trying to thump boogers out of your nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWake up. I want you to tell me what happened between you and Nick before Jessie gets up. I know you were holding out when you were telling us about it last night, so spill. I need details.\u201d</p><p>Ugh! I rolled over and shoved my face into my pillow. I spent most of the night thinking about our perfect kiss and the other half of the night reminding myself how he had gotten so good at it. Practice made perfect and he had no idea how many girls he had practiced on. The thought made my stomach feel jittery and nervous at the same time.</p><p>\u201cSomething happened that shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Claire reached out and shoved me so hard I nearly fell off her bed. \u201cShut the front door! You did not play the V-card to The Sex Tricks Jedi?\u201d</p><p>I reared my pillow back and bopped Claire in the head. \u201cIs that a question or an accusation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich does it need to be?\u201d</p><p>I met this guy all of three days ago. She couldn\u2019t possibly think I had practiced making babies with him. \u201cI was talking about him kissing me, Pervert.\u201d</p><p>She wanted details. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed him back, which was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>She looked confused. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Why shouldn\u2019t it have happened and why was it a mistake?\u201d</p><p>Hello? Lights are on, anybody home? \u201cYou were there. You heard what Jessie said about him. He\u2019s a Playah. I asked him how many girls he had been with and he had no idea. Literally. He couldn\u2019t even take a guess at a number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie doesn\u2019t know either. I don\u2019t like it, but I put it out of my mind because I love him.</p><p>What was that supposed to mean? Was she comparing him to Jessie? \u201cIs that your way of defending The Sex Tricks Jedi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d She shrugged her shoulders and cocked her head to the side a little. \u201cI think you should give him a chance.\u201d</p><p>Where was this coming from? \u201cHe is not my type at all so why in the world would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t see the way you look at him and you don\u2019t see the way he looks at you when you\u2019re not looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think you haven\u2019t seen the way he looks at my legs.\u201d Okay, maybe that wasn\u2019t completely fair since I was the one that had called his attention to them.</p><p>\u201cLike he\u2019d be the first, Payton.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My phone rang and Claire jumped over me to grab it from the nightstand before I could. \u201cIt\u2019s him. I knew it would be,\u201d she sang as she waved my phone in front of my face.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna wanna talk about our kiss last night and I\u2019m not ready to go there so I\u2019m not answering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to because I am.\u201d I tried to reach out and grab my phone from her, but I missed and she slide the bar to answer his call. I\u2019m going to choke her.</p> <p>She put the phone up to her ear and gave me her best shit eating grin. \u201cHello, Nick.\u201d</p><p>What was she up to? She didn\u2019t answer my phone without motive.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is Claire. Payton is in the bathroom but she was just about to call you to see if you wanted to come swimming at her house today.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no she didn\u2019t. I reached out and slapped her across her leg. Everyone thought she was so innocent and perfect, but they were so wrong. I knew her well and she was a little devil.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. You can bring someone with you if you\u2019d like. We were thinking about one or one-thirty.\u201d</p> <p>I looked to see what time it was. Shiz, that was only a couple of hours from now.</p><p>\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll text you the directions to her house and we\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>She tossed my phone on the bed in my direction. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Was she serious? \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d</p><p>I huffed to show her my grievance against her. \u201cThanks a lot, Claire. Now, I\u2019ll be in a rush to get home and do my hair, shave everything and redo my toenails.\u201d I realized too late how I sounded after the words were out there.</p> <p>\u201cMy, my...someone\u2019s planning to go to an awful lot of trouble to look good for someone they don\u2019t like or want.\u201d</p><p>I really didn't want to hear Claire\u2019s gloating, mostly because somewhere deep down inside, I knew she was right. It didn\u2019t matter that Nick was all wrong for me; I wanted to see him today.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>After I rushed home from Claire\u2019s, I had about an hour and a half to do all the primping I had planned.</p><p>Yeah, I guessed it was silly to wash my hair only to dunk it in the pool, but I wanted to look great and dirty hair wasn\u2019t sexy.</p><p>After I got out of the shower, I painted my toenails first so they could dry while I got ready. I decided I didn\u2019t want to look too put together, so I pulled my hair into a ponytail and left off my usual make-up routine with the exception of my peachy lip gloss. It was a necessity I didn\u2019t go without.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even have to think about which swimsuit I wanted to wear. It was definitely my new white bikini because I had ulterior motive in mind; I wanted to see what Claire was talking about, how Nick looked at me when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking. What better way to get him to look my way than a string bikini?</p><p>\u201cPayton,\u201d I heard Claire call out from downstairs to let me know she and Jessie were at my house.</p> <p>\u201cBe right down. Go on around to the pool and I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>I checked myself one last time in the mirror and then threw my cover-up on over my bikini and slipped into my wedges. I checked the time when I got downstairs and saw that Nick could show at any minute.</p><p>I walked out by the pool and found Jessie putting sunscreen on Claire while Dane was busy working on the music. Who invited him?</p><p>\u201cMind if I crash your pool party?\u201d</p><p>Since when did Dane care if I minded? \u201cWould it matter if I minded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I hear Nick Hawke is coming. You\u2019ve got something going with him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most certainly do not.\u201d I wondered if my lie showed all over my face.</p><p>Jack Johnson\u2019s \u2018Sitting, Waiting, Wishing\u2019 started blaring from the speakers and I thought Dane couldn\u2019t have chosen a more appropriate song. \u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging. I think he\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my type. You know I wouldn\u2019t date a guy from Collinsville.\u201d I turned to Jessie when what I said registered. \u201cNo offense, Kimosabe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken, Miss Shallow.\u201d</p><p>He knew it pissed me off when he called me that. \u201cI\u2019m not shallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say. I\u2019ve not met anyone more shallow than you. But I still love \u2018ya even if Claire gives me no choice.\u201d</p><p>I shot him my favorite hand signal and walked over to the lounger and took off my cover-up as I thought about where I wanted to be when Nick got here. It was all about visuals with guys and I knew the perfect scene.</p><p>I heard the slam of a car door, and then another, so I leisurely stretched out on the lounger with one of my legs bent so he could see exactly how long my legs were. I tilted my face up toward the sun but not enough that I couldn\u2019t peek from behind my sunglasses to see his reaction when he came through the gate.</p><p>I heard the squeak of the iron gate as it swung open and I peered over to see him. Rats. Jessie and Claire met him when he walked through and blocked my view.</p><p>I held my position and waited. And waited. And then at the very moment I was ready to get up and strut over to him, I saw a beautiful brunette appear next to him.</p><p>Claire told him to bring someone with him, but I never considered he would after our kiss last night. What a tool! I saw Jessie hug the girl and that made it even worse because it meant he brought a Collinsville whore to my house.</p><p>I was glad to be wearing dark shades because they disguised my reaction to the brunette beauty, not that any of them were looking at me. I waited another minute or two and when Nick still didn\u2019t look my way, I grabbed my cover-up and went inside.</p><p>I slammed the door on the way in the house. Yeah, very toddler like I know, but I was pissed. I couldn\u2019t believe he brought a girl to my house. Who does that kind of thing? I\u2019ll tell you who...A guy that doesn\u2019t give a care in the world about me.</p><p>I wanted to kick or punch something, preferably Nick Hawke. Ugh! Why did I like that guy? He couldn\u2019t be more wrong for me. I didn\u2019t date guys without money or a place at the top of the social ladder. He didn\u2019t even have a spot on the bottom rung and he didn\u2019t care because he was unaware of the ladder\u2019s existence.</p><p>What was I thinking? I was still the one in control here. If Nick hurt me, it was because I let him and that was not the way this was about to go down. I had been there and stupidly done that with Cooper and I wasn\u2019t going to play that game again.</p><p>That was it. I was not going to sit in this house and feel sorry for myself while everyone else was outside having a great time. I was going out there and I was going to do it with my head held high, so I took off my cover-up and draped it over my arm.</p><p>I remained true to myself and made my grand entrance like I always did while I wore my best poker face. He wasn\u2019t going to see the wild card coming his way. He had another thing coming if he thought he could bring a girl to my house after he kissed me.</p><p>I strutted from the house to the pool and tossed my cover-up over the back of a patio chair. I glanced at Nick as he peered over his shades to check me out and he gave me that incredibly sexy grin that had become all too familiar but I didn\u2019t have a smile in return for him.</p><p>I turned my back on him and bent over to spread my towel across my chair. I bent a little further than I had to and it made my bikini bottom ride up a little so when I stood again, I slid my fingers just inside the edge of it and tugged as I wiggled my butt a little...just for him.</p><p>I stretched out on the lounger and tilted my face up toward the sun to show my lack of interest in Nick or his brunette companion, which had apparently done a disappearing act while I was inside the house formulating my plan of action.</p><p>My eyes were closed tightly and I willed myself not to look in his direction but I heard someone sit on the lounger next to me so I waited for the voice to identify its occupant.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doll Face. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t make a move to look in his direction and I blandly answered, \u201cIt\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I detected confusion in his voice. \u201cNope. What could possibly be wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You act like you\u2019re mad at me.\u201d</p><p>How perceptive of him. \u201cWhy would I possibly be mad at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Oh, come on. Really? \u201cWhere did your guest go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the pool house changing into her swimsuit.\u201d</p><p>Did he really not find this awkward? \u201cPlanning to introduce us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I was planning to when we got here, but you went inside. I\u2019ll introduce you when she comes out.\u201d</p><p>Miss Beautiful Brunette walked out of my pool house in an awesome red bikini and stopped to get her sunscreen out of her bag on the table on the other side of the pool where Dane, Jessie and Claire sat. I looked at how beautiful she was and I realized anger wasn\u2019t the only thing I was feeling. I was jealous and hurt and I despised it because I had no control over it.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to bask in the sun because of the two of us, I wasn\u2019t the snake here. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot for laying out. I\u2019m getting in the pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to come in with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what kind of game this is, but I\u2019ll play. So sure, join me in the pool if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is up with you?\u201d Nick reached for his shirt to pull it over his head and I got my first look at the amazing body hidden beneath his shirt, along with the huge black tribal tattoo wrapping around the left side of his ribcage to just below his heart and I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away because it was so hot.</p><p>He stared at me, waiting to hear me tell him what was going on with me, but all I could do was study the black ink wrapping around his torso. \u201cWhat is it with Collinsville guys and tattoos?\u201d</p><p>He looked down in the direction of his tattoo as if it might have changed from the last time he saw it. \u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I sure don\u2019t.\u201d Liar, liar, pants on fire and boy were they. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGirls always think it\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t so I guess I\u2019m a first. It looks skanky.\u201d Maybe lightning wouldn\u2019t strike me for telling such a boldfaced lie.</p><p>\u201cWow, tell me how you really feel.\u201d</p> <p>I rolled my eyes and then headed for the pool with Nick hot on my heels. \u201cYou act like you don\u2019t want me here. Has something happened since you invited me?\u201d</p><p>I whirled around on him. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you and I certainly didn\u2019t invite your date. It was all Claire\u2019s idea. Remember? That\u2019s who you talked to, not me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at me. He freakin\u2019 laughed at me. \u201cMy date? Is that what\u2019s going on here? You\u2019re mad because I brought a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know you kissed her hostess last night?\u201d</p><p>He was amused, but I wasn\u2019t. \u201cNo, I didn't tell her we kissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t kiss. You kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recall you kissing me back.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I did, but it was such a mistake on my part. \u201cIf I did, and I\u2019m not saying I did, I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>I tried to turn away, but he caught me by the hand and pulled me toward him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna kiss you again and next time you won\u2019t call me \u2018friend\u2019 afterwards.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was why he brought a date to my house. He was mad about being called \u2018friend\u2019? \u201cThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re mad because I addressed you as \u2018friend\u2019 in my text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here but one thing is for sure. I didn\u2019t like being referred to as a simple friend after our amazing kiss.\u201d</p> <p>What the hell? \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here either but I sure think it\u2019s wrong for you bring a date to my house after last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous.\u201d</p><p>Damn skippy I was jealous but I would die before I admitted it. \u201cI\u2019m not. I just think it proves what a Playah you are and confirms all the reasons why I\u2019ll never go out with you.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling, or maybe it could be called some form of gloating. \u201cDallas,\u201d he called out as he waved over the brunette and I immediately wanted to cringe because I remembered that name. Stupid! Why had I been too dumb to consider that he brought his sister? Because I was too wrapped up in my own hurt and preconceived notions to consider the possibility that maybe he wasn\u2019t trying to play me after all.</p><p>12 Cracked Glass</p><p>Nick</p><p>Payton Archer had a jealous streak when it came to seeing me with another girl and I couldn\u2019t be happier about that. She was caving whether she wanted to or not and that meant I was one step closer to having her. \u201cPayton, this is my sister, Dallas.\u201d</p><p>Payton\u2019s face was red, but it wasn\u2019t from the sun or the heat. She was blushing because her jealous anger had revealed more than she intended. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to meet you, Dallas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for inviting me.\u201d Payton\u2019s eyes shot to mine and begged me to not say otherwise. \u201cYour house is gorgeous and this pool is to die for. This is where I would spend every minute of summer if it were in my backyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you were able to come and please make yourself at home.\u201d I pointed in the direction of the pool house. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of drinks and snacks in the kitchen, so help yourself to anything you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I wouldn\u2019t care for anything right now. I\u2019m dying to get in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Dane yelled as he ran toward the pool to do a cannonball. After his big splash, he came up and ran his hands over his hair from front to back pushing the water away from his face.</p><p>Payton shook her head and rolled her eyes. \u201cVery mature, Dane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarning...if you didn\u2019t think that was mature, you probably won\u2019t think this is either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d I surprised her and she let out a loud screech when I grabbed her around the waist and pulled her into the pool with me. I held her against me as we fell into the water and then bobbed up to the surface.</p><p>She came up and gasped for air. \u201cI should put my knee in your nuts for that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t let go of her, but I twisted my torso to protect my jewels because I wasn\u2019t sure she wouldn\u2019t decide to go for it. Who knew with this wildcat?</p><p>Jessie got up from the table where he and Claire were sitting and pulled his shirt off. \u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>Claire put a death grip on the arms of the chair she was sitting in and looked up at Jessie. \u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know exactly what I\u2019m gonna do and you should, too. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never thrown you over my shoulder before, Princess, so let go of the chair.\u201d</p><p>Dane yelled out across the pool. \u201cAwww, yeah. Free show. This oughta be good.\u201d</p><p>I saw the challenge in Claire\u2019s eyes daring Jessie to try to pull her from that chair and knew she wasn\u2019t going easily. Jessie squatted in front of her so they could be eye level with each other. \u201cWe can do this the easy way or the hard way. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and stared him in the eyes, challenging him to try to forcefully move her. \u201cYou know I always choose hard.\u201d</p><p>He nipped her on her bottom lip with his mouth and she yelped. \u201cAnd that\u2019s only one of the many things I love about you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it that you think you\u2019re gonna get me to let go of this chair without prying my hands free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not prying anything. You\u2019re going to take your hands off the chair using your own free will.\u201d</p><p>She suspiciously narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to help you let go.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a stubborn grin. \u201cYou just think you are, but it\u2019s not happening, Dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, have it your way.\u201d He reached up and very slowly began to pull the tie to her bikini top behind her neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve got about five seconds before your top drops to your waist. What\u2019s it gonna be? Let it drop or let go of the chair to grab it before it falls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessie Dewayne Boone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Dane or Hawke seeing what\u2019s mine because I know you\u2019re gonna be a good girl and grab your top before it falls. When you do, I\u2019m throwing you over my shoulder and hauling you into that swimming pool.\u201d</p><p>Claire kicked and squirmed as he pulled and slowly counted. \u201cThree. Two. One.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head, just in case Claire proved to be as stubborn as her bestie and the whole thing happened as fast as lightning. Claire apparently reached for her top before it fell so Jessie grabbed her and threw her over his shoulder just like he promised with one exception. He walked past the pool without tossing her in. \u201cSorry to interrupt the show, but we\u2019ll be inside for a few minutes because there\u2019s a little business we need to take care of.\u201d</p><p>Claire slapped him across his back and it made a loud sound. \u201cJessie!\u201d</p><p>I knew the type of business they were about to take care of. Boone was about to find out how good Claire\u2019s little black bikini looked when it was tossed on the floor. He was one lucky bastard, but I was certain Claire\u2019s crumpled black bikini was no comparison to how the white one in front of me now would look.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>It had been at least an hour and a half without any sign of Jessie or Claire, but I didn\u2019t care because it wasn\u2019t their company I craved.</p><p>Dane and Dallas slowly migrated from us on the pool steps to the seat in the deep end of the pool and I strongly suspected we were witnessing the beginning of something starting between the two of them. That was cool by me because I liked Dane. He was a nice guy and we would get along fine as long as he didn\u2019t do anything to hurt my sister.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little hungry. Wanna grab a snack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I dare say that there\u2019s nothing in the world that could hold a candle to the sight of water rushing down Payton Archer\u2019s ass when she got out of the pool. I almost, key word being almost, wished I hadn\u2019t seen how fine it looked because it had me adjusting myself in my swim trunks behind Payton\u2019s back as I followed her to the pool house to get something to eat.</p><p>She handed me a cola and chips and I sat down on a couch in what Payton called an outdoor room. Yeah, a freakin\u2019 outdoor room with furniture, a kickin\u2019 stereo system and a flat screen.</p><p>She pulled out a remote and pointed it toward a receiver below the flatscreen. \u201cWhat do you wanna hear?\u201d</p><p>I wanted some great make out music, but I doubted she would go along with that. \u201cSurprise me.\u201d</p><p>She had a mischievous grin to appear on her face. \u201cYou know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Here\u2019s a band I bet you won\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I listened for a minute and didn\u2019t recognize the song. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Never heard this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Civil Twilight and you\u2019re gonna become very familiar with them if you hang with me for long. They\u2019re my favorite band.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I could become very familiar with Civil Twilight. That wasn\u2019t a problem for me.</p><p>She pointed the remote toward the receiver to turn the volume down and then sat in the chair across from me, which was really disappointing because it would be hard to kiss her from that far away. She popped the top on her drink and then looked up at me as she opened her chips. \u201cTell me about your tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Her question caught me off guard and caused me to choke a little on the cola I had turned up. It took a few seconds, but I finally managed to stop coughing so I could speak. \u201cSorry. Went down the wrong way. What do you want to know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the general stuff like when did you get it? Why did you choose that design and what does it mean?\u201d</p><p>How did I answer that? There was nothing general about my ink or her questions regarding it. I had never been asked to explain the particulars of it; she was the first. My own family had never even asked although I was fairly certain they probably all understood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t sure I trusted her enough to tell her the specifics of what drove me to mark myself in such a permanent way, so I decided generic was the way to go with my answers. \u201cI got it the day I turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was when?\u201d</p><p>Hmm. She wanted to know when my birthday was and I found myself liking that. \u201cSeptember 27th. I know, a painful birthday present to myself, right?\u201d</p> <p>She looked at it curiously from where she sat. \u201cI could think of less painful gifts. What does it mean?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to tell her what it said because having her read it herself would be my chance to bring her closer to where I wanted her. I stretched with my arm over my head. \u201cCome read it for yourself.\u201d</p><p>She got up and came to sit next to me on the couch before she cocked her head to the side to read the swirling words. \u201cOh, cool. I couldn\u2019t tell that there were words mingled in the design from a distance. I thought it was only artwork.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to place her finger on the first word. \u201cI was lying when I said I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d Her fingertip gently followed the text as she read it aloud, \u201cLove is delicate as glass; once broken it can be fixed, but there will always be cracks.\u201d</p><p>The soft gliding touch of her fingertip trailing along my skin sent tingles down my body and ignited flames in my gut. When she finished reading it, she left her finger against my skin and looked up at me. \u201cThese aren\u2019t random words. They mean something very significant to you.\u201d</p> <p>Very significant was the understatement of the millennium and the moment we were sharing quickly became very serious. I suddenly found myself in a place I didn\u2019t want to be. It was a dangerous spot because I didn\u2019t share that part of myself with anyone.</p><p>She put her finger against the part that said \u2018Love\u2019 just below my heart and rubbed as if she might be able to wipe the ugly away. \u201cYou didn\u2019t randomly choose this. This is here because someone hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I had been naked with plenty of girls, but I had never allowed one of them to read my tattoo and we definitely never discussed it. I closed my eyes, trying to escape this first time conversation I had ignited by asking her to take a closer look. When she didn\u2019t say anything more, I opened my eyes and she was still sitting on the edge of the couch looking at me.</p><p>She licked her lips as she looked at my mouth. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk about it if you don\u2019t want to. I can think of something else I rather do.\u201d</p><p>I heard my heart throbbing loudly in my ears and I thought I would die if I didn\u2019t get my lips against hers soon. I reached for the back of her neck and pulled her closer as I scooted in her direction on the sofa.</p><p>Although I had been with lots of girls, I normally didn\u2019t kiss them longer than I felt obligated to and sometimes I didn\u2019t at all if I could get away with it. It felt too intimate and emotional for me, much more so than sex, so I simply didn\u2019t do it if I didn\u2019t have to.</p> <p>Give me ten seconds. That\u2019s all I needed before I was reaching for panties but Payton made kissing feel different for me. I liked it and I was content to make out with her all day without taking it all the way.</p><p>Her lips left mine and she trailed kisses along my chin and jaw until her mouth reached the side of my neck. I rested my head on the back of the couch to give her full access and she took advantage.</p><p>I knew I had lied to myself when her lips hit that sensitive spot below my ear. It\u2019s true; I could make out with Payton all day, but who was I kidding? She had flipped my on switch.</p><p>\u201cPayton, I mean this in the best possible way, but...you\u2019re killing me here,\u201d I groaned under my breath. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me so turned on, I\u2019m about to bust the seams in my swim trunks.\u201d</p><p>I heard her giggle. \u201cIs that so?\u201d she asked between kisses on my neck. \u201cI\u2019d love to see your version of The Incredible Hulk.\u201d</p><p>This girl was trying to kill me and I was definitely interested in seeing if she would succeed, but then we heard the door leading into the house swing open and we scrambled like a pair of kids trying to look like nothing in particular was going on.</p><p>Awesome. Jessie and Claire had been in the house almost two hours and they chose now to come out.</p><p>I scooted away from Payton to the opposite end of the couch and pointed at the stack of throw pillows behind her. \u201cToss me one of those pillows.\u201d</p> <p>She shrugged and then gave me a questioning expression as she reached for one. \u201cWhy? You gonna take a nap or something?\u201d</p><p>I pointed toward the crotch of my trunks and she laughed as she tossed it in my direction. \u201cThrow pillow, AKA boner barrier.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling at her. \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d hate to know how many inconvenient hard-ons this girl had caused. The number would no doubt be tremendous and I felt a jealous twinge as I thought about it.</p><p>She smiled back. \u201cOh, but I disagree, Hulk.\u201d</p><p>13 Adrenaline Junkie</p><p>Payton</p><p>Did I just attach my lips to Nick Hawke\u2019s neck like a Dyson vacuum? Why, yes I did and I apparently did a bang up job at it according to the smile on his face.</p><p>He lounged against the back of the couch smiling as we waited for Jessie and Claire to find us after they discovered we weren\u2019t in the pool. I looked at him and couldn\u2019t contain my smile about the little secret he was trying to hide under the throw pillow I tossed him. I should have felt bad about it, but I couldn\u2019t because I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of making out with him.</p><p>After Jessie and Claire found us, Jessie plopped down between us on the couch and looked over at the pillow casually across Nick\u2019s lap. Yep, he had to at least suspect the reason behind its strategic placement. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Hawke?\u201d</p><p>Nick dropped his arm across the pillow like he was afraid Jessie might jerk it away at any minute. \u201cAwe, not much. Got tired of being in the pool and thought we\u2019d watch a little television while we grabbed a snack.\u201d</p><p>Wrong answer. Come on, Nick. You couldn\u2019t watch a TV that wasn\u2019t on.</p><p>Jessie looked up the television mounted on the corner of the house. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a black screen?\u201d</p><p>Nick ran his hand through his hair and laughed. \u201cMy bad. I meant listening to umm...Civil Twilight.</p><p>Jessie looked toward the pool. \u201cWhere\u2019d Dane and Dallas go?\u201d</p><p>Nick and I turned to find the pair in the pool, but there was no sign of them and I did the answering this time since Nick failed question one. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Guess they\u2019re taking a break from swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you not see them get out of the pool if all you were doing was sitting here listening to music while you grabbed a snack?\u201d Jessie reached over and grabbed Nick\u2019s kneecap and gave it a hard squeeze. \u201cSounds to me like you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Nick jerked and grabbed Jessie by the wrist to make him stop squeezing as he groaned, \u201cDamn, Dude. Let go.\u201d</p><p>Claire rolled her eyes as she looked at me and got up to get a drink from the pool house. \u201cLeave him alone, Jess. They can do whatever they want to do.\u201d</p><p>Jessie reluctantly obeyed Claire and released Nick\u2019s kneecap. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself, Princess. He made messin\u2019 with him too easy. Seriously, Dude...you\u2019re sporting that whole \u2018two year-old caught with his hand in the cookie jar\u2019 look very well.\u201d Jessie gave Nick an elbow to the ribs and looked over at me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m about to say this, but you\u2019re slippin\u2019, Dude.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to not notice the way Nick didn\u2019t deny Jessie\u2019s claim about him slippin\u2019. I realized I liked the idea of possibly being the reason why. I wanted to spend more time with him so I could explore this thing between us. My mind immediately began reeling with all the ways I could accomplish that but I had to put those thoughts on hold when Dane and Dallas came through the gate from wherever they had been.</p><p>Claire came out of the pool house from getting her drink and saw Dane and Dallas coming across the backyard. \u201cWell, look who just magically reappeared.\u201d</p><p>Dane lifted a brow at Claire. \u201cI believe I could say the same thing about you and Jessie since you disappeared for like, what? Two hours?\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at Jessie and they both grinned. \u201cNo way it was more than 30 minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure. If you say so.\u201d Dane chivalrously offered the only remaining chair to Dallas and then sat next to her on the ottoman. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? A meeting of the minds?</p><p>\u201cYeah and that\u2019s why you weren\u2019t invited. Where\u2019ve you been, Underthinker?</p><p>He lifted his phone to show me. \u201cLeft it in the car and I\u2019m expecting a call from Paxton about plans for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we hang out here tonight since my parents are still gone,\u201d I suggested. \u201cWe could cook.\u201d</p><p>Claire knew I couldn\u2019t cook so I wasn\u2019t surprised when she called me out about my suggestion. \u201cSince when do you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I would cook. I said \u2018we\u2019 would cook.\u201d</p><p>The girl wasn\u2019t salutatorian for nothing. She could add one and one. \u201cMeaning you want me to cook.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and acted innocent just to piss her off. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re volunteering, then \u2018yes.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do. We have dinner plans with my parents. Remember? They arranged dinner with Uncle Bill so he could talk to Jessie about law school and we can\u2019t blow it off.\u201d</p><p>Dallas looked at Nick apologetically. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve gotta get back because I have plans with Ashley and Hailey.</p><p>Well, shit. That didn\u2019t go the way I wanted.</p><p>\u201cI could drive Dallas home if Nick wants to stay,\u201d Dane volunteered and confirmed my suspicions that he might want to get to know Nick\u2019s sister better.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t even think it over. \u201cWould you mind, Dallie?</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d Dallas looked at Dane and gave him a sweet smile. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We were alone at my house and I suddenly panicked. What was I thinking? This was a terrible idea. It was crazy for me to be alone with Nick after I got so carried away with him earlier. If I went that far with people here, what would I do without them?</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t my only problem. I invited Nick to stay for dinner and I couldn\u2019t boil water on my best day. \u201cClaire wasn\u2019t kiddin\u2019 about me not being able to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. No one grills a better steak than me, so if you can wrap foil around some potatoes, we\u2019re good.\u201d</p> <p>I relaxed a little because he seemed to have steak on his mind, not sex. That worked for me because steak wouldn\u2019t get me in trouble. \u201cDo you want to go to the market now so we can have an early dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. That works for me because I\u2019m getting hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Just give me a minute to get dressed.\u201d I went upstairs and quickly changed out of my swimsuit into a casual sundress and sandals. I sprayed my hair with a little spritz and let it do its natural wavy thing instead of pulling the curl out with the straightening iron like I usually did. I spritzed myself with my favorite peach and cherry blossom body spray and then applied a fresh coat of lip gloss and I was ready to roll.</p><p>I saw Nick\u2019s face as he watched me come down the staircase and I could see that he was surprised by the change in my appearance. \u201cYour hair...it\u2019s curly. Another surprise.\u201d His smile grew and he reached out to pull some over my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>I went to get my purse and keys and wondered which car we would take. \u201cWant to take my car or yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll take mine.\u201d</p><p>I liked it when he drove, so that was fine by me. I walked over and set the security alarm for the countdown. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>As Nick had previously done, he opened the car door for me but this time I was expecting the drop to the passenger seat. \u201cI think I did that a little more gracefully this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you do is ungraceful,\u201d he said huskily before he shut my door.</p><p>Nick used the drive to the supermarket to quiz me about Dane because he thought Dallas was interested in him. He wanted to know how many girls Dane had dated and if he had ever cheated on one. He fit the role of protective older brother perfectly and it made me see a side of him I liked even more.</p> <p>We went inside the supermarket and pushing a shopping cart with Nick felt so strange and...domestic. Going into a grocery store wasn\u2019t something I had ever done on a date. Wait. Was this a date? If it wasn\u2019t a date, what was it?</p><p>Nick insisted on fresh cuts, so we were waiting for the butcher to slice our steaks and I decided I wanted to surprise Nick with a dessert. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and down the aisles but came up blank. I only entered the kitchen to eat and not cook so I texted Claire for an idea.</p><p>Being the perfect little Suzy Homemaker that she was, she instantly texted back, \u201cStrawberries, pound cake &amp; whipped cream. No cooking required.\u201d</p><p>I loved her. She had the answer to everything.</p><p>After getting the cake and whipped cream, I walked to the produce area to get the strawberries and noticed a pretty girl watching Nick at the meat counter. When she pulled her compact out of her purse and applied lipstick, I knew she was about to approach him and my possessive inner biotch surfaced.</p><p>I eased over closer to her. \u201cHe\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>She jerked around to look at me and her expression told me that she thought I was strange for approaching her. I looked around as if I was afraid I might be overheard and leaned in to whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad he has the crabs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she screeched.</p><p>I leaned in a little closer. \u201cIt\u2019s true. He gave my friend the crabs and it took weeks for her to get rid of them. She didn\u2019t know what it was and someone told her the only way to get rid of them was to put alcohol on them. Let\u2019s just say that everyone in a five mile radius had to cover their ears. I don\u2019t care how hot he is, no guy is worth the crabs.\u201d</p><p>She promptly closed her compact and slipped it back into her purse. \u201cGee, thanks for the heads up.\u201d</p><p>I held my palm up for a high five. \u201cMy pleasure. Chicks before dicks, am I right?\u201d</p><p>She reached up and her palm met mine with a loud slap. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She went on her merry way and I laughed as I searched through the strawberries for the best looking ones. That was so wrong of me but it served that chick right for what she thought she was about to do with my Nick.</p><p>My Nick? Where had that thought come from?</p><p>My stomach did a flip as I thought about how that kind of thing probably happened to him all the time, girls throwing themselves at him. No wonder he had an unknown number.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I heard him ask when he walked up behind me.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the ingredients in my arms. \u201cStrawberry Shortcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. No cooking involved. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhip cream is always okay with me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes got big and so did his smile.</p><p>Whip cream is always okay with me. Was he talking about food or something entirely different? My mind was obviously in the gutter because on the ride home, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the soft, sweet cream and all the ways I could use it.</p><p>I had to get my mind out of the gutter. \u201cWhy do you race? Is it for the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe money is nice, but I have a little habit I can\u2019t kick.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. Was he on something? Marijuana? Heroine? Meth?</p><p>He started laughing when he saw the look on my face. \u201cDon\u2019t look so scared.\u201d</p><p>Drugs were a deal breaker for me. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re talking about and then I\u2019ll decide if I should be scared or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adrenalin junkie. I love endorphins. And they\u2019re not illegal. I discovered the feeling when I was a kid. I started out with trick skating. I liked the feeling I got from tricks on ramps. The ramps kept getting bigger and bigger and I moved up to BMX stunts and Motorcross. It takes more for me to achieve that rush so I\u2019ve escalated to street racing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next? Stunts with planes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one day.\"</p><p>He was serious. \u201cIs that the real reason you want to be a police officer? You need that rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>He was so cryptic. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you just go bungee jump or something like that?\u201d</p><p>He was quick to answer. \u201cDone it.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I should have guessed that one. \u201cYou\u2019re weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it \u2018til you\u2019ve tried it.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was on to something. \u201cYour car has a lot of power.\u201d</p><p>He grinned because he liked that I noticed. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly legal. It has a lot of bells and whistles I\u2019ve added to it.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the way his car made me feel the night I had to drive him home. \u201cWhen I drove your car, I liked the way I felt when I was in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? You could be a closet adrenaline junkie.\u201d</p><p>I looked around at the Highway we were on and didn\u2019t see any other cars. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me and then back at the road. \u201cShow you what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get what I was talking about. \u201cHow fast you go when you race.\u201d He looked back at me to see if I was serious and I gave him a wink. \u201cGive me a rush.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling, dimples and all. He was proud of what he could do and he wanted to do it with me in the car. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Show me what this mutha can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed the edge of my seat and felt my entire body tense as he sped faster and faster down the highway. It felt like we might lift off the ground any minute. \u201cShit! How fast are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeedometer cuts off at 120. I\u2019m guessing around 140 miles per hour, but that\u2019s as fast as I\u2019m taking it with you in here.\u201d</p><p>He started slowing down, but I wasn\u2019t finished getting my rush so I lowered my window. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>I unbuckled and got up on my knees to put my head out the window. He was right. I liked this rush thing. I kicked my shoes off and pushed up until I was sitting on the door ledge. I raised my arms up and let the wind completely take me over. It was so exciting I couldn\u2019t contain my squeal. \u201cWoo hoo.\u201d</p><p>I felt the car slowing down. \u201cShit, girl. You\u2019re crazy. Get your ass back in this car before you swallow a bug.\u201d</p><p>I slid back in the car like a Duke and pulled the visor mirror down so I could try to tame my wild hair. \u201cThat rocked.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I had calmed down from my rush by the time we got back to my house. We hit the kitchen as soon as we got back and started getting dinner ready. I washed the potatoes and wrapped them in foil first and then washed and cut the strawberries while Nick prepped our steaks. Surely, I couldn\u2019t mess that up and I silently prayed I didn\u2019t; I didn\u2019t want him to think I was a total flake.</p><p>\u201cThese won\u2019t be as good as they would have been if they had marinated longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to let me grill for you when they have time to marinate overnight.\u201d</p><p>That meant getting together again. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>He went outside to light the grill while I finished cutting the strawberries and I watched him through the window as I stood in front of the kitchen sink. I remembered what Claire told me about the way he looked at me when he thought I wasn\u2019t looking and I dared say I probably had the same look on my face right now.</p><p>An hour later, we ate dinner and Nick was true to his word. No one grilled a better steak than him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kiddin\u2019 You\u2019re quite the skilled grillsman. I ate the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned from watching my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your dad. He was really nice to me the night he drove me home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He half-smiled and then quickly changed the subject. \u201cWhat about dessert? I want you to show me your culinary skills.\u201d</p><p>There was little skill involved in what I had done. \u201cYou mean lack of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p> <p>He was placing way too much confidence in my abilities because he\u2019d never seen me in action in the kitchen. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s very true, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any danger with the strawberry shortcake.\u201d</p><p>I cut two slices of pound cake and then topped them with whipped cream and strawberries before I placed his in front of him. \u201cBon app\u00e9tit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks great.\u201d</p><p>I tried to make it pretty and I guess I didn\u2019t do a terrible job but it didn\u2019t look like anything I\u2019d ever gotten in a restaurant. Hopefully, I didn\u2019t screw it up royally in the taste department.</p><p>I waited for him to take the first bite because I was too nervous to try it myself. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p> <p>I felt relief wash over me. \u201cReally? You\u2019re not just saying that to keep from hurting my feelings, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really is good. I promise. Here. Have a bite.\u201d He reached over and offered to feed me a bite of his although I had my own right in front of me. Shiz, that was sexy. The thought of putting my mouth where his had been caused my stomach to do another one of those fluttery things.</p><p>My eyes never left his as I leaned closer and took the bite he offered. He watched my mouth as I licked my lips and I hoped he offered me another bite because it was so damn sexy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a little...\u201d he said as he pointed to the corner of his mouth.</p><p>I reached with my finger to one corner of my mouth and slid it downward.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he said huskily as he leaned over and kissed my mouth. \u201cTastes even sweeter this way,\u201d he whispered as he smiled against my mouth and that was it; I was a lost. I was his puppet and he was my master; he could do with me what he wanted.</p> <p>Nick\u2019s mouth was still against mine and I could feel the warm rush of his breath against my lips and I suddenly wanted a dessert that didn\u2019t include strawberry shortcake. \u201cWhat do you think of a night swim?\u201d</p><p>He smiled against my lips. \u201cI think I like that idea very much.\u201d</p><p>I nibbled my bottom lip for a second as I convinced myself to back away. \u201cGive me a minute to change.\u201d</p><p>I dashed up the stairs and heard the kitchen faucet running and dishes clanking so I knew Nick was clearing the table and rinsing the dishes. He was hot as hell and considerate. Could this get any better?</p><p>I looked at my still wet white bikini and wondered if it was worth putting the cold thing back on or if I should get a dry one. Nick loved it on me, so I decided it was definitely worth the freeze I\u2019d get when it hit my body. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t last but a minute.</p><p>I looked in the mirror and my eyes were immediately drawn to my very noticeably erect nipples. I hadn\u2019t planned to put my cover up back on but I guessed I would until those things decided to calm down.</p><p>I walked into the kitchen and Nick had it completely cleared with our dishes in the dishwasher. \u201cThank you, but you\u2019re my guest and you didn\u2019t have to do that. I would have gotten it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no problem. I\u2019m used to it since it\u2019s me, my Dad, Jake and Dallas.\u201d</p> <p>His mom. He didn\u2019t talk about her and I wondered why. Maybe she passed away and it was too painful for him to talk about. I\u2019d ask him about that later, but not now. I didn\u2019t want to spend this time alone talking about parents.</p><p>We walked out and I flipped the pool light on. Going into the pool this time was different; it wasn\u2019t quite so playful as we eased down the steps into the shallow end.</p><p>I dropped down until the water covered my shoulders and then dipped my head backwards. I rose up and pushed the water away from my face. \u201cI love to swim at night.\u201d</p><p>He wasted no time getting in my space as he bobbed up and down in front of me. \u201cI\u2019ve never swam at night, but I think I\u2019m gonna like it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He reached out and grabbed my waist, pulling me close to him, and I couldn\u2019t resist putting my arms around his shoulders as we both stood on our knees in the shallow end.</p><p>It was a gentle kiss, very much like the others we had shared. His lips moved slowly and deliberately as his tongue entered my mouth and rhythmically danced with mine. His lips moved from my mouth to my chin toward my neck under my ear and I tilted my head to the side to encourage more of what he was doing.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, the distinct line of what Nick was to me had changed. I couldn\u2019t pinpoint the moment he had gone from being nothing I wanted to everything I didn\u2019t want to live without and it scared the hell out of me. I was terrified of his past and afraid of being used up and tossed aside like he had done so many times before.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019ve backed me into a corner.\u201d It came as a whisper from his mouth against the skin on my neck.</p><p>\u201cUmm, I think I\u2019m the one that has my back against the corner of the pool.\u201d</p><p>He stopped kissing my neck and put both of his hands on my face. His eyes watched mine as he searched for an answer to a question I didn\u2019t hear him speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking about the way you make me feel.\u201d He rubbed his thumbs over my cheek bones. \u201cWe have a connection and I\u2019ve never felt that with anyone before you.\u201d</p><p>My jealous chord was struck. We might both like to feel a rush, but that wasn\u2019t the only way he had connected with someone before. \u201cI highly doubt that. I think you\u2019ve been very connected to a countless number of girls according to your own confession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Payton, this isn\u2019t me bullshitting you so I can screw you. I want to tell you how I feel about you and you don\u2019t make it very easy when you say stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. He wasn\u2019t playing with me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you were being serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re not together, I want to be. When we\u2019re not touching, I hold out hope for just the slightest, accidental graze. You\u2019re all I think about and it\u2019s because my whole world is falling for you. Hard.\u201d</p><p>14 I\u2019ll Teach You</p><p>Nick</p><p>Oh, shit. I just told Payton I was falling in love with her. Well, not in those words exactly, but close enough for her to get the gist.</p><p>I was still holding her face in my hands and I cringed as I waited for her to tell me how she felt. I looked in her eyes and she didn\u2019t say a word. That\u2019s when I realized the truth. She wasn\u2019t saying anything because she didn\u2019t feel the same and I had screwed up big time.</p><p>What was I thinking? I had hoped for something that was never gonna happen. A girl like Payton would never go for a guy like me. Jessie told me she and I would never happen and I should have listened, but I couldn't consider the possibility because I was too busy being a pompous ass in thinking no girl would turn me down.</p><p>I waited a few more painful seconds and Payton still said nothing, so I became resigned to the truth. She didn\u2019t feel the same about me and I suddenly felt stupid because I had gone against all of my own rules and opened myself up only to be hurt.</p><p>I swallowed the pain of her rejection and took my hands from her face as I pulled away. I was desperate to get out of there and away from her, but she quickly reached her arms up around my shoulders and stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI want to be the only one you think about.\u201d She gently pressed her lips to mine. \u201cBut let\u2019s be clear about one thing. I won\u2019t be just another one.\u201d</p><p>I pulled her closely and pressed my forehead to hers as I made a vow. \u201cNever, Doll Face. I swear.\u201d</p><p>It felt like only minutes had passed as we made out in the pool, but it was almost midnight when Payton checked the time. \u201cOh, shit. It\u2019s midnight and I told Aunt Tillie I would come to her house tonight. I need to check my phone because I bet she has called a thousand times. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a quick kiss before she got out of the pool and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from watching her as she walked up the steps out of the pool and grabbed a towel. God, what I wouldn\u2019t give to be that towel right now.</p><p>I knew our night swim was over since it was so late and because she had somewhere to be. I got out and dried off while she was talking on the phone and was finishing up as she came out of the house.</p><p>\u201cI told Aunt Tillie I would be there in a little while and she\u2019s cool with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t get you in trouble with your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She\u2019s the total opposite. She has helped me out of hot water with them more than one time. Man, I wished my mom was more like her.\u201d She threw her head over and shook her hair out before she twisted it up in her towel. \u201cYou wanna come up with me while I pack a bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I\u2019d do anything if it meant I got to spend more time with Payton.</p><p>I followed her up the stairs into her bedroom and saw Fair Bear sitting in the middle of a dozen pillows on a luxurious bed. Lucky Bear. \u201cHe looks really out of place on your fancy bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bed\u2019s not fancy. You can sit on it while I pack.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the sleek comforter and thought about the mark my wet trunks would leave on it. \u201cPayton, your bed is fancy and my trunks are wet so I\u2019m not sitting on it.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the bag in her hand on the floor and walked over to where I stood by her bed and shoved me backwards so that I fell right in the middle. \u201cTell me you won\u2019t sit on it and I\u2019ll make you lie on it.\u201d</p><p>God, this girl was impossible.</p><p>I sat up on the edge of her bed and watched her while she finished packing her bag. \u201cWhen will your parents be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I talk you into spending tomorrow with me since they won\u2019t be here?\u201d</p><p>She grinned as she looked at me. \u201cPossibly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll possibly need to pack something casual like a T-shirt, jeans and sneakers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That peaked her curiosity. \u201cAnd why do I need to be casual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause those tall ass heels and short skirts you like to wear won\u2019t be too appropriate for what I have planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh...mysterious.\u201d She went into her walk in closet and came out holding a T-shirt with a pair of jeans thrown over her arm. She folded the shirt and put it in a bag I was sure cost more than my entire wardrobe. \u201cI\u2019m dying to know. Can I have a little hint?\u201d</p><p>I was titanium and there was no way I was giving her one little detail. \u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>She put her bag on her dresser and came over to stand between my knees. She poked her bottom lip out at me and I was positive it wasn\u2019t the first time she had used her beautiful pouty face to get what she wanted. \u201cNot even one little \u2018ole hint?\u201d</p><p>She sat across my lap with her arm around my shoulders and nibbled my earlobe. Although I recognized it for the tactical move it was, she was irresistible and I couldn\u2019t reframe myself from giving in to her just a little bit. \u201cOkay. One hint and that\u2019s all you\u2019re gettin\u2019. I\u2019m going to show you one of the things I like to do for fun.\u201d</p><p>She moved further down on my neck. \u201cSo, I get a glimpse into Nick Hawke\u2019s life. Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, you\u2019ll have to wait and find out tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She shoved me back on the bed again and crawled over me. I lifted my head from her bed to kiss her and she backed away just barely out of my reach to tease me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until tomorrow to find out.\u201d</p><p>I tried to kiss her again and she barely got away from me, so I reached for the back of her neck and pulled her down until we were eye to eye. \u201cI said you\u2019d find out tomorrow. Now, stop teasing me and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you when you tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>That little vixen. She just thought she was going to tease me and hold her kisses hostages in exchange for information. Well, I had news for her; two could play this game.</p><p>I sat up and grabbed her by the waist to quickly flip her onto her back before she squealed. \u201cNick!\u201d</p><p>I crawled up her still bikini clad body the way she had mine, except my mouth was only millimeters from her skin. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to beg for mercy now.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was trembling. \u201cWhat are you gonna do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish what you started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the word finish, I hope you don\u2019t mean us having sex because we\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you got that right, Doll Face. We\u2019re definitely not having sex tonight.\u201d I put my mouth over her ear and whispered, \u201cNot even when you beg me to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>I heard her sharp intake of breath and I smiled. I had succeeded in shocking her, but it didn\u2019t last for long because only a second later she was trying her hand at a comeback for me. \u201cI hardly think that I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d I didn\u2019t give her the chance to finish because I put my finger to her lips.</p><p>She opened her mouth and drew a breath to say something else, but I covered her lips with mine before the words could escape. I lightly feathered her mouth with kisses and then took advantage when she opened enough to allow my tongue access.</p><p>Her heart was against my chest and my lips were pressed to her neck when I started my Southward journey. I heard her breathing become increasingly louder and her chest began to rise and fall harder when my mouth paused just above the top of her bikini. I stopped, giving her the time she needed to tell me to go no further, but she didn\u2019t so I pressed on and continued my journey in exploring her beautiful body.</p> <p>I reminded myself of how Payton was different from the fast girls I was used to so I proceeded with great caution because I didn\u2019t want to scare her. I spread my fingers and placed my hands around each side of her ribcage as I went lower on her body. I let my thumbs lightly touch the under edge of her breasts while my tongue tasted the spot between them. I felt her heart beating a million times a minute under my mouth as she bent her knees upward and apart so my body could fall in between them.</p><p>When I finished giving her breasts the attention they deserved, I slid lower down her body to her stomach and I dipped my tongue in her bellybutton so I could see her squirm and she didn\u2019t disappoint me.</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh. Ooh.\u201d That was the sound of reassurance and it meant I was doing something very right.</p><p>She jerked beneath me and arched her back as my mouth moved down to her hipbones just above the waist of her bikini bottom sitting low on her hips. I didn\u2019t try to slide it down, but I wanted to when I kissed her groin through the damp white material.</p><p>\u201cShall I stop?\u201d I whispered as my mouth moved across the top of her pelvic bone.</p><p>I managed to make out the sound of a \u2018no\u2019 through her heavy panting so I didn\u2019t stop. I slid my hands inside the sides of her swimsuit bottom and wrapped them around her hipbones and cupped her bare bottom in my hands. \u201cHow \u2018bout here? Want me to stop?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed beneath me and her voice was breathless as she begged me to not stop, but I had a promise to keep. It was a no sex night, but I planned to give her what she needed while I stayed true to my word.</p><p>I heard a moan escape her lips as she covered her eyes with her hand and pounded the mattress with her other and I knew I had just given her an experience she would never forget.</p><p>15 Titillating Details</p><p>Payton</p><p>Wow. He considered that my punishment for teasing him?</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at the ceiling with my comforter still fisted in my hand. Was that what I think it was? Hell yes it was and it was magnificent. It was without a doubt the most incredible sensation I had ever experienced. Shiz, I wanted him to do that to me again.</p><p>He slid up my body and rested his weight on his elbows that were pressed into the mattress on each side of my head. He stroked his fingertips down each side of my face as he watched my eyes. \u201cLiked that, did ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, yeah...just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell...just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>He smiled because it pleased him to hear me admit I liked what he did to me. I felt the heat rise in my face when I thought about what I had shamelessly begged him to do to me. He warned me I would, but I didn\u2019t believe him because I had no idea he was capable of eliciting such an uncontrollable urge that would make me throw good sense out the window.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter how much I begged and pleaded with him. He kept his word when he told me we wouldn\u2019t have sex and I found myself feeling regretful about that instead of relieved.</p><p>Geez. I needed to get away from him fast because I was thinking about asking him to break his no sex tonight promise. \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t push my luck with Aunt Tillie. I don\u2019t know how cool she\u2019d be if I showed up hours after I told her I would be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get in trouble because I have plans for you tomorrow, Doll Face.\u201d He lowered his lips to mine and gave me a gentle kiss. \u201cDoes 12 o\u2019clock sound all right to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d That meant we would only be apart for eleven hours.</p><p>We spent the better part of the next 30 minutes kissing good-bye until we finally unglued our lips long enough for me to go to Tillie\u2019s house. When I walked into her house, I found her casually lounging on the chaise in the living room watching television. \u201cHey, Girly Girl. Have a good night?\u201d</p><p>I fell backwards onto the couch and sighed dramatically.</p><p>\u201cSounds like someone had a great night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. It was one of the most wonderful nights of my life.\u201d I thought about my incredible experience with Nick and knew I wasn\u2019t giving him enough credit after that thing he did. \u201cI take that back. It was definitely my best night ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you with a cute guy?\u201d</p><p>Cute didn\u2019t seem to cut it with Nick. \u201cYou have no idea. He is hot, I mean like really hot and he\u2019s considerate. One of my favorite things about him is that he loves my smart ass mouth. Oh, and he\u2019s an awesome kisser.\u201d I thought it might be wise to leave off the part about him giving me my first big O. \u201cTillie, I seriously think I could fall for this guy.\u201d</p><p>I heard my aunt giggle at me. \u201cI think you already have. Look at you. You\u2019re actually giddy. I\u2019ve never seen you like that about a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to sleep tonight because I\u2019m so excited about being with him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do your parents think of him?\u201d</p><p>I wished she hadn\u2019t asked me that because I didn\u2019t even want to think about what they\u2019d say about Nick. \u201cThey haven\u2019t met him, but I can already tell you that they wouldn't approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, you don\u2019t know that\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. He\u2019s from Collinsville and that\u2019s all they need to know for them to discredit him. He doesn\u2019t have money or social influence so they\u2019ll give me the thumbs down before they even meet him. You know how they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t. You can\u2019t be for sure until you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want me to be with someone like Cooper. Never mind the fact that he\u2019s a dickhead that gave me an ultimatum to sleep with him or hit the road. Mother never even asked me what happened. She just blamed me for him breaking up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry, honey. Do you want me to talk to Vivian for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Let her think I\u2019m a total disappointment instead of a virgin. Serves her right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this lucky young fella have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he does. His name is Nick Hawke. Gah, I even love saying his name. Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>I looked up from where I lay on the couch when my aunt didn\u2019t answer and I saw that she had sat up on the edge of the chaise. \u201cSomething wrong, Tillie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing\u2019s wrong. Please, go on. I want to know everything about your Nick.\u201d</p><p>My phone alerted me to a text and I knew it was Nick without looking.</p><p>\u201cGot to T\u2019s ok?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smiled because he was checking on me. \u201cIt\u2019s Nick. He\u2019s checking to make sure I got here safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Telling T about our night minus the titillating details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved the titillating details.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe 2. UR so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStoked about tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to have more titillating details tom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDef.\u201d Was he kiddin\u2019 me? Hell yeah, I wanted to have lots and lots of more titillating details.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful. Making no more promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d I hit send before I had a chance to back out and wondered what was wrong with me? That was basically as good as telling him I wanted to bow chicka wow wow.</p><p>\u201cI promise no more promises.\u201d Oh, shit. That meant all was fair play.</p><p>\u201cGood. See U tom at 12. Your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Until then...thinking about titillating details.\u201d Yeah, I bet he was thinking about titillating details. Who was I kiddin\u2019? I was thinking about them, too. And probably would the rest of the night.</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d</p> <p>I put my phone down and quietly squealed as I fell back against the couch again and began to spill everything I knew about Nick, including how hard I was falling for him.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I felt amazingly well for someone that stayed up talking to Tillie about Nick until the sun was up. She wanted to know everything about Nick and I realized there were still so many things I didn\u2019t know about him, so I had investigation work ahead of me today.</p><p>But I had business to tend to before I went to Nick\u2019s. I had to see Claire.</p><p>I pulled up at her house and then walked in without knocking like I always did. I had practically spent half my childhood in this house and to knock would have felt weird.</p><p>It was a weekday so Jessie and the Deverauxs were at work. The house was quiet so I knew Claire was being a total bum and sleeping late, but that wouldn\u2019t last because I was gettin\u2019 her ass up. I needed girly advice.</p><p>I climbed the stairs and her door was standing wide open. Good. I wanted to scare her and I probably wouldn\u2019t accomplish that if I had to open the door.</p><p>I tiptoed silently across the floor until I was standing at her bedside. I gave her comforter a jerk to wake her up and realized too late that she wasn\u2019t asleep and she wasn\u2019t in her bed alone.</p> <p>Claire reached for the sheet and jerked it up to her neck. \u201cWhat the hell, Payton?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I thought you had the covers pulled over your head to block out the sun. I didn\u2019t know Jessie was under there with you. I thought he was at work, but don\u2019t let me interrupt. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>This was one of those rare moments when I was embarrassed. \u201cAs you were, Kimosabe.\u201d Eww, that sounded weird and I scrambled to get out of there as fast as possible. Both of them were my best friends, but seeing the two of them nekkid in bed together was simply TMI for me.</p><p>I got in my car and checked the time. Eleven o\u2019clock meant I had an hour to burn and I was fresh out of ideas so I texted Nick to see if we could get together earlier?</p><p>\u201cSure. Come now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d</p><p>After the drive to Nick\u2019s from Franklin, I was only 40 minutes earlier than we originally planned. I knocked a few times and he came to the door wearing the same attire he told me to wear except he had added a Vols ball cap.</p><p>He reached for my hand, pulled me inside his house and shut the door. He put his hands around my waist and pulled me close. \u201cGirl, I\u2019ve missed you and I\u2019m about to mess up your lip gloss.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me gently at first and it became increasingly hungrier with each stroke of his tongue against mine. He started walking backwards toward the couch, pulling me with him until we were in the spot where we shared our first kiss.</p><p>When he stopped kissing me, he ran his fingertips along my face. I noticed he did that a lot, like he enjoyed touching my face.</p><p>I felt the same way as him. We had been apart for too long, but I wasn\u2019t ready to show him my hand so I put on my familiar poker face. \u201cIt\u2019s only been ten hours since we were together.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me tightly and put his nose against my neck and inhaled deeply. \u201cTen hours, ten days, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>He kissed my neck right below my ear. \u201cUmm, I think that\u2019s roughly nine and half days.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly and then whispered against my ear. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. Always a clever comeback. Are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>No. I rather do this the rest of the day. \u201cSure. Where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you until we get there.\u201d We walked to the front door and he opened it for me and then we briefly held hands to his car. He opened the car door for me and I turned to him before I got in. \u201cYou are killing me with this secretive stuff.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over and smiled as he gave me a quick kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll give you another clue. It\u2019s not a girl thing, but the girls that like it, love it, and it\u2019s a rush.\u201d</p><p>That could almost be frightening. He walked around the car and I could see that he was still smiling. He got in beside me and I watched him for a minute. \u201cThat was probably the worst clue ever, so no more. I\u2019ll find out what it is when I find out so I\u2019m changing the subject. You\u2019re wearing a UT cap. Are you a fan?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out of his drive. \u201cYeah. Isn\u2019t everyone from around these parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really, but I\u2019m enrolled there this fall. Funny story. My mom has been determined my entire life that I would go to her Alma Mater, so I picked UT to piss her off. Mission accomplished. She\u2019s mad as hell and I love it.</p><p>He shook his head, but didn\u2019t look in my direction. \u201cMan, you don\u2019t even see how lucky you are. I get the privilege of going to a community college and that\u2019s with student loans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some really great community colleges. Besides, the police academy is where you\u2019ll learn the real stuff, right? I mean the parts about how to be a cop and stay safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I\u2019m getting shot at, an education from UT isn\u2019t what\u2019s gonna save me.\u201d</p><p>I wished I hadn\u2019t brought up the part about his safety. I didn\u2019t like the way it made me feel to think about him being in danger. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I not say things like that? Danger is going to be a part of my life every time I\u2019m on the job.\u201d</p><p>I had an uncontrollable urge to touch him. I reached for his free hand and squeezed it tightly in mine before I brought it to my mouth to kiss. I held on to his hand when he moved it to my leg and I watched him as he drove us to wherever we would be spending our afternoon while we got our rush on together.</p><p>Could I be with someone like him? I mean could I risk being with someone that enjoyed adrenalin, danger and living life on the edge the way he did? There were so many uncertain things in my head, but I was sure of one thing. I was playing my own dangerous game with him and the cost of losing was high price to pay...my heart.</p><p>16 Glocks and Ginnys</p><p>Nick</p><p>I parked by the cabin and turned off the engine. Payton looked at the old rustic building and then back at me. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our hunting cabin.\u201d</p><p>Something about that amused her. \u201cOkay, what exactly do you think we\u2019re gonna be hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not hunting anything.\u201d I reached under my seat and slid my Glock 17 out. I took it out of the box and held it up for her to see. \u201cWe\u2019re target practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy! Did you know that?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNope, I\u2019m not shooting anything. Guns scare me. I\u2019ve never even touched one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it. I promise. When you take a shot and hit a target, you get a surge of adrenalin that I don\u2019t even know how to describe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I prefer a Nick induced thrill like last night rather than a gun induced one.\u201d</p><p>I liked the sound of that. \u201cAgree to shoot with me and maybe you\u2019ll get both kinds of rushes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t have a clue what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I leaned over and kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m gonna show you what to do.\u201d</p><p>We walked behind the cabin where Dad and I had built a homemade set of multilevel beams to house our targets and I set up a line of beer bottles on each shelf. \u201cWatch me first so you can get an idea of what to do.\u201d</p><p>I took my stance. \u201cYour feet should be shoulder width apart like this and square with your hips. The majority of your weight should be on the balls of your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I see why you told me to wear sneakers instead of my tall ass heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I love you in those tall ass heels, but they weren\u2019t gonna cut it out here in the boonies with a pistol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. Maybe I\u2019m a Charlie\u2019s Angel natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive you\u2019re an angel, but we\u2019ll see about the natural part.\u201d I held the Glock out away from Payton and positioned my hands around the grip. \u201cYour left hand should be high on the pistol with both of your thumbs almost touching the side like this. Put your left thumb forward so it is in front of your right and both should be pointing at the target. Think of your left hand as the steering wheel so squeeze a little harder with it. Hold your arms out straight, but don\u2019t completely lock them, and take aim at your target.\u201d</p><p>I stretched my arms toward the first bottle and then took all eight of them out one by one. \u201cThink you can do that, Angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I rather watch you do it.\u201d She broke into a huge smile. \u201cDamn, Nick, that was so hot. I don\u2019t think I got it all. Wanna do it again for me? So I can watch your technique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more time and then you\u2019re gonna give it a try.\u201d</p><p>I had nine rounds left in the magazine so I lined up nine more bottles because that\u2019s how confident I was in my accuracy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bam! Knocked all nine out perfectly. I dropped the magazine out and started reloading it. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. The worst thing you can do is miss.\u201d I slid the magazine back in when I finished loading it and held it out for Payton.</p><p>She stared at it, but didn\u2019t make a move to take it from me. \u201cI\u2019m nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. Come here and I\u2019ll help you.\u201d From behind, I wrapped my arms around her before I took her hands and placed them on the grip of my Glock. \u201cThumbs here and here. Squeeze more with this hand because you\u2019ll use it to aim. Hold your arms straight out.\u201d I noticed her feet were next to each other without any distance between them so I leaned around and put my mouth against her ear. \u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p> <p>She giggled as she moved her feet apart. \u201cYou are so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be a good instructor,\u201d I said innocently.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had enough practice to be an expert instructor.\u201d</p><p>Okay. The line became hazy somewhere along the way and I wasn\u2019t sure if we were talking about target shooting or sex. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m good at what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, you\u2019ve been quite excellent at everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>Hmm. I was very fond of hearing her praise.</p><p>\u201cNew shooters tend to want to go low and to the left, so lift a little and bring it a tad to the right. We\u2019re aiming for the first bottle on the top left. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, am I ever.\u201d</p><p>I helped her aim in just the right spot. \u201cOkay. Pull the trigger back.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated and I could feel her trembling. \u201cAre you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I\u2019m with you all the way. Let me count and you can pull the trigger on three. Okay?\u201d</p><p>She inhaled deeply and then blew it out slowly. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready. I can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere goes. One...Two...Three.\u201d On three she pulled the trigger and took the top off of the first longneck.</p><p>When she realized she had hit it, she let out a loud squeal but didn\u2019t move a muscle. \u201cWoo! That was awesome and you were so right. What a rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you liked it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wanna do it again.\u201d</p><p>This girl was full of surprises. Could she be anymore perfect for me? \u201cYou wanna do it by yourself this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think I do.\u201d</p> <p>I took my arms away. \u201cRemember your stance and where to hold the pressure. Bring it up and to the right just a hair. Do you want me to count again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think that helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. One...Two...Three.\u201d She pulled the trigger and missed.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Try again.\u201d I reached for her arms and brought them up for her. \u201cLift them just a little higher this time and breathe. Don\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>One...Two...Three.\u201d She missed again. And then again.</p><p>I could see she was getting frustrated. \u201cUgh! This isn\u2019t easy. I need you to help me.\u201d</p><p>I put my arms around her again to help her aim. \u201cI didn\u2019t get good at this in one day. I\u2019ve been doing it since I was eleven. Relax. You\u2019re stiff as a board.\u201d</p><p>She let her shoulders go loose and I pushed her hair away from her neck to hang over her left shoulder. I leaned into her and put my mouth against her right ear. \u201cBreathe. Loosen your shoulders and tighten your arms. One...Two...Three.\u201d</p><p>Together we took out the other eight longnecks and then an additional dozen without a single wasted bullet. I dropped the magazine out to check it and then slid it back in when I saw it was empty. \u201cI think we make a great team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could agree with that, but I think the teacher was greater than the student.\u201d</p><p>I put my empty gun back in its case and we started walking toward my car. \u201cShooting small targets takes a lot of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, seeing how good you are at shooting makes me worry a little less about you becoming a police officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worries you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it does.\u201d</p><p>Wow. I\u2019d never felt like anyone had worried about me except Dallas and Ginny. I put my gun case on the ground and turned the bill of my cap around to the back before I put my hands on Payton\u2019s waist to pull her closer. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly imagine how hard I\u2019m falling for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet I have a pretty good idea.\u201d She put her arms up around my shoulders and I lifted her to sit on the hood of my car. She leaned back, bringing me with her as I fell between her bent knees. She wrapped her legs around my waist and pressed my body into hers as my mouth moved over her neck. \u201cHow have you managed to put me under your spell, Payton Archer?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my ball cap by the bib on the back of my head and gave it a toss onto the windshield of my car. She laced her fingers through my hair, grabbing two fistfuls and pulled it hard, forcing me to look up at her. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Let\u2019s go back to my house. Was that an excuse to get me to cool my jets or an invitation for something much different? I had no idea with Payton because she wasn\u2019t like the girls I was used to, but she certainly seemed inclined to get physical and the ride home didn\u2019t make me think otherwise.</p><p>She reached for my hand as I pulled away from the cabin and didn\u2019t let go as I drove toward my house to pick up her car. She held it firmly and slowly stroked my arm from my hand up to my bicep and back down the whole way home.</p><p>By the time we got to my house, Payton\u2019s touch had me so wound so tightly I thought I might spring at any moment. That was until we pulled up at my house and I saw Ginny\u2019s car parked on the street.</p><p>No. Not today. Not right now. Not when Payton had just asked me to go to her house while her parents were still gone. Man, nothing could kill a boner faster than your grandmother. I leaned my head forward and put it on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother is here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t let go of my hand. \u201cThen you have to go in to see her and we can get together another time.\u201d</p><p>There was no way I was letting her get away from me. \u201cCome in with me and meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You think I\u2019m grandmother worthy?\u201d</p><p>Was she kiddin\u2019 me? She was way beyond grandmother worthy. \u201cOf course. Ginny will love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGinny. That\u2019s a cool name for a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s short for Ginger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll come in and meet your Ginny if you\u2019re sure I won\u2019t be intruding.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stop the huge smile that spread across my face as I leaned over and gave her a kiss. \u201cI\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>We walked through the front door and found Ginny and Dallas in the kitchen. I had forgotten. Today was her day to give Dallas cooking lessons.</p><p>I let go of Payton\u2019s hand and went over to kiss my grandmother. \u201cGinny, I have someone for you to meet. This is Payton Archer.\u201d</p><p>My grandmother looked at Payton and then back to me and smiled. Me bringing a girl home had obviously taken her by surprise. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you, Payton.\u201d</p><p>Ginny didn\u2019t do handshakes. She was a hugger and she took Payton by surprise when she put the sack of flour down to come over and embrace her. \u201cAre you the girl that\u2019s going to tame my Nickolas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the jury is still out on whether he\u2019s tamable or not.\u201d</p><p>I knew my Ginny was in love with Payton when she started laughing. \u201cOh, she\u2019s saucy, Nickolas.\u201d She wrapped her arm around Payton and pulled her close as she whispered something in her ear she didn\u2019t want me to hear.</p><p>Whatever it was made Payton very happy as evidenced by her smile. \u201cI promise. I will definitely do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Miss Payton. Do you cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma'am. No one has ever showed me how.\u201d</p><p>Ginny went to the closet and pulled out one of Dallas\u2019 extra aprons. \u201cHere, put this on. I\u2019m teaching Dallas how to do fried chicken, smashed potatoes, green beans and biscuits with gravy.\u201c</p><p>\u201cNo, Ginny. We can\u2019t stay.\u201d I looked at Payton and grinned. \u201cWe have somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>Payton slid the apron over her head and tied it around her waist as she smiled at me. \u201cI think we can stay for a little while.\u201d</p><p>I conceded and went to the living room to watch television while Ginny had her way with Payton and Dallas. I often heard whispering, followed by a rush of laughter and I was positive they were laughing at me about some sort of nonsense. The weird thing about it was that I\u2019d catch myself smiling when they did it because I liked it. I liked having Payton in my house with my sister and grandmother and I liked the way they were in the kitchen together bonding over fried chicken.</p><p>An hour later, Payton came out of the kitchen and sat next to me on the couch. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad because I wanted to stay, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if we stayed to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a choice. Ginny isn\u2019t gonna let you do all that work and then watch you leave without eating.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and put her head on my shoulder. \u201cThank you. I had so much fun and Ginny taught me a lot. I actually made homemade biscuits. I can\u2019t believe it. If they\u2019re terrible, you can\u2019t tell me. It would break my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoll Face, I promise you I\u2019ll never do anything to break your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d</p><p>I kissed the top of her head. \u201cEvery word.\u201d And I did mean it. I would rather die than do anything to break this beautiful girl\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cGinny said we\u2019d be eating without your dad because he wouldn\u2019t be home from work until later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, his shift isn\u2019t over until seven and he usually doesn\u2019t get home until almost eight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll save him a plate.\u201d She got up from the couch and tugged on me to coax me up. \u201cGet in here and try my food.\u201d</p><p>I probably ate too fast. One...because it was so good and two...because I was ready to get some alone time with Payton back at her house. I mentally screamed when she offered to help clean up after dinner, so I got in there and helped to speed up the process.</p><p>Dallas took note of my never seen before help. \u201cYou never help clean after a meal. Trying to make a good impression with Payton?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d I lied because it was easier that way. I put the last dish into the cabinet and made our getaway announcement as I went over to kiss my grandmother. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, Ginny. Thanks for supper. It was great as always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget that your Payton cooked a lot of it.\u201d</p><p>My Payton. Hmm, I liked that.</p><p>Payton slipped off her apron and passed it to Dallas before she went over to give my grandmother a hug. \u201cThank you for everything you taught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI come once a week to teach Dallas and I\u2019d love to have you back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would love that.\u201d She turned to me as if to ask permission and I shrugged, letting her know that it was her decision and fine by me. The thought of Payton spending time with my family made me very happy, but nothing could make me as happy as getting her alone again and that was next on my agenda.</p><p>17 A Part of Nick</p><p>Payton</p><p>We came in through the front door instead of using the garage. Nick had his arms around me so he used his foot to kick it closed. He slid his arms down around my waist and squeezed me in a tight bear hug as he lifted my feet from the floor. When he finished, he put me back down and scanned the house. \u201cYou\u2019re sure your parents aren\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPositive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He cupped my face with both of his hands and stared at it like he was searching for anything that might have possibly changed since this afternoon. \u201cI thought I\u2019d die before I got you here so we could be alone.\u201d</p> <p>My lips felt dry because my lip gloss had worn off so I lightly ran my tongue over them to be ready for his kiss. He slowly rubbed his thumb across the moisture and spread it over my entire mouth. \u201cI love these lips.\u201d</p><p>His teasing was killing me. \u201cHurry up and kiss me because I think I\u2019m gonna scream if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He gently pushed me toward the door behind me. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll scream if I do.\u201d</p><p>The few hours since he had me on the hood of his car was too long ago so I fisted the front of his shirt and pulled him close. My mouth crashed against his and our kiss wasn\u2019t soft nor sweet. My mouth was demanding because he was like a drug in my veins and I needed more and more of him.</p><p>With my back still pressed against the inside of the front door, I lifted my arms up around his neck and leaped to wrap my legs around his waist. I clearly surprised him, but he caught my legs and held me firmly as he pushed my back against the interior of the front door.</p><p>He backed away and kissed me as he carried me toward the living room. We tumbled onto the couch with him on top of me and I instinctively pulled my legs up around him while the weight of his body pressed me into the couch.</p><p>I loved having him on top of me and between my legs, but I was blindly pushing buttons I didn\u2019t know how to control. I was shoving him to the outer limits of his control and I had no right to do that if I wasn\u2019t planning to close the deal.</p><p>He was kissing down my neck while he pressed his groin into mine and I was starting to have some those wonderful tingling sensations I felt the night before. I had this instinctive inclination that just a little more would make it feel even better. I didn\u2019t want to tell him to stop, but I had to.</p> <p>My voice was much weaker than I meant for it to be. \u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>He never took his lips away from my neck. \u201cUh huh?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to say the words, but I had to before I lost myself completely and let him do anything he wanted to me. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>He stopped kissing me and lifted his head to see my face. I dreaded saying the words he had never heard before. I hated being the first one to tell him \u2018no.\u2019</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with anyone before and I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He smiled that lopsided grin I loved so much, but it wasn\u2019t what I wanted to see after telling him I wasn\u2019t ready to have sex with him. What did he find so amusing? Was it my lack of experience or was he pleased with himself for predicting I would slam on the brakes. Neither option made me happy.</p><p>I tried to slide out from underneath him, but he was too heavy and I was pinned. \u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me.\u201d</p><p>He pushed his arms under me and lowered his head to my shoulder to give me a big squeeze, very much like the one he gave me by the front door. \u201cMmm. I love that you\u2019re not ready and I have to wait, but I especially love that no guy has ever been inside you. It gives me something special to look forward to.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t laughing at my lack of sexual experience. My virginal status and desire to stay that way a while longer actually made him happy. Who knew turning a guy down and telling him he would have to wait could make him so happy?</p><p>He sucked my bottom lip and it made a popping sound when he released it. \u201cThis is a first for me. I\u2019ve never had to buy the cow before.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to be reminded that he always got the milk for free. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re damn lucky I know what you mean by that.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, pulling me with him and placed a feather light kiss against my mouth. His lips were still against mine as he whispered, \u201cThe anticipation of having you under me and being inside you is so much better than any sure thing I\u2019ve ever had in the past.\u201d</p><p>Just hearing him say stuff like that turned me on and made me think about what it would be like with him. Suddenly, all I could feel was my heart pounding in my ears and my fingers going tingly.</p><p>He gave me a quick peck and leaned away too soon. \u201cI need you to help me figure this out. I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, so what does a couple do on a Friday night?\u201d</p><p>Girlfriend. I think he just called me his girlfriend. Maybe. God, I loved the sound of the word coming out of his mouth and it made me wanna kiss him bad, but I needed to know for sure what I was to him. \u201cYou said you\u2019d never had a girlfriend before. Did you mean that in general or did you mean...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant that you\u2019re my first girlfriend. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want. I just needed to be clear about it so there was no misunderstanding. And as for what we should do...we can do anything we want. Maybe even more of what we were just doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at my legs and shook his head. \u201cNot if you want to keep those jeans on.\u201d</p><p>He said the hottest things and had the power to turn me on in a second flat. How in the world was I ever going to keep from getting naked with him?</p><p>\u201cMost dates are something like dinner and a movie. Maybe bowling or a concert. Something like that, but all I want to do tonight is stay here to talk and enjoy this alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument here.\u201d He lay on the couch on his side and pulled me in front of him to spoon. \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad had a work conference in Vegas and my mom went with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of work does your dad do?\u201d</p><p>My parents weren\u2019t really the what I had on my mind when I said I wanted to talk. \u201cStock broker. Investments. That kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>He gestured to my house with his hand. \u201cBig time money making kinds of things. And your mom is an attorney?\u201d</p><p>My mom was more of a prima donna in a tennis skirt than a hot shot attorney. Becoming a lawyer was never about law for my mom. It was all about using her career to put her in contact with very rich people so she could find a very rich husband. \u201cShe used to be, but she hasn\u2019t practiced since before I was born.\u201d</p><p>He found something I said amusing. \u201cYou forgot to mention that part when you threatened me with your mom after you rammed your car into mine.\u201d</p><p>I had forgotten about that. \u201cFor your information, I didn\u2019t ram my car into yours. I gently bumped it and it was all your fault.\u201d</p><p>He was amused by that. \u201cHow was it my fault when all I was doing was sitting at a red light?\u201d</p><p>I laced my fingers through his hand that was draped over my waist. \u201cJessie was warning me and Claire about you and your man whoring ways. He called you a Sex Tricks Jedi and I got so out of sorts that my foot slipped off the brake and hit the gas pedal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s why you called me Jedi the night we met.\u201d He pulled me closer for a hug and kissed the top of my head. \u201cI\u2019m glad you gently bumped me. I\u2019ll have to thank Jessie later for dogging on me, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have met you and that would have been a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and over my shoulder at him. \u201cYes, that definitely would have been a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my temple. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to introduce me to your parents or tell them about me, are you?\u201d</p><p>I turned back around so I didn\u2019t have to look at him. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be missing anything by not meeting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I get it.\u201d I heard the hurt in his voice. He thought my reasons for not introducing him to my parents was because I thought he wasn\u2019t good enough, but that wasn\u2019t it at all. He was too good for them. That\u2019s not how my parents would see it, but I at least owed him an honest answer about it.</p><p>I stroked my hand over his. \u201cNick, my parents have expectations for who I should date and a Collinsville guy planning to be a police officer doesn\u2019t come remotely close to meeting their approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m good enough to risk my life every day on the job so they can be protected, but I\u2019m not good enough to date their daughter?\u201d</p><p>Yep, he totally got it. \u201cThey\u2019re assholes and you\u2019re better off not meeting them. But hey, you meet my approval and I\u2019m the only one that counts. Besides, you are gonna look so yummy in that officer\u2019s uniform.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven when I cut all of this off?\u201d</p><p>Cut what off? I turned over to face him when I realized what he meant. My heart stammered because I loved his messy hair. It was one of the things that made him so sexy. \u201cNo way. You have great hair. I won\u2019t let you buzz it all off.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and gave some a yank. \u201cPolice officers don\u2019t walk around with hair like this.\u201d</p> <p>He was so wrong about that. \u201cSexy ones do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, that would be the kind that get paid to wear a fake uniform and strip it off at bachelorette parties.\u201d</p><p>Whew! That had me thinking thoughts I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d We don\u2019t need to talk about stripping police uniforms off so tell me about something safer. What about your mom? You\u2019ve never mentioned her.\u201d</p><p>Silence. At first, I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer me and I was about to tell him he didn\u2019t have to talk about her if he didn\u2019t want to. Then a moment later, something almost tangible squeezed my heart when he started to talk about his mom. \u201cShe left us when I was six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ever see her?\u201d</p> <p>He slowly shook his head. \u201cNope. Not since the day she walked out on us. I don\u2019t have a clue where she is. I\u2019m pretty sure my dad knows, but just doesn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why she left?\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand up and down his arm as he told me what little he remembered. \u201cI suspect there was another man, but I don\u2019t know for sure. I asked my dad about her several years ago and he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything. I dropped it all together but I have a vague memory of being in his closet and finding a file on her. I must have been pretty young when I found it because I don\u2019t remember much about what it said, but I know she had remarried and had more kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have brothers or sisters you\u2019ve never met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know. After she left, I was so hurt and angry that I told people she died. I was only six and I guess I thought it hurt less to think of her as dead than not loving me enough to stay.\u201d He brought my hand to his mouth and kissed it. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever told all this to.\u201d</p><p>I held his hand as he told me what it felt like to grow up thinking no one could love him if his own mother didn\u2019t. I wanted to go back in time and tell him how wrong he was for thinking that, but the best I could offer was to listen.</p> <p>He might have been with a lot of girls, but he just gave me something he had never given to a one of them...a part of himself.</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother was the reason behind that tattoo spread over his heart and the reason he tried unsuccessfully to find comfort in any willing girl. Her selfish choices had almost ruined him. Almost. I found myself hating a woman I would never know and wondered if I would be able to fix the cracks she left behind on his heart.</p><p>18 Say My Name</p><p>Nick</p><p>It felt good to open up and tell Payton about my mom and what she had done. Most importantly, I was finally able to admit how painful it was. When I decided to share that part of my life, I didn\u2019t realize how I was opening my heart to her. With only one look into her eyes, I knew I was offering her a piece of myself and she was happily accepting it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to give me generic words about how it wasn\u2019t my fault or how everything was going to be okay. She simply held my hand while she listened to me tell her how damaged I was and that\u2019s when I had no doubt. I loved this girl and I finally understood that place my dad warned me about...the point of no return.</p><p>Payton and I were stretched out on the sofa side by side in the dark with only the light of the moon coming through the window. It had been a little while since either of us had said anything. Payton was motionless and I thought she had fallen asleep but then she rolled over to face me and put her arms up around my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a gentle kiss and tugged on her bottom lip with my teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll stay as long as you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d She feathered a kiss across my mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not going to Tillie\u2019s and I want you to stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Any other time I would have taken that as an invitation for sex, but not with Payton after our discussion and I was okay with that. \u201cI will if it\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to let my dad know I\u2019m not coming home tonight.\u201d I reached for my phone in my pocket and texted my dad.</p><p>\u201cStaying at a friend\u2019s tonight. CU in a.m.\u201d</p><p>He would ask where I had been when I got home and I didn\u2019t plan on lying. It would no doubt cause an argument so I guessed Payton and I were in very similar situations. When it came to our parents\u2019 opinions about us being together, they would be in agreement on keeping us apart even if the reasons were polar opposites.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to waste another minute of my precious time with Payton worrying about my confrontation with my dad because all I cared about now was having her in my arms.</p><p>\u201cCan I call Claire real quick? I sort of need to check in with her and Jessie because I could possibly owe them an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went over to Claire\u2019s this morning because I needed to talk to her. When I walked in, the house was super quiet so I thought everyone was at work and she was sleeping late. I was gonna wake her up by jerking her covers off and screaming, \u201cRise and shine.\u201d Well, there was some rise and definitely some shine because Jessie was in bed with her and they weren\u2019t wearing clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he was sneakin\u2019 into her bed.\u201d</p><p>Payton\u2019s phone rang right before she reached for it and she saw that it was Claire. \u201cI swear I think we have telepathy sometimes.\u201d She slid the bar and said, \u201cHey, I was just about to call you to tell you again how sorry I am for walking in on you and Jessie. I had no idea. I swear I thought he was at work.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me and smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s at my house right now.\u201d</p><p>She drew an invisible heart on my leg with her finger. \u201cWe\u2019re together together.\u201d</p><p>She pointed to her phone and rolled her eyes. \u201cI know that. We took the same Biology class. Remember?\u201d</p><p>That had the ring of a safe sex talk about it.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take your own advice because I\u2019m pretty sure that was you I found naked with your boyfriend this morning. The same boyfriend who you say you aren\u2019t having sex with.\u201d Yep, she was definitely trying to give Payton the safe sex talk.</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d She held the phone out to me. \u201cJessie wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I fell back against the couch and groaned. For real? When was he gonna stop this protective brother bullshit? I was gonna seriously blow my top if he tried to add insult to injury by giving me the safe sex talk when I wasn\u2019t gettin\u2019 any.</p><p>I took the phone from Payton, prepared to tell Jessie to screw himself if he started lecturing me. \u201cWaddup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire says you and Payton are together now.\u201d</p><p>I felt myself immediately becoming defensive. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wait for it. Wait for it and here we go with the warnings about how I better not hurt her, but that\u2019s not what came next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy for you, man. I think you\u2019ll be good for each other.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what I expected to hear. \u201cThanks, man, and just so you know...I plan on being good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you, but if you hurt her, Claire will make good on her threat to yank your balls up over your ears.\u201d Now, this was more like it. That\u2019s more like what I expected to hear out of him.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you have to worry because I\u2019m not gonna hurt her. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped up my conversation with Jessie and passed the phone back to Payton so she could say bye to Claire. When she got off the phone, she looked at me and smiled. \u201cOverprotective, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit my ass. I think they\u2019re afraid we\u2019ll get it on before they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? They live in the same house. Do you really think he\u2019s not banging her every night?\u201d Ooh, bad choice of words to say to my new girlfriend. \u201cSorry. That didn\u2019t come out right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I may be a virgin but my ears aren\u2019t. I\u2019m okay with you calling it \u2018banging.\u2019 I happen to have some very colorful names for it myself.\u201d</p><p>Man, she was already an awesome girlfriend and I couldn\u2019t wait to hear what her colorful names were.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he hasn\u2019t tasted her nectar, but trust me. They aren\u2019t locking loins. Claire\u2019s dad put a cock block on Jessie. He warned him before he moved in with them that if he found out they were having sex, he was out on his ass. It was actually a very smart move on Dr. Deveraux\u2019s part. If he hadn\u2019t let him move in, Jessie would be hidin\u2019 the snake in Claire every day. This way, he gets to keep an eye on them and he guilted Jessie into keeping his daughter a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Another virgin? I had no idea there were so many. Must be a Franklin thing because it sure wasn\u2019t a Collinsville thing. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of places he could take her so her dad wouldn\u2019t catch them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClaire has begged him, but he won\u2019t because he promised Dr. Deveraux he wouldn\u2019t. I think it\u2019s an honor thing with him because of the way he grew up. He wants to prove that he can do the right thing even though he was raised by two of the most unfit people in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what\u2019s the deal? He\u2019s gonna marry Claire before they lock loins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got it and from the looks of it this morning, they\u2019ll be gettin\u2019 married a lot sooner than I thought. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll hold out until they\u2019ve finished college if they\u2019re already gettin\u2019 naked together. That little sneak didn\u2019t tell me they were doing everything but the deed itself.\u201d</p><p>Wow. Jessie had really turned out to be a stand up kind of guy and I suddenly felt inferior. Payton wanted someone like him so that\u2019s what she would expect from me and I wondered if I could be this person for her? I only knew one thing for sure. I would try my damnedest to be anything she wanted me to be. Her game, her rules. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She got up from the couch and grabbed my hand, giving it a tug. \u201cCome upstairs with me.\u201d</p><p>Whoa! I knew she wanted me to stay all night, but that sounded like an invitation to sleep upstairs with her, maybe even in the same bed. While I freakin\u2019 loved the idea of being so close to her, I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good idea. Getting into bed with her would be like starting a fire I might not be able to contain.</p><p>I had to quit thinking that way. That was the old me and I shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions. It was wrong for me to assume she would want me to sleep with her in the same bed. She was probably putting me in the guest room. They certainly had enough of them.</p> <p>Please. Let her put me in the guest room.</p><p>Nope. She took me into her bedroom. She let go of my hand and went over to the bed and started tossing the pillows over into the corner of her room. \u201cYou can use my bathroom while I turn the bed back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d That\u2019s all I could say and it sounded like it came from a twelve year-old boy going through puberty when it squeaked out of my mouth.</p><p>I went into her bathroom and shut the door behind me. I looked around and saw her toothbrush in a holder. As if on cue, I heard her call out from her bedroom. \u201cYou can use my toothbrush if that doesn\u2019t gross you out.\u201d</p><p>Nothing about her could ever gross me out. My mouth had already explored every part of hers, so what was so different about using her toothbrush? \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you\u2019re sure you don\u2019t,\u201d I called out through the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>When I finished brushing my teeth, I washed my face with Payton\u2019s girly soap that smelled just like her and then I stripped down to my boxers and stood looking at myself in the mirror. I was nervous, but not about what I was going to do. It was more about what I wasn\u2019t going to do.</p><p>I tried to shake off the way she was messin\u2019 with my head, but it was impossible. Forget it. I was going out there in my boxers and I was gonna climb into that huge bed and sleep next to Payton without doing the thing I wanted to do most. We weren\u2019t locking loins so it shouldn\u2019t be complicated, except it was. It was the most complicated thing I had ever done with a girl.</p><p>I opened the door and walked out like everything was cool, but it definitely wasn\u2019t. This was gonna be one long, rough night for me.</p><p>She looked surprised to see me in nothing but my boxers and I wondered if I should have left my clothes on. Too late now. Man, I sucked at this. I had never been so unsure of myself.</p><p>\u201cDone. All yours.\u201d I tried to be casual but there was nothing casual about the way I was feeling.</p> <p>She went over to her dresser and pulled out whatever she planned to wear to bed. I didn\u2019t look because I would have died right then and there if it was something skimpy or sexy. That was the thing about always banging girls in my backseat. I\u2019d rarely ever been with one in a bed and I\u2019d sure never seen one walking around wearing something silky or sexy.</p><p>She went in the bathroom and I got into her bed. I leaned over and smelled the pillow next to me to make sure I had chosen the side she didn\u2019t sleep on. Yep. The pillow next to me was floral and fruity, so I knew that was her side.</p><p>It seemed like she stayed in the bathroom forever and I wondered if she was as nervous as me. Imagine that. I hadn\u2019t gotten nervous about being with a girl in a few years, but here I waited on a girl I wasn\u2019t gonna bone and I couldn\u2019t be more on edge about it.</p><p>I had almost talked myself down from a full blown panic until she opened the door and my tilt-o-whirl of emotions spun out of control again.</p><p>I hoped she would come out wearing an old T-shirt and boxers like my sister wore to bed, but dayum...what was I thinking? She lived in luxury, so she slept in luxury as well.</p><p>She was wearing a red satin tank with spaghetti straps with a pair of matching shorts. Her blonde hair was in a knot on top of her head and her face was freshly washed. She was finishing up massaging lotion into the skin on her arms as she walked toward me and I could tell it was her signature smell. Peach and cherry blossoms. Ordinarily I would have no idea, but I had seen the bottle when I was in her bathroom.</p><p>She pulled the covers back and climbed into bed next to me. She turned onto her side and propped her head on the inside of her bent arm. I mimicked her position and we spent the next few minutes staring at each other without speaking, but it wasn\u2019t awkward. It was like we were getting better acquainted with each other\u2019s faces.</p><p>She slid her tongue across her lips, something I noticed she did a lot when she wasn\u2019t wearing lip gloss, and I couldn\u2019t resist leaning in to kiss her wet mouth. At first, our lips were the only thing touching, but then she slid her arms up around my neck as she scooted her upper body closer. I snaked my arms around her waist and slid her satin clad body across the smooth sheets until she was firmly pressed against my bare chest.</p> <p>She lowered one of her hands from my shoulder to my chest and rubbed my chest causing my nipple to harden. She slowly slid that same hand across my chest to the other side and repeated the process, except this time she rolled it between her thumb and index finger.</p><p>She slid her hand back up to my shoulder and moved her mouth away from mine along my jawline. \u201cThe first time I saw you, I fantasized about the way your scruffy face would feel against my body.\u201d</p><p>I moved my mouth down her neck and leaned over her, forcing her to her back. \u201cThen I think you need the full experience so you don\u2019t have to fantasize anymore.\u201d</p><p>We might not make love, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t show her how good the things leading up to it could be. What was it she called it? Everything but the deed itself.</p><p>I kissed her mouth gently and then slowly moved my scruffy chin down her throat to her chest. I slowly and deliberately slid my hands under her satin top so she had longer to anticipate the touch of my fingers against her breasts. I stroked my thumbs up and down on the outer edge of her breasts, teasing her so she\u2019d want more. I lifted her top higher and she surprised me when she sat up to pull it over her head. She tossed her red satin top to the floor and then fell back onto the bed watching my face for a reaction as her chest heaved up and down.</p><p>\u201cEverything but the deed itself?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was entirely breathless when she answered me. \u201cYes, everything but the deed itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at me and smiled. \u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it again, louder.\u201d</p><p>She scrunched her brows at me in question, but did as I told her. \u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna want to scream when I make you feel like the only girl in the world.\u201d</p><p>19 Smoke That Clown</p><p>Payton</p><p>How many times did Nick make me scream his name? I had no idea because I lost count.</p><p>I woke up first and found myself affixed to Nick\u2019s naked body. I don\u2019t know how we managed to do everything without the deed itself. Somehow it was the morning after and I was technically still a virgin, but that wouldn\u2019t last for long if we continued to do the things we did last night.</p><p>Nick\u2019s restraint had to be made of iron clad steel because unlike me, he never seemed close to losing control. He never asked or even suggested we do the deed.</p><p>I lifted my head from his chest slowly and looked down at the sheet covering him from the waist down. I didn\u2019t get a good look at it last night. All I wanted was one quick peek. It wouldn\u2019t hurt a thing and he\u2019d never even know because he was asleep. Besides, he saw me naked from all kinds of angles last night.</p><p>I slowly reached for the sheet and lifted it ever so gently until I had the view I wanted. \u201cSee something you like down there?\u201d</p><p>Shit! I jumped, startled at being caught peeking at his package and pulled the sheet up over my head to hide my embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cI bet that\u2019s an even better view.\u201d</p><p>Double shit! Now my eyes were under the covers with it. I jerked the sheet down to my chest and squeezed my eyes tightly. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to know I was peeking. I thought you were asleep.\u201d</p><p>He threw the covers back. \u201cYou can look all you want.\u201d</p><p>I rolled to my stomach and pressed my face into my pillow. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He reached for me and flipped me onto my back before he crawled over me. \u201cWhy, yes you are, Miss Archer. You are very good.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his mouth to mine and kissed me gently. \u201cHow are you still a virgin? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever seen anyone as horny as you.\u201d</p><p>I slapped him across his bare back as I dropped my lower jaw. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that to me.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s true. You react so strongly to even the simplest touch. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve contained it this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, no guy has ever done those kinds of things to me and secondly, if he had, I don\u2019t think he could have made me feel the way you did. You\u2019re damn good at what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to be damn good at it again right now, but I really need to go.\u201d He leaned over and gave me a quick kiss \u201cI\u2019ve got a race tomorrow night and I\u2019ve got to do some fine tuning on my car.\u201d</p><p>He got up from my bed in all of his naked glory and walked to my bathroom while I admired him from behind. Ooh. He didn\u2019t take his boxers with him. That meant he had to walk back out to get them and I\u2019d get to see his package in full view.</p><p>He walked out of the bathroom toward me and I couldn\u2019t look. My eyes literally wouldn\u2019t leave his face. He was grinning at me and I saw his dimples. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can look if you want. I promise I looked at you last night. I think I memorized every inch.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his underwear on the floor. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m putting my boxers on. I\u2019m pulling them up slowly. Only a few more seconds and then you\u2019ve missed your chance. Three. Two.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stand it. I had to look before he pulled them all the way up. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I waited too long. I didn\u2019t get but about a one second view, but wow. What a view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached for his jeans and pulled them up. \u201cWill you come watch me race tomorrow night? I\u2019ll need a good luck kiss like the one you gave Dane.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and tucked the sheet under my arms. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019ll give you a better one than that. You\u2019ll feel it all the way down to your...toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should practice now so you\u2019ll have it perfected by tomorrow night.\u201d He leaned over and kissed me. \u201cSince your parents are coming home today, does that mean I won\u2019t see you until tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have dinner plans for us, so I guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be able to make it that long without me doing everything except the deed itself to you?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know. I could see how it could become addictive real quick. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to ask you. Since you\u2019re my girlfriend now, could I ask you to be my companion for a banquet on Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to be your companion. What kind of banquet is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a ceremony honoring my dad and some of the police officers in this region. It\u2019s sort of a big deal because my dad is being recognized with a special award.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it black tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s semiformal so you won\u2019t get to see me in a tux, but this could be your one and only chance to see me in a suit and tie.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d have to find a way to get away without my parents seeing me in a semiformal dress. That would definitely send up a red flag. \u201cCan I meet you at your house?\u201d I knew how that sounded. In other words, I was telling him to not pick me up at my house because I wasn\u2019t introducing him to my parents.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I heard the hurt in his voice, but it was better to hurt him a little now rather than have my parents forbid me from seeing him. I knew from experience that they weren\u2019t afraid to do that.</p><p>He grabbed his T-shirt off my dresser and pulled it over his head. He came back to my bed to sit by me and he ran his fingers down my arm. \u201cGod, I don\u2019t want to leave. I wish I could stay here with you in this bed all day, but I have a lot of stuff to do to get my car ready. This next guy isn\u2019t going to be as easy to beat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou sound a little worried.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of my nose. \u201cNah, I\u2019m gonna smoke that clown.\u201d</p><p>He got up from the bed and I followed him, wrapping the sheet under my arms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up. I can let myself out.\u201d He kissed my forehead. \u201cGo back to bed and sleep a little longer. It was a long night.\u201d</p><p>That was the understatement of the year. \u201cOkay, but call me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of not calling you, Love.\u201d</p><p>I watched him walk out the door and when I was sure he was gone, I fell back onto my bed. Love? Was it possible for him to love me so soon? I might not think so except I had the same feelings. I loved him. I knew it deep down in my bones. I loved Nick Hawke, even if the world thought I was crazy.</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>37 hours and 20 minutes. That was approximately how long it had been since I saw Nick and it was too long. I didn\u2019t like being apart from him and talking on the phone wasn\u2019t enough. I needed to see him and touch him and I wouldn\u2019t be happy until that happened.</p> <p>I wondered if he was as restless as me. He didn\u2019t sound like he was when we talked on the phone and that worried me. Had he grown tired of me already?</p><p>Any worries or questions I allowed to creep into my head vanished the moment I saw him coming out of the door to his house. He was as anxious to see me as I was to see him.</p><p>He caught me around the waist and lifted me up for a tight hug. \u201cMmm. I have missed you.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed him as tightly as he did me. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think tonight would ever get here.\u201d He stepped away from me and looked me up and down. I was wearing one of my favorite casual dresses with a denim jacket and a pair of boots. \u201cYou look beautiful. I may lose this race because I can\u2019t take my eyes off of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better not. How much do you have on it?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brows at me. \u201cI\u2019ve got a \u2018G\u2019 on it, my biggest bet yet.\u201d</p><p>$1,000? That had to be a lot of money for him. \u201cShould you really be betting that much? What if you lost?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his chest. \u201cOh, you\u2019ve wounded me and my pride. Don\u2019t worry, Love. I never lose.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. That word, Love. \u201cI hope not because my money is on the Camaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re bettin\u2019 on the car without consideration for the driver? Tsk. Tsk. Haven\u2019t I taught you anything?\u201d</p><p>I felt like being a little saucy so I slipped my arms around his waist and pulled him close. \u201cYou\u2019ve taught me plenty.\u201d</p><p>He put his face into my neck and rubbed his scruffy face against me. \u201cI hope to teach you more real soon.\u201d</p><p>I had given this thought and I was clueless. Where would we go for our alone time? \u201cYou know we\u2019re spoiled, right? We had my house all to ourselves and now we have to find another place to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fear. I\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my watch. \u201cIt\u2019s almost an hour before the race starts. Do you normally go this early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I can\u2019t help it. I want to go early so I can show off my girlfriend. My buddies are gonna jizz in their pants when they see how hot you are.\u201d</p><p>Maybe I should have been offended by that, but I wasn\u2019t. I was flattered. \u201cWell, by all means, let\u2019s get down there so the jizzing may begin.\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me close as we walked to his car. \u201cYou have to be the coolest girlfriend ever. Most chicks would be all like, \u2018Ewe, that\u2019s gross. Don\u2019t say stuff like that.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour first impression of me wasn\u2019t all that accurate and you\u2019re gonna have to figure out at some point that I\u2019m not this delicate little flower you pegged me for. There\u2019s nothing delicate about me.\u201d</p><p>We got to \u2018The Strip\u2019 almost an hour before the race and people were already lining up and hangin\u2019 out on the side of the road. Nick parked his Camaro on the starting lineup and told me to stay in so he could open my door for me. He wanted everyone there to know I was his.</p><p>I got out and could almost tangibly feel the staring eyes on me. It was awkward and I wondered how many of the girls looking me over were one of the unidentifiable numbers. I had to get over that. I couldn\u2019t look at every girl around and constantly have that on my mind because it would drive me crazy. Nick and I were together. He brought me here because he wanted everyone to know we were a couple. It was that simple.</p><p>He held my hand possessively as he introduced me to so many people I couldn\u2019t remember any of their names. Some of the guys didn\u2019t say a word when he introduced me and I laughed to myself as I wondered if that was a jizz moment I was witnessing.</p><p>It was getting closer to race time and Nick\u2019s opponent pulled up and parked next to his Camaro at the starting line. He stepped out of a corvette very similar to my Dad\u2019s and I cringed a little because I knew how fast that car would go.</p><p>Nick must have seen the worry on my face. \u201cDoll Face. It\u2019s gonna be all right. I\u2019m gonna beat him. Remember, it\u2019s not just the car. It\u2019s the driver, too.\u201d</p><p>I tried to look confident, but I wasn\u2019t sure I pulled it off very well. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Man, I just wanted this to be over. It made me too nervous.</p><p>Jake called out the three minute warning and I knew it was time for Nick\u2019s good luck kiss. He pulled me into his arms. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about this for a day and a half.\u201d</p><p>I put my arms up around his shoulders. \u201cA good luck kiss is a lot of pressure to put on a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have complete faith in you. And your lips.\u201d</p><p>He hooked one arm around the back of my neck and supported my lower back with the other. He started kissing me and dipped me backwards like the famous photograph of the soldier kissing the nurse on Times Square.</p><p>I heard a lot of whistling, clapping and hollering as he kissed me, but I didn\u2019t care. It was one of the most romantic things I\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>He helped me to stand upright again and steadied me on my feet. \u201cAll the way to my toes, just like you promised.\u201d</p><p>My heart was pounding and I felt lightheaded. \u201cI still feel a tingle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to that tingle and we\u2019ll pick up where we left off when I\u2019m done smokin\u2019 this clown.</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>He was in his car and I blew him a kiss as I walked to the finish line where the others were. I found a spot right on the line up front and wrung my hands as I waited impatiently to see him cross the red spray painted line first.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>I turned around and saw the whore that tried to hump him the night we met. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s using you for sex.\u201d</p><p>I had to laugh out loud about that one. I could argue that I\u2019d have to be having sex with him in order to be used for it, but I wasn\u2019t going there with her because it was none of her business. \u201cNow would be the perfect time for you to become a missing person so run along and get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Nick know what a bitch you are?\u201d</p><p>She said I was a bitch like it was a bad thing. This chick didn\u2019t want to pick a fight with me because it was a battle she wouldn\u2019t win. I was a sarcastic genius. \u201cHe sure does and he loves the things my smart ass mouth can do to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let me leave you with this thought. When he gets you in his backseat to screw you, just remember he had me there first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip. I\u2019ll be sure to wipe the backseat down with bleach before I get naked.\u201d I wanted to puke, but I wouldn\u2019t let her see the way she had shaken me so I put on my poker face and prepared for my next best comeback. \u201cLook, this bitch doesn\u2019t want to be one of your 99 problems, so can you please cage the rage before I have to activate the Bat Shit Signal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me.\u201d</p><p>I used my best condescending voice and believe me, it was an awesome one. \u201cDarlin,\u2019 if I got smart with you, how would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, smart ass bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNicely played.\u201d My words oozed with sarcasm as I under dramatically clapped my hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve just killed at least a minute of my time I\u2019ll never get back so run along because you\u2019ve delighted me long enough with your presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he screws you over like he did me.\u201d</p><p>I looked at my watch. \u201cHmm. Give us about 15, maybe 20 minutes and we should be gettin\u2019 right on that.\u201d</p><p>Sarcasm, insult, and mockery...my work here was done.</p><p>I faked her out and she thought she wasn\u2019t getting to me, so she turned and stormed off. When I turned my attention back to the race, it was already over and I didn\u2019t even know who won.</p> <p>It looked like everyone was going out to congratulate Nick, so I guessed that was a good sign he had won. I hung back so his fans could talk to him, but I heard him calling for me over the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBack here,\u201d I called out from behind the crowd.</p><p>He pushed his way through the crowd to get to me, just like the first night we met. He wrapped his arms around me and lifted me for a quick spin. \u201cThat one was for you, Love.\u201d</p><p>20 Surprise In An Elevator</p><p>Nick</p><p>Payton\u2019s parents being home sucked. She told me she needed to be careful where they were concerned, but I hadn\u2019t seen her since my race three days ago and 72 hours was too long for me to go without her. I needed to feel her in my arms, but tonight I would have her all to myself because I had something special planned after the banquet.</p> <p>I stood in front of the mirror to my dresser and straightened my tie for the dozenth time as I thought about the fight Dad and I had about me asking Payton to come to the banquet. He was no less prejudice than her parents and I didn\u2019t understand why he was so opposed to us being together.</p><p>There was a soft knock on my bedroom door and I knew it was Dallas because Jake always entered unannounced. \u201cYou can come in.\u201d</p><p>Dallas opened the door and peeked in at me. \u201cNeed help with your tie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It won\u2019t stay straight. It keeps slipping or something.\u201d</p><p>She came to stand in front of me and she untied it completely so she could start from scratch. \u201cI heard you and Dad arguing about Payton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with him? He acts like she\u2019s the devil incarnate, but she\u2019s not. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p><p>She made the first loop on my tie. \u201cI know. I really like her and I think you two are great for each other. She grounds you.\u201d</p><p>She made the next loop and pulled it through to make the perfect knot. \u201cI love her, Dallas. I know it\u2019s crazy and it\u2019s so soon, but I do.\u201d</p> <p>She finished my tie and patted my chest as if to say, \u2018all done.\u2019 \u201cHave you told her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve told her that I was falling for her, but I haven\u2019t said \u2018I love you.\u2019 I have something special planned for us after the banquet and I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m telling her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, too. I\u2019m certain of it. Even Dane says he\u2019s never seen her so crazy over a guy before, not even that Cooper guy she dated for a while.\u201d</p><p>Just thinking about saying those three words to her made me want to throw up, but in a good way. \u201cI sure hope so because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if she told me she didn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember what Ginny says about love...have no regrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not worried about it. So, tell me how things are going between you and Dane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s great. I like him a lot and he\u2019s good to me.\u201d</p><p>I never expected anything less from him. He seemed like a real standup kind of guy. \u201cHe better treat you right if he knows what\u2019s good for him. I\u2019ve got a can of whoop ass with his name on it if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jake appeared at my bedroom door. \u201cMiss Fancy Pants is in the living room waiting on you.\u201d</p><p>Thanks a lot, Jake. Could you say that a little louder? I don\u2019t think the neighbors at the end of the street heard. \u201cDon\u2019t call her that, especially loud enough for her to hear you.\u201d</p><p>He thought he was being funny when he lowered his voice to a feminine whisper. \u201cOkay, Miss Hot Piece of Ass is in the living room waiting on you. Wuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even say a word. He has every right to be like that with you after the way you\u2019ve ragged him about Gabbi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck with whatever you have planned for Payton tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sis.\u201d</p><p>I walked into the living room and Payton was standing with her back turned to me looking at my school pictures on the wall. \u201cCute little bugger, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>She turned around and her beauty almost took my breath away. Her hair was swept up with a cream flower and there were loose curls hanging around her face. She was wearing a strapless, cream colored lace cocktail dress with a wide black tie around her waist. Her tanned legs were bare and their length accented by the tallest heels I\u2019d seen her in to date, making her almost as tall as me.</p><p>\u201cYou just keep surprising me. I didn\u2019t think you could be any more beautiful, but then you go and prove me wrong again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You look very handsome in your suit and tie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I clean up all right.\u201d I walked over to her and put my hands on her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna let me mess up your lip gloss, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not right now, but I\u2019d be terribly disappointed if you didn\u2019t later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have plans for a lot of things tonight. Let me grab my keys and we\u2019ll get going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go in my car tonight if you want. That is if it won\u2019t mess up any of those plans you\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She held up the keys to her Lexus and dangled them in front of me. \u201cHere, you\u2019re driving.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>We passed the car off to the valet and then walked through the hotel lobby to the banquet hall where we found a large room lined with tables covered with black table cloths and big fresh flower center pieces.</p><p>Payton looped her hand through my arm as I escorted her across the room to the table where I saw my family sitting. My dad looked up and saw her on my arm and was none too happy, but I didn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t the one I wanted to please.</p><p>I gave him a look that begged him to not be rude. \u201cDad, you remember Payton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Good to see you again, Payton.\u201d I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s good to see you again as well, Mr. Hawke. Thank you for allowing me to be part of your big night and congratulations on the award you\u2019ll be receiving tonight.\u201d</p><p>An announcer interrupted whatever my dad was about to say to Payton by tapping the mic and announcing that the awards ceremony was about to begin and would be followed by a meal and live music.</p><p>Payton\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI love live bands. Will you dance with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t miss dancing with you for the world.\u201d</p><p>We finished the award ceremony and dinner within an hour and the band got started immediately. It was a slow song and I offered my hand to Payton. \u201cMay I have this dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you may.\u201d</p><p>The band was playing their version of \u2018Faithfully\u2019 and it was actually pretty good. There were only a few other couples on the floor, but we could have been the only ones and I wouldn\u2019t have cared. Having her in my arms felt so good, so right.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s this surprise you have for me? Are you gonna teach me to shoot a shotgun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tonight\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t include guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, teaching me to shoot a pistol might not have been the smartest move on your part. If I ever caught you cheating on me, you\u2019d stand a far better chance of surviving if I didn\u2019t know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019m not worried. I\u2019m just like this song says. I\u2019m forever yours. Faithfully.\u201d</p><p>She was amused. \u201cYou can be nauseatingly sweet sometimes, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you changed the subject on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did. Are you gonna tell me what the surprise is?\u201d</p><p>I was nervous, but I had to tell her at some point so now was as good a time as any. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t freak out because this doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m asking for or expecting more. This is only about us having some alone time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about, but I promise I\u2019m not going to freak out on you.\u201d</p><p>I took the keycard for a hotel room out of my pocket and held it up for her to see. \u201cI got us a room in this hotel. If you need to think about it or if you don\u2019t want to go up with me, I completely understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I don\u2019t have to think about it at all. I want to.\u201d</p><p>We stopped dancing and she stroked her fingertips over my lips. \u201cLike now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s tell everyone we\u2019re leaving and then we\u2019ll go up.\u201d</p><p>After we told everyone goodnight, we were standing alone in the elevator as it rose to our floor. Being so close to Payton, I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to touch her, so I stroked the back of my fingers down her bare arm and watched the chill bumps rise on her skin.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nick. I forgot my purse on the table. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. It won\u2019t take but a minute to go back down to get it.\u201d</p><p>I reached over and pressed the button for the ground floor and we made a stop at the third floor on the way down so Payton and I moved to the side to allow the couple onto the elevator. The petite blond woman and tall dark haired man were laughing when the doors opened and they immediately went solemn when they saw Payton. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The silence was thick as they stared at each other and then the doors closed without them getting on or saying a word. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>Payton looked pale. \u201cThat was my mother but that wasn\u2019t my father. It was his business partner.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. Not good. Not good at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. Are you all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think my brain has had time to process what I just saw.\u201d</p><p>I tried to think of anything to better the situation. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other conclusion could I jump to? She\u2019s supposed to be at one of her Women\u2019s Auxiliary meetings and I\u2019m pretty sure they don\u2019t hold those one on one in hotel rooms with men.\u201d</p><p>Payton\u2019s mom was definitely gettin\u2019 it on with her dad\u2019s partner. \u201cDo you need to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I have to. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m screwing up our night.\u201d</p> <p>I put my arm around her and pulled her close. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not screwing up anything, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any kind of condition to drive. I\u2019m taking you home and I\u2019ll get Jake and Gabbi to follow us and pick me up at your house.\u201d</p><p>She waited by the entrance while I got her purse and made arrangements with Jake. When we started driving toward her house, I had no idea if she wanted to talk or not, so I left that ball in her court. If she wanted to talk we would. If she didn\u2019t, that was fine, too.</p><p>We were almost to her house when she finally decided she wanted to talk about what happened. \u201cShe\u2019s gonna try to turn this on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Her affair with your dad\u2019s business partner has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how she is. She\u2019s gonna try to deflect from what she was doing onto me being in a hotel with you.\u201d</p><p>I pulled into the driveway and Jake parked on the street to wait for me. \u201cDo you want me to go in with you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. That would only make things worse, but I truly appreciate it. This is something I have to handle on my own.\u201d</p><p>She leaned over and gave me a light kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow and let you know how things went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t wait until tomorrow. Promise me you will call me tonight or I\u2019ll be worried sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll call you as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>She gave me another kiss and then hesitated like she wanted to say something. I wanted to take the opportunity to tell her I loved her, but the timing was all wrong. It would have to wait until another time.</p><p>21 Refuge</p><p>Payton</p><p>My mother beat me home and was waiting in the living room when I walked through the door. \u201cYour father\u2019s in bed and you will keep your voice down.\u201d</p> <p>I sat on the couch across from her and waited to see which approach she would take to turning all of this away from herself and she didn\u2019t disappoint me. \u201cWho was that boy you were with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Nick Hawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing with him in that hotel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s father was being honored at a banquet and we went to see him accept his award.\u201d</p><p>Her voice dripped with sarcasm. \u201cAnd his father was receiving his award in a hotel room instead of the banquet hall?\u201d</p><p>If she wanted to call me out, I could do the same. \u201cNo, Mother, I was going up to that room with Nick to do the same thing you were doing with David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I was doing at that hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of what you may think, I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me or what I was doing because I\u2019m the adult here. I want to know everything about that boy you were with.\u201d There it was. Her deflection.</p><p>\u201cI love him and that\u2019s all you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard anything about him?</p><p>It was pointless to lie. \u201cBecause I knew you\u2019d never approve of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from Collinsville. He doesn\u2019t come from money or influence. His dad is a cop and his mother abandoned his family when he was six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019re describing, I would have, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother! How could you say something so cruel?\u201d</p><p>She ignored my question. \u201cThis is the way this is going to be. You\u2019re never going to see that boy again and you\u2019re going to keep your mouth shut about seeing me and David in that hotel together. Got it?\u201d</p><p>My mother was being unreasonable just as I predicted so I stormed to my room to pack a bag so I could go to Tillie\u2019s. She had always been my refuge from my mother and I hoped tonight would no be different.</p><p>I needed to talk to Nick. I dialed his number and put him on speaker phone as I drove the short distance to my aunt and uncle\u2019s house. He answered on the first ring without his normal greeting.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>No. I definitely wasn\u2019t okay. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well. She did exactly what I thought she would. She turned everything around on me and what I was doing in that hotel with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need to come and get you?\u201d</p><p>I would love nothing more, but that wasn\u2019t going to help matters. \u201cNo. I\u2019m on my way to Tillie\u2019s to stay the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her about me?\u201d</p><p>I told her the truth, that I loved you. \u201cWhat could I tell her but the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me that I was never going to see you again.\u201d</p><p>He went silent. \u201cAre you still there, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton, that can\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I can hardly stand to go one day without seeing you. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d survive not seeing you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do? She could make things bad for you.\u201d</p><p>That was an understatement. \u201cI don\u2019t know. The only thing I\u2019m sure of is that I\u2019m not going to lose you because of her. I\u2019ll think of something; I always do.\u201d</p><p>I was desperate to make this work and I would resort to measures I wouldn\u2019t normally consider. Maybe Tillie could help sort out this mess. She had offered to talk to my mom about Nick. Maybe she could convince her to quit being such a hard ass.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here and I want to talk to Tillie before she goes to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to call me first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And there it was. The perfect moment to tell him that I loved him was hanging in the air, yet I couldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want my first time to tell him to be over the phone. I needed to see his face when I said those three words.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll talk to you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I love you, Nick.</p><p>I sat in my car for a minute just thinking about what would have happened if we hadn\u2019t run into my mother in the hotel. I think I would have given myself to him. Hell, who was I kidding? I know I would have. He had the room the rest of the night and I was tempted to call him back and tell him to meet me there, but that wasn\u2019t gonna fix the mess we were in and would likely only compound the problem.</p><p>I saw Tillie standing on the front porch looking toward my car, so I got out before she came to check on me. She met me on the walkway and gave me the hug my mother should have given me when I told her I was in love.</p><p>\u201cOh, Pate. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew this was how she would react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to keep your relationship with Nick a secret.\u201d</p><p>This is the part where things got tricky. Did I tell her the truth about how my mother knew or did I lie to protect her secret? She certainly didn\u2019t deserve the courtesy, but I decided to keep her secret for now to protect my Dad.</p><p>\u201cWe slipped up and she caught us together.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a lie, but that didn\u2019t make me feel better because I knew I was telling her a half truth.</p><p>\u201cAnd she forbade you to see Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like I said she would. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do because I have no idea how far she\u2019s willing to go to keep us apart. If I continue to see him, she\u2019ll make my life a living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a talk with her. Maybe I can get her to change her mind.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t holding out hope and the impact of the night\u2019s events finally caught up with me as tears washed down my face like a breaking dam. My mom was cheating on my dad and I stood to lose the boy I was so desperately in love with. Could things get any worse for me?</p><p>\u201cGo to bed and try not to worry. Everything will look different tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, I had the good sense to throw my necessities into a bag before I jetted out of my house. I changed into the sleep clothes I packed and hung my cocktail dress on the closet door. I crawled into bed and looked at it hanging there before I turned the lamp off. That wasn\u2019t where my dress was supposed to be. It was supposed to be in a crumpled pile on the hotel room floor.</p><p>I hoped sleep could claim me quickly so I could put the pain out of my mind, but I stayed awake crying most of the night. I didn\u2019t feel any more hopeful when I woke up the next morning. If anything, I was less hopeful. I reached for my phone to call Nick because I promised I would and because he would want an update on how things had gone with my aunt.</p><p>\u201cHey, Beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called early. I don\u2019t think I slept an hour all night from worrying. How did things go after we talked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Tillie is going to try to talk to her, but I\u2019m telling you now that she will never change her mind. That would mean admitting she was wrong and she doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come here? I\u2019m the only one home and I\u2019d like to see you before the clan gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. What\u2019s the address and I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait for Nick to make it to the door. I needed to feel his arms around me, so I swung it open as he came up the steps and met him halfway. \u201cIt feels so good, so safe to be in your arms. I wanted to pretend all of this was a terrible nightmare that didn\u2019t exist once I woke up.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me tightly. \u201cI wish I could make it all go away for you.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his face and kissed him as though he might disappear at any moment. If my mom had anything to do with it, he would.</p><p>When I was finished kissing him, I grabbed his hand and led him toward the house. \u201cCome in so we can talk before Tillie and the kids get back.\u201d</p><p>We walked inside the house. \u201cHave you had breakfast yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I came straight here after you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still some breakfast left. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>I took him into the kitchen and he sat at the bar while I warmed leftovers from the breakfast Tillie had made for the kids. I put his plate in front of him and realized I probably should have told him what it was first. Everyone might not like dessert for breakfast. \u201cChocolate gravy and biscuits. Can you believe that? My mom would die before she would serve this in our house. She\u2019d be afraid one of us might gain a pound.\u201d</p><p>His expression was bittersweet. \u201cMy mom used to cook this for us. I haven\u2019t had this since I was a little kid.\u201d He took his first bite and shook his head. \u201cTastes just the way I remember it.\u201d</p><p>I was afraid the reminder of his mother\u2019s cooking might upset him, but it didn\u2019t. It was a pleasant recollection for him and I found myself wanting to make a new memory for him...one of me cooking this meal for him. \u201cSince Ginny taught me how to make biscuits, I could ask Tillie to show me how to make the chocolate gravy and I could cook this for you sometime.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and put his hand on top of mine. He squeezed it gently as he gave me that beautiful grin that showed his dimples. \u201cI would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>I avoided the issue at hand while he finished his plate. I wanted him to enjoy it without feeling the nauseatingly nervous feeling I got every time I thought about how we were gonna handle this situation with my mother.</p><p>When he finished his plate, he sat back in his chair and looked at me solemnly as he sighed. \u201cBaby, what are we gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m hoping Tillie will come back with good news but I\u2019m not holding my breath. This is Vivian Archer we\u2019re dealing with here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a way to win? You either give in to your mother\u2019s demands and never see me again or go against her and suffer the consequences? And what would her consequences be? Would she cut you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I ask that of you?\u201d</p><p>How could you not if you loved me? \u201cI didn\u2019t know it until last night, but I would go up against the world for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nuts. You shouldn\u2019t be forced to choose between me or your family. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, but welcome to the world of money, privilege and influence. Those who don\u2019t have it think it\u2019s what they want and need, but money is ugly.\u201d</p> <p>I heard Claire\u2019s ringtone as my phone vibrated on the kitchen counter. \u201cIt\u2019s Claire. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s calling to see how last night went. She doesn\u2019t know anything about what happened with my mom. Do you mind if I take this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and I\u2019ll clear these dishes.\u201d</p><p>As I explained everything that happened after the banquet, I paced the floor because it was what I did when I was upset. I had almost explained the entire night\u2019s events when I looked up and saw Nick staring at the photographs on the refrigerator.</p><p>He turned to look at me and held up a photo he had taken off the freezer door. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>I knew something was terribly wrong when I saw his face. \u201cClaire, I need to call you back.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him and looked at the photo I walked by every time I was in Tillie\u2019s kitchen. I pointed to each person in the photo. \u201cThat\u2019s my Aunt Tillie, Uncle Brigham and their kids Tristan and Tara.\u201d</p><p>He looked so pale. \u201cShe may be Tillie to you, but my dad always called her Mattie.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How does your dad know Tillie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Matilda and she\u2019s my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I could mistake my own mother? I might have been young when she left, but I couldn\u2019t forget her face. This is Matilda Hawke, or she used to be. I guess she\u2019s Matilda Archer now.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cShit, it all makes sense now why my dad didn\u2019t want me to date you. He knew I would figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Dutch didn\u2019t want Nick to date me? That was news to me.</p><p>The door leading from the garage flew open and Tristan and Tara came flying through the kitchen and both ran over to hug me around the waist. \u201cHey, Pate. Who\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Nick. Are y'all staying to swim with us today?\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Nick and saw the realization on his face. He was looking at his brother and sister for the first time. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t today, Sweet Pea. We have some things to take care of. Maybe another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Unaffected by our decline, they took off upstairs to their bedrooms and I was glad because I had no idea what was about to go down.</p><p>Tillie came through the door carrying a couple of sacks of groceries and went straight to the counter without looking in our direction. She started putting the refrigerated products away and then caught sight of us and was startled.</p><p>She looked at me and then at Nick and I knew by the look on her face that everything he said was true. She was his mother.</p><p>She staggered back a step or two, taken surprise by the son she had abandoned so many years ago. \u201cNickolas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nick now.\u201d</p><p>She cupped her nose and mouth with both of her hands and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Nick stared at her, taking her in and studying her. \u201cAll this time I thought you were a million miles away and you were only one town over. You were a twenty minute drive from us and nothing. Not one visit. Not a single call. You just left while we were in school. We got up that morning with a mother and came home without one.\u201d</p><p>She stared blankly at Nick.</p><p>\u201cHow could you leave like that and never contact us again?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her waiting for her answer. I thought of that six year-old boy that felt like no one could love him if his own mother hadn\u2019t and I became angry. My anger quickly escalated to fury as I thought about the way her choices had damaged this man I loved and I didn\u2019t recognize the voice coming from within me. \u201cTell him! An explanation is the very least you owe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Brigham and we fell in love, but he told me the only way we could be together was if I left all of you behind. He didn\u2019t want kids that weren\u2019t his.\u201d</p><p>She reached out to him and he recoiled from her touch. \u201cYou got your happily ever after. I hope it was worth it.\u201d</p><p>He spun around to leave and she called out after him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Nickolas, but I swear there\u2019s not been one day I didn\u2019t regret leaving you and Jacob and Dallas.\u201d</p><p>The lack of Dutch\u2019s name didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Have a nice life, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d I ran to grab my stuff and then I ran out the door to catch him.</p><p>He stopped and turned to grab my arms as his fingers gripped me tightly. \u201cPayton, I\u2019m not in a good place right now.\u201d</p><p>I grimaced from the pain and he immediately loosened his hold and put his arms around me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Baby. Did I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He did, but I\u2019d never tell him that. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d He pulled me into his world and squeezed me tightly.</p><p>I needed him to know I was on his side. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go see my dad. Alone. I have to know if he knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that you need to do that without me. When\u2019s check out time on the room you booked last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Noon.\u201d</p><p>We left in such haste that I know he didn\u2019t check out. \u201cDo you still have the keycard to the hotel room?\u201d</p><p>He reached for his wallet and opened it. He slid the card out and I stroked his hand as I took it. \u201cMeet me there after you finish talking to your dad. And stop by the front desk to add on an extra night.\u201d</p><p>22 Room 329</p><p>Nick</p><p>I wasn\u2019t looking forward to this at all. I wanted to turn my car around and go to Payton in our hotel room, but I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to confront my dad about the things he knew about our mom, but kept from us.</p><p>His patrol car was in the drive when I got home. It was his day off, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t be back from his morning run for at least another 30 minutes. Maybe longer if he was doing long distance today.</p><p>I was sitting on the couch when he came through the door and he was clearly surprised to see me. \u201cI thought you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I came back because I need to talk to you about something serious.\u201d</p><p>He wiped the sweat from his face with the towel around his neck. \u201cOkay. Shoot.\u201d</p><p>That was one of the perks of having Dutch Hawke for a dad. He was a straight shooter and taught me to not beat around the bush. \u201cI\u2019ve been at Matilda Archer\u2019s house this morning. Did you know our mother lived in Franklin?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and sat in the recliner across from me. \u201cI knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was having an affair. He wanted her but he didn\u2019t want you. He made her choose between him or her kids and she chose him. How was I supposed to look you in the face and tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe deserved to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were too young to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I\u2019m almost nineteen and I can\u2019t understand it now, but I still deserved to know. You have no idea how I felt when I realized I was standing there looking at my mother. She has other kids. We have a brother and sister we didn\u2019t even know existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew Payton was the link to exposing the truth. That\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want us to be together, but it\u2019s all out in the open now. You don\u2019t have a reason to not want us to be together unless there\u2019s something else you\u2019re not telling us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never had anything against Payton personally. She\u2019s a very lovely girl, but I knew your being with her would come to this. I was scared for you. I didn\u2019t know how you would handle it because you were always the one that took it the hardest. It did something to you when Mattie left and I\u2019ve never known how to fix it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, but I don\u2019t think I would be if Payton wasn\u2019t in my life. It\u2019s weird how her presence in my life brought all this to the surface and yet she\u2019s the only one that could bring me out of this dark world I fell into. I love her, Dad, and she\u2019s the rock that will help me get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre are you going to tell Jake and Dallas about your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. At first, I was angry with you for not telling us, but I understand why you didn\u2019t. No child needs to hear that his mom left because she chose to be with her lover, but we\u2019re not little kids anymore. Jake would be fine, but Dallas is so tender hearted. I don\u2019t know how she would react so I need to think about it. She has the right to know, but I\u2019m not sure I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. You\u2019re not the parent here and the responsibility shouldn\u2019t fall onto your shoulders. You\u2019ve carried too much on them for too many years already.\u201d</p> <p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I tapped lightly on the door to room 329 and waited for Payton to answer. She opened the door and was wearing a plush, velour robe with the hotel emblem embroidered on the pocket. Her hair was slightly damp and hung in loose curls with the sides pulled away from her face. I immediately recognized her signature smell hanging in the air and I knew she had showered while she waited for me.</p><p>I stood in the doorway looking at her, realizing I was afraid to take a step inside without her invitation. She stepped back to make room for me in the doorway and I recognized it for what it was-her unspoken invitation to join her in our room.</p><p>My heart leapt with excitement of the unknown. I wasn\u2019t sure what being alone with her in this room all day and night might bring, but I was content with just being with her if that\u2019s what she wanted.</p><p>I walked into the room and she shut the door behind me. I hadn\u2019t had time to come up to the room when I booked it the night before, so I looked around for the first time and took it all in, including the king size bed.</p><p>She came up from behind and hugged me with her head against my back. I reached for one of her hands on my chest and grasped it so I could bring it to my lips for a kiss.</p> <p>She squeezed me tightly and sighed as if having me in her arms was a relief. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you. I know it has only been a couple of hours, but it seems like I\u2019ve been in this room waiting on you forever.\u201d</p><p>She let go of me and I took her hand as we moved to the bed to sit on the edge. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I had to wait on my dad to get home from his run.\u201d</p><p>She looked so nervous. \u201cDid it go all right?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt went as well as it could considering the topic. He knew where she was all these years and I was pissed at first, but then he explained some things and I understand why he didn\u2019t tell us when we were smaller. I still think he should have when we were older, but I see how it was easier for him to let sleeping dogs lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t forget that he was in pain as well. She was his wife and she left him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be terrible for him, but I don\u2019t remember any kind of reaction out of him. He\u2019s was there, but he wasn\u2019t. It was almost like losing both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how she did that. She\u2019s always been so loving toward me, more so than my own mother. I\u2019ve often thought of her as more of a mother to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronic, huh? She wouldn\u2019t stay to be a mother to her own children, but she chose to mother you when you needed one.\u201d I put my arm around her and pulled her close. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t hate her too much since she took care of my girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour girl? I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it, too.\u201d</p><p>I kissed the top of her head and she tilted her face up to look at me. I couldn't resist putting my lips against hers, but our position wasn\u2019t right. It felt awkward and uncomfortable.</p><p>She must have had the same thought because she slid off the edge of the bed and came to stand between my knees. She put her hands on my face as she looked in my eyes. \u201cI want to take away all of your pain and show you how worthy you are of being loved.\u201d She reached for the hem of my T-shirt and pulled it over my head. She tossed it over her shoulder to the floor and then ran her finger over the words inked across my skin. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be true.\u201d</p><p>I put my hand on top of hers over my heart. \u201cThis was the only truth I\u2019d ever known until I met you. My dad told me I didn\u2019t know the power you had over me, but he was wrong. I know you have the power to heal this and make me whole again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to start right now.\u201d She untied the knot of the belt holding the hotel robe around her and allowed it to slide down her arms to a puddle on the floor. Beneath it, she was wearing a short, cream nightgown with layers of black lace ruffles. It was sexy, yet somehow innocent, and no one had ever worn anything like it for me.</p><p>I put my finger under one of the slim straps and ran it up to her shoulder and back down again. \u201cWhen did you get this little number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swung by to get it on my way here. Do you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah! I freakin\u2019 love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I was hoping you would. I sort of had you in mind when I bought it.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her by the waist and pulled her closer between my legs. \u201cI better be the only somebody you had on your mind when you bought it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only somebody ever on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d</p><p>She pushed me backwards on the bed and took off my socks and shoes before she crawled up my body and straddled me. I put my hands on her waist and guided her to the spot where I needed to feel the pressure of her body against my groin. She put her palms flat on my chest and slowly slid them up until she reached my shoulders. On the way back down, she used her perfectly manicured nails to scratch my skin with just enough pressure to make me groan.</p><p>When she finished raking her nails down my chest, she surprised me by reaching for the button on my jeans. \u201cSomeone is very frisky today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>She never took her eyes from mine as she popped the button on my jeans loose and then slid my zipper down. She dipped her fingers into my waistband and pulled downward, so I lifted my hips and she had me out of my jeans, leaving me down to my black and white boxer briefs.</p><p>She dropped her mouth to my chest and pressed her body against me as she slid down to kiss my ink. She didn\u2019t linger there long before she moved lower to just above my waistband. It was one of the teasers I had performed on her and to have her do it to me in return was sweet torture.</p><p>She was driving me insane and I couldn\u2019t stand the teasing any longer. If I couldn\u2019t be inside her, I needed to at least be on top of her. I grabbed her waist and flipped her onto her back so I could press my body against hers in hopes of a little relief.</p><p>She bent her knees and they fell apart to kindly accommodate me. I propped on my elbows and held her face in my palms so I could memorize it. It was foolish to think her mother might not keep us apart, so I had to be honest with myself about where we were going and the truth was...I had no idea.</p><p>Her honey colored eyes stared up at my chocolate ones and she saw the uncertainty in them. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna work out. It has to.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and pressed my forehead to hers. \u201cI can\u2019t lose you, Doll Face.\u201d</p><p>Things suddenly felt too serious and I needed to lighten the mood. I lifted my head from hers and pulled on her bottom lip with my mouth. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to never be shocked by this delicate mouth again. Come on, shock me. I\u2019m dying to hear some new material.\u201d</p><p>She reached up and put her palms on my face. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Of all the things I had imagined happening between us, I had highly underestimated the way I would feel hearing her tell me she loved me for the first time. My heart felt like it was swelling and about to burst with the love I had for her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Payton Archer.\u201d I rubbed my thumb over her lips. \u201cI think I did the moment you opened this smart ass mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss this smart ass mouth.\u201d</p><p>I did as I was told and then I trailed my mouth down her throat to her breasts. I reached under her sexy gown to see what kind of surprise I could find underneath. I got up on my knees and lifted her gown to find matching lace panties. Damn, they looked so hot on her.</p><p>I hooked my fingers in the sides and tugged a little, testing her to see if was okay to take them off. \u201cBusiness as usual, ma'am? Everything with the exception of the deed itself?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at me. \u201cNo, not this time. I want everything plus the deed itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t want you to look back on this and regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you and I could never regret you making love to me. Not in a million years.\u201d She lifted her hips off the bed, my cue to slip her panties down and this thing I had done so many times suddenly felt like something I had never done before.</p><p>I tossed them to the floor next to my clothes and she hooked her thumbs in the elastic waistband of my boxer briefs and pushed down. She caught my underwear with her toes once they were below my hips and pushed them down to the foot of the bed under the sheets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt myself touch her sweetest part and I knew I was in danger of coming apart at the seams as she positioned herself with her knees to either side of my hips. Damn. The condoms were in my jeans pocket. Rookie mistake.</p><p>I pulled away to reach for my pants in the floor, but she locked her legs around my waist. \u201cI\u2019m just getting a condom from my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need that. I\u2019ve been on the pill for a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>She could see the storm within me. \u201cYou told me you\u2019d never been with anyone without protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been with anyone, so we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p> <p>She squeezed me against her using her legs. \u201cI want to feel you inside me with nothing between us.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for this girl and I felt myself giving in to what she wanted, which wasn\u2019t terribly difficult to do. I hovered over her and kissed her face as I stroked her cheek with my fingers. \u201cI swear I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d</p><p>She reached for my face with her hands. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna hurt a little at first until I push all the way through, but then it should get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t think it was possible to love this girl more. \u201cI love you, Payton, and I need you to know something. I may have given my body to a lot of girls, but none of them have ever possessed my heart. It belongs to you and no other.</p> <p>She smiled and it melted the heart that belonged only to her. \u201cAnd mine belongs to you and no other.\u201d</p><p>I gently pressed myself against her without pushing inside and she shut her eyes tightly like she was waiting for a painful assault. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes and I could see the fear she was so bravely trying to hide from me. \u201cDon\u2019t stop looking in my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I slowly pushed myself inside this girl I adored and was shocked by how wonderfully different she felt. I heard you couldn\u2019t always feel the barrier that had to tear, but I undeniably felt Payton\u2019s and knew I was about to hurt her because I was in a place where no man had ever been before me.</p><p>I watched her eyes as I pushed through and saw the shock and pain the second it happened so I stopped so she could recover from it. She tensed and slammed her eyes shut. She bit her bottom lip and roughly dug her nails into my back, which served me right for what I was doing to her.</p><p>After a minute, her pain subsided and I felt her relax beneath me but I waited. I wanted her to ask me for more. And that\u2019s exactly what she did.</p><p>23 We Happened</p> <p>Payton</p><p>Shit, that hurt.</p><p>I opened my eyes and looked at Nick hovering over me. He was still inside me, but completely motionless and I knew he had stopped because he didn\u2019t want to hurt me more than necessary.</p><p>I realized how tense I was so I took a breath and slowly blew it out as I forced my body to relax. I took several more deep breaths and then I felt something entirely different. It wasn\u2019t pain at all. It was a building desire low in my groin and I was desperate to have the full experience of the deed itself.</p><p>It felt like someone else was in control of my body as I started to lift my hips against Nick. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Keep going.\u201d</p><p>He happily complied with my command. \u201cTell me what you want and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hair and grabbed two fistfuls. \u201cYou. All of you. Right now.\u201d</p><p>I just thought I had screamed his name before.</p><p>I was still waiting for my heart to slow down and to catch my breath when Nick rolled off of me. I turned on my side so I could face him and saw a thin sheen of sweat across his brow. It was hotter than hell knowing he had worked that sweat up on me.</p><p>He looked at me, assessing my eyes and breathlessly asked, \u201cAre you okay? I didn\u2019t hurt you too bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only hurt for a minute and then it felt really good.\u201d I couldn\u2019t contain my smile. \u201cI want to do it again.\u201d</p><p>He rolled toward me and kissed me through his smile. \u201cDamn, girl. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, boy. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>We spent all day in bed but Nick noticed when my stomach growled in protest from its lack of food. \u201cI need to feed you so you can be strong for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>He glided his nose along mine before he got up. \u201cYes, ma'am. A lot more.\u201d</p><p>Good.</p><p>I wanted to stay in and order room service but Nick insisted on taking me out somewhere nice for dinner. I dragged myself out of bed and got ready because I wanted to please him. Again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to wash Nick\u2019s smell off, but I had to take another shower. When I was finished, I put on a cream sundress with a pair of brown sandals. I hadn\u2019t brought all of my hair straightening supplies so I was left with no option but to go curly. I pulled the front into a twist and secured it to the side with the back hanging in loose curls below my shoulders.</p><p>Nick walked up behind me in the bathroom and pushed my hair away from my neck. He planted a kiss behind my ear and watched my face in the mirror. \u201cI told you that we were gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did and I\u2019m so glad you were right although I was so positive you were wrong at the time. I didn\u2019t want you to be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He reached under my sundress and rubbed his hand across my panties. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a good thing I couldn\u2019t resist trying to get into these.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d never get out of the room if he kept doing things like that, so I pushed his hand away. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in that bed happenin\u2019 again if you don\u2019t stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>He loved having that kind of power over me, but he tried to let me think I was the one in control. \u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d</p><p>Nick took me to a romantic Italian restaurant. They weren\u2019t busy because it was the middle of the week and we were seated in a booth in a dark, secluded area off to ourselves. We were in the middle of our meal when I got a text from my aunt.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from Tillie.\u201d I looked up at Nick. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know she\u2019s Mattie to you, but she\u2019s been Tillie to me for thirteen years.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged like he didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I felt a bit of hope. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna read it and you can tell me what you think it means.\u201d I cleared my throat because it was a long one. Tillie never used short hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease know I am sorry for everything. I can\u2019t change the past but there\u2019s one thing I can change &amp; that\u2019s your mother\u2019s mind. You &amp; Nick will be together. I\u2019ve made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like she convinced her to go along with us being together, except I\u2019m certain that\u2019s not possible. She wouldn\u2019t have voluntarily consented to us being together. There is something else going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter what it means as long as we get to be together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t matter what the catch is, but do you see that she didn\u2019t just do this for me? She did this for you, too. She loves you and wants you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>He put his fork down on his plate. \u201cI need you to understand something, Payton. I have nothing for her, but I\u2019m choosing to be nice where she is concerned because you love her and I don\u2019t want to upset you. I honestly couldn\u2019t care less about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I don\u2019t blame you. I get it and I don\u2019t take your feelings lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d</p><p>After we finished dinner. We went back to the room to hit the resume button. We were both sleep deprived after the previous night, but neither of us wanted to sleep because we were afraid of missing one minute together.</p><p>The light of the morning sun was threatening to stream through the crack in the curtains when we both fell asleep from utter exhaustion and it was almost time to leave when we woke again, leaving us little time to be together before we\u2019d have to check out.</p><p>I opened my eyes and he was looking at me. \u201cAfter I met you, you became my reason to wake up every morning, but today you're my reason to stay in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how I wish we could.\u201d</p><p>I stretched and a seductive moan escaped my lips. \u201cOops, that was my inner porn star sound accidentally coming out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I recognize it from last night.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes he could be as witty as me. \u201cNice one.\u201d</p><p>I lazily sat up in the bed and brought the bed sheet with me tucked under my arms. He mimicked me minus the sheet and scooted over behind me to massage my back and shoulders. \u201cAre you sore?\u201d</p><p>I was, but it was a good kind of sore. \u201cA little bit, but it\u2019s mostly when I move.\u201d</p><p>He put his arms around me and stroked my stomach. \u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll think of me every time you move today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt I\u2019ll think of you whether I move or not.\u201d</p><p>He groaned as he kissed my shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave this bed, but I guess we can\u2019t stay here forever.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the clock and saw that our stolen time together was over. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta leave before they kick us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust give me five more minutes of this.\u201d He moved his mouth from my shoulder down my back and I gave him the five minutes he asked for plus another ten.</p><p>After the hands of time forced us out of bed and scurried us toward the door, we stopped for one last kiss before entering the hallway of the real world.</p><p>\u201cCall me as soon as you know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me in for one last hug and huskily whispered in my ear. \u201cI already have been.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>As I got closer to Franklin, I knew there was a stop I had to make before I walked in to have it out with my mother again. I needed to see Claire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But, I wasn\u2019t making the same mistake twice. I rang the doorbell and waited for her to come to the door because I didn\u2019t need another peep show of her and Jessie in bed together.</p><p>She opened the door and looked at me like I was nuts. \u201cSince when do you ring the doorbell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I got an eyeful of you and Kimosabe playing doctor under the covers. Thanks a lot \u2018cause I\u2019m scarred for life now. I\u2019ll never want to see a doctor again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up and get in here. I need an update on you and The Nickster.\u201d</p><p>I followed her to her living room and fell into her dad\u2019s recliner. \u201cA lot of crazy stuff has gone down, Claire. Being with Nick is like riding a bipolar coaster. One minute everything is awesome and I\u2019m happy and then the next the shit has hit the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>She gave me an all knowing look. \u201cUmm, tell me something I don\u2019t know. Jessie and I built and manage the bipolar coaster.\u201d</p><p>She was right. What was I thinking? Nick and I weren\u2019t the only ones with problems. \u201cDo you remember me telling you about the banquet to honor Nick\u2019s dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how did that go?\u201d</p> <p>I recalled how things played out and I wanted to go back in time and erase seeing my mom and David together. \u201cThings started out great. After the awards ceremony, we were dancing and Nick surprised me with a keycard to a room in the hotel where the banquet was.\u201d</p><p>She reached for a pillow on the couch and threw it at me. \u201cI\u2019m already jealous and you haven\u2019t told me any details yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t be too jealous when I tell you the rest. Nick and I ran into my mom with David. They were in the hotel together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean your dad\u2019s partner? That David?\u201d</p><p>I still wanted to cringe remembering the guilty looks on their faces. \u201cYeah, can you believe that? My mom is having an affair with him. Well, needless to say that put the brakes on me and Nick using the hotel room for whatever we were going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble shiz. So, what happened when you got home?\u201d</p> <p>Did she really even have to ask? She knew how psycho my mom could be. \u201cVivian went bat shit on me. She turned everything into why I was in a hotel with a boy. She told me I couldn\u2019t see Nick anymore. So, I went to Tillie\u2019s and that\u2019s where things got even crazier. I still can\u2019t believe it, but Tillie is Nick\u2019s mom.\u201d</p><p>When I finished explaining the whole mama drama situation, Claire was astounded. \u201cIs this gonna cause problems between you and Nick? I mean, his mom that left him has been more of a mother to you than her own children. That can\u2019t sit well with him.\u201d</p><p>Nope. No apparent problems in that department. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to cause too much of a problem for him since we just spent the last 24 hours in a hotel room together.\u201d</p><p>She let out a big squeal. \u201cShut the front door! Did you practice making babies with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a few times.\u201d</p><p>She found another pillow on the couch and threw it at me. \u201cI\u2019m so jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have reason to be. I\u2019m telling you, Claire...you have to do whatever it takes to talk Kimosabe into it. Seduce him if you have to.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYou caught me trying. Thanks, by the way. I almost had him talked into it when you came in on us. Now, he won\u2019t come back to my bed because he says that it\u2019s too tempting.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d worry if it wasn\u2019t. \u201cSorry. I really had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Can\u2019t blame you because he\u2019s too honorable for his own good, but we do have a little secret. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>Whatever it was had her grinning. \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d</p><p>Claire pulled her shorts down low on her hips and I saw a fresh black tattoo. It was an ornate, antique heart shaped lock without a key sitting just inside her hipbone, still red and inflamed. I was more attuned to these tattoos now and I could see Jessie\u2019s name entwined within it. \u201cJessie\u2019s got the matching key on his hip.\u201d</p><p>There was a time when I would have asked her if she had lost her mind, but not since I met Nick because I understood. \u201cI love it, Claire Bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was nervous about showing it to you. I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d say about it because I know you aren\u2019t into tattoos.\u201d</p><p>That was a different time in my life. \u201cI used to not be into them, but that was before I got a boyfriend with one bigger than my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be next.\u201d</p><p>Liking them and getting one was two completely different things. \u201cI doubt that. I\u2019m not a masochist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad. Jessie sat next to me the whole time and held my hand, or maybe it was me holding his. He wasn\u2019t excited about my pants being pulled down that far in front of another guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re gonna get another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Jessie doesn\u2019t want me to. He says he can\u2019t take watching it again, but something tells me it had less to do with the tattoo process and more of seeing the guy touching me so close to what he considers his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell him he has to claim it before he can consider it his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d</p><p>Who would have thought the bad girl hiding out below Claire\u2019s perfect persona would snag a bad boy that turned out to be so good?</p><p>24 Change Your World For Me And I\u2019ll Rock It</p><p>Nick</p><p>It had been a long time since we left the hotel and I was beginning to worry about Payton. My mind raced as I considered all the possibilities. Maybe my mother had not come through with what she promised and Payton walked into a mess when she got home.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to call or text her in case she was still talking to her mom, but my fear and worry were threatening to take the reins. I picked up my phone and contemplated calling, then put it down again. This was ridiculous. She wasn\u2019t in danger and she would call when she could.</p><p>My phone rang and I answered it immediately. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve been waiting forever. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, everything\u2019s fine. I needed to see Claire before I came home so I ran by her place for a minute. I\u2019m sorry. I guess I stayed longer than I realized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. So, how did it go when you got home?\u201d</p><p>It was like my mom was someone else. The calm before the storm would be the perfect description. \u201cWeird, that\u2019s how it went. My mom acted like everything was cool. She said she wants me to invite you over so she and my dad can meet you. It was like the whole elevator incident never happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think my mom told her?\u201d</p><p>For me, this could only be about one thing. \u201cI think she knows about my mom\u2019s affair with David and she\u2019s blackmailing her into letting us be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would my mom do that to her friend?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never see this for what it was. \u201cI think Tillie is doing it so she can see you happy and this is the only way she has any control over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope she\u2019s not doing it because she thinks it\u2019s gonna change the way I feel about her.\u201d</p><p>It mattered very little to me why she was doing it. \u201cDoes it matter why if it means we get to be together?</p><p>\u201cNothing matters as long as I have you. You and no other.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>Being with Payton in her house with her parents was strange. I was welcomed, yet I wasn\u2019t. Her mother was outwardly courteous, yet simultaneously cold and I guessed her father was probably confused about why his wife was supporting Payton\u2019s decision to date someone like me.</p><p>Dinner with the Archers was strained to say the least and they were less than impressed by my plans to attend community college and then apply to the police academy. Both of them had this incredible way of making me feel inferior without a word or a glance in my direction.</p><p>When dinner was over, Payton and I went into the backyard and sat by the pool to dangle our feet in the water. It was a huge relief to get away from her parents, but the inferior feeling they instilled in me remained and my lack of conversation didn\u2019t go unnoticed by my girl. \u201cYou\u2019ve been quiet tonight. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>When you screwed girls without a relationship, you didn\u2019t have to do the meet the parents thing so this was a first for me. Her parents made their disdain for me no secret and I guessed I worried in the back of my mind that Payton would eventually listen to them. \u201cIt\u2019s your parents. They might not say it, but they don\u2019t like me and they sure don\u2019t want me dating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry they were so rude to you. I knew that\u2019s how they\u2019d be and that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want you to meet them. It never had anything to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault I don\u2019t measure up to their expectations for their daughter\u2019s boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t say that. I couldn\u2019t be with anyone more perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help what I came from, but I could control where I was going and to see how unimpressed they were with my career choice shook me to my core. I wondered if Payton was as unimpressed as her parents. \u201cI\u2019ve never given my career choice any thought beyond it being what I wanted to do with my life, but being with you makes me think about more than myself. How do you feel about me being a cop?\u201d</p><p>She reached for my hand. \u201cI joke about how hot you\u2019d be in a uniform, but the truth is that I don\u2019t love the thought of you being in danger every time you go to work. It scares me.\u201d</p><p>I moved my foot over to Payton\u2019s and played footsie with her under the water. \u201cBecoming an officer is a few years down the road, but I need to ask you something. If we were still together in a few years, could you see yourself being with a cop?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell! Where did that come from?</p><p>She snaked her foot around my ankle and stroked it up and down. \u201cYeah, I could see myself dating a cop.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean dating and I took a deep breath as I prepared to ask the question that could make or break this relationship. \u201cI\u2019ll make a decent income as a cop, but I\u2019d never be able to give you the fancy things your parents have, so I\u2019m cutting straight to the chase here. Could you be happy being married to a cop?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She quickly turned to look at me because she needed to see if I was joking. When her eyes met mine she found no humor and I recognized the shock in hers. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. The tables had turned. I was the one to shock Payton Archer and I wasn\u2019t finished yet. \u201cI\u2019m serious as a heart attack. If you told me you couldn\u2019t be married to a police officer and wanted me to do something different, I would. I would be who you needed me to be.\u201d</p><p>Her foot fell away from mine and she had no response. Not one word. That couldn\u2019t be good. I had just basically told her I wanted to marry her one day in not so many words and I\u2019d change my career if it was going to keep her from being my wife.</p> <p>I was the first to look away because my bravery was suddenly replaced by embarrassment. That was such a stupid move on my part. What was I thinking? Girls like her didn\u2019t voluntarily go from living in luxury to middle-class at best.</p><p>She pulled her feet out the water and stood up. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>I pulled my feet out of the water and stood to follow her toward the pool house. She opened the door and we walked inside without turning on the light. After she shut the door, the dull light from the moon was the only illumination in the room as she reached for me in the darkness.</p><p>Her lips didn\u2019t need light to find mine, but when they did, they hovered without kissing me. \u201cThe only person I need you to be is you. If being you means you\u2019re a police officer, then I would be proud to be the wife of an officer.\u201d</p><p>She lightly sucked my bottom lip and let it go so it made a loud popping sound before she moved to my neck. How could she do that? Only one pull on my lip with her mouth and she could make me weak at the knees.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re parents are right there. I can see them through the window. What if they caught us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can see them but they can\u2019t see us. Besides, they already don\u2019t like you so how are we any worse off except both extremely frustrated?\u201d</p><p>She pulled my hands and led me over to a chair. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>I did as I was told and then she sat across my lap. \u201cYou just told me you would change your world to make me happy, so I think you deserve to have your world rocked, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>25 Hello Past. Have We Met?</p><p>Payton</p> <p>The next several weeks passed quickly and I tried to avoid thinking about my upcoming move to Knoxville because it hurt too much to consider being away from Nick. We had become so close and the thoughts of being away from him was too painful to think about.</p><p>Today was Monday, Ginny\u2019s day for her weekly cooking lesson with me and Dallas. Even Gabbi had joined us for lessons, so with all the women gathered in the kitchen making noise, Nick and his dad had started using this hour as one of their routine running times.</p><p>Today\u2019s menu was pork chops, fried squash, homemade mac and cheese and cornbread. My mother would die a thousand deaths if she knew I was learning to cook this kind of food.</p><p>There was a knock at the front door and I volunteered to answer it since I was in charge of the mac and cheese today and my job was done until the timer went off. I opened the door and found a pretty girl about my age standing there in tight faded jeans and a tight striped shirt. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Nick. Is he here?\u201d</p><p>I already didn\u2019t like this. \u201cNo, but he should be back in about half an hour. Do you want me to tell him you stopped by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I wait for him?\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped up and slammed against the wall of my throat while my instincts screamed at me; she was one of the unidentified. \u201cSure. Would you like to come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll sit in my car to wait.\u201d</p> <p>I walked back into the kitchen and Dallas immediately saw the sickened look on my face. She slid over to me away from Ginny and Gabbi and lowered her voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Who was at the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a girl looking for Nick and I got the distinct feeling she knew him well,\u201d I stressed so she would know what I meant. \u201cShe\u2019s waiting outside in her car for him to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter if he knew her well or not. He loves you and he\u2019s not studying any ho he used to mess around with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would she hang around to see him? Was she not clued in a little by his girlfriend answering the door?\u201d</p><p>Dallas placed a reassuring hand on my arm. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t go to school with us, then she probably thinks you\u2019re his sister. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>Well, I wasn\u2019t his sister and I wanted to know what the hell was going on.</p><p>I heard the front door open and I walked into the living room. Dutch looked suspiciously like Nick\u2019s wingman covering for him. \u201cNick will be in shortly. He had a friend stop by to talk for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to look like the jealous girlfriend so I forced myself to go back into the kitchen with the other women. I was apparently too preoccupied to hear the timer go off because Ginny cued me. \u201cPayton, that timer is for you. You need to check the macaroni to see if the panko crust is browned.\u201d</p><p>I zoned back into reality. \u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d I slid my hand into the oven mitt and then reached into the oven to pull it out and screamed when I burned my inner wrist.</p><p>Ginny sprung into action and started inspecting me immediately. \u201cHurry to the sink and run cool water over it to stop the burning process. Dallas, get Payton a plastic bag and put some ice cubes in it.\u201d</p><p>I ran the cool water over the burn and it helped a little, but I knew it was going hurt like a mutha later on. Dallas passed the bag of ice to me and I wrapped a paper towel around it.</p><p>Ginny came over to inspect my injury. \u201cEveryone gets burned in the kitchen at some point, Payton.\u201d</p><p>I could handle the burn in the kitchen. It was the potential burn of what was happening in the front yard that had me worried.</p><p>I sat in the kitchen holding the ice to my inner wrist while the girls got supper on the table in the dining room without me. I heard the front door open, but I didn\u2019t make a move. I was terrified to face Nick. I was afraid I might see something on his face I couldn\u2019t handle.</p><p>He walked into the kitchen and saw me holding the bag of ice over my inner arm. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Dallas spoke up for me. \u201cShe was preoccupied by what was in the front yard waiting for you and burned her arm.\u201d</p><p>That earned everyone\u2019s attention including Ginny\u2019s. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the front yard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019, Ginny. I\u2019m gonna take a shower before supper.\u201d</p><p>I was gonna explode before I got him alone to talk about that girl and what she was doin\u2019 here.</p><p>Dallas walked up beside me where I sat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I hope that didn\u2019t piss you off, but I wanted him to know it was his fault you got burned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was fine and it let him know we\u2019ll be having a little talk as soon as I can get him alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alone in the bathroom now. Dad doesn\u2019t give a rip if you\u2019re in there with him or not, so I\u2019ll cover with Ginny if you wanna sneak in there to talk to him. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re gonna be able to sit through this meal without dying inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he have the door locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSista, please. You think we don\u2019t know how to pick locks around here?\u201d</p><p>I followed her down the hall and watched her pop the lock on the door with a small screwdriver. \u201cOpen sesame.\u201d</p><p>The shower was running and I slipped in with the agility of a thief in the night. I locked the door behind me knowing it was of little consequence in this house with all the lock pickers living here.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton?\u201d He peeked around the shower curtain with shampoo in his hair. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 in here?\u201d</p><p>I was standing by the door with my arms crossed. \u201cI\u2019m the one that answered when that girl came to the door, so I know she was wanting to see you. Since she waited in her car for you, I\u2019m guessing she got her wish. What did she want from you?\u201d</p><p>He ducked back behind the curtain. \u201cCan we talk about it after supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t because I\u2019m freaking out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton, it\u2019s complicated and I can\u2019t explain the whole story before supper.\u201d</p><p>Complicated. I didn\u2019t like the way that sounded. \u201cWhat is there to explain?\u201d</p><p>The shower cut off and he reached for his towel. He got out and started drying off, but I was too terrified about what was happening to even think about looking at his naked body. \u201cBaby, trust me. You don\u2019t want me to start this story if I can\u2019t finish it.\u201d</p><p>A long story. That couldn\u2019t be good. I felt like I was gonna puke and I considered telling Nick to move over so I could hover over the commode. I covered my mouth with my hand to convince it not to regurgitate.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, Nick! I\u2019m not okay. I just sat in your house for half an hour waiting for you to come home to see a ho you screwed and now you won\u2019t tell me what happened when you talked to her.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t denying he screwed her so she was one of the unidentifiable. \u201cSo, you have screwed her?\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily. \u201cShe says we did and I don\u2019t have a reason to doubt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She said it happened at a party. I remember the party, but I don\u2019t remember her at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why did she come here? What did she want?\u201d</p><p>There was a knock at the door and I heard Dallas\u2019 voice on the other side. \u201cGinny is asking questions and looking for you. I can\u2019t cover for you any longer without her guessing where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Nick. \u201cWe\u2019re not even close to being done with this conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and slipped out into the hall luckily without getting caught by Ginny. After I made my appearance in the kitchen, I resumed my duties but not without an inspection by Ginny. \u201cLet me see your burn.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky. It\u2019s not gonna be a bad one and should heal nicely if you keep some aloe vera on it.\u201d</p><p>Lucky? Is that what we were calling it these days? It sure didn\u2019t feel like it at the moment.</p><p>Nick sat next to me at supper and reached for my hand under the table. I pulled it away although that might have been a little unfair to him. I went into this relationship knowing I might eventually run into some of the girls he had been with, but I wasn\u2019t prepared for the way it made me feel. There was nothing he could do to change the past, but I was jealous and at the moment simply felt like being pissed.</p> <p>I pushed my food around and noticed Nick did the same. That couldn\u2019t be a good sign because he normally ate like a horse.</p><p>When everyone finished supper, I helped clear the dishes and clean the kitchen. The closer I was to talking to Nick, the more nervous I became. When I was finished, I walked into the living room and Nick motioned for me to follow him out the front door. He took my hand in his once we were outside and he led me over to the swing on the front porch we had sat on a hundred times.</p><p>He turned to face me and took my other hand in his. He squeezed them both. \u201cI love you, Payton.\u201d</p><p>The wild look in his eyes frightened me. \u201cThere\u2019s something going on, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but he didn\u2019t have to because his face said it all. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Nick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat girl says she got pregnant by me that night at the party. She had a baby a month ago and she says it\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Sick. I was gonna be sick, like immediately. I jumped from the swing and heaved over the porch railing into the flowerbed. Nick sprung behind me and grabbed my hair as I leaned forward, just the way he had the first night we met.</p><p>I heaved up everything in my gut, and then some more, as I heard Nick tell me over and over how sorry he was and how much he loved me. I straightened up when I felt like there couldn\u2019t possibly be anything left in my stomach.</p><p>He wiped away the tears rolling down my face as he talked, but I couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying for the roaring in my ears and I recognized it as one of the first signs I usually got when I was going to pass out. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta lie down.\u201d</p><p>I dropped down to the concrete porch and propped my legs up on the exterior wall of the house so I could get some blood to my head before I blacked out. I threw my arm over my eyes because I knew I was about to make the ugly cry face. \u201cYou told me you always used condoms. Always without fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I did every single time. Until you.\u201d Nick dropped down beside me and cradled my head in his lap. \u201cPayton, I don\u2019t remember that girl at all. The only thing I have to go on is what she says, so this baby may not even be mine. I told her I wanted to do a DNA test.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s at least be honest about this. If she said you screwed her then you screwed her. Stop acting like you\u2019re a damn victim here. You played and now you have to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pissed and I get it. I\u2019m pissed at myself for being so stupid.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure there was a word for what I was feeling but it wasn\u2019t coming to mind and pissed didn\u2019t even begin to cover it. I strained to get up and then looked at him. \u201cI can\u2019t handle this. I\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton, you can\u2019t leave. We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about because I\u2019m telling you that I can\u2019t handle someone else having your baby.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my arm and I jerked it away as I burst out crying. \u201cI wanted to be the one to have your babies, not her.\u201d</p><p>He caught me and pulled me to him for a hug as my cry escalated into uncontrollable sobbing. \u201cWe can get past this and make it work.\u201d</p><p>I was crying too uncontrollably to disagree, but I shook my head violently.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t say we can\u2019t. We can get through this because I love you and I know you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about next time? What do I do when the next girl shows up with your baby and then the next and you eventually have your own little baseball team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need time to cool down.\u201d</p><p>Time wasn\u2019t gonna fix this FUBAR situation. \u201cOh, I\u2019m cool. I\u2019m so cool with this that I\u2019m gonna tell you what you can do. Go get in that car you\u2019ve used to screw all these girls and drive down to the pool hall so you can find your next pregnancy scare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that, Payton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I mean every single word. Go find that slut, Samantha, and maybe you can screw her tonight. I bet she\u2019d love to have your next baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will but I need you to move your car out from behind my screwmobile so I can get down to the pool hall and find her.\u201d</p><p>I stormed toward my car and screamed over my shoulder. \u201cWell, then let me get the hell up outta yo\u2019 way, Poppycock.\u201d</p><p>26 Regrets</p><p>Nick</p><p>No! There\u2019s no way that just happened. Except the gut wrenching sickness in the pit of my stomach was proof it had. It was official. My past just collided with my future and it had won.</p><p>I stood in my yard and watched Payton speed away out of my life and I made a decision. This was not going to end like this.</p><p>I ran into the house and grabbed my keys without a word to my family so I could catch Payton before she got away. I was speeding down the highway and was almost to Franklin when I realized I hadn\u2019t caught her, so I picked up my phone and dialed her number.</p><p>Who was I kiddin\u2019? She wasn\u2019t going to take my calls, so I left her a voicemail. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m so sorry for everything. Please, call me so we can talk this out. I didn\u2019t mean what I said about going to find another girl. You\u2019re the only one I love. It\u2019s you and no other.\u201d</p><p>I took the next few minutes to think about where Payton would go. Definitely not home. Claire\u2019s. I was almost positive that was where she would go and so that meant that was where I was going, too.</p><p>I pulled up at the Deverauxs and saw Claire\u2019s car and Jessie\u2019s truck, but no sign of Payton\u2019s car. Dammit. Where was she?</p><p>Even if she wasn\u2019t here, I would bet she called Claire so I went to the door and used the knocker to beat with a little more desperation than I intended. I didn\u2019t let Claire get the door open all the way before I started questioning her. \u201cHas she called you? Do you know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you mean Payton and no, I haven\u2019t talked to her. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a fight and she took off.\u201d</p><p>Claire found that amusing. \u201cYou know she\u2019s a hothead so give her time to cool down and then you can talk about it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand the seriousness of the situation. \u201cIt was bad, Claire. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll ever talk to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. She loves you so of course she\u2019ll talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>Jessie came to the door from the back of the house. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled at Jessie. \u201cHe and Payton have had a spat.\u201d</p><p>It was way more than a spat. \u201cClaire, please call her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her to make sure she\u2019s okay, but I won\u2019t betray her trust by giving the phone to you. She has her reasons for not talking to you and you\u2019ll have to wait until she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Claire went to get her phone and left me with Jessie. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>I ran my hands up through my hair and fisted it to give it a yank. \u201cI have screwed up big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dude. I\u2019m not playing. A chick showed up at my house tonight. She told me I got her pregnant and her one month old was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. Is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I guess it could be, but I don\u2019t remember this girl at all. She didn\u2019t even look familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her I wanted a DNA test and she agreed to do it. She\u2019s gonna make the arrangements and then call me.\u201d</p><p>I saw Claire coming down the stairs with the phone to her ear and she didn\u2019t look happy with me. \u201cI\u2019m not telling him that.\u201d</p><p>She held her phone out to me. \u201cShe has something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I took the phone and put it to my ear. \u201cPlease, listen to me, Baby. I love you and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen to me. While you\u2019re out finding Samantha or your next unidentified number tonight, I\u2019m going to work on my second one. Then, when I\u2019m finished doing him, we can compare notes on how it made you feel to know someone else had that part of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Doll Face. It won\u2019t fix this and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll be the one to regret it more than me.\u201d</p><p>And then she hung up on me. I dialed her back and she didn\u2019t answer. Great. Now she wouldn\u2019t answer my calls or Claire\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s going to sleep with someone to get even with me because she\u2019s so hurt by the possibility of this baby being mine.\u201d I felt the tears stinging my eyes. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care that this would have happened a year ago before I met her. Claire, text her and tell her to not do it.\u201d</p><p>I passed her the phone and her thumb went to work. \u201cI am, but I\u2019m not doing it for you. I\u2019m doing it for her because she\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>I drove all over Franklin and didn\u2019t find Payton or her car, so I was forced to give up and go back to Collinsville. I had to face it. It had been hours since I talked to her and if she followed through with her threat to sleep with someone else, I was already too late. The deed was done.</p><p>I pulled into the parking lot of the county line pool hall on my way back into Collinsville and decided a beer or two or twelve might help take my mind off what happened with Payton. I walked in and two of my buddies were hanging out in the back corner as usual. \u201cHawke! Get your ass back here, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>I walked to where my old gang sat and slid into an open chair next to Justin Walls. \u201cWhere the hell have you been all summer?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged. \u201cAh, around.\u201d</p><p>Luke Mason leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you where Hawke\u2019s been since he won\u2019t. He\u2019s been between the legs of the sweetest piece of ass I\u2019ve ever seen. I get hard just thinking about that East Franklin girl.\u201d</p><p>One warning. That was all I was willing to give and that was only because I considered these guys friends. \u201cShut up, I\u2019m not gonna let you talk trash about her like that. She\u2019s not like the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook at how whipped he is. Her stuff must be damn good.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and the chair behind me fell backwards making a crashing sound on the concrete floor. \u201cI warned you, Luke.\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up signaling his white flag. \u201cEasy, Hawke. I was just screwing with you. I had no idea you were that serious about the chick.\u201d</p><p>Luke hadn\u2019t said anything I wouldn\u2019t have...before Payton, that is. \u201cSorry, Dude. It hasn\u2019t been a great night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, you need a beer.\u201d Luke got up from the table and came back with a fresh pitcher. \u201cHave a drink on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I filled the frosty beer mug in front of me, but didn\u2019t wait for the head to go down before taking the first big swig.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you? Got lady problems?\u201d</p><p>Lady problems didn\u2019t even begin to describe what I had going on. \u201cMe and Payton are having a little trouble, but it\u2019ll be cool. No worries\u201d These weren\u2019t the kind of guys you confided in with your innermost thoughts or your relationship problems so I left it at that.</p><p>It was two hours and eight draft beers later and I had heard the complete rundown of every girl Luke and Justin had done over the entire summer. I welcomed the beer buzz I had gotten. It helped tune out their chatter while temporarily helping me forget my breakup with Payton...until Samantha Hodges walked through the door and I remembered Payton\u2019s angry words. \u2018Go find that slut, Samantha, and maybe you can screw her tonight. I bet she\u2019d love to have your next baby.\u2019</p><p>I turned my head from her hoping she wouldn\u2019t notice me, but Luke hollered out to invite her over to join us at our table. \u201cSam, bring your fine ass over here.\u201d</p><p>She walked over and I stared into my beer without looking up at her, but I could feel her eyes all over me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, guys?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust catching up with Hawke since he\u2019s been hyberdating that East Franklin chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, how\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p><p>Luke laughed and told Samantha, \u201cHe says there\u2019s trouble in paradise. Maybe you could help him out a little.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, Samantha sat across my lap and put her arm around me. \u201cNick knows I\u2019m always willing to help him out.\u201d</p><p>I strained to distance myself from her. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>She scooted across my lap so that she was sitting on my crotch instead of my legs. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like you\u2019re doing good. You look drunk and hard up and I can do something about that.\u201d</p><p>I pushed against her, at least what I thought felt like pushing, but she didn\u2019t budge as she leaned in and kissed me hard. Luke and Justin yelped and hooted, but I managed to push her back enough to unlock my mouth from hers.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get off of me, now.\u201d</p> <p>She twisted toward the entrance to the pool hall and then back to me. \u201cKiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to kiss you the first time and it\u2019s definitely not happening again. You seriously need to get up before I toss you on your ass.\u201d</p><p>She reached around my shoulders and locked her lips onto mine again for a desperate kiss. I grabbed her face and pushed her away. \u201cWhat the hell, Samantha!\u201d</p><p>I angrily shoved back from the table and grabbed her by the waist to force her off my lap. \u201cOff, now.\u201d</p><p>I stood to ensure she didn\u2019t sit back down in my lap and caught a glimpse of Payton going out the front door. \u201cDammit.\u201d</p><p>I ran for the door as fast as I could after having eight beers. I saw Payton walking toward her car and I called out to her. \u201cPayton, please stop.\u201d</p><p>27 Everything</p><p>Payton</p><p>My heart suddenly felt cold and the center began to crack and shatter like a sheet of ice when it can no longer withstand the pressure being pushed against it.</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have come here, but I stupidly wanted to see him so we could talk.</p><p>\u201cPayton, please stop.\u201d</p><p>I stopped, but not because I planned on listening to anything he had to say. I was the one that was going to do the talking. I turned around and began to clap my hands. \u201cBravo, Nick. You deserve a round of applause for your performance this summer. You really had me believing you loved me, so take a bow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d he slurred in his drunkenness. \u201cI love you with all of my heart.\u201d</p><p>The bastard was trashed so I couldn\u2019t even enjoy letting him have a piece of my mind because he would never remember it anyway. He reached for my arm but I jerked from his touch. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been broken up five hours and you were already making out with that slut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. She sat on my lap and started kissing me. I told her to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the victim, again?\u201d</p><p>He put his hands in his hair and pressed the sides of his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make you understand. I don\u2019t want Samantha. I never wanted her, even before you came along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve never slept with her?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny it and it hurt like hell. \u201cI can\u2019t change you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can\u2019t you see you already have? I\u2019ve done some terrible things in the past but how can you hold that stuff against me when it all happened before you came into my life? You are my ray of light in this dark world. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything like you, but you have been such a beautiful surprise.\u201d</p><p>They were beautiful words but that\u2019s all they were and would fade away with the morning sun. \u201cNo. We are so over that someone should come up with a new word for over.\u201d</p><p>Hearing myself tell him that we were over was the breaking dam holding my tears inside. I turned to leave and he staggered forward and caught me by my waist from behind. He pulled me close and I could feel his hot, drunken breath against the back of my neck, sending chills all over my body. I couldn\u2019t help myself from leaning back against him because even under the present circumstances, he still had the power to make me want him.</p><p>He held me tight and I let him. I needed to have him close, even if it was only for a minute before I let him go forever.</p><p>He pushed my hair away from my neck and brought his mouth to my ear. Even with him standing behind me, the smell of beer on his breath was stout. \u201cCan\u2019t you see I would do anything to be your everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy everything wouldn\u2019t be having babies with other girls.\u201d I felt a sob building in my throat. \u201cSo since I\u2019m not your everything, how about I\u2019ll be nothing at all to you?\u201d</p><p>He kissed the back of my neck and rubbed his hands over my stomach. \u201cYou are my everything and I don\u2019t want babies with anyone but you. I want to put them inside you and then watch them grow right here.\u201d</p><p>I laced my fingers through his and savored the moment briefly before I pushed his hands away. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>He turned me around to face him and his eyes were glazed over. \u201cI may be drunk, but I know exactly what I\u2019m saying. I want to marry you and have lots of babies...little blond headed ones with honey eyes just like their mother.\u201d</p><p>He started kissing my neck and I felt myself melting under his touch. He lifted me onto the hood of my car and then pressed his body against my parted legs. \u201cI love you, Payton, and I don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d</p><p>This was his game and he was damn good at it so I had to get away before I gave in and got naked with him in the backseat of my car. I pushed him away and slid off the hood. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing that. You\u2019re not gonna kiss me and turn me on to make me forget what you\u2019ve done. You have a baby out there with another girl. That\u2019s a problem for me because I\u2019m going to be the one to give my husband his first child. Me, not some random whore.\u201d</p><p>I opened my car door and got inside. \u201cI should have known when you swept me off my feet that I was in the perfect position for you to drop me on my ass.\u201d</p><p>28 Chokehold</p><p>Nick</p><p>I just watched my whole world drive away.</p><p>I walked back inside the pool hall and went back to the table where my buddies were sitting. They looked at me waiting for an explanation, but I didn\u2019t have one to give them.\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>No, nothing was okay without Payton in my life. I stared blankly at the beer I had not finished when she came in. Why had she come here? Had she come to talk things over and then changed her mind when she saw Samantha in my lap kissing me?</p><p>Luke snapped his fingers in front of my face. \u201cWhat happened, Dude?\u201d</p><p>Samantha walked up to our table looking like the cat that swallowed the canary. \u201cPlease, allow me to explain, boys.\u201d</p><p>I stared dumbfounded at her. I had no idea what she was about to announce, but it was clearly making her happy. \u201cThe Playah got played. That\u2019s what happened. I set you up, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She motioned across the room. \u201cI believe you met my cousin, Brandi, earlier today.\u201d</p><p>I turned around and saw the girl that was at my house claiming to be the mother of a baby belonging to me. \u201cYou\u2019re cousins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me Nick, what does it say about one\u2019s character when a complete stranger shows up at your door and tells you they had your baby and you don\u2019t know the difference because you\u2019ve screwed so many girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met her?</p><p>\u201cLuckily for Brandi, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou screwed me and I returned the favor. Do you need me to elaborate further on that?\u201d</p><p>I slammed my palm against the table and made the beer mugs clank against the surface. \u201cYou just caused me to lose the only girl I have ever loved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLuckily for me, she thinks the worst of you and wouldn\u2019t believe you or these tools you call friends if you told her what actually happened.

You might find that you might have one after all.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>My head was killing me and I definitely needed to take something for it, but what could I take for the pain of losing Payton? There was only one cure for that and it was unobtainable because she believed I had a baby with a stranger and I had no way of proving otherwise.</p> <p>I heard a gentle knock on my door, so I knew it was Dallas. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>She was the one they called to come get me at the pool hall last night and I knew she was checking in on me because she saw how plastered I was. She slowly opened the door and came in with two pain killers and a glass of water. \u201cI thought you might need these this morning.\u201d</p><p>She was always so thoughtful. Thank God she wasn\u2019t like Jake. \u201cThanks, my head is pounding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk about what happened?\u201d</p><p>I explained about the girl and her accusation on down to how Samantha had set the whole thing up. \u201cDallie, I have no way of proving I didn\u2019t get this girl pregnant because there isn\u2019t going to be paternity papers saying I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust tell Payton the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell her about Samantha last night and she didn\u2019t believe me. She knows what she saw and I can\u2019t convince her otherwise. She\u2019s definitely not going to believe me about that baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re just going to give up? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other choice do I have? I can\u2019t prove anything so I should face reality. My past just put my future in a chokehold and snuffed the life out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u2248 \u2248 \u2248</p><p>It had been a week, 7 whole days, since I saw Payton and I had never been more miserable in my life. If I had any sense, I would stop asking Dane about her when he came to see Dallas, but I guess I was a masochist in that way and I just couldn\u2019t stop myself.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t even have to ask him anymore. He automatically had a report waiting for me each time he came to the house and tonight was no different.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t seeing anyone and that helped my feelings minimally. Dallas was getting fed up with Dane\u2019s reports because she thought I was being a dumb ass about the whole thing. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. Stop asking him about her if you\u2019re not going to try to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is it? You can\u2019t stop asking him about her or you can\u2019t try to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d I got up and headed for the door because we had beat this dead horse enough and I had somewhere to be. \u201cI\u2019ve got a race in half an hour so I\u2019ve gotta split. Ya\u2019ll coming tonight or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, we\u2019re coming. Your sister never misses and I\u2019ve got five hundred bucks on you, Dude. I\u2019ll be there to get my money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you there then.\u201d</p><p>I drove down Main Street on my way to The Strip for the race and got stopped at our red light...the one where Payton ran into the back of my car and made me fall in love with her. I smiled as I remembered the way the whole thing happened and I laughed when I thought about her asking if she could swipe her credit card up my ass crack. I missed her smart ass mouth.</p> <p>I pulled up at the start line next to my opponent, some community college guy in a suped up black Mustang GT, and I was thoroughly unimpressed unless he was hiding something under that hood I didn\u2019t know about. I got out and we did our usual sizing each other up thing. I hung with my pals and he hung with his. Yada yada.</p><p>I saw Samantha Hodges making a move on my opponent and knew it was her psychotic way of trying to make me jealous. It was really too bad that she was going to give her body to someone that cared nothing about her because she thought she would gain vengeance against another guy that cared even less about her. Not only was she a slut; she was a dumb one, too.</p><p>The GT was nothing more than a pony. I couldn\u2019t really even get excited about the whole thing because the guy was such an amateur. I almost felt bad taking the money. Almost. Besides, he was getting Samantha so he wouldn\u2019t be leaving completely empty handed.</p><p>I got out of the car and felt a twinge of hope when I saw Jessie and Claire in the crowd around my car. I immediately began searching every face for Payton but found no sign of her.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>At least we weren\u2019t gonna beat around the bush about it so I didn\u2019t try to insult Claire\u2019s intelligence by pretending I didn\u2019t know what she meant. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>I knew it wasn\u2019t my business, but that didn\u2019t keep me from wanting to know. \u201cShe\u2019s at her house waiting on Cooper to come over so they can talk.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell no. Say it wasn\u2019t so. \u201cWhy is Cooper going to see Payton? He has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore. He broke up with Allie because he said he wants Payton back.\u201d</p><p>That son of a bitch probably knows Payton and I were sleeping together so he thinks he\u2019ll have a better chance at getting in her panties now. \u201cIs she gonna take him back?\u201d</p><p>Claire shrugged and gave me her idunno face. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a reason not to.\u201d</p><p>Wrong. \u201cUh...yeah, she does. How \u2018bout cause he\u2019s a total dickhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he wouldn\u2019t be the only one now, would he?\u201d I couldn\u2019t argue with her on that. \u201cYou know what, Nick? I liked you a lot better when you were messing up her lip gloss instead of her mascara.\u201d</p><p>God, it killed me to know I was the reason for her tears, even if I was completely innocent of the things she thought I did.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know what else? Right now, that dickhead is telling her everything she should be hearing from you.\u201d</p><p>I should have tried again to tell her the truth. I shouldn\u2019t have given up so easily. \u201cI screwed up big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa\u2019 think? You more than screwed up, Bro. She\u2019s been devastated.\u201d Claire hit me in the arm with her fist as hard as she could. \u201cI told you to be the right guy and you hurt her. I should jerk your balls up over your ears.\u201d</p><p>Jessie died out laughing. \u201cBe careful, Dude. I\u2019m pretty sure she could do it.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s probably exactly what I deserved. \u201cCan I fix this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but how will you know if you don\u2019t try?\u201d</p><p>I turned and ran for my car. \u201cHey, what\u2019s the plan, Stan?\u201d I heard Claire call out behind me.</p><p>I turned and ran backwards as I answered so I wouldn\u2019t lose more precious time with Payton. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my girl.\u201d</p><p>I raced down the highway toward Franklin praying the whole way that Payton hadn\u2019t decided to comply with Cooper\u2019s previous ultimatum or any new ones he might have come up with. My mind raced, imagining every possible scenario. Would she give in to him? Ordinarily, I wouldn\u2019t have thought so but I had hurt her and she could potentially be looking for a way to ease that pain. I knew all too well what it was like to look for comfort in anyone willing to offer a little to you.</p><p>I parked my car on the street in front of her house and ran across the lawn even though the sprinklers were on. I rang the doorbell with one hand while I beat against the glass part of the door with my other hand. \u201cPayton!\u201d</p><p>Vivian answered the door with a smirk on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re too late. She left with Cooper five minutes ago and they didn\u2019t look like they\u2019d be coming back any time soon. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>29 Tangible Thoughts</p><p>Payton</p><p>3 Weeks Later</p><p>It was Friday night in a college town and I sat alone in the apartment I shared with Claire while she and Jessie were out celebrating their one year anniversary. He told me he had something special planned for her, but wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was because he didn\u2019t trust me to keep it to myself. Imagine that. He thought I had a big mouth.</p><p>I totally expected her to come home with an engagement ring on her finger.</p><p>I settled into my now hollowed out spot on the sofa with a half gallon of rocky road to watch some stupid reality show about finding love. Really? If you couldn\u2019t find love in the real world, were you really expecting to find it on some stupid television show? Apparently these 24 people thought so.</p><p>I was only a few bites of ice cream in when there was a knock on the door. Great. I hoped it wasn\u2019t that weirdo from next door again. Too many freaks and not enough circuses.</p><p>I eased over to the window and slowly pulled up on the blind\u2019s slat to see who my guest was because I wasn\u2019t opening the door up to that weirdo. It was Dallas Hawke.</p><p>Fear was the first emotion I felt when I saw Nick\u2019s sister at my door. Something had to be wrong and my mind raced with the possibilities. He must have had a wreck during a race. That had to be it, or he had shot himself with one of those stupid guns or those guys had jumped him again because he wouldn\u2019t throw a race.</p><p>I quickly swung the door open and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears as I felt the sensation of pulsating blood in my face. My stomach became fluttery like I was going to be sick. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Dallas? What\u2019s happened to him?\u201d</p><p>She smiled when I opened the door and I felt a small amount of relief. \u201cNothing has happened, at least nothing new. I\u2019m just here to talk about him.\u201d</p><p>I felt relief wash over me. \u201cPlease, come in.\u201d</p><p>She walked through my door and we hugged each other as though we hadn\u2019t seen each other in years. She squeezed me hard and groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. I\u2019ve missed having you in the kitchen with me and Ginny. She\u2019s a slave driver without you there to help me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d love to be back in the kitchen with the Hawke women. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you and Ginny, too.\u201d</p><p>I had missed them, but I wanted to skip the courtesies and get straight to what brought her here. Something had to be wrong with Nick. She wasn\u2019t here out of the clear blue without calling for no good reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t just wondering. I was dying to know. \u201cMore than just a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here about that girl with the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Here we went. I was finally going to know for sure that Nick had a baby with another girl and I felt my nausea return.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so much you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure there was and I preferred to keep it that way because Nick had broken my heart enough for this century.</p><p>\u201cCan we sit? This is gonna take a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019ll have to excuse me because I\u2019m so shaken that I can\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re shaken because you love Nick.\u201d I couldn\u2019t argue with that so I didn\u2019t.</p><p>We sat on the couch and I used the remote to turn off the television.</p><p>\u201cI have things to tell you and your initial reaction is going to be to not believe me, but everything I\u2019m about to say is the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat baby was not Nick\u2019s. In fact, I\u2019m not even sure there ever was a baby.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand. How did they do a DNA test on a baby that she wasn\u2019t sure even existed?</p> <p>\u201cSamantha Hodges has been in love with Nick for years. She has chased him for as long as I can remember and she occasionally caught him, but all of that ended when he found you and she couldn\u2019t stand it. She orchestrated this whole baby thing. Nick never met that girl until she showed up at our house. Samantha knew you and Nick would break up and he would end up down at the pool hall getting drunk. That\u2019s why she was there that night, to make her move on him but then you walked in and that was the topping on her cake.\u201d</p><p>It was a good story, but that\u2019s all it was. It was a shame that Nick had lied to his sister so well because I could see that she believed everything she was telling me. \u201cIf all of this was true, why wouldn\u2019t he have told me when it happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to explain about Samantha that night, but you were so hurt you wouldn\u2019t listen. He knew the story about the baby would be no different.\u201d</p><p>She was right. I didn\u2019t believe either explanation.</p><p>\u201cI can see you don\u2019t believe me and that\u2019s why I brought this.\u201d She reached into her purse and pulled out a worn black leather book. \u201cI know how wrong it was for me to take this. These are Nick\u2019s most private thoughts and he will either love me or hate me for giving this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick keeps a journal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. He doesn\u2019t seem the type.\u201d</p><p>No, I would never have pegged Nick as one to journal. Not in a million years.</p> <p>She handed the book to me and I stared at it like it was some ancient piece of art I didn\u2019t have the right to touch. \u201cI don\u2019t suggest reading anything before the day he met you.\u201d</p><p>Against my conscience screaming at me, I took the worn leather book containing all of Nick\u2019s most private thoughts because I wanted to crawl inside his head knowing all along how completely and morally wrong it would be. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can read this, Dallas. I want to, but it feels so wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you read it and find out he\u2019s a lying bastard, then you\u2019re no worse off then you were. If you read it and find out he loves you more than life itself, then it will be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>That was a huge gamble for her to bring me something she hadn\u2019t read. \u201cThen how do you know he doesn\u2019t journal about the way he screwed girls behind my back the whole time we were together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know how much he loves you and I saw the changes in him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so confident in giving this to you. I\u2019m positive it\u2019ll bring you back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he going to know it\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m gonna blame Jake.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. I wouldn\u2019t want to be there when that went down.</p><p>I walked Dallas to the door and we said our goodbyes, not knowing if we would ever see each other again. The thought made me sad. She turned back to me before she made it to Dane\u2019s porsche and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised when you find out he\u2019s breakable.\u201d</p><p>Once Dallas was gone, I sat in my spot on the couch and stared at Nick\u2019s tangible thoughts in my hands. I brought it to my nose and inhaled deeply, taking in the heady mixture of leather and Nick\u2019s signature smell.</p><p>Was I ready to know Nick\u2019s innermost thoughts? Sometimes the things that came out of his mouth were more than I could stand. I had to do some serious thinking about this.</p><p>I picked up my partially melted box of rocky road and put it back in the freezer because I didn\u2019t seem to have an appetite for it any longer. I leaned against the kitchen counter and looked at the journal from where I stood in the kitchen as I put one of my nails to my mouth to chew.</p><p>I realized I was ruining my fresh manicure and jerked my hand away from my mouth. I left the kitchen and picked up the journal again. I cracked it open to look at his handwriting and couldn\u2019t recall ever seeing it before. It was pretty and legible, not like most guys\u2019 chicken scratch.</p><p>I had sat in utter silence weighing my two options with their consequences for an hour and a half when I heard the sound of keys in the front door. Claire came through the door smiling from ear to ear and I could tell she was about to burst. Yep. She definitely got an engagement ring tonight.</p><p>\u201cWe have an announcement to make. Jessie has asked me to marry him.\u201d She held up her left hand. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Claire told me every little detail about the way Kimosabe had proposed while he kept quiet and laughed at her animated way of retelling the story. He had driven her back to Franklin to the old football field where they had their first kiss and first dance, except this time he played a different song. He told Claire to ask him what the name of the song was and he popped open a ring box as he told her the song was \u2018Marry Me.\u2019</p><p>It was sickeningly sweet, but I was ecstatic for her. She had really found her prince charming, tattoos and all.</p><p>Jessie was definitely staying over tonight because there was no way Claire was sending him to the guys\u2019 dormitory on campus. Not after a marriage proposal like that. It might not be the deed itself, but the boy had some rewards coming his way.</p><p>I sat on the couch clutching Nick\u2019s book for another hour after Claire and Jessie went to bed and I had no better idea of what I was going to do than when Dallas handed it to me. I heard Claire\u2019s door open and then shut quietly before she came into the living room where I was.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should tell Claire about the journal. She always strived to be perfect and snooping in someone else\u2019s private thoughts would surely make her list of no-no\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDallas was here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Everything\u2019s fine, but she had some interesting things to tell me. She said that whole thing with the baby was a hoax made up by that Samantha chick that cornered me at Nick\u2019s race. She had her cousin pretend to have Nick\u2019s baby to break us up. She brought this to me so I could read it for myself.\u201d</p><p>I showed her what I had been clutching to my heart for the last hour. \u201cIt\u2019s Nick\u2019s journal. She took it from him and she thinks I should read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has no idea what it says, but she\u2019s confident it will change my mind about Nick. Do you think I should read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is do you think you should read it?\u201d</p><p>I hated when she answered a question with a question. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wrong to read his private thoughts?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me as though I was a stranger. \u201cHave we met? Since when do you care if it\u2019s wrong? Hell, yes, it would be wrong to read it. Should that stop you? Hell, no! Read it.\u201d</p><p>Once I crossed that line, I couldn\u2019t go back. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayton, now is not the time for you to go Team Pollyanna. It doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Maybe I would read one entry. I opened it up and scanned until I found the day we met.</p><p>30 Nick\u2019s Journal</p><p>Payton</p><p>June 7th</p><p>I won another race last night but that wasn\u2019t the best part of my night. I met a girl, a real hot piece of ass w/ a smart mouth on her. I called her Doll Face because she\u2019s the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen. She acted like she wasn\u2019t falling for my shit, but I played it cool and ended up with her in the backseat of her car. Too bad she was asleep w/ her head in my lap because she got wasted. We could have had a real good time.</p><p>She says she\u2019s not looking to hook up with someone like me. She says she\u2019s looking for truly, madly, deeply but I bet I can change her mind. I always do. And I\u2019ll start tonight at Dane\u2019s party.</p><p>Well, that entry certainly wasn\u2019t going to make me fall in love with him all over again. Why couldn\u2019t he have said his world stopped turning the first time he saw me or he thought he was in heaven because I must certainly be an angel? Not that I was a hot piece of ass with a smart ass mouth.</p><p>Claire saw my disappointment. \u201cWhat does it say?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to tell her because it was such a letdown, but I did anyway. \u201cSomething about me being a hot piece with a smart mouth.\"</p><p>Claire thought it was hilarious. \u201cJessie told me his first thought about me was that I had great tits.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That made me feel a little better. Now I wanted to read more. \u201cGet out of here and go back to your fianc\u00e9e. You weren\u2019t in there long enough to reward him well enough for what he gave you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFianc\u00e9e. Wow, I have a fianc\u00e9e. Who\u2019d have thunk it?\u201d</p><p>Claire went back to bed and I poured myself a glass of wine before I settled into my bed with my new companion. I had already crossed the line so why stop now?</p><p>June 8th </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It\u2019s official. I\u2019m nuts. I\u2019m writing about her for the second time today. I thought about her until I went to sleep and then first thing when I woke up. She was on my mind all day, even when I went to the lake and was around all of Gabbi\u2019s hot friends. I always hooked up with one of them. But not today because she was the only one on my mind.</p><p>Jake says I should stay away from her but I don\u2019t think I can. And I know I don\u2019t want to try.</p><p>I had no idea he thought about me so much so soon. We had just met. I probably would have freaked out and thought he was a psycho if I had known.</p><p>June 10th</p> <p>I\u2019m writing this a day late, but that\u2019s because my eyes were too swollen to see anything last night after the pepper spray incident. Another story for another time. Right now, I only want to write about her...Doll Face.</p><p>I saw her again at Danes\u2019 party and asked her to leave with me. I almost shit my pants when she said \u2018yes.\u2019 Good thing I didn\u2019t. I had no idea where I would take a classy chick like her, but we drove by the fairgrounds and she told me that no one had ever taken her before. It made me sad that she didn\u2019t have that simple kind of memory from her childhood so I decided to take her. It was fun acting like a kid with her and I hoped she didn\u2019t think it was a lame date. (I\u2019m calling it a date even if she didn\u2019t.) I wanted to kiss her on the Ferris wheel. It would have been so perfect if she hadn\u2019t just finished telling me for a second time how she didn\u2019t want a guy like me. Am I really that unlovable? Maybe not because I did get a kiss from her later last night and it was perfect.</p><p>I thought everything was going great until Dad came in from taking her home. I don\u2019t know what happened, but he doesn\u2019t want me to see her anymore. He can forget that shit because I\u2019m into this girl big time.</p><p>No. You\u2019re not the least bit unlovable. You were very easy to love.</p><p>June 12th</p> <p>Like the song, Payton Archer is tbtf and I\u2019m falling for her. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.</p><p>Tbtf? What was that? I guess I\u2019d have to urban dictionary it.</p><p>I had no idea he felt this way so fast.</p><p>June 14th</p><p>It\u2019s official. I have my first girlfriend. And I taught her how to shoot my Glock. I hope this combination doesn\u2019t prove to be a lethal one for me. I should be fine. I think she likes my titillating details too much to shoot me.</p><p>She certainly likes to scream my name. I like it, too. Very much.</p> <p>Ginny loves her. And I do, too.</p><p>Yes, sir. Nick is a very talented young man. I certainly do like his titillating details very much and how he used them to make me scream his name. I would love to scream his name again.</p><p>June 15th</p><p>I didn\u2019t see Payton today and it sucked. I miss her.</p><p>I bet it sucked for me then too because I know for sure it sucked right now.</p><p>June 16th</p><p>I took my girl to the strip to show her off tonight. I saw Samantha Hodges there and I was afraid of what she might say to Payton. She\u2019s had this psychotic habit of trying to run off other girls I\u2019ve been with. Payton didn\u2019t mention her, so I guess Samantha finally got the picture.</p><p>I\u2019m in love with Payton but I\u2019m scared to tell her. I\u2019ve never loved a girl before and it\u2019s scary as hell.</p> <p>I\u2019m a sitting duck waiting for her to figure out what a son of a bitch I\u2019ve been. When she does, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll stick around. My mom didn\u2019t so why would I expect her to?</p><p>I didn\u2019t mention that psychotic bitch because me and my smart ass mouth took care of her and because I didn\u2019t want to tell you the things she said to me. I think I would have thrown up if I would have felt those words roll off my tongue.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t have been scared to tell me. I loved you, too. I still do.</p><p>You're not a son of a bitch.</p><p>I didn\u2019t stick around because I couldn\u2019t. And you know why.</p><p>June 17th</p><p>I don\u2019t like it when Payton\u2019s parents are home. I\u2019m ready for them to go away again.</p><p>Me, too, Nick.</p><p>June 18th</p><p>They\u2019re still here. Go away already.</p><p>My, my. Someone was anxious.</p><p>June 19th</p><p>They still haven\u2019t gone anywhere and I need to see my Payton now. She\u2019s coming to Dad\u2019s banquet with me tomorrow night but that\u2019s still too far away.</p><p>I have something special planned so we can have some alone time. It seems like it\u2019s been forever since we were alone.</p><p>I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to tell her how I feel. I\u2019m terrified like I\u2019m standing on the ledge of a building about to jump and I have no idea if my parachute will open.</p><p>My fingers are crossed. I pray she feels the same.</p><p>Why were you so scared, you silly boy? I was standing by your side ready to jump with you.</p><p>June 20th</p><p>Tonight was a total disaster. Thanks a lot, Vivian.</p><p>Payton was upset about finding her mom w/ another man. I wanted to make it better for her, but there was nothing I could do. I couldn\u2019t even hold her in my arms because she had to go home to deal with her mama drama.</p><p>A child shouldn\u2019t have to deal with a parent\u2019s mess. I guess Payton and I have that much in common.</p><p>I didn\u2019t get to tell her I loved her. I hope she already knows.</p><p>Payton\u2019s blow up with her mom was enough to send her to her aunt and uncle\u2019s house. I don\u2019t know what this means for her or for us and it scares me.</p><p>Oh, Nick. Ignorance can be so bliss.</p><p>June 21st</p><p>I just spent the most glorious 24 hours of my life with Payton. All I wanted was to be with her and tell her how much I loved her, but she exceeded any expectations I had.</p><p>It was her first time to make love. Theoretically, it was my first time, too. I\u2019ve been saving my heart for someone, but I didn\u2019t know who that person was until I met her. She isn\u2019t just another one. She is THE one.</p><p>Oh, and I saw my mother for the first time in 13 years. It paled in comparison to what I just shared with Payton.</p><p>There\u2019s no feeling in the world better than being THE one for Nick. It\u2019s really too bad it didn\u2019t last because when it was good, it was really good.</p><p>Jun 22nd</p><p>My mother did something to make Vivian accept our relationship. Sort of. She doesn\u2019t accept us, but she does tolerate us. But it\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t care what my mother did as long as I\u2019m with Payton.</p><p>She knows the me no one else on earth knows and I love her for it.</p><p>Do I really know the Nick no one else on earth knows? I thought I did, but then our little world came tumbling down and now I don\u2019t think I knew you at all.</p><p>June 23rd</p><p>I told Payton I wanted to marry her. I do. If she needed me to be something besides a cop, I would do it for her. I would change my entire world just to make her smile.</p><p>She must have liked it when I told her I would change my world for her because she took me in the pool house and rocked mine.</p><p>I want this girl forever.</p><p>I loved that he would change his world for me, so I rocked his and he loved it. So did I.</p><p>Even if he would change his world for me, it\u2019s too bad he couldn\u2019t change the past. Getting that girl pregnant and messing with Samantha Hodges ended a beautiful thing.</p><p>I closed the journal and put it on my bedside table. Reading Nick\u2019s journal wasn\u2019t accomplishing what Dallas thought it would. Maybe I should stop because it was only causing me more pain.</p><p>I finished off my glass of Riesling and stared at the black leather book beside me. It called to me like a siren of the sea. I couldn\u2019t stop now. I\u2019d always wish I had read it all, even if it was painful. I needed the closure.</p><p>June 30th</p><p>Payton came for her cooking lesson with Ginny today. I may have suggested Ginny teach Payton how to make chicken and dumplings since they are my favorite. It\u2019s only right that my favorite girl know how to cook them for me since I plan on keeping her around forever.</p><p>I wanted to be around forever. I wanted to learn how to cook all of your favorite meals, but you ruined that for us. Maybe Samantha can cook your chicken and dumplings for you now.</p><p>July 10th</p><p>I\u2019ve been thinking about my mother a lot lately but I haven\u2019t told anyone. Not even Payton and I tell her everything. I sort of want to see her again. I love the way she took care of Payton but it hurts me to know she did when she left her own 3 children motherless, only 1 town over.</p><p>I might ask Payton to go to her house with me, but it would kill me if she didn\u2019t want to see me. It would be like feeling that fresh pain all over again.</p><p>She knows how to get in touch with me. I guess she will if she wants to see me. Then again, she\u2019s known for the last 13 years.</p><p>Oh, Nick. I had no idea. I wish you had told me.</p><p>July 14th</p><p>Dallie is getting so close, so fast to Dane. I\u2019m not sure I like it, but I don\u2019t guess I have much room to say anything after the whirlwind romance between me and Payton. We fell in love in all of what? 2 minutes.</p><p>I guess I\u2019m being the overprotective big brother, but it\u2019s my job to worry about my baby sister. Dallie hasn\u2019t had much female influence in her life other than Ginny. Hopefully, that will all be changing since Payton is around so much now.</p><p>I\u2019d kill Dane if he got Dallie pregnant.</p><p>I guess that\u2019s what Jessie thinks about me.</p><p>I\u2019ll be the one to kill Dane if he gets Dallas pregnant.</p><p>July 16th</p><p>Payton can still scream my name. Really loud. We were in my room and I wasn\u2019t sure when anyone would come home so I put my hand over her mouth.</p><p>She bit me. Funny thing about that? I liked it.</p><p>The not so funny thing about it? Ginny came in the house and heard us. She knew what we were doing. She waited until Payton was gone to ask me if we were being careful. For future reference: Having the sex talk with your grandmother is not cool. Really.</p><p>I\u2019m not telling Payton what Ginny asked me. She would be mortified. She\u2019d probably never want to come back for cooking lessons and I need that girl to know how to cook if I\u2019m keeping her forever. I love good food.</p><p>Don\u2019t be so dramatic. It was just a gentle love bite. Maybe.</p><p>I liked it, too. And also what you did to make me scream your name. I wish you could do it again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>You\u2019re right. I would have died if I had known Ginny heard us. Good call, Nick.</p><p>July 20th</p><p>I did the wrong thing to the right girl. Or at least I was told I did.</p> <p>Today started out great with Payton at my house for her weekly cooking lesson with Ginny. But then the shit hit the fan. And it slung it all over the room.</p><p>A girl showed up at my house and told me I had a kid. A one month-old. She never even told me if it was a boy or a girl. I just thought about that.</p><p>I didn\u2019t recall ever seeing this girl before in my life, but that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not the baby\u2019s fault and I know what it\u2019s like to be thrown away by a parent so I couldn\u2019t do that if this kid was mine.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a choice. I had to tell Payton. I could have lied about it until the DNA test came back. If the kid turned out to not be mine, then she never had to know, but I couldn\u2019t do that to her.</p><p>She was devastated and it killed me to see that pain in her eyes.</p> <p>I know what she was thinking because I was thinking the same. This kid just crushed our dreams.</p><p>I could give up any hope of her marrying me if this kid was mine. I could probably give up any hope of that even if it wasn\u2019t. She was scared it would happen again and who was I kidding? It could happen again.</p><p>She said she was going to be with someone else so I could know the pain she was feeling. What could I say about it if she did? I\u2019d been with too many to count. An unidentifiable number. Isn\u2019t that what she called it?</p><p>She came to find me at the pool hall, but why? Did she come there to pick up somebody or did she come so we could work things out? I don\u2019t guess it matters because Samantha saw her walk in and she jumped in my lap and put her tongue down my throat for Payton to see. Psychotic Bitch. I can only imagine how that must have looked to Payton. She didn\u2019t believe me when I tried to explain. Could I blame her? Then again I was drunk as a skunk. I\u2019m not sure how good of a job I did at explaining.</p><p>I don\u2019t really remember what I told her. Something about wanting to put babies inside her seem to ring a bell for some reason. God, that was not the right thing to say to your girlfriend when another girl just showed up on your doorstep claiming to have had your kid. Except Payton wasn\u2019t my girlfriend anymore. She was leaving me over this. And I can\u2019t say I blamed her.</p><p>She deserved so much better than me. She now knew me for the son of a bitch I was and she left just like I knew she would.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the part where we slam on the breaks for what happened next.</p><p>The whole thing was bogus. I never met that chick. Samantha fabricated it all, including the part Payton saw in the pool hall, to break us up. And it worked like a charm. And now I have no way of proving any of this to Payton other than my word and that of my 2 drunk buddies.</p><p>I\u2019m screwed. I saw the hurt in her eyes.</p><p>She\u2019s not going to forgive me for this thing I didn\u2019t do.</p><p>Oh, god. He didn\u2019t get that girl pregnant and he didn\u2019t want that psychotic bitch. All of this was her doing and I was blind to all of it because I was so stubborn. He knew I wouldn\u2019t take his word for it. What have I done, Nick?</p><p>July 25th</p><p>Vivian enjoyed telling me Payton was with Cooper and it broke my heart.</p><p>That\u2019s a bold faced lie. I am not with Cooper. I told him we would never get back together. My mother is a total bitch.</p> <p>July 30th</p><p>Dallas says I can\u2019t stay drunk for the rest of my life. I beg to differ.</p><p>I, too, have done my fair share of getting drunk since we broke up.</p><p>August 1st</p><p>My blood is drowning in alcohol. So is my brain. It\u2019s the only way I don\u2019t constantly think about the way I screwed up with the only girl I\u2019ve ever loved.</p><p>Oh, Nick. What are you doing to yourself?</p><p>August 4th</p><p>My dad thinks I need help or something. I do. It\u2019s called Payton Archer.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry for leaving.</p><p>August 6th</p><p>I\u2019ve got to start classes tomorrow so I\u2019ve decided to smile because it\u2019s the easiest way to hide the pain and I\u2019ll act like losing Payton wasn\u2019t a big deal when it really broke my heart. It\u2019s what everyone wants because it\u2019ll make them feel better.</p><p>I\u2019m doing it for them, not me.</p><p>Please, smile again. I miss your dimples.</p><p>August 7th</p><p>These are my own private thoughts and if I\u2019m going to wuss out in this journal, I might as well do a bang up job at it. (That\u2019s one of Payton\u2019s words I love so much.)</p><p>I\u2019m hollow without her. I want to beg her back but I know it would be wasted breath. She hates me. But I still love her.</p><p>I wish I could just stop loving her the way she stopped loving me but then I hate myself for even having those kind of thoughts. I don\u2019t want to stop loving her.</p><p>Writing this down is the only reason I don\u2019t lose my mind entirely. I can\u2019t say these things to anyone.</p><p>Jessie says I need to talk to Claire\u2019s mom but I can\u2019t. This is my only way of confessing the way I feel.</p><p>I love you, too, Nick. I never stopped even when I thought the worse of you. Please, don\u2019t stop loving me. I was wrong.</p><p>August 10th</p><p>I got a new tattoo today. I wish I could show it to Payton, but I can\u2019t because she\u2019s not here. And she won\u2019t ever be again.</p><p>I will be. And I can\u2019t wait to see your new tattoo. I wish you had described it.</p><p>August 15th</p><p>I couldn\u2019t shake the need to see my mother again so I called her today. We\u2019re meeting tomorrow. It\u2019s scary, but not near as much as thinking about spending the rest of my life without Payton. God, I miss her.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know you saw Tillie. She never mentioned it.</p><p>August 16th</p><p>I met my mother at a restaurant in Collinsville today. I got to hear her version of how things happened. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but I\u2019m glad to know the truth.</p><p>Just when I think I can\u2019t begin to understand how she walked away from us, I think about the things I would do if Payton asked me to and I find that I shouldn\u2019t be too critical or judgmental because I would do anything Payton asked of me.</p><p>Payton was right. She blackmailed Vivian about her affair with David so we could be together. I said it wouldn\u2019t change the way I felt about her, but I was wrong. She helped us be together, so how could I hate her?</p><p>She wants to see Jake and Dallas. I\u2019m going to ask them for her, but Jake will refuse because he was so angry when Dad told him she lived so close. I think Dallas will agree. She doesn\u2019t remember her and if nothing else, she would want to see her out of curiosity.</p><p>My mother says Payton is at UT and she hasn\u2019t seen her in a few weeks. I found out Vivian lied to me about Payton and Cooper. They didn\u2019t get back together. I was happy to hear that, but it only means she\u2019s on the market for someone else to have.</p><p>It would kill me to see her with someone else.</p><p>I hope seeing Tillie helped you. I\u2019m glad you know the truth about me and Cooper. And I\u2019m not on the market. My heart belongs to you and no other.</p><p>August 22th</p><p>I\u2019m settling into classes and it\u2019s helping me take my mind off Payton. A little.</p><p>Luke and Justin talked me into going out with them tonight. They told me I needed to get laid to forget about Payton. I would try it if I thought it would work.</p><p>No. No. No. Don\u2019t do that, Nick. Please.</p><p>August 23rd</p><p>We went to the club last night. I danced with some girls, but none of them held a candle to Payton. There was one that reminded me of her though. She wasn\u2019t near as beautiful and she was soft spoken. Nothing like my Payton.</p><p>I don\u2019t guess I can call her that anymore. She isn\u2019t my Payton.</p><p>This girl liked me. A lot. She asked me to leave the club with her so I did.</p><p>No! No! No! I slammed the journal shut and threw it across the room. It slammed against the wall and fell opened on the floor. I couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t read about him being with another girl.</p><p>This was my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have left him. He was sleeping with other girls because I was too stubborn to hear him out. He was innocent all along.</p><p>I put my arms around my legs and started rocking. I did this to myself and now I had to deal with the consequences. I looked at Nick\u2019s journal on the floor and walked over to pick it up. I had to own this pain to get past it. Knowing the truth wouldn\u2019t be as bad as imagining far worst.</p><p>I picked it up and read that last line again before I continued.</p><p>She asked me to leave the club with her so I did.</p><p>I went back to her apartment with her because I thought it would help me forget Payton. But it didn\u2019t. Nothing ever does.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even expect romantic stuff. It had been so long since I had been with a girl other than Payton, I had forgotten how some of them could be. She was stripping her clothes off like we were about to close some kind of business transaction. She was pissed when I told her I couldn\u2019t sleep with her because my heart belonged to someone and it wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>Thank, god! I breathed a sigh of relief, the first breath I had taken since I started reading this entry. And I\u2019m glad she was pissed.</p><p>September 11th</p><p>Today is my sweet Payton\u2019s birthday. I can call her that if I want to. We\u2019re not together and I can\u2019t give it to her but I still bought the ring I had been saving for. I even got it engraved on the inside just like I planned. \u201cYou and No Other.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do with it. I guess I\u2019ll stare at it every day and think about how I let the only girl I\u2019ll ever want to marry slip through my fingers.</p><p>He bought me a ring? What kind of ring? One that you\u2019d engrave You and No Other inside. I think it\u2019s an engagement ring since he says I\u2019m the only girl he\u2019ll ever want to marry. I have to know. I have to see him. Now.</p><p>The sun wasn\u2019t up yet but it would be by the time I got ready and made it to Collinsville. I had to see him. I had to tell him how much I loved him and how wrong I was.</p><p>I went to my room to shower and I got ready. I let my hair go curly the way he liked it and I put on the sundress I wore when he took me to dinner after we made love for the first time. I hoped he recognized it and remembered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I was ready to go, I softly knocked on Claire\u2019s door. I heard stirring and smiled to myself because I knew she was putting on clothes. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>I eased the door open and Jessie was still asleep. I motioned with my finger for her to come out so we didn\u2019t wake him up.</p><p>She saw Nick\u2019s journal in my hand. \u201cYou read it?\u201d</p> <p>I clutched it to my heart. \u201cYes. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have, but I did and I\u2019ve been so wrong about him. I have to go to him. Now.\u201d</p><p>She looked out her window and then at the clock. \u201cIt\u2019s still dark. Why don\u2019t you wait until it\u2019s light outside.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t winning this argument. \u201cIt\u2019ll be light by the time I get to his house. I can\u2019t stand to be without him another minute. I\u2019ll burst if I stay here. It\u2019s only a two hour drive and I want to be there when he wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see it doesn\u2019t matter what I want you to do. You\u2019re going to do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>31 In The Middle Of Shallow</p><p>Nick</p><p>I drank way too much whiskey so my head was freakin\u2019 pounding and whoever was blowing up my phone wasn\u2019t helping matters. I reached over to silence the thing because I was in no mood to talk to anyone, especially at eight o\u2019clock in the morning after the drunk I pulled.</p><p>A few minutes later, I heard a soft knock on my door. Shit! Could I not be left in peace for one minute? \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dallas opened my door and something about the look on her face wasn\u2019t right. She wouldn\u2019t be coming into my room on a Saturday morning this early. I lifted my head to look at her and she had her phone in her hand. She didn\u2019t say a word. She just handed it to me and I could only assume she meant for me to answer it.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick, it\u2019s Claire.\u201d</p><p>Please, no. My heart sank because I immediately knew something had happened to Payton and I shot up in the bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She left four hours ago coming to your house and she\u2019s not answering her phone. She was supposed to call when she got to your house and I haven\u2019t heard from her. She should have made it to your house by six o\u2019clock. Maybe even earlier because there wouldn\u2019t have been much traffic. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Dallas will start calling all the hospitals between us and I\u2019ll get my dad up. He can get some units to help patrol the area looking for her car. I want you to start driving this direction on the route she would have taken. I\u2019ll drive in your direction from this side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. There\u2019s two ways she could have gone. I\u2019ll take one and Jessie will take the other.\u201d</p><p>I hung up and handed Dallas\u2019 phone to her. She took it from me but stood frozen as I got up to get dressed. \u201cNick, this is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>I went to my closet to grab a shirt. \u201cHow could this possibly be your fault?\u201d</p><p>I pulled my undershirt over my head and started tucking it in my jeans. \u201cI went to Knoxville last night to see Payton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>I could see the tears collecting in her eyes. \u201cTo convince her you should be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Sis and I appreciate what you did.\u201d I kissed the top of her head. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>The tears collecting in her eyes spilled down her cheeks. \u201cBut, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. Right now, I just need to find Payton and make sure she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Dad immediately sprung into cop mode and had units patrolling for Payton\u2019s car before I even left the house.</p><p>I got in my car and for the first time in a long time, I started praying. I love her so much. Please, let her be okay. Please place your protection around her and keep her safe. She means everything to me.</p><p>I was almost out of Collinsville when I got a call from my dad. \u201cA unit found her car on the side of the road, but it\u2019s been abandoned. Looks like she had a blowout in a rural stretch so her phone probably wasn\u2019t getting a signal.\u201d</p><p>And she was too impatient to wait. That was Payton. \u201cHow far from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it\u2019s that stretch on Highway 67 after you leave Collinsville and get into Shallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll drive from this direction and the squad car can drive from that direction and one of us should find her.\u201d God, I prayed one of us found her and she didn\u2019t get picked up by some lunatic.</p><p>Please, show me what I\u2019m looking for. I drove down Highway 67 about 10 miles and saw what I thought was her in the distance. I sped up, anxious to confirm her safety, and saw her walking with hellacious heels in one hand and something I couldn\u2019t identify in the other.</p><p>When I came to a stop in front of her, she lifted her skirt and stuck out her long leg and gave me the hitchhiker\u2019s thumb with a big smile on her face.</p><p>I jumped out of my car and ran to meet her in a dramatic reunion in the middle of Highway 67 in Shallow, Tennessee. That\u2019s when the potential severity of the situation hit me, along with my tears of relief.</p><p>I grabbed her face and stared at it because it had been too long since I saw it. \u201cI could beat your ass right now. Do you hear me?\u201d I pulled her into my arms and squeezed her way too hard. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me. Why are you out here this time of the morning?\u201d</p><p>Tears were streaming down her face by handfuls. \u201cI had to see you. I was wrong, so very wrong and I had to tell you the minute I figured it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat caused this revelation for you to drive to my house at four o\u2019clock in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d She held out my journal. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sorry I read it. It told me everything I needed to know. Everything I should have already known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d And then it clicked for me what my sister meant. \u201cDallas. She gave it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mad at her. She did it because she loves you so much and knew it was the only way I\u2019d see the truth. Can you ever forgive me for being so stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d I leaned in for the kiss I thought I\u2019d never have again and I felt her smile against my mouth. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see your newest tattoo. You didn\u2019t describe it at all and I\u2019m dying of curiosity.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my shirt and showed her the infinity symbol with her name entwined within it. She reached out to touch it and all those familiar feelings emerged from under the surface.</p><p>\u201cI love it. I want one just like it with your name.\u201d She pointed to the place over her heart. \u201cI want it right here for your eyes only.\u201d</p><p>My name tattooed over her heart sounded like the best idea I\u2019d heard in a long time. \u201cI think that can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I want my birthday present.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she read my journal. \u201cYou do, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I want it now.\u201d</p><p>I had it with me. I always had it with me so I could look at it and be reminded of her. \u201cWell, what if I had it in my pocket? Would you want me to give it to you right here in the middle of Shallow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I pulled the black leather box from my pocket and balanced on my palm. \u201cIs this the birthday present you\u2019re talking about?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI believe that could be it.\u201d</p><p>I dropped down to my knee and then reached up to pop the top. She saw the ring I had saved to buy and I watched as her eyes filled with tears. \u201cPayton Caroline Archer, will you be my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Nickolas Aleksei Hawke, I will marry you.\u201d</p><p>I took the diamond engagement ring from the box and slid it on her left ring finger. \u201cAnd will you let me put babies inside you and watch them grow?\u201d</p><p>She burst into laughter, remembering what I had told her I wanted to do the night we broke up. \u201cYes and I\u2019ll even let you practice first. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I love you. You\u2019re gonna be the best wife ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn skippy.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>3 Years Later</p><p>Payton</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it was time. We had waited for months and it was finally here.</p><p>I reached over and shook Nick\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBaby, wake up.\u201d</p><p>He rolled away from me onto his stomach and put his face into his pillow. \u201cNo, woman. I just pulled a double and I\u2019m tired. I want to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I shook him again. \u201cGet up. It\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s baby time. We need to go the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019 me, right? The baby is choosing to come now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Get your ass up.\u201d</p><p>We got in the car and I\u2019d never known Nick to drive so slow. For the love of God, he used to race every chance he got and now he was a cop. He could speed if he wanted to and he had an excuse to get a move on. Did he need me to put a flame under his ass or what? There was a baby on the way.</p><p>We walked up to the front desk. \u201cClaire Boone\u2019s room, please.\u201d</p><p>We waited as the receptionist looked her up in the computer. \u201cLooks like she\u2019s in Labor and Delivery Room 117. Go through those double doors and it will be down the hall to the left.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe it. Our best friends were having a baby. It wasn\u2019t planned, but sometimes the best things weren\u2019t.</p><p>We walked toward Claire\u2019s room and I was so excited I went down the wrong hall. Nick stopped and pointed in the right direction. \u201cBaby, your other left.\u201d</p><p>We got to the door ready to knock and I heard a baby cry. No way. She had just called me an hour ago to tell me she was at the hospital. There\u2019s no way she had already had the baby.</p><p>My ears perked up. \u201cThat was a baby crying.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t seemed enthused. \u201cI think you can expect to hear that kind of thing around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it came from Claire\u2019s room.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about having babies, but that would be awfully fast for a first, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Like record time, but Claire does everything perfectly so I would expect no less from her when it comes to giving birth.\u201d</p><p>I lightly knocked on the door and heard Claire\u2019s soft voice. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p> <p>I peeked around the door first to make sure we wouldn\u2019t be walking in on her doing that spread eagle thing or whatever position it was they put you in when you pushed out a baby. \u201cAll clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, get yourself in here so you can see our little addition.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe what my eyes were seeing and I felt the tears coming. Claire was holding a tiny little baby in her arms while Jessie stood over her admiring his work.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, Claire. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s already here.\u201d</p><p>I streaked over to her bedside and looked down at her new bundle of joy. I still couldn\u2019t believe they chose to not find out what the baby was when she had her ultrasound. \u201cTell me. Boy or girl?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuess.\u201d</p><p>I had declared it a boy from the second Claire freaked out about being pregnant, but now I wasn\u2019t so sure. I looked down and tried to decide if I thought the baby looked like a he or she, but I could only distinguish one thing from that sweet face. It was Jessie Boone\u2019s mini-me.</p><p>Although the baby looked just like Jessie, there was something too pretty about her to be a boy and that\u2019s when I decided. \u201cThat\u2019s a girl face. She\u2019s too pretty to be a stinkin\u2019 boy.\u201d</p><p>Claire couldn\u2019t take her eyes off of her. \u201cShe sure is.\u201d</p><p>Nick shook Jessie\u2019s hand and did that half masculine hug thing. \u201cCongratulations. You\u2019re a dad, Boone. That\u2019s freaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened so fast, I haven\u2019t had time to absorb it all. Her water broke and she was all calm and everything. We didn\u2019t get in any kind of hurry about getting here because we thought it would take hours but then some really bad pains started. By the time we got here, she was almost ready.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOmigod, did you get your epidural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was eight centimeters when we got here and it all happened too fast. Girl, let me tell you...that pain ain\u2019t no joke. Ooh, it burned like a mutha. I thought my vajayjay was on fire. It\u2019s probably better you weren\u2019t here. I would have scared you into never having any.\u201d</p><p>I did not need to be hearing that right now.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just missed them. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t meet them in the hall carrying Ozzy and Harley. Those two immediately sacked out after the excitement of seeing her was over, so they took them home.\u201d</p><p>Now that we knew it was a girl, it was time to choose a name. \u201cSo, what are you naming this beautiful little princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked about Finley Elizabeth, but I\u2019m still not sure. I need to look at her a little longer to make sure it fits.\u201d</p><p>That was a great name. \u201cI like it. She can pull off Finley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna hold her?\u201d</p><p>I guess I should get used to it. \u201cAbsolutely. She needs to get familiar with her Aunt Pate.\u201d</p><p>I took Baby Finley from Claire and looked down at her beautiful little round face. I unconsciously began to sway as I spoke softly to her and touched her soft cheek to mine. I guess it was the innate thing to do but I was still surprised when I caught myself doing it because I had never been around babies and I certainly didn\u2019t get a nurturing instinct from my mother.</p><p>There was no question about it. This was what I wanted.</p><p>We didn\u2019t stay near as long as I would have liked, but Claire and Jessie needed bonding time with Finley before she had to go to the nursery.</p><p>Nick and I didn\u2019t talk much on the ride home and I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because he was avoiding the baby talk or because he was still tired. I hoped it was the latter.</p><p>It was still night and I knew he was exhausted from working so many hours so I let him go to bed instead of starting the conversation that scared the hell out of me.</p><p>There was nothing on television so I cut it off and softly slid into bed beside my husband. I turned on my side away from him so I wouldn\u2019t disturb his sleep and I felt his arm snake around my waist and pull me against him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep. I guess being up so long has given me my second wind.\u201d He kissed the back of my neck and rubbed his hand over my belly. \u201cYou want me to practice putting a baby in there?\u201d</p><p>That had been our little joke we had shared for three years and I wondered what he was gonna say when I told him it couldn\u2019t be called practicing anymore because he had succeeded in putting one there.</p><p>The timing wasn\u2019t perfect. I had another year before I got my BS in interior design and I knew he wanted it to be the two of us for a while longer. At least that\u2019s what he said when I told him Claire was pregnant. That had been several months ago. I hoped time had changed his mind or maybe seeing Finley stirred something different in him.</p><p>I was nervous. I was afraid he would think I had done it on purpose so Claire and I could have babies together. I didn\u2019t, but I was happy about it and I wanted him to be, too.</p><p>I rolled over to face him and he hitched my leg over his hip. He rubbed his hand up the back of my thigh to my panties and slid his hand underneath. \u201cI love to get into these.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my neck as he pulled my nightgown up and over my head. That familiar stirring presented itself and I decided to ride it out one last time before I told Nick about the baby.</p><p>Three years together and he could still make me scream his name. He was the best husband ever.</p><p>We lay silent in the dark and he was rubbing his hand back and forth over my belly so I decided that was my sign to tell him. \u201cI admire the way you have been such a diligent student in your baby making studies, Mr. Hawke, but there comes a time in every student\u2019s life when he must fail or graduate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me I\u2019m getting an \u2018F\u2019 in your class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re definitely not getting an \u2018F.\u2019 You\u2019re graduating with a 4.0. And honors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Hawke, you\u2019ve mastered your craft. You can no longer practice putting a baby in me because you\u2019ve successfully done it already.\u201d</p><p>I cringed as I waited for his response. I felt the bed shift as he reached over to turn on the lamp. Our bedroom was dimly lit and he spun around to look at me and then to my naked belly.</p><p>He scooted over next to me and curiously reached his hand out to place it over the spot where our baby currently resided. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve ever done to get a rush doesn\u2019t even come close to comparing to the one I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth on my stomach and kissed it. \u201cOur baby is inside you right there.\u201d He gazed up at me. \u201cGod, I love you. You\u2019re the best wife ever.\u201d</p><p>He crawled up my body to kiss me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the best husband ever. Now, make me scream your name again.\u201d</p><p>No regrets in love. Ever. </p> </body></html>"]
