The fiery pain blasted in his shoulder even as the retort of the rifle echoed in his ears.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not taking me back, you bastard!\u201d The snarl came from up ahead, to the right. The tip of the barrel jutted over a fallen log.</p><p>Jude gritted his teeth, but didn\u2019t bother glancing down at the wound. No time for that, not now. \u201cBobby Burrows!\u201d He called out the man\u2019s name. Voice loud and hard, as if he weren\u2019t bleeding like a freaking stuck pig. \u201cThere are two ways we can handle this...\u201d He stalked forward. Drops of blood littered the ground around him. Great. Blood would attract the gators and hell knew what else. The bastard would pay. \u201cFirst way\u2019s easy, as in...you drop that rifle and come out with your hands up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up! I won\u2019t go to jail! I won\u2019t!\u201d The tip of the weapon began to move. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cThen we do it the hard way.\u201d Jude inhaled and caught the cloying scent of the swamp, the rich flavor of his own blood, and the man\u2019s scent of fear and sweat. \u201cI come and get you\u2014 and I rip you apart.\u201d Simple enough. His eyes narrowed on his target. The ground disappeared beneath Jude\u2019s feet as he sprang forward.</p> <p>A man darted out from behind the log, eyes wild, rifle clutched tight to him. With a big-ass scope on it, of course. He lifted, aimed\u2014</p><p>Jude growled, a deep, inhuman sound, and he swiped out with his right hand. He caught the wanted man in the right shoulder, and saw the spatter of blood in the air. Bobby\u2019s this time, not his.</p><p>Wound for wound. Blood for blood. The way of his kind.</p><p>He grabbed the weapon, wrenching it out of Bobby\u2019s hand. Bobby, a guy in his forties, balding and with big fists, stared up at him, terror on his face. \u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude smiled. Held up his hands. Blood stained the claws that seemed to burst out of his fingertips. \u201cHuman?\u201d</p><p>A whimper.</p> <p>The smile stretched even more. His shoulder ached like a bitch, pulsing every few seconds, but Jude ignored the pain. An old habit. He leaned forward, ran his claws over the squirming man\u2019s stubbled face. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. What I am, Bobby, is the worst nightmare you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He let his claws dig into skin. \u201cTell me, did you enjoy cutting those women?\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s screams pierced the night.</p><p>The first time she saw him, Jude Donovan was covered in blood. Erin Jerome recognized him instantly\u2014she\u2019d seen his picture in the local paper just days before. She watched as Jude handed the wanted man he\u2019d apprehended over to the local cops. Watched as Bobby Burrows, a man who\u2019d cruelly sliced up the faces of his ex-wife, his two ex-girlfriends, and some unlucky woman he\u2019d stumbled across in Baton Rouge, was shoved into the backseat of a squad car.</p><p>She could hear Bobby\u2019s shouts from across the street. His yells of \u201cMonster!\u201d And his ravings about claws and killers.</p><p>Disgust tightened her lips. Jerk was probably already preparing for his defense. An insanity plea. Erin would bet a month\u2019s salary on it.</p><p>Not that she was going to let the freak get away with something like that.</p><p>Oh, no, as an assistant district attorney, it was her job to make sure that old Bobby got to see the inside of an eight by twelve foot cell, preferably for the rest of his miserable life. Angola prison was waiting for him.</p><p>Straightening her jacket, because this was only her second week on the job and she needed to be professional\u2014or, at least try to be\u2014Erin crossed the street. Her eyes were drawn to Jude.</p> <p>The bounty hunter.</p><p>He worked for Night Watch, a huge, multi-state operation that had a main base in Baton Rouge. Night Watch was reputed to be one of the best, if not the best, bounty hunting agencies in the country. No matter what it took, their hunters caught their prey.</p><p>A fact that, right then, made her enormously grateful. Her job would get a whole lot easier now that she had the defendant in custody.</p><p>Her heels tapped on the pavement. Time to\u2014</p><p>Jude\u2019s head shot up. His eyes, the bluest she\u2019d ever seen, lazered in on her.</p><p>Erin stumbled. No, oh, hell, no\u2014</p><p>She caught his scent then. The wild scent of her kind.</p><p>Other. Shifter.</p><p>Erin wasn\u2019t human, well, not completely anyway. And she knew the truth about the world around her.</p><p>She knew that humans weren\u2019t the only killers out on the streets.</p><p>Sucking in a sharp breath, she straightened her shoulders and kept walking. The animal scent of the hunter teased her, as did the thick fragrance of blood in the air.</p><p>Dammit, this is the last thing I need. She\u2019d tried so hard, for so long, to be normal.</p><p>Then this guy had literally landed in her path.</p><p>His nostrils widened as she came closer. She knew he was drinking in her scent, knew too by the faint line that appeared between his brows that he couldn\u2019t quite understand what she was.</p><p>Story of my life.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jerome.\u201d One of the uniforms stepped toward her, a wide smile on his face. His partner slammed the car door, effectively isolating Bobby and ending his claws rant.</p><p>Maybe that hadn\u2019t been an insanity plea in the making after all.</p><p>She crouched down, gazing at Bobby through the window. Her breath rushed out. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d But she knew.</p><p>The uniforms looked at Jude.</p><p>Jaw clenched, so did she.</p><p>And Erin realized she\u2019d made a serious mistake. His eyes held hers. Saw too much.</p><p>Danger.</p><p>Oh, yeah, this guy was a serious threat. To her.</p><p>Not good-looking, not really, at least not in that classic, magazine way. A mane of thick blond hair teased his shirt collar.</p><p>Framed a face that was hard, a little cruel. High cheeks. Sharp nose. Square jaw.</p><p>No, not a GQ face. But still...</p><p>Sexy. Somehow, he was still sexy. Maybe it was those lips. That scar that slipped right over the edge of his top lip.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t have been sexy, but it was.</p><p>He was.</p><p>Freaking animal attraction, that\u2019s what it was.</p><p>The guy had an air about him, one of those I-don\u2019t-give-adamn attitudes. A wildness in his eyes and in the curl of his lips.</p><p>Erin swallowed. She couldn\u2019t help taking an uneasy step back.</p><p>His eyes followed the movement, and one golden brow rose. After a moment, he shrugged. His gaze raked over her body.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssistant District Attorney Erin Jerome.\u201d Gritted out. Why was there blood all over Bobby? If something happened and this case got thrown out\u2014</p><p>\u201cNot the question I was asking.\u201d Bland as you please. That brow was still up.</p><p>Her lips parted. \u201cWhat?\u201d No way could he have meant\u2014</p><p>His eyes swept over her again, and a smile lifted his lips. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Right then, the only interesting thing she saw was Bobby. A lie. But she\u2019d always been good at lying to herself. And about herself. \u201cWhat. Happened?\u201d</p><p>Another shrug. \u201cHe slipped in the swamp. Fell on some branches.\u201d</p><p>It was Erin\u2019s turn to let her eyes drift over him. Drift over his too-wide shoulders and muscled chest. \u201cIs that your blood?\u201d</p><p>she asked quietly. \u201cOr his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle of both.\u201d</p><p>A headache began to pound behind her left eye. Erin grabbed on to her patience and held tight.</p><p>What was the guy\u2019s deal? Was he the crazy one?</p><p>\u201cUh, Ms. Jerome?\u201d It was the uniform to her right. \u201cYou want us to go ahead and take Burrows to processing?\u201d</p><p>Erin shook her head. She\u2019d been listening to the police radio, hoping for some word on Bobby. The guy had vanished less than an hour after posting bail\u2014she still didn\u2019t know what the idiot judge had been thinking. She\u2019d been desperate for some word on the sadistic jerk, and then, like a sweet gift from Fate, she\u2019d caught the news of his capture.</p><p>She\u2019d almost flown down to Burns Swamp. \u201cTake him to the hospital. Get him patched up.\u201d She pointed at the cop. \u201cDo not let him leave your sight for even a second, understand? Bail\u2019s revoked. Once the docs give the ok, haul his ass back to jail.\u201d</p><p>Hopefully, he\u2019d stay locked up for the rest of his miserable days.</p><p>The uniform, Ray Neal\u2014she\u2019d met him twice before\u2014gave a nod. He and his partner climbed into the car, then drove away, taking her criminal with them.</p><p>And leaving her alone with the hunter.</p><p>\u201cWanna answer my question?\u201d His voice was deep, rumbling.</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her bare arms, and it was far too warm for her to have a chill from the weather.</p><p>\u201cJust what question was that?\u201d She tilted her head to the right.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d A pause. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>She let her brow furrow. She\u2019d fooled Other before, she could do it again. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure I understand. I told you, I\u2019m Assistant District Attorney\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t smell human.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught on a gasp. No, he hadn\u2019t just said\u2014</p><p>He stepped toward her, a fast move that brought their bodies too close. Jude leaned in, lowering his head over the curve of her throat. And inhaled.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d She shoved him, hard, and watched with no small satisfaction as he stumbled back.</p><p>Oh, yeah, big guy, I\u2019m much, much stronger than I appear. He wasn\u2019t the first one to learn that little lesson.</p><p>She almost bared her teeth at him. Almost.</p><p>After all, she wasn\u2019t an animal. No matter what the whispers back home said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know just what you think you were doing,\u201d she snapped, glaring at him as she narrowed her eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019d better watch what you do and what you say around me.\u201d Was the guy crazy? You don\u2019t smell human. He couldn\u2019t say things like that.</p><p>The words were too dangerous.</p><p>She reached into her purse. Dug out her card. \u201cCall my office. My assistant will take care of any paperwork you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a moment longer. Then, slowly, his tanned fingers rose. Long fingers, callused. Strong. He took the card, and his fingertips brushed over her hand.</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t flinch and she was extremely proud of that fact.</p><p>\u201cGood work, Donovan.\u201d After giving him that grudging token of appreciation, she nodded and began to march back toward her car.</p><p>She\u2019d taken all of five steps when she heard his whistle. Long, loud, and very appreciative.</p><p>Erin stilled.</p><p>I really don\u2019t need this shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got your scent.\u201d Hard words. Scary words. Because she knew what they meant.</p><p>If Jude Donovan truly was a shifter, and every instinct she had screamed that he was, then having her scent, well, it meant he had her. He\u2019d be able to follow her, to find her, almost anywhere.</p><p>A shifter. What were the odds she\u2019d stumble onto him?</p><p>One of the little perks in the Other world\u2014the world full of supernaturals and nightmares, the world that, rather unfortunately, was her life\u2014was that like recognized like. Demons, because, yeah, those conniving bastards were real, could</p><p>\u201csee\u201d others of their breed. They could look right past the magic glamour and peer into the darkness inside.</p><p>Witches felt the power pull from their brethren.</p><p>And shifters, well, they could smell each other\u2014a distinct scent. One that carried the wisp of power and the scent of the beast.</p><p>Jude Donovan smelled of power. Of wild, strong man. Of savagery. No denying that scent.</p><p>As for the beast...she didn\u2019t need the marks on Bobby\u2019s face to know Donovan had claws.</p><p>Erin began to walk again. One determined step after another.</p><p>And even when she climbed into her car, she could feel his eyes on her. Watching and seeing too much.</p><p>Now, she\u2019d have to be extra careful to stay on her guard and not let the hunter discover the secrets she kept so carefully hidden.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d Dee Daniels asked the minute Jude strode past the rather unassuming entrance of Night Watch\u2019s Louisiana branch. She stood quickly, her blond hair cut brutally short around her elfin face. There was envy in her eyes as she stared at him with her lips slightly parted. \u201cYou lucky bastard, you took prey down, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jude grunted and rolled his shoulder. He\u2019d shifted before coming into the agency. A fast, hard shift to speed up the healing process. His kind were blessed with a freaking phenomenal recovery system. Some shifters were lucky, they could heal almost instantly from their wounds. Others took a few days for a full recovery. It all depended on the power of the beast inside.</p><p>Because he was a very rare shifter breed, Jude was on the luckier end of the spectrum. He could heal fully in hours.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d have a scar because the system wasn\u2019t that perfect. More like he had his own little micro surgeon inside, stitching him back up. Soon, all that would remain of the jagged hole would be a slim line of raised flesh\u2014once the skin melded itself back together.</p><p>He dropped his bag near his desk. Damn but he was tired.</p><p>He hurt.</p><p>And he was horny.</p><p>All because of a little human.</p><p>No, not a human. He\u2019d stake his life on it.</p><p>\u201cYou tracked the bastard down in twelve hours.\u201d Dee gave a faint hmmm, kind of like a revving motor. \u201cJerk, you\u2019ve just broken my record.\u201d</p><p>The disgruntlement in her voice had a reluctant smile tugging at his lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, babe, there\u2019s always next time.\u201d Dee was a bloodthirsty one. She was the toughest and sneakiest fighter he\u2019d ever come across. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she was one hundred percent human.</p><p>A human with a serious attitude.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let that asshole stay on the streets.\u201d Because he\u2019d seen the pictures. Seen just what good old Bobby had done to the women who\u2019d \u201cwronged\u201d him.</p> <p>Poor Sheila Gentry had gotten seventeen stitches in her face because she\u2019d made the mistake of saying no when the guy asked her out for dinner. She\u2019d taken a pit stop at a gas station and found one hell of a Romeo who wanted to pick her up.</p><p>Psycho.</p><p>Caged psycho now.</p><p>The little ADA had better do her job and keep him there.</p><p>He eased into his chair. Heard the grunt of the leather. \u201cDee, what do you know about Erin Jerome?\u201d</p> <p>She blinked her chocolate eyes. The lady was all of five-foot-three. One hundred and fifteen pounds. She looked like a hard wind would blow her over.</p><p>But he\u2019d seen her take down demons twice her size.</p><p>Dee knew the score about the Other world. Knew it, and often hated it.</p><p>A frown had her brows pulling low. \u201cThe new ADA? She just started.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew that. He would have known about her if she\u2019d been around for more than a few weeks.</p><p>Her scent. He\u2019d never smelled anything like it. Roses. Soft, subtle. And...more. An alluring, haunting scent of woman.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t smell like an animal. Didn\u2019t give off the wild, rich scent of female shifters.</p><p>But the minute he\u2019d seen her, the minute he\u2019d caught her fragrance in the air, his whole body had stiffened.</p><p>And he\u2019d gotten the biggest hard-on of his life. There was something there. He knew it.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, she\u2019s Other.\u201d Dee curled her lip. \u201cI swear, you guys are taking over the city.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she? Witch? Djinn? One of those charmers?\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t speak. Because he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cA vampire?\u201d Ice dripped from her voice. Dee hated the vamps. Her mission in life was to exterminate as many of them as she could.</p> <p>Not that he blamed her, really. A vampire master had slaughtered her family years ago.</p><p>Dee was real big on the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d mentality.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...think so.\u201d Erin\u2019s skin had been flushed with color. Kissed by the sun. Vamps were usually paler than, well, death.</p><p>The lady had been a real looker. Coal black hair, thick, spilling to her shoulders. Red lips. Cheeks almost brutally sharp.</p><p>Eyes wide and gold. And a little black mole near the corner of her left eye.</p><p>Great body. High breasts. Round hips. Long, long legs.</p><p>Sexy.</p><p>Tall, slender, she\u2019d walked with confidence, grace.</p><p>Until she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>Then he\u2019d watched her stumble, for just a moment.</p><p>Because she\u2019d sensed what I am.</p><p>Only another shifter should have been able to sense him.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t smell like a shifter,\u201d he muttered, rubbing his hand over his face. Hell, he shouldn\u2019t even be worrying about this now. He should be sleeping. Drinking. Congratulating himself on another job well done.</p><p>Not obsessing over a woman who clearly wasn\u2019t interested in him.</p><p>Yeah, \u2019cause smelling a woman, sniffing her like a freaking dog\u2014that was the way to get a date.</p><p>\u201cJust let me know if you hear anything about her, okay?\u201d he finally said.</p><p>A cautious nod.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dee.\u201d He closed his eyes...and saw Erin.</p><p>Shit. He needed to get a life.</p><p>He needed to take a life. Needed to kill. Needed to feel the sweet trickle of life being washed away.</p><p>The Slasher, Bobby Burrows, waited just behind the bars. There he stood, stalking around and muttering about evil and devils and hell.</p><p>And annoying the hell out of him.</p><p>That bastard had been on the news for the last two nights.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s fat, ugly face had been splashed across the screen\u2014making him sick.</p><p>Bobby Burrows didn\u2019t deserve fifteen minutes of fame. He deserved a trip to the grave.</p><p>Bobby grabbed the bars of his cell. Tightened his thick hands into straining fists around the metal and screamed, \u201cThe fuckin\u2019 devil marked me! I want reporters in here, I want my lawyer, I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He sidled closer to Bobby, finally stepping out of the shadows he loved so much and smiling. He jerked his thumb toward the group of guards who were watching television near the entrance to the cages.</p><p>Cages. That\u2019s what he called \u2019em. To keep the animals inside.</p><p>But sometimes, the cages couldn\u2019t hold the animals.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath and caught the scent of the man\u2019s sweat and blood. \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna help you.\u201d They were too busy huddling up and watching a game to give a shit about the guy left in holding. He smiled and hoped he didn\u2019t look too hungry. \u201cBut I will.\u201d</p><p>Bobby squinted at him. The left side of his face was covered by a large, white bandage. \u201cWhat? Who are you?\u201d</p><p>His hands rose to the bars, reached for Bobby\u2019s\u2014</p><p>The Slasher jumped back.</p><p>Ah...not as stupid as he looked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me who hurt you, Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I did. The devil\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe devil\u2019s not real.\u201d He\u2019d never seen him. Judgment wasn\u2019t for the afterlife. It was for here and now, to be delivered by the strong.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d Absolute certainty. \u201cFound me in the swamp. Changed before me. I shot the bastard, but he still came after me.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cThen he cut me.\u201d</p><p>The bars were so thin. Not nearly strong enough to keep him out.</p><p>But strong enough to trap the human inside.</p><p>\u201cHe let you live, didn\u2019t he? I don\u2019t think the devil would do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a monster!\u201d Spittle flew from Bobby\u2019s mouth. \u201cHiding behind the face of a man. That fuckin\u2019 hunter! Pretendin\u2019, he\u2019s pretendin\u2019!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all pretend,\u201d he told him softly, aware of the excitement burning through his gut. He didn\u2019t have any more time to waste. \u201cIt\u2019s how we live.\u201d His hands flew through the gap in the bars. His right hand locked around the Slasher\u2019s throat.</p><p>A wheeze slipped past Bobby\u2019s lips.</p><p>Smiling, he jerked the human\u2019s head to the right. He heard the sharp snap of bones.</p><p>And felt a rush of power as the man sagged in his grip.</p><p>Slowly, his left hand rose. He cast a glance back toward the guards. They were still glued to their TV.</p><p>Fucking oblivious humans.</p><p>Claws pushed from the ends of his fingertips. He raised his left hand and plunged the claws into Bobby\u2019s heart.</p><p>As the blood flowed, a soft sigh escaped his lips.</p><p>No way was the media going to be able to overlook this kill.</p><p>He\u2019d be taking over the news now.</p><p>Jude got the call from the police station forty-five minutes later. A cop who owed him a favor tipped him off.</p><p>The call was brief, and the details came fast. Burrows was dead. The ADA was on her way.</p><p>And, oh, yeah, it looked like an animal had attacked the guy\u2014while he was locked up. Of course, the cops hadn\u2019t seen a thing. Bobby had been all alone in holding one minute, then sliced and diced the next.</p><p>Jude grabbed his jacket. Slung it over his shoulder\u2014almost healed now. He ran for the door.</p><p>And ignored Dee\u2019s shout behind him.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see the body.\u201d</p><p>His voice, even deeper now, stopped her as Erin began to climb the steps leading to the police station and to the dead man.</p><p>She glanced back over her shoulder. She\u2019d caught his scent seconds before he\u2019d spoken. \u201cHow do you even know there\u2019s a body here, Donovan?\u201d The District Attorney\u2019s office had received the call less than fifteen minutes ago. Just how had the hunter learned about the death?</p><p>Suspicion had her eyes narrowing. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He jumped up the steps. Grabbed her arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill the bastard, no. If I\u2019d killed him, well, he would\u2019ve been left in the swamp and been gator bait by now.\u201d</p><p>Erin swallowed. Nice, to, ah, know. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as you. I want to know what happened to the Slasher.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. You don\u2019t want to see the body. \u201cSounds to me like you already know.\u201d Which meant she had a leak in the department. Not surprising. Not particularly good news, either.</p><p>His wide shoulders lifted in a shrug. \u201cTrust me on this, you don\u2019t want to see Bobby Burrows right now.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cAnd, trust me, I\u2019m a big girl. I can handle it.\u201d Not like it was her first murder scene. Not by a long shot. She was twenty-nine years old, and she\u2019d been working the rough cases since she\u2019d passed the bar years ago.</p><p>To make a difference, sometimes you had to get your hands dirty.</p><p>Erin turned and continued stalking up the stone steps. Jude shadowed her moves, his body a ripple of muscle.</p><p>His scent filled the air around them.</p><p>Her heart raced, too fast. Was the frantic beat from the dread filling her at the thought of a dead man waiting in what should have been a secure cell?</p><p>Or was it from something more?</p><p>No.</p><p>She shoved open the glass doors. A guard near the front rushed forward. \u201cMs. Jerome\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her thumb jerked toward her hulking shadow. \u201cKeep Donovan up here. I don\u2019t want him anywhere near my crime scene.\u201d</p><p>Her sensitive ears picked up the hunter\u2019s swift inhalation and the nearly soundless...\u201cYou\u2019ll need me on this one, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Sweetheart. She slanted him a scathing glance. \u201cDoubt it, hunter. Doubt it.\u201d Then she stalked down the tiled hallway, heading for lockup, and wondering just what sort of sight waited for her.</p><p>You don\u2019t want to see the body.</p><p>The lady had one fine ass.</p><p>Even as anger tightened his body, Jude couldn\u2019t help but admire that beautiful sway.</p><p>His nostrils were full of her scent. Woman, roses, and just a hint of rich, wild forest. Yeah, that wildness\u2014that fragrance had slipped into the air when those gorgeous eyes had narrowed and rage coated her voice.</p><p>Erin Jerome was so much more than she pretended to be.</p><p>The beast within him roared when she got close, and when she got too far away.</p><p>\u201cSorry, man, you heard the orders.\u201d Jamison McGee, a good cop and a good human, frowned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, James.\u201d Jude rocked back on his heels. He could smell the blood from here. \u201cShe\u2019ll be changing her mind.\u201d</p><p>Because he hadn\u2019t been kidding when he told the pretty ADA that she\u2019d need him.</p><p>Jude glanced toward the vinyl chairs near the entrance. \u201cWhen she comes looking for me, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes, ten tops, and he\u2019d wager his ADA would be running her sexy ass right back to him.</p><p>Because it seemed that another monster was out hunting. One that had killed right under the noses of the Baton Rouge PD.</p><p>Talk about a bold asshole.</p><p>Jude almost could admire that. Almost.</p><p>The scent of the blood burned her nostrils. Most of her kind liked that smell. She hated it.</p><p>Erin straightened her shoulders and strode forward. Four uniformed cops stood just in front of the entrance to the pen.</p><p>They glanced up at the clicking of her heels. One of them, an older guy with rich coffee skin, graying hair and a strong chin, stepped toward her. \u201cMs. Jerome, you\u2019d better brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>He looked worried. Looked like he thought she was going to pass out after one glance at the stiff.</p><p>She really wasn\u2019t the passing out kind of girl.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the warning.\u201d The second one she\u2019d gotten in less than three minutes. But Grant Tyler wasn\u2019t being an ass with his warning. The young cop next to him was stark white and shaking. He looked like he might be doing some fainting at any moment.</p><p>Oh, hell. A cop ready to hit the floor was never a good sign.</p><p>Erin pointed toward the door. \u201cShow him to me.\u201d</p><p>Grant pushed open the door.</p><p>The stench nearly made her gag. Then she saw him.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s arms had been yanked through the bars, left to hang over the edges of his prison. His wrists had been cut, long, thick slices, and his blood pooled on the floor. His eyes were open, wide, and his face had been slashed. A bloodred smile stretched from one ear to the next.</p><p>Positioned. Styled. His body had been arranged for the ultimate shock value.</p><p>Erin\u2019s lips pressed together.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Grant whispered.</p><p>There was a flash of light as the crime scene guy snapped a photo.</p><p>She flinched. \u201cFine.\u201d No, no, she wasn\u2019t fine. What the hell had happened? Her gaze jerked to the left, then the right. The other cells were empty. Transfer had been made just hours before, and she knew Bobby had been the only prisoner in holding.</p><p>She\u2019d planned for him to be the only one there\u2014all the better for the cops to keep an eye on him.</p><p>This was so not good.</p><p>A killer, murdered while he was surrounded by cops.</p><p>Murdered by cops? Her stomach knotted.</p><p>Erin turned away from the body. Goosebumps rose on her flesh. \u201cWho was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Admitted quietly. \u201cBurns, Grimes, and Hyde.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pressed into her right temple. The blood. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see a thing?\u201d Doubt had her voice rising. No way, no way was that possible.</p><p>\u201cWe were up front.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cDidn\u2019t see what happened and didn\u2019t hear a peep.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. This was a nightmare.</p><p>Captain Antonio Young strolled in then. Wearing a perfect suit, not so much as a wrinkle anywhere to be found. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Erin growled at him. He wasn\u2019t on her top ten list. Over the last week, she\u2019d gotten a pretty up close look at the captain, and came away thinking the guy was a bit of a prick. He was secretive, he didn\u2019t share his case files with the rest of the PD, and the guy was given to disappearing for long periods of time. Hardly upfront police behavior.</p><p>Erin had no idea how the man had ever been promoted through the ranks.</p><p>He must\u2019ve had some serious connections somewhere or else he\u2019d known where some bodies were buried. Maybe he\u2019d helped to bury those bodies.</p> <p>\u201cYour men have to be cleared.\u201d Her voice was sharp. The captain knew this, and he still had Grant and the others less than ten feet away from the victim. \u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to tell me how to do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, obviously, you do.\u201d The press would go wild with this story. Wild. \u201cFour cops. One dead perp. You do the math, Young.\u201d Okay, so she sounded like a bitch. Screw the polite chitchat. The man knew better.</p><p>Bobby Burrows was dead\u2014not just dead\u2014slaughtered. Aw, hell.</p><p>Young\u2019s handsome face\u2014cause, yeah, no denying he was a pretty boy with those elegant planes and hollows on his face\u2014tightened. No sign of his flashing dimple. He glared at her, and she glared right back.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it.\u201d From Grant. Strong, steady Grant. She\u2019d had a good feeling about the guy from the beginning, from the first moment she\u2019d met him at the courthouse. A real upfront kind of guy.</p><p>Now this.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to prove that,\u201d she said. Not going to be easy.</p><p>Another flash of light.</p><p>Erin licked her lips and knew what she had to do. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d Much as she hated it...</p><p>She was going to have to get close to that body. She spun and headed for the perp. Um, victim now. Her steps slowed as she approached the body. \u201cGive me a minute, Mark,\u201d she said to the crime scene analyst, and he moved back.</p> <p>Less than a foot away, she stopped. She didn\u2019t touch Bobby or the bars, no way was she going to risk contaminating evidence. But...</p><p>But her eyes touched him. Her gaze scanned every inch of him, paying careful attention to the wounds and\u2014</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest.</p><p>Those weren\u2019t knife wounds. No, she knew the shape of those wounds.</p><p>Intimately.</p><p>Those slices had been made by claws. She\u2019d seen marks like that too many times in the past.</p><p>Her nostrils twitched and she stared at Bobby\u2019s bloody form.</p> <p>The cops there\u2014the captain, the three men, and the woman\u2014they were human. So were the crime scene guys.</p><p>No shifters.</p><p>But a shifter had been here. He\u2019d killed.</p><p>And she knew there was a shifter close by, one who didn\u2019t mind a little blood and who sure had a hard-on for Bobby.</p><p>Jude.</p><p>Her steps were very precise as she turned and left the holding area. Once she was clear, her fingers knotted into fists, and she stormed down the hallway, racing back to face the hunter.</p><p>Jude stretched his legs out, letting the heels of his boots press into the old floor. He didn\u2019t glance at his watch, but he figured Erin had been with the body about eight minutes or so now and\u2014</p><p>Click. Click. Click.</p><p>The sound of fast-approaching high heels.</p><p>He glanced up.</p><p>And saw Erin bearing down on him, her face tight with fury and her eyes blazing.</p><p>Glowing?</p><p>She stalked right up to him, put her hands on the hips he\u2019d like to touch and demanded, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Whoa. Jude stood up, slowly, aware that he towered over her slender figure and using that to his advantage. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got the wrong idea here, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not your sweetheart.\u201d She jabbed a finger into his chest. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what got a hold of that bastard?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was fierce, but pitched low enough that only he would be able to hear her. \u201cI recognize the work of claws when I see</p><p>\u2019em, Donovan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my claws.\u201d The words came out more growl than anything else. He cleared his throat, tried again. It was hard to speak normally, with her so close, with that sweet scent filling his nose, and with the beast roaring. \u201cI told you, if I wanted him dead, he wouldn\u2019t have made it out of that swamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew what I\u2019d find in that cell.\u201d A pause, just for a beat of time. \u201cHow\u2019d you know, hunter? Because you\u2019d been the one to send Bobby to hell? Just had to put a smile on his face, didn\u2019t you? A grin for him to greet the devil with?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand, tired of her fingernail digging into his chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, sweetheart. I\u2019ve got an alibi. I was at Night Watch and at least four other agents can attest to that.\u201d Good thing, too. He rotated his shoulders. No more pain. Not even a twinge.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know? \u201d Gritted from between her teeth. Teeth that were starting to look a bit sharper than before.</p><p>He almost smiled. Would have, if they weren\u2019t talking about a dead body and if they hadn\u2019t been surrounded by cops.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend in the department. He called me.\u201d Because he owed me and because the sly bastard knew he\u2019d need my help. Just like she would.</p><p>Erin just didn\u2019t want to admit it yet.</p><p>\u201cWhat. Friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, now, you can\u2019t expect me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat. Friend!\u201d Her voice wasn\u2019t soft anymore, and a couple of cops glanced their way. \u201cTell me, because I\u2019m sure as hell thinking you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was me, ma\u2019am.\u201d A slow-drawling southern voice said.</p><p>Erin\u2019s head whipped to the left and her mouth dropped open as she stared at Antonio. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, flashing his perfectly capped, too-white teeth. The teeth looked even whiter next to his caramel skin\u2014coloring Jude knew the guy had gotten courtesy of his very lovely Mexican mother. \u201c\u2019Fraid so, Ms. Jerome. \u2019Fraid so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not quite as clueless as you seem to think I am.\u201d His voice was low but fierce. \u201cAnd one look at that body told me the cops in that room weren\u2019t suspects.\u201d He jerked his thumb toward Jude. \u201cBut one of his kind sure as hell was.\u201d</p><p>She froze. Then, it was as if a veil fell over her face. Erin\u2019s expression cleared, until only a false mask remained. \u201cHis kind?</p><p>What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Jude blinked. The lady was good. If she hadn\u2019t just been snarling at him about claw marks, he might have bought her confused act.</p><p>Or maybe not.</p><p>Because apparently even Tony wasn\u2019t buying it. The captain snorted and said, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am, then you\u2019re gonna have one hell of a time survivin\u2019 in this town.\u201d</p><p>She was living a nightmare. An absolute somebody-please-wake-me-up screaming nightmare.</p><p>Antonio knew about the Other.</p><p>Yeah, that was a problem, but the big deal was that she had a shifter gone bad who was slicing up killers right under the noses of the PD.</p><p>The news headlines would be brutal.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break this to you, Ms. Jerome\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin,\u201d she choked out because the captain drawled her surname out in a way that was like nails grating on her nerves.</p><p>\u201cBut the world you live in, well, only half of what you see is real.\u201d Antonio paced the small confines of his office, looking very much like a caged cat.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t. The guy didn\u2019t so much as give off one whiff of shifter scent.</p><p>But then, her smell was pretty damn hard to detect, too.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She kept her voice mild with an effort. After the captain\u2019s big revelation, he\u2019d herded her and Jude into his office.</p><p>She was playing the innocent human, for now. And for as long as necessary.</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago, I was out in the swamps. A vampire tried to drain me and leave my body for gator bait.\u201d</p><p>Nice visual. \u201cA vampire?\u201d Erin shook her head. \u201cSorry, captain, but vampires aren\u2019t real.\u201d Yeah, right. Those bastards were as real as she was.</p><p>Jude rolled his shoulders beside her. He\u2019d been doing that every few moments. What was up with that?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re real.\u201d Antonio stopped his pacing. \u201cGet used to the idea.\u201d</p><p>She had, about twenty-five years ago, when she\u2019d watched her mother go claw to teeth with a vamp. \u201cUm...tell me, captain, have you been in for an evaluation recently? Perhaps a trip to the police shrink is in order.\u201d Erin braced her hands on the armrests of her chair and pushed to her feet. \u201cNow, unless you want to tell me a few fairy tales about some trolls running loose in the city, I\u2019ve got a murder to solve. I don\u2019t have time for this crap.\u201d A good exit line. She headed for the door, chin up, shoulders back.</p><p>And heard clapping behind her. Glancing over her shoulder, Erin saw Jude smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d He pointed one long finger at her. \u201cBut why don\u2019t you cut the crap, ADA? We both know you understand all about the monsters in the dark, and playing the innocent isn\u2019t gonna work with me.\u201d</p><p>We both know you understand all about the monsters in the dark. Her lips parted.</p><p>He rose slowly and stalked toward her. Yeah, stalked, his movements slow and steady, strangely graceful, his eyes predatory. His bright gaze dropped to her mouth. Seemed to heat.</p><p>Trouble. Oh, but the man was going to be dangerous to her. She\u2019d known it from that first glance. Erin licked her lips. \u201cI, uh...\u201d No, that wouldn\u2019t work at all. She cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Donovan.\u201d One fast glance toward Antonio. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump on this insanity parade\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloves are off, lady. You know what I am.\u201d</p><p>Shifter.</p><p>He leaned in close and she watched the flare of his nostrils. \u201cAnd I know what you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Human.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s cut to the chase, here, okay? No pretending\u2019s necessary when the door\u2019s closed.\u201d And the door was closed.</p><p>Closed and locked. She\u2019d heard the soft snick after Antonio shut the door. \u201cYou saw the body. You said yourself\u2014those were claw marks, right?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted once more to the left. Antonio stared at her with his wide eyes. Denial was still an option. She didn\u2019t have to blow her cover, the cover she\u2019d worked so hard to get. Four months. It had taken her four months to find this job and to escape from her past.</p><p>A past that had come calling today\u2014memories stirred up by the cloying scent of blood and death.</p><p>Running from monsters was hard work, because they were everywhere.</p><p>Silence hung in the room, too thick.</p><p>Jude swore. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll take a look at the body and see what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed his hand when he tried to push past her, and she kissed her new life good-bye. \u201cIt was a shifter.\u201d</p><p>Antonio exhaled. \u201cDamn woman.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s skin felt warm beneath her fingertips. His eyes bored into hers, and she watched his pupils flare.</p><p>Dangerous.</p><p>She pulled her hand back and smoothed her fingers over the soft cotton of her pants. \u201cIt was a shifter, and, how convenient\u2014there\u2019s a shifter standing right in front of me.\u201d Towering over her. Surrounding her with his heat and scent.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t kill him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Their words twisted and blurred in her mind. She waited for the denials to finish, then raised a brow. \u201cYou said you could prove your innocence.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, but Jude nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d she muttered. \u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019ll have to do that.\u201d And she believed he could.</p><p>After that whole alibi business was taken care of, it would be time to get down to business.</p><p>\u201cCall Night Watch,\u201d Jude said. \u201cYou can verify my whereabouts in less than two minutes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d do that, but first...\u201cAre you up for another case, hunter?\u201d She knew just how hard it was to catch a shifter, especially one who hungered for the sweet thrill of human prey.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to hire me?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was. She knew that Jude Donovan would be her best bet for catching this killer. The cops wouldn\u2019t be able to track a shifter.</p><p>It takes a beast to catch a beast.</p><p>Oh, the games the Other played.</p><p>\u201cThe DA gonna be up for this?\u201d Antonio asked, inching closer.</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t glance his way. \u201cHe\u2019ll go for it.\u201d She\u2019d make absolutely certain he did. \u201cBut will you?\u201d she asked Jude.</p><p>His hard face was unreadable. Jeez but the man was big. She topped out at just under six feet, but he towered over her by several inches.</p><p>Just what kind of beast did Jude carry? Shifters\u2014the beings that most said carried two souls.</p><p>The soul of a man.</p><p>The soul of an animal.</p><p>Most shifters were pretty harmless. They could transform into foxes, birds, or snakes.</p><p>Others were more dangerous. Bears, panthers, wolves.</p><p>Wolves. Some believed\u2014with good reason\u2014that those were the most dangerous of the shifters. Fierce, bloodthirsty, and, just for fun, every now and then...psychotic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hunt for you.\u201d His gaze never left her face. \u201cFor a price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city will pay you.\u201d She\u2019d talk to the mayor and the DA. She wasn\u2019t planning a big reveal about the Other world with them; at least, not unless she wasn\u2019t given a choice. But Gus and Clark were smart guys. They\u2019d wise up real fast to the benefits of having this case handled as quietly and quickly as possible. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Jude could contain the guy, they\u2019d be more than willing to pay his price. A price she expected to be very high.</p><p>Jude shook his head. \u201cNot talking about the city.\u201d</p><p>Antonio stopped his inching closer routine.</p> <p>Her heart slammed into her ribs but she kept her voice quiet and silky when she asked, \u201cThen just who are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile. One that whispered across his face, lifted his upper lip and had her thighs clenching.</p><p>\u201cYou, sweetheart. You. \u201d</p><p>Erin gulped. Dammit\u2014that scar on his top lip\u2014 sexy. She could see the hunger in his eyes. The man\u2019s hunger and the beast\u2019s.</p><p>And she felt the hot rise of her own need.</p> <p>Not going to happen. She took a moment to let her heart rate ease back to normal. This wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d had a strong physical reaction to a shifter.</p><p>Okay, a really sexy shifter.</p><p>And it wouldn\u2019t be her last. She couldn\u2019t stop the rush of sensual awareness, but Erin controlled the wild instincts inside.</p><p>She always had. \u201cThe city will pay you,\u201d she said again and let the ice chill her words. \u201cAnd pay you well.\u201d Because hunting a killer like the one who\u2019d slaughtered Bobby wouldn\u2019t be easy.</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThey\u2019d better.\u201d Jude didn\u2019t look away from her. \u201cBut, sweetheart, you\u2019ll pay, too.\u201d</p><p>The words were a definite threat.</p> <p>Shifters always thought they were the baddest assholes on earth.</p><p>Because some of them were.</p><p>The local news carried the Burrows story that night at ten. A bright, perky blonde appeared at the top of the hour announcing, \u201cBobby Burrows, the suspect in the so-called Slasher Crimes, was found dead in his holding cell today. Police aren\u2019t releasing any information on this case yet, although sources say foul play is suspected...\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>He stared at the screen and felt the rage boil in his blood.</p><p>Foul play was suspected? Fuck, yes, he\u2019d carved up that bastard.</p><p>And he\u2019d done it for her.</p><p>The image on the screen flickered and a close-up shot of the mayor and the DA appeared. The DA was running his fat mouth about the security at the station.</p> <p>Blah. Blah. Blah</p><p>The camera angle altered, just a bit, and his prey appeared.</p><p>So perfect.</p><p>Erin stood a bit behind the mayor. Looking all calm and lovely in her button-down shirt and pants. Controlled and elegant.</p><p>Such a beautiful lie.</p><p>He knew who she was, what she was, down deep, past the skin.</p><p>She was just like him. She liked the blood, the screams, the pleas for mercy.</p><p>He knew all about the real Erin. Flawed, broken, and wild for death.</p><p>Just like him.</p><p>He hoped that she\u2019d liked her little present. Hoped she enjoyed all of the presents he would give to her. Soon.</p><p>He rose and went to the TV. He touched the spot just over her image.</p><p>Sweet, sweet Erin.</p><p>\u201cNo more running, love, you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>She should have known escape wasn\u2019t possible.</p><p>She should have known.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>She went to him. When the press conference was over, when the freak-out in the mayor\u2019s office had finally subsided, Erin went straight to Jude.</p><p>She knew where he lived. She\u2019d gotten that information from Night Watch when she called to verify his alibi.</p><p>Jude\u2019s lair was at the edge of the city, skirting the swamps. More of a cabin than a house, and one that didn\u2019t look overly inviting.</p><p>Raising her hand, Erin banged on the door. So, sure, it was close to midnight. And, okay, granted, the swamp looked dark and dangerous and the call of the crickets and who-the-hell knew what else had her ears ringing.</p><p>The mayor had sent her to Jude. The DA had sent her.</p><p>And she\u2019d come because she needed to see him.</p><p>The door opened with a creak. Jude stared down at her, stubble on his cheeks, his blond hair tousled and his eyes hooded.</p><p>No shirt. His chest was bare and too close. The man had serious muscles. Damn. His jeans hung low on his body, wrapping around his hips and clinging to his strong, hard thighs.</p><p>Hunter.</p><p>\u201cTook you long enough,\u201d he said, voice so deep it was nearly a growl.</p><p>Light surrounded him and spilled onto the porch. She shifted, her high heels scraping over the old wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize you were waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Lie. She\u2019d known that he wanted to talk to her, alone, just as she\u2019d wanted to talk to him.</p><p>Erin had to find out what he knew about her\u2014and how he knew it. So I won\u2019t slip up and make the same mistake with someone else next time. \u201cDo I get to come inside or do I have to stay out here all night?\u201d</p><p>His mouth hitched into a half-smile. Erin inhaled.</p><p>Then Jude stepped back, motioning for her to enter.</p><p>The fingers of her right hand tightened around her purse strap and she walked forward, hesitating for only the briefest of seconds when she caught sight of the deep gouges along the doorframe.</p><p>Claw marks.</p><p>Some shifters sure did like to mark their territory. Her jaw tightened and she brushed past him, all too aware of the heat and strength of his body.</p><p>The interior of his place was Spartan bare. A couch. A giant TV. A paperwork-covered desk shoved into the corner. A big, scarred wooden table, two chairs around it, a small lamp on its surface. Erin caught a glimpse of the kitchen\u2014or was that a closet?</p><p>\u201cNot here much,\u201d he said with a shrug, following her gaze. \u201cToo busy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunting.\u201d She knew exactly how he spent his days. In the hours since they\u2019d parted, she\u2019d done her homework.</p><p>Jude Donovan. Age thirty-five. College graduate, with a degree in criminal justice. He\u2019d been recruited to work for Night Watch when he\u2019d barely been twenty-two. His reputation for hunting was vicious, and so were the criminals he captured. The vilest of criminals.</p><p>Humans...and she\u2019d be willing to bet Other, too.</p><p>She reached into her bag and pulled out a check. Not the usual way things were handled in the DA\u2019s office, but...\u201cI\u2019ve been authorized to acquire your services.\u201d He didn\u2019t glance at the check, just kept those blue eyes trained on hers. Her fingers were steady as she held the check in the air between them. \u201cThis check is for ten thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>No change of expression. From the looks of his cabin, the guy shouldn\u2019t have been hesitating to snatch up the money.</p><p>\u201cGive the check to Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>At that, her lips firmed. \u201cI already gave them one.\u201d A hefty one, at that. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you. A bonus from the Mayor. He wants this guy caught, fast.\u201d Before word about the true nature of the crime leaked too far.</p><p>\u201cSo old Gus doesn\u2019t think his cops can handle this guy?\u201d</p><p>Gus LaCroix. Hard-talking, ex-hard-drinking mayor. No nonsense, deceptively smart, and demanding. \u201cHe\u2019s got the cops on this, but he said he knew you, and that you\u2019d be the best one to handle this job.\u201d</p><p>Erin strongly suspected that Gus belonged in the Other world. She hadn\u2019t caught any unusual scent drifting from him, but his agreement to bring in Night Watch and his almost desperate demands to the DA had sure indicated the guy knew more than he was letting on about the situation.</p><p>Could be he was a demon. Low-level. Many politicians were.</p><p>Jude took the check. Finally. She dropped her fingers, not wanting the flesh on flesh contact with him. Not then.</p><p>He folded the check and tucked it into the back pocket of his jeans. \u201cGuess you just got yourself a bounty hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I guess you\u2019ve got yourself one sick shifter to catch.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them, moving fast and catching her arms in a strong grip.</p><p>Aw, hell. It was just like before. The heat of his touch swept through her, waking hungers she\u2019d deliberately denied for so long.</p><p>Jude was sexual. From his knowing eyes, his curving, kiss-me lips, to the hard lines and muscles of his body.</p><p>Deep inside, in the dark, secret places of her soul that she fought to keep hidden, there was a part of her just like that.</p><p>Wild. Hot.</p><p>Sexual.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>Not the question she\u2019d expected, but one she could answer. \u201cI know what you are. What sane woman wouldn\u2019t be afraid of a man who becomes an animal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome women like a little bit of the animal in their men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d Liar.</p><p>His eyes said the same thing.</p><p>\u201cDo your job, Donovan. Catch the freak who cut up my prisoner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Bobby had been slashing his victims?\u201d</p><p>Hit. Yeah, there\u2019d been no way to miss that significance.</p><p>\u201cWhen word gets out about what really happened, some folks will say Bobby deserved what he got.\u201d His fingers pressed into her arms. Erin wore a light, silk shirt\u2014and even that seemed too hot for the humid Louisiana spring night. His touch burned through the blouse and seemed to singe her flesh.</p><p>\u201cSome will say that,\u201d she allowed. Okay, a hell of a lot would say that. \u201cBut his killer still has to be caught.\u201d Stopped, because she had the feeling this could be just the beginning.</p><p>Her feelings about death weren\u2019t often wrong.</p><p>She was a lot like her dad that way.</p><p>And, unfortunately, like her mother, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Did he deserve to be clawed to death?\u201d</p><p>An image of Bobby\u2019s ex-wife, Pat, flashed before her eyes. The doctors had put over one hundred and fifty stitches into her face. She\u2019d been his most brutal attack.</p><p>Erin swallowed. \u201cHis punishment was for the court to decide.\u201d She stepped back, but he didn\u2019t let her go. \u201cUh, do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do.\u201d His eyes glittered down at her. \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna be working together, we need honesty between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you to find the killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will. Don\u2019t worry about that. I always catch my prey.\u201d</p><p>So the rumors claimed. The hunters from Night Watch were known throughout the U.S.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shivering, Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m not.\u201d She was.</p><p>\u201cI make you nervous. I scare you.\u201d A pause. His gaze dropped to her lips, lingered, then slowly rose back to meet her stare. \u201cIs it because I know what you are?\u201d</p><p>She wanted his mouth on hers. A foolish desire. Ridiculous. Not something the controlled woman wanted, but what the wild thing inside craved. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Erin jerked free of his hold and glared at him. \u201cFew things in this world scare me. You should know that.\u201d There was one thing, one person, who terrified her but now wasn\u2019t the time for that disclosure. No, she didn\u2019t tell anyone about him.</p><p>If she could just get around Jude and march out that door\u2014</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re not scared of me, then. Maybe you\u2019re scared of yourself.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cNot human,\u201d he murmured, shaking his head. \u201cNot vamp.\u201d</p><p>Vamp? Thankfully, no.</p><p>\u201cDjinn? Nah, you don\u2019t have that look.\u201d His right hand lifted and he rubbed his chin. \u201cTell me your secrets, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, not the sharing type.\u201d She\u2019d wasted enough time here. Erin pushed past him, ignoring the press of his arm against her side. Her body ached and the whispers of hunger within her grew more demanding every moment she stayed with him.</p><p>Weak.</p><p>She hated her weakness.</p><p>Just like her mother\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shifter.\u201d His words stopped her near the door. She stared blankly at the faded wood. Heard the dull thud of her heart echoing in her ears.</p><p>Then the soft squeak of the old floorboards as he closed the distance between them.</p><p>Erin turned to him, tilted her head back\u2014</p><p>He kissed her.</p><p>She heard a growl. Not from him\u2014no, from her own throat.</p><p>The hunger.</p><p>Sure, he made the first move, he brought his lips crashing down on hers, but...she kissed him right back.</p><p>Her hands locked around his shoulders, her nails dug into his flesh. Oh, damn, but his flesh...Strong, hot.</p><p>Her mouth was open, lips parted for the thrust of his tongue. She\u2019d tried to play the good girl and walk away, but there was no denying she wanted this\u2014 wanted him.</p><p>Tongues met. Took. Tasted.</p><p>And he tasted good. Even better than the chocolate she craved in the middle of the day. Erin realized she wanted more. So much more.</p><p>She rose on her tiptoes. Widened her mouth, and this time, the growl that she heard came from him.</p><p>His hands clenched around her hips, and he jerked her even closer to him. The hard bulge of his arousal pressed against her. Long and hard and promising such fierce pleasure. She could have him, thrusting deep and hard into her, and Erin knew the ride would be fantastic. The sex great.</p><p>She could have him.</p><p>His fingers cupped her ass.</p><p>Take him. Take him.</p><p>He ripped his mouth from hers. She sucked in a sharp breath and tried to clear the lust from her mind. She needed\u2014</p><p>His mouth pressed against her neck. Right over her pulse.</p><p>Her weak spot.</p><p>His tongue laved her and her knees trembled. Then Jude bit her, a light, teasing bite.</p><p>A marking, nonetheless. She knew the way of shifters.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t stop the heat that swept through her. Erin\u2019s nipples swelled against him, her sex moistened.</p><p>Freaking animal response.</p><p>So much need.</p><p>\u201cYou want me, Erin, just as much as I want you.\u201d The words rumbled against her flesh.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t deny it. She wouldn\u2019t give in to the furious desire, either. With one serious effort, Erin made her hands stop clutching him and she pushed against his chest instead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nice chest.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>She pushed harder, letting some of her enhanced strength flex. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p> <p>His head rose and he stared down at her with eyes shining brightly. So blue it almost hurt to look into them.</p><p>\u201cShifter.\u201d He said this again, but it wasn\u2019t so much a question. Too certain. \u201cI can see it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>No, no that couldn\u2019t be possible. She always controlled her body. No claws. No glowing eyes. No too-sharp teeth. The guy was guessing, trying to trip her up.</p><p>\u201cSweet little shifter. You can\u2019t hide your beast from me.\u201d</p><p>There was no beast. \u201cLet. Me. Go.\u201d Her voice was huskier than she would have liked, but she meant the words. Being near him right then, not really an option.</p> <p>Running, yeah, that was the best option. Not because she was afraid, but\u2014</p><p>Shit, okay, she was afraid.</p><p>So there were a few things that scared her.</p><p>Jude dropped his hold.</p><p>Erin spun around and fumbled with the door. Her purse, all but forgotten, banged against her hip. Then she was outside, stumbling onto the porch and putting some much needed space between them.</p><p>Now if her heart would just slow its frantic beat.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over.\u201d His voice followed her down the steps.</p><p>\u201cDamn right.\u201d She tossed him a glare over her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find my killer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d His steps were slow and heavy on the porch. \u201cUs. We\u2019re not over. We\u2019re just getting started.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cI can still taste you.\u201d</p><p>She could taste him. And her panties were wet. Just from a kiss.</p><p>What would happen when they were both naked?</p><p>She would not find out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna happen, sweetheart. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Arrogant asshole.</p> <p>Sexy beast.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not.\u201d Some temptations had to be denied. \u201cYou deal with that. \u201d She opened her car door and climbed inside.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you hide your animal side?\u201d He raised a hand to his shoulder and ran his fingertips over the small wounds that she could see even in the dim light from the porch.</p><p>Because some of her senses were enhanced, too.</p><p>Thanks, Mother.</p><p>She\u2019d marked him. The way of the beast.</p><p>\u201cI have no animal side,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. There\u2019s an animal in you, just growling to get out.\u201d He motioned to the wild land around them. \u201cWanna shift and run with me?\u201d</p><p>Ice froze her blood. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken about me, Donovan.\u201d Flawed. Broken. \u201cThere\u2019s no animal inside for you to play with\u2014sorry.\u201d Then she slammed her door. Seconds later, she shoved the gear shift into reverse and spun out of his drive.</p><p>Some temptations had to be denied.</p><p>No matter how much pleasure they promised.</p><p>He was dreaming about her when the phone rang. A hot, sexy dream that had him aching. Erin wore two thin strips of black lace. Her eyes were shining. Her lips moist.</p><p>She wanted him.</p><p>His hands couldn\u2019t touch her enough. Couldn\u2019t enjoy the feel of that satiny skin enough and\u2014</p><p>And then the phone rang.</p><p>Jude reached for the receiver near his bed, ready to give someone a serious ass-chewing. \u201cWhat the hell do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice.</p><p>Not breathy with desire like in his fading dream. Sharper, tinged with fear.</p><p>The lady had said she didn\u2019t fear much.</p><p>Jude sat up in an instant and his fingers tightened around the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d A call in the middle of the night was never a good thing.</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Okay, she\u2019d said that in his dream, but not quite the same way.</p><p>\u201c408 St. Charles Avenue. Come as fast as you can, okay?\u201d</p><p>Click.</p><p>For one second, two, he stared down at the phone.</p><p>Then he ran for the door.</p><p>Because Erin was afraid.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any police cars in front of the old house on St. Charles. No swirling blue lights.</p><p>Jude had expected to see them, or at least some sign of trouble.</p><p>The antebellum house sat quietly, time having ravaged the once beautiful frame. Azaleas did their part to hide the house, nestling it in perfumed security from curious eyes. But the beauty of the place had faded and only a whisper of glory remained.</p><p>A fixer-upper. There were plenty of old houses like it in the city.</p><p>But only one that had his Erin inside.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze scanned the yard. His nostrils twitched. There was another scent in the air. Heavy. Drifting just under the azaleas and their sweet fragrance.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>He bounded up the steps and shoved open the door.</p><p>And slammed into Erin.</p><p>They fell to the floor in a tangle of limbs and a cloud of curses. He tried to spin to protect her from the fall\u2014and his weight\u2014but it was too late.</p><p>They hit hard.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even flinch.</p><p>Her golden eyes met his and Jude tried not to notice just how incredibly good she felt beneath him. Tried, failed.</p><p>Her breasts were crushed beneath his chest. Her thighs were spread, cradling his hips in just the, oh yeah, right way.</p><p>If the scent of blood weren\u2019t clogging up his nostrils, he sure as all hell would\u2019ve enjoyed the moment.</p><p>Later.</p><p>He levered up onto his forearms. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on, Erin?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>No. Dammit. He wanted to stay exactly where he was.</p><p>And he wanted to find out why there were shadows in her eyes.</p><p>He got up.</p><p>Erin exhaled. \u201cI\u2014this has to stay between us, okay?\u201d</p><p>Jude blinked. \u201cWhat has to stay between us?\u201d He had a real bad feeling about this situation, and much as he liked the sexy ADA and wanted to get her naked, he wasn\u2019t about to break the law for her.</p><p>Well, he wouldn\u2019t break it much for her. A little bending, he\u2019d do that.</p><p>His nostrils twitched again.</p><p>That was human blood.</p><p>Shit. Wary now, he kept a close watch on Erin as she rose to her feet. She still wore the sexy blouse from earlier. Her makeup was gone. Faint brown smudges were under her eyes.</p><p>He could all but smell the fear dripping off her.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t scare.\u201d</p><p>She gave a rough laugh at that, kind of a desperate sound. Her fingers raked through her black hair. \u201cNo, hunter, I said there wasn\u2019t much that scares me. He does.\u201d</p><p>Jude tensed. \u201cSomeone else is here?\u201d He didn\u2019t smell him. Just that thick blood, coating every breath he took.</p><p>The animal inside loved the scent of blood. It was a response Jude couldn\u2019t control. Primal.</p><p>Like the response he felt for Erin.</p><p>But the man knew the coppery scent was bad. Trouble.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s...gone.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s hands fisted. His gaze swept the room. Caught sight of the old staircase, twisting up to the next level. To the left, he saw the gleaming wooden floors and the oversized doors that led out of the parlor. Doors that were firmly shut.</p><p>\u201cI-I went back to the police station after I left your place. I needed to talk to Antonio and find out what the ME had to say about Burrows.\u201d The words came out fast. \u201cI was tired when I got back and didn\u2019t even notice the smell until\u2014\u201d Her gaze darted to the left, to the white doors.</p><p>He crossed the room, body alert. His fingers curled over the old door knobs\u2014two doors, French style. He wrenched them open, ready for any threat.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>The lights were on in the other room. Bright and stark. Shining perfectly on the bloody message that had been left on the far wall.</p><p>Missed you.</p><p>The blood had trickled down, blurring some of the letters a bit, but the message was clear.</p><p>What the fuck? His growl filled the room.</p><p>This shit was twisted. \u201cYou searched the house?\u201d Sprawling places like this one had too many rooms and far too many places for someone to hide.</p><p>With his nose...no one would hide from him.</p><p>He spun around, ready to stalk from top to bottom and\u2014</p><p>She caught his arm. \u201cI told you, no one else is here.\u201d Plump lips tightened. \u201cThe bastard delivered his message and ran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome message.\u201d Not every day a woman got a love letter in blood.</p><p>Her fingers tightened around him. \u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need the cops. What the hell? You\u2019ve got some psycho ex-lover stalking you\u2014\u201d With freaking blood.</p><p>\u201cNot my lover.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNever that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall. The. Cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome jobs aren\u2019t meant for the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some are, sweetheart. You\u2019re an ADA\u2014you know this shit.\u201d She should. But he\u2019d worked with victims before, and he knew that even the professionals would forget the rules when the deadly games became personal. \u201cErin, when someone breaks into your house and leaves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Other. \u201d</p><p>He\u2019d figured that. Well, either Other or seriously fucked up human.</p><p>Seriously fucked up Other.</p><p>\u201cThe cops can still track him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can track him. The bastard\u2019s too good at hiding.\u201d She exhaled, and, for a moment, he thought he saw...calculation in her gaze.</p><p>He tensed.</p><p>Be careful with the ladies, Jude. You can\u2019t always trust a pretty face.</p><p>His grandfather\u2019s warning. Given right before his senior prom, the night Susie Jo Hill had left him on the dance floor to make out with the quarterback.</p><p>He\u2019d pounded the quarterback and come away with the scar on his lip, courtesy of a big-ass class ring and a lucky punch.</p><p>Then he\u2019d left a furious Susie Jo shouting on her doorstep.</p><p>Erin was no Susie Jo. She was something much, much more dangerous.</p><p>Her hand fell away from him and damn if he didn\u2019t miss her touch.</p><p>Not. Good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a stalker, Jude. A guy who has been trailing me and making my life hell for the last year.\u201d Her eyes held his.</p><p>A stab of pain in his palms made him realize that his claws were out. He unfisted his hands and the claws sprang to their full length.</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t so much as blink.</p><p>\u201cI came here to get away from him,\u201d she said. Her shoulders were straight, her chin up, but she still looked vulnerable.</p><p>And that made him want to roar with fury.</p><p>\u201cHe scares me. I\u2019ve caught his scent before. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s come inside my home. He\u2019s a shifter, I know that much.\u201d</p><p>A shifter. Like me.</p><p>No wonder the lady hadn\u2019t been so wild about gettin\u2019 down and dirty with him.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know where he got the blood.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder at the painted wall and shuddered. \u201cWhat if he hurt someone? What if...\u201d</p><p>Oh, the odds were good that he had. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring Antonio in on this.\u201d That much blood, yeah, someone had been hurt. \u201cIt\u2019s human blood.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted back to his. \u201cI know.\u201d Whispered. And she looked like she was going to be sick right then. Her hand rose to her mouth and she paled.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, sending silky locks tossing back and forth. After a moment, her hand dropped. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s giving me a present, don\u2019t you see? A gift. But I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not like him.\u201d You. Her eyes said it, even if her mouth didn\u2019t. \u201cThe blood sickens me.\u201d</p><p>A human reaction.</p><p>But he could have sworn she was a shifter.</p><p>No, no, dammit, he knew she was a shifter. The beast inside recognized her.</p><p>But shifters loved blood.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand the smell,\u201d she whispered and stormed back into the parlor. \u201cI hate it.\u201d</p><p>Pretty unusual shifter reaction.</p><p>He followed her, closing the doors with a quiet squeak. He needed to get a blood analyst in there, right away. Because he was getting a really dark, sick suspicion.</p><p>Human blood.</p><p>Who\u2019d bled out so nicely less than twelve hours before?</p><p>Burrows.</p><p>Antonio had taken Jude back to the crime scene at the station, after Erin had hightailed it to the DA\u2019s office.</p><p>He\u2019d seen Burrows. Seen the pooled blood on the floor.</p><p>But maybe, just maybe, some of that dark blood had left the holding area.</p><p>Judging by the way the letters had dripped on the wall, the killer would have needed to come straight to Erin\u2019s house after the murder. The blood must have been used when it was fresh.</p><p>The Slasher\u2019s blood?</p><p>Possible.</p><p>Not likely, of course. Could be from some other poor bastard. Then they\u2019d have two sick shifters on the loose.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t discount the connection. This whole mess was too screwed up. And it set his teeth on edge.</p><p>The stalker bastard had frightened Erin, had been frightening her. Not an acceptable situation.</p><p>The guy had broken into her house. He could have so easily gotten to her\u2014 hurt her.</p><p>Jude\u2019s teeth began to burn and lengthen. The claws were already out, time for the fangs.</p><p>And time to rip a shifter asshole apart.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>At least the police had come quietly. No screaming sirens. No flashing lights. Just two silent black vans. One patrol car. And Antonio, in a red sports car.</p><p>Flashy.</p><p>Figured.</p><p>Erin paced the length of her porch as she watched the crime scene team file into her house. The night was hot, humid as all hell, but goosebumps covered her arms.</p><p>Missed you.</p><p>Dammit. She\u2019d flushed her old life down the toilet for some freedom, but he\u2019d found her.</p><p>Now he was back to playing his sickass games with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d A hard bark of fury. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She raised a brow and turned to find Antonio glaring at her, the lights of the porch shining behind him. His hands were crossed over his chest, his eyes narrowed. He shook his head. \u201cYou called in a civilian before you called the cops\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the same civilian you called earlier, too,\u201d she reminded him. There hadn\u2019t been a lot of options for her. With the creep on her tail, there never were. Back when she\u2019d lived in Lillian, there sure as hell hadn\u2019t been a choice. As far as she\u2019d known, the police hadn\u2019t known about the Other.</p><p>So they certainly wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle a supernatural who\u2019d slipped over the line and gone straight psychotic.</p> <p>\u201cThis is different! This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life,\u201d she fired back at him. \u201cI know this isn\u2019t protocol, okay, but this isn\u2019t your average situation.\u201d Her voice lowered to a hard whisper, \u201cNot average at all.\u201d</p><p>A grunt. \u201cTrust me, blood on the walls is never average.\u201d</p><p>True. Erin sucked in a breath and tried to push her fear and anger aside. Antonio was catching the brunt of her fury, but the guy had already done her a favor by pulling in his team so softly.</p><p>The porch boards groaned as he stepped forward. \u201cHow long has this guy been after you?\u201d</p> <p>She swallowed. \u201cA year.\u201d Maybe longer. Hard to say. She\u2019d gotten her first \u201cgift\u201d almost twelve months before. But she\u2019d read up on stalkers and their behavior. She knew they often watched their prey for months or even years before making a real move.</p><p>\u201cDid you think running was going to stop him?\u201d</p><p>Jude had briefed him on her situation. Well, Jude had told the cop as much as she\u2019d told the shifter. Erin hadn\u2019t revealed everything. Not yet.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped it would,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took another step toward her. The scent of his cologne filled her nostrils. The guy always wore his cologne. Not too heavy but\u2014</p> <p>Another scent. Richer. Filling the air, surrounding her.</p><p>Shifter\u2019s scent.</p><p>Erin looked to the right, just over Antonio\u2019s shoulder, and she found Jude watching her, his big frame filling her doorway.</p><p>There was something in his eyes. A heat. Anger?</p><p>Desire.</p><p>\u201cYour crew\u2019s working hard,\u201d Jude said as he stalked toward them.</p><p>Antonio stiffened just a bit, then eased away from her. \u201cThey\u2019re the best I\u2019ve got, and they all know when we need...delicacy.\u201d</p><p>So they knew about the Other? Or were they Other?</p> <p>Jude came to stand beside her, his arm brushing hers and sending some of the chill dissipating from her body. Handy talent, that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s human blood.\u201d Flat.</p><p>The cop nodded. \u201cYou\u2019d know.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he would.</p><p>\u201cThis guy has a real hard-on for our ADA.\u201d</p><p>Antonio wasn\u2019t exactly high on the tact scale. Erin lifted a brow and managed not to grind her back teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s chased you across the state,\u201d Antonio continued. \u201cThe guy isn\u2019t backing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna make him back off.\u201d The words were little more than a growl from Jude.</p><p>Antonio\u2019s dark eyes locked on the shifter. \u201cThis gettin\u2019 personal for you, man?\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t bother answering. \u201cSend patrols out, have them keep an extra watch on the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Erin gave a laugh at that, and she knew the sound held a desperate edge. \u201cA patrol car isn\u2019t going to stop this guy. He\u2019s Other, and he\u2019s damn strong.\u201d Sometimes she worried that nothing could stop him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to. Not that night, that cold night when he\u2019d caught her in her bedroom and dug his claws into her arms as he pinned her to the bed\u2014</p><p>No.</p><p>Not going back there. Never again.</p><p>\u201cTell us everything you know about him,\u201d Jude said. The crime scene unit was still inside. Gathering their evidence. Walking through her life. They couldn\u2019t hear this. Only Jude and the cop he seemed to trust.</p><p>If only she were the trusting kind. But, other than her father, she\u2019d never really trusted anyone fully before.</p><p>When you had a lot to lose, trusting was a foolish mistake. Way too easy to get burned.</p><p>\u201cNot much to say.\u201d A shrug. He found me. I tried to be so careful and he found me. \u201cHe\u2019s a shifter.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to run again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen him?\u201d From Antonio.</p><p>Careful. \u201cI-I caught his scent once.\u201d</p><p>Antonio just looked blank.</p><p>Jude\u2019s fingers snaked down her arm and the heat burned through her shirt. \u201cShifters carry a distinct scent. It marks us.\u201d</p><p>The cop sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t smell a damn thing, well...those azaleas but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way shifters recognize each other,\u201d Jude told him. \u201cLike to like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Antonio\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Erin, his jaw dropping. \u201cYou\u2019re a shifter?\u201d</p><p>Way to go, hunter. \u201cNo, I most certainly am not. \u201d Her nostrils flared. \u201cI just have very...acute senses.\u201d That part was absolutely true. It felt good to be honest right then.</p><p>His gaze raked her. \u201cYou holding out on me again, ADA Jerome?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cWhat I am or what I am not really isn\u2019t the issue here.\u201d No, the issue was the psychopath who\u2019d painted blood on her wall. \u201cWe could have a victim out there, someone who needs help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why my crime scene gang is here. They\u2019re the best.\u201d Simple. \u201cIf the bastard left behind any clues, they\u2019ll find \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Erin realized she was leaning toward Jude. What? She snapped straight back up.</p><p>She was tired, that was it. Hell of a day. Even worse of a night. So she\u2019d gotten tired and she\u2019d sagged a bit. That was okay.</p><p>But the tight feeling in her gut, the fierce urge to turn and push against him, that was not okay.</p><p>She needed to get in bed. Needed to forget the blood and the fear.</p><p>But the idea of walking into that house again...\u201cI loved this house,\u201d she muttered, shoving back the hair that had fallen over the side of her face. There had been no ghosts in this house.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Antonio frowned at her and after a moment of silence, he said, \u201cSo you\u2019ve never seen the guy.\u201d Ah, trying delicacy now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t give you a description. Sorry. I wish that I could.\u201d Her shoulders lifted then fell. \u201cMale, big, strong.\u201d She\u2019d caught that much in the darkness. \u201cBut I can\u2019t tell you a single thing about his face.\u201d Not much help at all.</p><p>\u201cYou got all that from a scent?\u201d Antonio scratched his chin. \u201cOne fine nose you got there, lady.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. Maybe the guy didn\u2019t know as much about the Other world as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>One of the crime scene techs walked out. She had four evidence bags in her hands. Antonio waited for her to pass them, then he leaned forward and said, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need protection.\u201d</p><p>She was stronger than any human he\u2019d send to protect her.</p><p>A human wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to help her this time. She needed\u2014</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got protection.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s words had her head jerking toward him. She stared into his eyes. So deep and wild. \u201cShe\u2019s got protection,\u201d he repeated, the words fierce.</p><p>Protection...but at what price?</p><p>She could sure use his power and strength, but\u2014</p><p>But Jude was a danger to her, too. Every moment she spent with him, Erin could feel the thing inside her tensing.</p><p>Hungering.</p><p>Like to like.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that always the damn way?</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should think about moving to a hotel room for the night. The team\u2019s gonna be here for a long while longer,\u201d</p><p>Antonio said.</p><p>\u201cI-I will.\u201d Great idea. The sooner she got out of there, the better.</p><p>Missed you.</p><p>Dammit. No.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let him do this to her. Not again.</p><p>The hotel room was small. The air conditioner buzzed with a steady whir of sound, and the bed, a queen that looked like a double, waited with perfectly smooth covers.</p><p>Jude scanned the room, hands on his hips. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay here. You can come to my place and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine here,\u201d Erin said, her voice smooth as silk. No more fear. No worry. No anger.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>The lady had frozen on him. Jude didn\u2019t like that. Not one bit.</p><p>She tossed a small overnight bag onto the foot of the bed. \u201cThanks for bringing me over, but it really wasn\u2019t necessary. I could have driven myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to bring you.\u201d He\u2019d wanted to make certain she was safe.</p><p>Blood on her walls. What kind of sick freak was after her?</p><p>And why was she so calm now? His fingers clenched. \u201cTony will send a unit around here, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing else is going to happen tonight.\u201d She kicked off her heels. Suddenly became two inches shorter.</p><p>The lady had nice feet. Red toenails. Kinda pretty.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way this guy works.\u201d</p><p>She would know.</p><p>Erin lifted her hands above her head as she stretched and he really tried\u2014 for about three seconds anyway\u2014 not to look at her chest. But her breasts stretched the front of the blouse and those buttons looked like they might pop at any moment.</p><p>Get a grip. The lust was gonna have to take a backseat for the time being.</p><p>Romeo from hell was stalking her. She didn\u2019t need him jumping her then, too.</p><p>Her hair brushed over her shoulders. Such a dark, thick curtain.</p><p>Focus. \u201cI can...stay here.\u201d Hell, yeah. \u201cUm, to keep an eye out in case\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her arms dropped and the stretching show ended. \u201cNot necessary.\u201d Clipped. She marched toward him, eyes glinting.</p><p>\u201cLook, hunter, I appreciate all of your help.\u201d Her steps halted, a foot away from him. Her head tilted up, just a bit. \u201cI-I know I shouldn\u2019t have called you. I don\u2019t know why I did.\u201d</p><p>He knew. Jude caught her hands, closing that space between them. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d Oh, yeah, she felt the connection, exactly like he did. The hard hunger. The need.</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>Jude wanted those lips. Wanted the soft body that pressed against him. The bed was so close. He could ruin those perfect covers real fast.</p><p>He took a breath, tasted her, and said, bluntly, \u201cYou need me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Jude watched the flare of her golden eyes. Flecks of emerald circled her pupils. So beautiful. He knew the protest was coming even before she sputtered, \u201cLook, you\u2014You might think you\u2019re God\u2019s gift to the ladies, but I don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot talking about sex right now.\u201d That would come, later. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a shifter on your tail, and as good as Tony and his team members are, I\u2019m better.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth snapped closed. No argument, because she knew he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you called me.\u201d Her breasts pushed against his chest, the nipples pebbled. He\u2019d always been a breast man, and the lady had some fine breasts.</p><p>But business came first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the best hunter in the area. You called me, before you called the cops, because you wanted my help.\u201d</p><p>Still no denial.</p><p>\u201cYou want this guy stopped? Let me handle him.\u201d</p><p>Secrets were in her eyes. Fair enough, he had his own hard stories to keep, too.</p><p>\u201cYou really think you can catch him?\u201d Erin asked quietly.</p><p>A shrug. \u201cI\u2019m your best bet.\u201d He believed that, one hundred percent.</p><p>\u201cWhat will I...\u201d Her gaze dropped even as her hands rose to push against his chest. Small hands with red nails to match her toes. \u201cWhat will I have to pay for your services?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, not until that stare of hers rose slowly once more. And he didn\u2019t back away from her either. \u201cOne hell of a lot,\u201d Jude told her and enjoyed the widening of her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>Then he kissed her because he had to taste her. Her lips were parted and he drove his tongue deep.</p><p>Damn but she was sweet. He\u2019d been a sucker for sweets as long as he could remember.</p><p>She didn\u2019t fight him. Didn\u2019t dig her nails into his chest or twist her head away. No, her tongue swiped against his and she gave a little rumble in her throat, a cross between a growl and a moan\u2014and then he just stopped thinking.</p><p>And started feeling.</p><p>Lush female curves. Soft skin. Lips. Tongue.</p><p>His hands snaked down her spine, caught her hips\u2014squeezed.</p><p>Nice ass.</p><p>His cock rose toward her, swelling and hungering.</p><p>Her scent teased him. Those roses...and woman. The rich scent of her need, a fragrance that only made his arousal stronger.</p><p>And...something more. Earthier. Subtle, simmering just below the surface, but something familiar in the air.</p><p>Her hands shoved against his chest and Jude stumbled back.</p><p>Forgot the punch the lady packed.</p><p>Her lips, red and wet, tightened. \u201cIs sex with me part of the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her truthfully. \u201cIt\u2019s a bonus.\u201d</p><p>Jude knew he\u2019d said the wrong thing even as Erin sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cListen, shifter\u2014\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands and tried to ignore the hard-on that stretched the front of his jeans. \u201cEasy. What I meant\u201d\u2014okay, so he\u2019d never been real good with women and words\u2014\u201cwas that the case and us\u2014they\u2019re separate.\u201d</p><p>But he did plan on moving into her house, if not her bed, right away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d be the most vulnerable at night. During the day, she\u2019d be surrounded by lawyers and cops. Sharks and the police\u2014they had to keep her pretty safe. But at night, when she went back to that big old house all by herself, she\u2019d be a target.</p><p>Jude would make sure she wasn\u2019t alone. Not until the freak was caught.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so cocky.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou really think you can get any woman you want?\u201d</p> <p>He lifted a shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t want any woman.\u201d Just you. The need had been like a fist in the gut and a stroke to the groin from that first moment.</p><p>Like to like.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>He\u2019d heard about some shifter couples who were combustible in the sack. With sex and shifters, the human rules were ripped away and only the basic needs of the animals remained.</p><p>And the animals sure had a lot of needs.</p> <p>But Erin claimed she wasn\u2019t like him.</p><p>A good liar, his Erin. Just not good enough.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI can\u2019t deal with this now, Jude.\u201d</p><p>Hmmm. He liked the way she said his name. Soft. Husky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead on my feet and I just\u2014I can\u2019t deal with this,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Can\u2019t deal with you.</p> <p>Fair enough. The lady had been through one wild night. She needed to rest, and he wasn\u2019t a jerk enough to deny her.</p><p>Tomorrow would be soon enough to get their partnership started.</p><p>\u201cLock the door behind me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Her eyes lifted toward the ceiling. \u201cYeah, because I was just gonna leave it open so every creep in the city could sneak in.\u201d</p><p>Smart-ass. He liked that. Even rundown, she still had spirit.</p><p>A tough lady.</p><p>She\u2019d have to be, in order to face what was coming.</p><p>He\u2019d seen his share of psychopaths while working with Night Watch. The agency had earned its reputation for going after the scum of the earth for a reason.</p> <p>They hunted those criminals that others wouldn\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t.</p><p>So he\u2019d seen freaks, come upon scenes that had caused bile to rise in his throat and sweat to bead his upper lip.</p><p>The beast within had roared at the carnage, but the man had leashed him and gotten the job done.</p><p>Shadows lingered under her eyes. The woman was all but swaying on her feet. \u201cGet in bed.\u201d Next time, with me. \u201cI\u2019ll see you first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He brushed by her, locking his eyes on the door. Don\u2019t look back. The woman will make you weak.</p><p>With the freak shifter on the loose, he couldn\u2019t afford to be weak.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The whisper froze him at the door. Then, dammit, he looked back.</p><p>\u201cI owe you, Donovan.\u201d Back to Donovan, huh? \u201cI won\u2019t forget that you came for me.\u201d She rocked on her heels. \u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone ever coming to my side so quickly.\u201d</p><p>Leave or toss her on the bed. Jude sucked in a desperate gulp of air. The lady had no idea what she was doing to him.</p><p>That husky voice. Those deep eyes.</p><p>That scent.</p><p>Had the other men in her life been worthless idiots?</p><p>Nothing could have stopped him from getting to her side.</p><p>His head jerked in what he hoped was a nod. He yanked the door open. \u201cSee you...in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed closed behind him. He waited a minute, two, then heard the snick of the deadbolt being thrown.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Jude took the steps three at a time and was down in the lobby, leaning over the registration desk, in less than a minute\u2019s time. He slapped his hand on the counter, letting the twenties peak through his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cGive me the room that connects to the lady\u2019s.\u201d No way was he leaving her alone. Jude planned to be close enough to hear even the whisper of fear from her.</p><p>The clerk, a teen with a bad case of acne on the left side of his face, eyed the money with a narrowed gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re not some kind of perv...are ya?\u201d</p><p>Jude growled.</p><p>The kid hopped back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend. We\u2019re having a fight.\u201d He smiled, showing teeth he knew to be a bit too sharp. \u201cIt\u2019ll be over long before dawn, so just give me the damn key. \u201d</p><p>His fingers shaking, the kid tossed him the key.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jude caught the key card in his left fist. His right hand lifted, revealing the money. \u201cThe extra forty is for you. If anyone comes around sniffing after my lady, you let me know ASAP, got it?\u201d</p><p>The money disappeared in a blink. \u201cUh, got...it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>The room card bit into his palm, and Jude forced himself to ease the grip.</p><p>Just to make sure the place was clear, he scanned the lobby. Then, satisfied, he headed back upstairs.</p><p>The hunt would start tomorrow.</p><p>The beast inside jerked against his leash.</p><p>Tomorrow.</p><p>Jude woke, his heart racing and his eyelids flying open.</p><p>He strained, struggling to hear. What had woken him?</p><p>A whimper. Muffled.</p><p>He jumped out of bed and lunged across the room. One yank and the lock on the connecting door broke. \u201cErin!\u201d</p><p>She screamed and sat up, her eyes wide open.</p><p>Alone. His heart was about to burst from his chest. \u201cSweetheart, you scared the hell out of\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flew at him, snarling, hands out, claws extended.</p><p>Swearing, he stumbled back, but not before those claws raked a trail of fire across his chest.</p><p>Not a shifter, my ass. \u201cErin!\u201d He grabbed her. No choice. Self-preservation instincts were strong in him. His fingers locked tight around her wrists and he jerked her arms down. \u201cCalm\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke his hold. In about half a second.</p><p>She. Broke. His. Hold.</p><p>And came at him again with those razor sharp claws shooting from her fingertips.</p><p>He snarled and she froze.</p><p>Then she blinked and shook her head. \u201cJude?\u201d Her claws retracted. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He saw the flare of her nostrils. She\u2019d left a lamp on near the bathroom, and the light spilled in a soft circle, giving him a perfect view of her. Even without that light, he would have been able to see.</p><p>\u201cYour chest!\u201d Horror broke across her face. Her gaze dropped to her hands. She turned them over, staring at her palms, her fingertips. Looking like she\u2019d never seen the things before.</p><p>\u201cI heard you cry out,\u201d he said, pushing his right hand against the throbbing wound. He\u2019d had a hell of a lot worse before.</p><p>No big deal, but\u2014</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t expected such a fierce attack from her. \u201cThought you might need me.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders dropped. \u201cI-I don\u2019t remember. I guess I was...dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to be one hell of a dream.\u201d The scent of his blood seemed too thick in the air.</p><p>\u201cI...guess so.\u201d She reached for him and Jude held his ground. Erin bit her lip. \u201cI should wash this, bandage you.\u201d She caught his arm and led him to the bathroom.</p><p>He could have stopped her. Told her it was just a flesh wound and that even without shifting, it would be gone by dawn.</p><p>But he liked the way her hands felt against him.</p><p>He\u2019d ditched his shirt before he\u2019d crashed in the bed. Kept his jeans on, just in case.</p><p>Good thing he\u2019d had the denim on. He\u2019d have to make sure he kept her claws away from that part of his anatomy.</p><p>The bathroom was the size of a closet, a miniscule one. After flipping on the lights, Erin turned from him and wrenched on the water. She snagged a cloth, held it under the flow of water, soaped it up, and then eased it across his bare chest.</p><p>The lady didn\u2019t meet his gaze. Just kept one small hand over his heart while the other swiped the cloth over the five long claw marks.</p><p>No denying what they were.</p><p>She turned from him, her hip and shoulder brushing against him as she rinsed the blood from the cloth.</p><p>\u201cWant to talk about it?\u201d He inched closer, the better to trap her against the sink.</p><p>Erin\u2019s face was pale. \u201cI have occasional night terrors, okay? Had \u2019em for years, even before the creep got attached to me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pressed together. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>His hands rose slowly and curled over her shoulders. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to talk about the dream, then how about you try telling me one more time that you aren\u2019t like me. Because I know a shifter\u2019s claws when I see them.\u201d And feel them.</p><p>Her gaze held his in the mirror. Her hair was a dark curtain around her face, and despite her height, she still looked fragile, delicate, against him.</p><p>Looks could be so deceiving.</p><p>\u201cHaving claws...doesn\u2019t make me a shifter.\u201d Her chin lifted and color finally began to drift back into her cheeks. \u201cAny number of Other have claws.\u201d</p><p>True enough. His head lowered over her shoulder. She\u2019d finally ditched her business clothes and slipped on a loose pair of pajama pants and a white top. The neckline was low and scooped, showing off that perfect cleavage.</p><p>Jude bent over her. Really, he was in the best position. That sweet ass before him. Her neck, all but bared so close to his mouth.</p><p>A faint tremble shook her.</p><p>He lowered his head, setting his mouth right over her throat. Just an inch separated him from that sweet flesh.</p><p>Vamps weren\u2019t the only ones who liked to bite.</p><p>\u201cJude...\u201d</p><p>His lips closed over her skin. Kissed. Sucked. Her head fell back, exposing even more of that tempting flesh.</p><p>His mouth eased over her. Found that sweet spot where neck and shoulder met. A favorite for his kind.</p><p>His fangs burned.</p><p>He bit her.</p><p>Not too hard. Not a marking.</p><p>Just a taste.</p><p>That firm ass rocked back against him as she moaned.</p><p>His heart thudded, the drumming filling his ears. The dream\u2014night terror, whatever the hell it had been\u2014was gone.</p><p>Now it was just the two of them. He was ready, more than ready, his cock hard and thick with lust, and she wanted him, he knew that.</p><p>Erin lunged forward, her palms slapping against the counter. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His teeth snapped together as he fought to rein in his hunger.</p><p>Her hair fell over her face, shielding her from his view. Erin\u2019s shoulders heaved as she pulled in several deep breaths.</p><p>Jude glanced toward the shower and thought about hopping in, then cranking on the ice cold water.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not what you think,\u201d she whispered, still with her head down.</p><p>Not gonna have that. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Guttural. The need was too stark for anything else.</p><p>Her head lifted and the coal black strands slid back. Her eyes held his in the mirror.</p><p>She said, \u201cI-I\u2019ve got shifter blood.\u201d</p><p>No doubt.</p><p>Her head moved to the left, then right. \u201cBut I can\u2019t shift. I can\u2019t.\u201d Anger, no, fury in her voice.</p><p>Well, hell.</p><p>He\u2019d heard of a few others like her. Hybrids. From the matings of shifters and humans. Or shifters and charmers or even demons. Some hybrids came out even stronger than the purebloods. The strength of both parents, the weaknesses of neither.</p><p>But then there were tales of other hybrids...</p><p>Those who got the weaknesses, but not the strengths.</p><p>No, I\u2019ve felt her strength. Erin sure as shit isn\u2019t weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...flawed, okay? The beast in me\u2014hell, she may as well be dead.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, grabbed her hands and trapped them against the countertop. \u201cShe\u2019s not dead.\u201d Erin felt so good against him.</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he ordered. Across the top of the counter, etched in deep, were claw marks. Just like the ones on his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a beast all right, sweetheart. And whether you can shift to let her play or not, doesn\u2019t make a bit of difference.\u201d He turned his head, rubbed his nose against her throat.</p><p>Some cats really were all alike.</p><p>\u201cI want you, and I don\u2019t fucking care what you are\u2014or what you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Then, before the last of his control splintered, he shoved away from her.</p><p>Erin twisted, staring up at him with those eyes that he knew could easily see right through him. In too deep.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re fucking not flawed. \u201d</p><p>He stormed for the connecting door. So the lock was broken. He needed space right then. Or else he was gonna pounce on her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, hunter.\u201d She\u2019d followed him from the bathroom. Her voice sounded hollow and when he looked back, her face could have been a blank mask. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cAnd trust me, you\u2019re better off that way.\u201d</p><p>Jude had left her. Good. She didn\u2019t need things to get sexual between them. It would just make the situation worse.</p><p>Like it could really get much worse.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand. When she\u2019d told the guy she was flawed, she hadn\u2019t been talking about her inability to shift. No, she\u2019d always thought not shifting was a blessing.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d A whisper directed at the closed white door.</p><p>No one did.</p><p>Well, just one person...the bastard who\u2019d left her the bloody love letter. He knew too well what she was like on the inside.</p><p>That knowledge was why he was after her.</p><p>Damn him.</p><p>Flawed.</p><p>Broken.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a new case.\u201d Jude kicked the conference room door closed and eyed the man who\u2019d first recruited him.</p><p>Jason Pak. Half-Korean, half-Choctaw\u2014and one hundred percent charmer. A tough asshole, one who liked to wear three piece suits and go gator hunting on the weekend.</p><p>Well, not so much hunting, since his gift allowed him to talk with the gators.</p><p>Pak lifted a brow. The guy was pushing fifty, maybe sixty, but there wasn\u2019t a single line on his face. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the situation with Bobby Burrows. I talked to the ADA myself last night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot just about Burrows.\u201d Jude had come to Jason right away, because he wanted the backup of the agency. \u201cIt\u2019s about Erin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur ADA is much more than she seems.\u201d Pak eased back in his chair, steepling his fingers beneath his chin. \u201cIsn\u2019t she, Jude?\u201d</p><p>No shifter senses, but Pak always seemed to know everything about the Other.</p> <p>\u201cGus is sure she\u2019s not demon, and I don\u2019t take her for a witch.\u201d Pak\u2019s black stare didn\u2019t leave Jude\u2019s face. \u201cYou stayed with her in a hotel last night. Does that mean she\u2019s one of yours?\u201d</p><p>Mine. If only. \u201cIt means she\u2019s my client.\u201d</p><p>Pak didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got an asshole stalking her. He\u2019s Other. Last night, he left a bloody message on her wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>Of course he did. \u201cShe needs protection, the kind of protection the cops can\u2019t give her.\u201d</p><p>A slow nod. \u201cBut we can.\u201d</p><p>Damn straight. \u201cI want this guy.\u201d Well, mostly he just wanted to kill him. \u201cGive me Daniels and Wynter.\u201d They were the best, well, after him.</p><p>As far as Jude knew, Pak was Night Watch. The agency was his baby. If there were superiors to him, Jude had never seen them or caught even a whisper of their names. So if he was going to pull in the other two agents, he\u2019d need Pak\u2019s go-ahead.</p><p>And if he didn\u2019t get permission\u2014screw it. He\u2019d find another way to protect Erin and to nab the bastard.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Pak\u2019s long, bony fingers reached for the phone. The speaker clicked on and he ordered, \u201cSend in Dee and Zane.\u201d</p> <p>Yes.</p><p>Normally, Jude hunted alone. He liked it that way. But this time, he wanted extra eyes. Not eyes for his own back, but for Erin. The better to keep her safe.</p><p>Pak rose from the chair. Straightened his jacket. \u201cCareful, shifter. If you let the case get personal, you could find yourself in dangerous waters.\u201d</p><p>Too late. He watched silently as Pak left the room. When the door shut, he muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s already personal.\u201d</p><p>One beat of time. Two, then...</p><p>The door shoved open. Dee came in first, her small body moving fast. \u201cHey, Jude! What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Zane strolled in after her. The guy always seemed to take things at a stroll. When the door shut behind him, he lifted a brow and just...waited.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze drifted between them, the two agents he trusted the most at Night Watch.</p> <p>Dee. Ms. Sandra Dee Daniels. But if any fool made the mistake of calling her Sandra Dee, she kicked his ass.</p><p>Dee was small but deadly. She could track a man across three states and barely break a sweat.</p><p>And Zane Wynter. Tall and lean, the guy knew how to hunt and how to catch prey. Dark hair, green eyes\u2014a lie that, because Jude knew the cagey bastard really had demon black eyes\u2014and a knack for tagging supernatural killers. The guy loved playing on the dark side and playing with his prey.</p><p>Dee stared, one golden brow arched. \u201cThis got anything to do with all the action that went down at the ADA\u2019s place last night?\u201d</p><p>Now, with Pak, Jude never knew where the guy got his info. But with Dee, he knew the source. Tony told that woman too much. Jude was about twenty percent sure the two of them had been lovers at one time.</p><p>\u201cThe ADA?\u201d Zane stretched slowly, the floor creaking beneath him. \u201cWhat\u2019s Prichard doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him.\u201d Dee sighed. \u201cThe new woman\u2014Jude\u2019s lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mine.\u201d Yet.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Zane\u2019s lips curved down. \u201cShe human?\u201d</p><p>Generally Zane\u2019s first question on every case. The guy preferred to hunt Other, and he had a real deadly hunger for the demons who\u2019d crossed the line.</p><p>The guy liked to kill his own. Whatever. Not Jude\u2019s issue.</p><p>Erin was his issue. \u201cThe fuckup who is after her isn\u2019t.\u201d Missed you.</p><p>Zane\u2019s gaze snapped to him. Now he\u2019d gotten the demon\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cJust what went down there last night?\u201d Dee asked, rubbing a hand over the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cErin\u2019s got a stalker. Some asshole who has been trailing her for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy tracked her to a new town?\u201d Zane whistled. \u201cPersistent, I\u2019ll give him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychotic,\u201d Jude fired back. \u201cI\u2019ll give him that. \u201d He tossed the file he\u2019d been compiling onto the conference table. \u201cCrime scene photos from last night. The guy broke in, wrote a message on her wall\u2014in blood.\u201d</p><p>Dee rifled through the folder and picked out the image of the words MISSED YOU. \u201cAnimal blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened around the photo. \u201cThis asshole a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s one weakness\u2014she let the vamp cases get to her, every time. One day, that could come back to bite her in the ass.</p><p>\u201cNo, a shifter.\u201d He rubbed his thumb across the scar on his lip. After a moment, he dropped his hand and said, \u201cLeast that\u2019s what Erin thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seen him?\u201d Zane jumped on that.</p><p>Now Jude hesitated. \u201cThe lady says no, but...\u201d But he didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t trust her, either.</p><p>You don\u2019t know me.</p><p>Could be there was a lot more to this game than he realized. \u201cLet\u2019s go carefully on this one, okay?\u201d These two knew the score, and they understood what he was saying and what he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you want to start?\u201d Dee asked.</p><p>\u201cWith Erin.\u201d Because everything was about her. \u201cWe need to dig into her past\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tear her life apart.\u201d From Zane. Never one for tact.</p><p>But he was right. \u201cYeah. Yeah, we do, but only her past life.\u201d The lady had worked hard for a new start, and he didn\u2019t want her secrets spread. \u201cDon\u2019t talk with anyone she works with yet. Let\u2019s just find out everything we can about Erin before she came to Baton Rouge.\u201d</p><p>Flawed.</p><p>He\u2019d find out exactly what she\u2019d meant by that.</p><p>And he\u2019d stop the asshole on her trail, too.</p><p>\u201cBail is set for the defendant at two hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Honor!\u201d Erin jumped to her feet. Two hundred grand? That was spare change to Lorenzo Coleman. Why not just give the guy a ticket out of town? \u201cThe defendant is a flight risk!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pillar of the community,\u201d Lee Givens, the snake of a defense attorney fired, on his feet now, too. \u201cDespite the ADA\u2019s attempt to slander my client, there is barely any evidence\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough for an indictment, \u201d she snapped. When it came to drugs in Baton Rouge, good old Lorenzo was a definite leader. The guy had been running his operation for years, but the vice cops had finally gotten lucky and busted his ass when there had been a shit load of cocaine stocked in the back of his office.</p><p>And the judge wanted to let him out with a two hundred grand bail?</p><p>First Burrows, now this guy. Were the judges insane? She\u2019d had one judge almost this bad back in Lillian. Judge Lance Harper. The guy had been a nightmare for her in the courtroom. Every time she\u2019d been forced to appear before him, her stomach had knotted with dread because she knew the guy would do something crazy.</p><p>\u201cAn indictment, yeah, but not enough for a conviction!\u201d Lee\u2019s face flushed. \u201cMy client will walk on this, he will\u2014\u201d</p><p>The gavel slammed down. \u201cEnough!\u201d Judge Julia Went pointed the gavel at the defendant. \u201cSurrender your passport, Mr.</p><p>Coleman.\u201d</p><p>Better than nothing, but...\u201cYour Honor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBail is set at two hundred thousand.\u201d Another hit of that gavel. \u201cWe\u2019re done here, Ms. Jerome.\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Erin gave a hard nod and tried to ignore the throbbing in her temples. She\u2019d been in court for most of the morning, and with all the hell that had happened last night, she hadn\u2019t gotten much sleep.</p><p>Dead on her feet\u2014yeah, that old term fit right then.</p><p>She grabbed her briefcase and shoved her files and notes inside. She\u2019d snag lunch from one of the vendors outside, then call Jude and see what he\u2019d found out about the blood at her house.</p><p>With one hand, she pushed open the courtroom doors. A quick nod to the guard outside and then\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy are you chewing my ass, Jerome?\u201d</p><p>Givens.</p><p>She looked heavenward, but didn\u2019t find inspiration. Just a cracked ceiling.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to push this case so hard. Lorenzo is a good man, established in the community, with a family, a wife, two sons\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin marched past him.</p><p>He followed.</p><p>She stabbed the elevator button and spared him a glance. \u201cHe\u2019s a drug dealer.\u201d</p><p>Givens smiled. An oily, used car salesman kind of smile. \u201cJust because drugs were found on the premises doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a dealer...or that those drugs were even his.\u201d His southern drawl was smooth as honey. He swept back his light brown hair and gazed at her with his falsely sincere blue eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s a victim, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to listen to this bull right now.\u201d Another case waited, and she still had to check in for a report on the Burrows killing.</p><p>The elevator doors slid open. A rush of people pushed by her, then Erin hurried inside.</p><p>The doors began to close. Bye, Givens.</p><p>He flung out his hand and had the doors easing back. \u201cYou\u2019re new in town, Erin. Don\u2019t go making too many enemies, too quickly.\u201d</p><p>Her brows lifted. \u201cThat a threat?\u201d Her voice dripped ice. Lee Givens was an attractive guy, with one of those clean-cut faces that juries loved.</p><p>She had the feeling that inside, he could be a real snake.</p><p>She\u2019d always hated snakes. Back home in Lillian, she\u2019d cut the head off more than her fair share with a handy shovel.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His hand didn\u2019t move. \u201cJust some friendly advice.\u201d He smiled at her.</p><p>Used car salesman.</p><p>No, she\u2019d met some really nice used car salesmen in her time.</p><p>Snake.</p><p>Another woman stepped into the elevator. She glanced at Givens. \u201cGoing down?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and finally removed his hand. \u201cSee you soon, ADA.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, he would.</p><p>Fucking bastard.</p><p>Rage filled him as he watched the men and women in suits drift by.</p><p>He\u2019d seen the way the lawyer looked at Erin. Greedy eyes. Knowing smile.</p><p>Fucking. Bastard.</p><p>Defending that piece of crap drug dealer. Standing all high and mighty in the courtroom like he was doing something special by being in front of the judge.</p><p>Like he was something special.</p><p>Then the guy had followed Erin. Whispered to her.</p><p>He\u2019d caught a glimpse of Erin\u2019s face. Seen the barely restrained anger. He knew his Erin well. She\u2019d wanted to go after the dumb dick, claws out and teeth snapping, but she\u2019d held back.</p><p>Because she knows I\u2019m here and I\u2019ll take care of things for her.</p><p>He loved to make his Erin happy.</p><p>Loved to see her smile...and the hint of her deceptively delicate fangs.</p><p>Finally. Home.</p><p>A yellow line of police tape barred her door, but Antonio had called Erin right before she left the office and said the place had the all clear.</p><p>Erin stared at the tape. She wanted nothing more than to go inside, kick off her shoes and fall into bed.</p><p>Little problem, though. Going inside meant she\u2019d have to see the blood.</p><p>Cleanup was not really part of the cops\u2019 usual routine.</p><p>So she\u2019d be the scrubber who got to remove the dry blood from her wall.</p><p>And she\u2019d have to stay in the house, knowing he\u2019d been there. Maybe another night in the hotel wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cGonna stand out here all night, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s voice. That deep voice packed a powerful sensual punch, one that had her yearning for things best forgotten right then.</p><p>\u201cI was strongly considering it,\u201d she murmured, not glancing back at him. Her track record with the opposite sex wasn\u2019t so great.</p><p>Gravel crunched beneath his shoes. She\u2019d known he was there, of course. She\u2019d caught his scent on the wind.</p><p>He brushed by her and vaulted to her porch. His fingers curled around the tape and ripped it down with one tug. \u201cNo sense staying out here in the dark.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always rather liked the dark. \u201cWhere\u2019s your truck?\u201d She hadn\u2019t seen it on the street.</p><p>His lips hitched into a half-smile, stretching that scar. Shouldn\u2019t have been sexy. Really shouldn\u2019t. \u201cSomewhere it can\u2019t be seen.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose at that.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are gonna be roomies until this situation is resolved.\u201d</p><p>Erin could only stare at him while crickets chirped around her and lightning bugs flashed in the distance.</p><p>A muscle flexed along his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my hands to myself, okay? But I\u2019m not leaving you alone, not at night. You\u2019re safe enough during the day. You usually have cops around you then, but at night\u2014no, not \u2019til this freak is caught.\u201d</p><p>Hmm. She walked forward, taking the steps much slower than he had. The yellow tape dangled from his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cNighttime protection. Is this part of the package I get for that big-ass fee I paid Night Watch?\u201d Drained her savings, but she couldn\u2019t think of a better way to spend the last of her blood money. She\u2019d sent the check to the agency this morning. Right to the big boss, Pak.</p><p>A shrug. \u201cWe aim to please.\u201d</p><p>She stopped before him. The guy was big. Since she was tall and loved to wear her high heels, she didn\u2019t have to look up at many men. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But her head tipped back a bit for him. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cGood? That\u2019s it? No argument... from the ADA? \u201d</p><p>She pulled out her keys and was happy her hands didn\u2019t tremble. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Donovan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJude.\u201d</p><p>Erin had to swallow at that. Too personal. Be careful, can\u2019t let him too close. \u201cJude.\u201d Grudging. \u201cHaving someone here with me until this jerk is caught sounds like a good idea.\u201d If only she hadn\u2019t been alone the last time he\u2019d caught her.</p><p>No. If Jude wanted to stay, yeah, that\u2019d be more than fine with her.</p><p>Her hand twisted and she shoved the key into the lock.</p><p>\u201cOne thing.\u201d His breath blew against her hair.</p> <p>Erin licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cThat whole keeping-my-hands-to-myself thing, if you want to change that rule, all you have to do is say so.\u201d</p><p>A quick push and the door creaked open. Glancing over her shoulder, she found his eyes blazing at her. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>His gaze dropped to her lips. \u201cGood. \u2019Cause like I said, at Night Watch, we aim to please.\u201d</p><p>She just bet he knew exactly how to please a woman.</p><p>He\u2019s a shifter. He can handle anything I throw at him.</p> <p>The knowledge burned in her mind. It wouldn\u2019t be like it had been with the others. First Jon, with his shaking hands and sweaty palms. She\u2019d almost broken his wrists because she got a little too carried away.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be like that.</p><p>And it wouldn\u2019t be like when she\u2019d tried a bit of bondage in college, thinking the ropes would hold her down and keep Lyle safe.</p><p>They\u2019d snapped in an instant and she\u2019d drawn blood seconds later with her claws.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t be like that. Not with another shifter.</p><p>\u201cThinking about it, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned. \u201cNo.\u201d Easy lie. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I don\u2019t want to see the blood inside.\u201d Okay, true enough.</p><p>He nudged her into the house. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. I sent a team by for cleanup before I told Tony to give you the all clear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cI swear, you have the sexiest scent. Woman, roses, and...wild.\u201d</p><p>Wild\u2014animal scent.</p><p>He dropped the bag she hadn\u2019t even noticed until that moment\u2014 way too busy focusing on the man\u2014and it hit the floor with a thud. \u201cI also took the liberty of upgrading your security system.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the flashing light on the right. \u201cUpgrade? But I already paid for a top of the line system!\u201d One that hadn\u2019t done a bit of good.</p><p>A quick smile. Shark strong. \u201cThis one\u2019s better. It\u2019s not on the market yet.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten rid of the blood, upgraded her protection, and he was there to stay the night. Erin could only shake her head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected, Jude Donovan.\u201d Not at all.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d</p><p>The radio blared, rocking the car. Not the classic, easy listening crap that Lee Givens listened to when clients or coworkers were around.</p><p>No, his music. Country, through and through. His thumbs pounded out a beat on the steering wheel as he snaked down the winding roads leading to his house.</p><p>Another damn day done. He\u2019d get home, shower the stench of his clients off his skin, then put in a call to his ex-wife. This weekend was his son Tommy\u2019s fifth birthday, and he would be at that party. He\u2019d missed the last three weekends with Tommy because of work.</p><p>No more.</p><p>He\u2019d finally gotten the all clear. They were making him partner at his firm. No more busting his ass to prove himself. Now he\u2019d take the plush office and easy street.</p><p>He had Tommy\u2019s new bike all nice and ready, just sitting in the garage, waiting for the kid.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d call Melissa, even though it was late, because he missed that boy, and her, but\u2014</p><p>Blindingly bright lights flashed in his rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Lee jerked the wheel and the tires screeched. \u201cAsshole, turn off the brights!\u201d He steadied the car and thought about throwing up a prominent finger. The shitass behind him sure would be able to see the gesture. His headlights were making the whole county glow.</p><p>Lee shoved his foot down on the gas. He\u2019d lose the jerk. Couple more bends and he\u2019d be turning off the old road and making the last stretch for home and he\u2019d be\u2014</p><p>The bright lights shot closer.</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cIf you want to pass, move the fuck around!\u201d He rolled down his window and shoved his arm out, waving his hand forward. \u201cCome around!\u201d Don\u2019t need this shit. He should have moved closer to the office, but he\u2019d kept the house.</p><p>Melissa liked it. Tommy had a tree house in the back. If they came home, they\u2019d need a place to\u2014</p><p>The other vehicle slammed into him, sending his car jerking forward. \u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d Fear dried his throat. Shit. Shit.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>An attack.</p><p>He\u2019d handled too many criminal cases, made too many enemies, gotten too many threats.</p><p>Threats he\u2019d never taken seriously. Until now.</p><p>He pinned the gas pedal flat against the floorboard but the other vehicle was closing in on him again. All he could see in his rearview mirror were those shining lights, making stars dance before his eyes.</p><p>What the hell did that guy have under his fucking hood?</p><p>Jesus! He swiped the sweat off his forehead. No, no way\u2014</p><p>The car slammed into him again.</p><p>Lee\u2019s car jerked and his head snapped back. The seatbelt bit into his shoulder and chest and he tasted blood on his tongue. His teeth had snapped closed on it. Lee spit, snarling as\u2014</p><p>The car flew up on the left. Lee finally caught a glimpse of it. Big, black SUV. Tinted windows. What the hell?</p><p>Too close.</p><p>His knuckles whitened around the wheel.</p><p>The black bitch slammed into the side of his car.</p><p>His secondhand BMW couldn\u2019t take the impact. The car flew to the edge of the road, trembled. Lee yanked the steering wheel, praying.</p><p>Not like this. He couldn\u2019t go out like this!</p><p>His breath heaved out. His heartbeat slammed so loudly in his ears he could barely hear the radio anymore.</p><p>The SUV plowed into him once more.</p><p>The BMW lost the fight.</p><p>The car tumbled off the road, rolled, again, again.</p><p>Glass shattered. The air bag exploded before him, a white cloud that surrounded him.</p><p>The radio died.</p><p>Metal crunched. Twisted. The top of the car thudded into the earth.</p><p>Oh, God, Tommy\u2014</p><p>Sorry, son.</p><p>Too easy. He smiled as he watched the blue car fly into the tree. Steam exploded from the hood.</p><p>Humans were so weak.</p><p>Hardly worth his time.</p><p>But if the bastard had survived the crash, maybe he could have a bit of fun with the lawyer.</p><p>Maybe a lot of fun.</p><p>Smiling, he started down the ravine.</p><p>Headlights flashed in the distance.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>The roar of the truck\u2019s engine reached his ears. One of those big, souped-up trucks that the hicks in this area seemed to love.</p><p>His jaw clenched. This kill wasn\u2019t over.</p><p>But the truck was coming closer, and he was in the open.</p><p>He cast one more glance down at the twisted metal. Odds were good that the asshole was dead.</p><p>And if he wasn\u2019t, there was always next time.</p><p>Next time.</p><p>He turned from the ravine and hurried back to his idling SUV. If he got his butt out of there, the other driver probably wouldn\u2019t even notice the wreck.</p><p>Humans were like that. So self-involved. Never seeing the danger and death until it was too late.</p><p>Fools.</p><p>He jumped into the vehicle. The night was still young. If he hurried, he might even be able to catch his lady.</p><p>Another hunt\u2014this one, the most important of them all.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>She couldn\u2019t sleep. Erin stared up at the ceiling as the soft patter of rain began to fall onto the house. The storm that had been threatening since late afternoon had finally come.</p><p>The patter quickened as the rain strengthened, falling harder, harder.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>But saw Jude.</p><p>The shifter had played the gentleman. He\u2019d walked her through the new security system. Done a top to bottom search of her house.</p><p>They\u2019d eaten together. Hell, he\u2019d even cooked.</p><p>Then he\u2019d walked her to her bedroom door.</p><p>And left her.</p><p>Without even one touch.</p><p>Should have been what she wanted.</p><p>But, no, he was what she wanted. She wanted him so much that she was aching.</p><p>The need was like that for her. Had been, since she was sixteen. When she wanted someone, she wanted. Craved.</p><p>Needed so badly that her body throbbed.</p><p>For most shifters, puberty was the time when real power kicked in. The first shift.</p><p>Not for her.</p><p>The beast\u2014or whatever the thing inside her was\u2014had awakened, and with it, so much hunger and need.</p><p>Control.</p><p>It had become the center of her life. Maintaining control. Always having control.</p><p>Then the stalker asshole had come along and ripped all of her careful control away.</p><p>Her hands knotted beneath the sheet.</p><p>Where was Jude? When she\u2019d offered him the room beside hers, he\u2019d shaken his head and stared at her with blue eyes that burned with hunger. \u201cToo close,\u201d had been his growled response.</p><p>Not close enough.</p><p>She was so screwed up.</p><p>Wanting him.</p><p>Fearing herself.</p><p>He can handle me.</p><p>Shifters were strong, she knew that. He\u2019d be able to handle anything she threw at him.</p><p>His steps had echoed when he\u2019d headed downstairs. Maybe he was in the little guest room she\u2019d set up. Maybe he\u2019d stripped off his shirt again, like last night.</p><p>Last night.</p><p>Her mouth dried. Oh, my. The man\u2019s chest had rippled with muscles. Beneath the jeans, his thighs bunched with power.</p><p>And when he\u2019d put his mouth on her...</p><p>Erin\u2019s nipples pebbled.</p><p>She turned over and buried her face into the pillow. Maybe she needed another cold shower. Maybe she\u2014</p><p>Thunder shook the house. Erin flinched. That had been a strong blast, loud, too, shaking her bed, shaking the\u2014</p><p>She bolted up, realization hitting hard. The thunder hadn\u2019t come from outside.</p><p>It sounded again, but it wasn\u2019t thunder.</p><p>Erin climbed out of bed, nearly falling flat on her ass as she hurried. That was a roar!</p><p>An animal\u2019s roar of fury, and it was coming from downstairs.</p><p>She ran for the door.</p><p>The change swept over him, hard and fast, fueled by fury, the black rage that boiled his blood and sucked the man back inside the beast.</p><p>He\u2019d heard the rattle at the door. The scrape of claws, and Jude hadn\u2019t needed the shrill beep of the alarm to sound. He\u2019d known the intruder was there.</p><p>Now he was going to destroy the bastard.</p><p>Bones snapped. Twisted. White fur burst from his flesh even as his claws tore from his fingertips. The snarl on Jude\u2019s lips became a roar of rage as the beast took over.</p><p>The pain didn\u2019t bother him, not anymore. But the power thrilled him.</p><p>His vision sharpened. His hearing grew more acute. In those swift moments of transformation, a new world appeared. A world where he ruled.</p><p>His mouth opened and another roar burst from him.</p><p>The bastard was running. He could hear his thudding footsteps. His favorite part...chasing prey.</p><p>Muscles bunching, he prepared for the hunt.</p><p>\u201cJude, what\u2019s going on? Jude! \u201d</p><p>His head jerked toward her. Long bare limbs, sexy silk over her flesh. Her eyes were wide, her mouth open. She stood on the stairs, just steps away from the bottom, and her fingers had a white-knuckled grip around the banister. \u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>He growled at her. That better not be fear on her face. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Not ever. No matter what form he took.</p><p>The beast wouldn\u2019t so much as scratch the woman that the man craved.</p><p>She stepped toward him, eyes too big. \u201cI-it\u2019s you. Why d-did you shift? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>No time. He whirled away from her and launched toward the open door.</p><p>Her footfalls rushed behind him. He glanced back and roared at her to stay put. In human form, she\u2019d just be a target.</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t risk her. Not now. Not ever.</p><p>He bounded into the night.</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>Erin stared after Jude, her heart racing so fast her chest hurt.</p><p>Jude\u2014 a tiger. A white tiger. Big and beautiful and deadly.</p><p>Tiger, tiger, burning bright...The words from the William Blake poem whispered through her mind as she watched him jump off her porch and disappear into the darkness.</p><p>Such grace and power.</p><p>So very, very dangerous.</p><p>A white tiger.</p><p>Thick fur, pale as snow, and lined with coal black stripes. The tiger was huge. The length of his body had been at least nine feet, plus that long, thick tail. His mouth\u2014when he\u2019d opened his mouth in that roar, his teeth had been\u2014 hell. He could have ripped her throat open with those razor-sharp teeth in less than a second.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t attacked her. In his blue eyes, she\u2019d seen the man staring back at her. Jude had full control over his beast.</p><p>Not all shifters did.</p><p>\u201cA white tiger,\u201d she whispered to the night. Jude was out there, hunting, for her.</p><p>There was a reason the white tigers bore the Chinese symbol for king on their heads. Some said the rare white tigers were among the strongest of the shifters, second only to the dragons. But the dragons, well, no one was really sure those guys even existed anymore.</p><p>Tiger versus wolf. Both strong, fierce killing machines. But the tiger\u2014she\u2019d lay odds he could take the wolf. He\u2019d still better be careful, and he\u2019d better come back to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Erin strode to the edge of the porch. Going after them would be foolish. She\u2019d just get in Jude\u2019s way, and she couldn\u2019t hunt with him. No shifting, no hunting.</p><p>As much as she hated to stay behind, she wouldn\u2019t risk his safety.</p><p>Besides, a white tiger could take down just about anything.</p> <p>So strong.</p><p>Strong enough to handle even her.</p><p>The rain pelted him and did its damnedest to wipe away the stench of his prey. But he caught a faint scent, one heavy with musk, smelling of the forest.</p><p>Shifter scent.</p><p>He took off after his prey, splashing through the puddles and sticking to the cover of the thick bushes and blooming azaleas as much as possible. The last thing he wanted was for a neighbor to wake up and see him running through the neighborhood in this form.</p> <p>His ears twitched. His prey was fast. Damn fast. Had he shifted, too? Good. He\u2019d like to see just what he was dealing with in the bastard.</p><p>Bushes slapped into his face and tickled his whiskers as he ran. Catch him. Got to stop him.</p><p>The thudding of the prey\u2019s steps grew weaker\u2014because the guy was pulling away.</p><p>Faster? No way could the bastard be faster. No. Way.</p><p>But the asshole was getting away.</p><p>Should have let the bastard come inside. When the lock on the door had clicked open, his roar of fury had given the guy too much warning and too much time to flee.</p> <p>But Jude hadn\u2019t been able to hold back the rage, or the change. The shift had burst over him with the rush of adrenaline that spiked his heartbeat. One thought\u2014 he\u2019s coming after her.</p><p>The beast had kicked into high gear.</p><p>The rumble of a motor growled up ahead. A car door slammed. No, he couldn\u2019t have shifted. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to jump in the car like that if he\u2019d shifted.</p><p>So if he hadn\u2019t shifted, then how the hell had he run so fast?</p><p>Jude rounded the corner just in time to see the taillights of a black SUV speed away.</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>His teeth snapped together. Give chase.</p><p>The demand from the beast.</p> <p>But a light had flickered on in the house behind him. Whoever was inside must have been alerted by the squeal of tires. The last thing he needed was to keep hunting on the road in his current body.</p><p>Next time, bastard. Next time.</p><p>He returned to her as a man. Naked, dripping wet. Erin met him at the door, an oversized towel in her hands. Her gaze darted over him. Thick muscles, eat-me abs, thick curling hair at his groin\u2014</p><p>Oh, wow.</p><p>\u201cGot away.\u201d Dark and rumbling. Still more beast than man.</p><p>Her gaze snapped back to his face. To those electric eyes. She held out her towel, licked her lips and swore she tasted him. \u201cWas it...him?\u201d</p><p>Stupid question. Who the hell else would have decided to come in her house at close to three a.m.?</p><p>Erin cleared her throat. She\u2019d finally managed to stop the beeping of the security system, but she couldn\u2019t get the image of Jude\u2019s shift out of her mind.</p><p>A tiger. A white, beautiful, scary-as-hell tiger.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t guessed, hadn\u2019t even considered...</p><p>A white tiger.</p><p>Different shifters had different reputations in the Other world. You knew not to trust a hyena or a coyote. Those bastards would turn on anyone.</p><p>Wolves\u2014dangerous. Sometimes psychotic. Great killers.</p><p>Bears were pretty easygoing, unless you got between them and a meal.</p><p>But white tigers were the rarest of the shifter breeds. Bloodthirsty. Relentless. Incredibly powerful.</p><p>Perfect. Yes, the more she thought about it, the more perfect Jude became for her.</p><p>He can match me. I won\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>Maybe she should be afraid. When she\u2019d seen him in tiger form, perhaps she should have been scared. He could rip her body open with a swipe of his claws. Use those razor-sharp teeth on her.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t afraid.</p><p>Seeing his power and his strength\u2014 no, she didn\u2019t fear him at all.</p><p>But she did want him.</p><p>Jude kicked the door closed. Water dripped from his hair and trailed over his face. \u201cYeah, I caught his stench.\u201d He flipped the locks into place.</p><p>Her breath jerked out. If he\u2019d caught the scent, it had only been because the bastard out there let him catch the smell. She knew the other shifter could manage to control his scent. He\u2019d sure masked the scent before.</p><p>But for the stalker to come after her like this... two nights in a row. He\u2019d never come after her so quickly before. Not back to back.</p><p>\u201cHe got away, this time.\u201d</p><p>He was good at getting away, every time. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d</p><p>A shake of his head sent water droplets flying. \u201cHe was too fast. Don\u2019t know what beast that asshole carries, but he\u2019s fast. \u201d</p><p>And strong.</p><p>And out there, waiting in the darkness. Planning his next move.</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he just leave her alone?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Erin. Blood, bones, and beast\u2014all mine.\u201d Words he\u2019d spoken to her that terrible night. Growled in the darkness.</p><p>Erin shook her head, trying to drive the voice from her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. Stared at him. You\u2019re mine. The asshole\u2019s voice rang in her head.</p><p>His? The hell she was.</p><p>The towel dangled in her hand.</p><p>Blue eyes glowing with need swept over her body. Jude wanted her.</p><p>She wanted him. Why fight it anymore? She wouldn\u2019t hurt him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Her heart shoved against her chest. She dropped the towel and went straight to him.</p><p>\u201cErin, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stood up on her toes and grabbed the back of his head, sinking her fingers into that wet mane and pulling his mouth down to hers. Then she kissed him. Mouth open, tongue seeking, hunger pounding through her.</p><p>His cock pushed against her. The rain hadn\u2019t done a thing to cool his arousal. The ridge was long and thick, straining, and she rubbed against him.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d get wild.</p><p>A growl rumbled in his throat. His tongue swiped against hers, and his hands wrapped around her. Big and strong.</p><p>Her nipples tightened into stiff points. Her panties grew damp. And Erin knew she needed a bed.</p><p>With an effort, Erin managed to tear her mouth from his. Hard to do, because the guy\u2019s tongue was freaking magic. \u201cCome upstairs with me.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to take him down there. Not with the memory of blood just a few feet away.</p><p>Upstairs. Safety.</p><p>And a big bed they could wreck.</p><p>They would wreck.</p><p>The beast stared out from his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me, sweetheart. I\u2019m not the kind of guy you can screw around with.\u201d</p><p>He was exactly the kind of guy she wanted to screw around with. Erin caught his hands. \u201cI want these on me, everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Hell, no. Not that sick bastard\u2019s. Her body was her own, and tonight, she\u2019d give it to Jude, and she\u2019d take the pleasure he gave her.</p><p>I can\u2019t hurt him. A reassurance that played again. He\u2019s strong.</p><p>Not human.</p><p>Tiger.</p><p>\u201cCome upstairs,\u201d she repeated, her voice soft. She took his right hand and trailed the fingers between her breasts. \u201cCome to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>She felt the tension in his hand. The leashed strength. \u201cI can\u2019t...do soft and easy. Not tonight, not after a shift.\u201d</p><p>The beast still coursed through him.</p><p>Erin smiled. The beast within was exactly what she wanted. \u201cGood.\u201d She turned from him and stalked toward the stairs.</p><p>Silence thickened the air behind her.</p><p>\u201cOne minute you\u2019re telling me to keep my hands off, now you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jerked off her camisole and tossed it behind her, not bothering to look back. Can\u2019t. \u201cNow I want them on me.\u201d</p><p>The wood of the stairs seemed cold beneath her feet. Clad only in a pair of white bikini panties, Erin climbed the steps.</p><p>Almost to the top. He hadn\u2019t moved. He wanted her, she\u2019d felt his lust rising against her, but he hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>I need you. Tonight, she needed him more than she\u2019d ever needed another.</p><p>Erin glanced down. Her claws were out, sharpened points. She could smell the scent of her own arousal in the air and knew he had to catch the scent, too. For a male shifter, the fragrance of a female shifter\u2019s need was rumored to be nearly impossible to resist. While she wasn\u2019t fully a shifter, she\u2019d still thought\u2014</p><p>The stairs shook when Jude raced up them.</p><p>A smile curved her lips.</p><p>Erin reached the landing. Her bedroom waited. Inside, the lamp on the nightstand poured out soft light. Her curtains were drawn over the windows. The bed sheets were rumpled.</p><p>She took one more step forward.</p><p>Jude pounced.</p><p>His arms caught her, lifting her off her feet, and spinning her around. His eyes, blazing, too brilliant, trapped her. His mouth took hers.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Fear wasn\u2019t in her mind, not then. No memories. No nightmares. Just him.</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist and felt that thick cock push against the crotch of her panties. He had to feel the wet touch of the silk, and she wanted him to know how much she ached.</p><p>Four steps, and they fell onto the bed. Kissing, touching, stroking.</p><p>She loved his mouth. Her tongue swiped over the sexy scar that drove her crazy.</p><p>His fingers curled over her breasts and Erin nearly shot off the bed. Her nipples were so sensitive, desperate for more.</p><p>His head lifted and, past those delicious lips, she could see the glinting edge of his teeth.</p><p>A faint memory stirred in her mind. Fear whispered to her.</p><p>No.</p><p>She rolled with him, twisting so that she was on top and in control.</p><p>Jude can handle me.</p><p>The tip of her nails\u2014claws\u2014raked down his chest. Over the firm, brown nipples. Down those sculpted muscles. He sucked in a sharp breath when she reached his abs.</p><p>Erin licked her lips and eased back. Her legs straddled his thighs, such hard and strong thighs, and a quiver stirred in her belly. Her hands shook when she reached for his cock, the length standing up, veins bulging the sides. Thicker than her wrist.</p><p>Long enough to give her one hell of a ride.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>Her fingers closed around him. Pumped. Stroked. She\u2019d like to taste him. Like to lick from root to tip and see just how long his control would last with her.</p><p>His hands locked around her waist and he shot up. His mouth closed over her right breast. Sucking, licking, tasting. Her head fell back on a moan.</p><p>\u201cJude!\u201d</p><p>The edge of his teeth pressed against her flesh.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t enjoy that, shouldn\u2019t like it so much.</p><p>Her sex trembled.</p><p>Empty. Need him inside.</p><p>Only the thin fabric of her panties was between them.</p><p>She leaned toward him and put her mouth on his throat. She teased him with her lips\u2014and then gave him her own bite.</p><p>Every muscle in his body stiffened. Not a growl in his throat this time. Hell, that was more a roar from the tiger.</p><p>In half a second, Erin found herself on her back again, looking up at him. Jude\u2019s face was fierce, etched with savagery and lust.</p><p>His claws ripped her panties away and in the next breath, he\u2019d shoved open her thighs.</p><p>Fury. Strength.</p><p>He could handle her. But could she handle him?</p><p>\u201cJude, I...\u201d</p><p>She expected the hard thrust of his flesh in her.</p><p>But instead he pushed down her body, lifted her hips up and took her with his mouth.</p><p>Her heels dug into the mattress. \u201cJude! \u201d Her claws slashed the sheets.</p><p>His tongue swirled over her clit. His lips locked around the center of her need. He sucked. He took.</p><p>Tasted.</p><p>Then drove that wicked tongue deep inside her.</p><p>Her climax erupted, sending spasms through her sex as she came in a fury of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cFucking delicious...nothing like you before...\u201d</p><p>She could barely hear his words over her drumming heartbeat.</p><p>But she felt him, the wide, round head of his cock, lodging at her straining entrance.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The wisps of memory had vanished with those sensual licks. Not like\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...clean.\u201d The words were deep, guttural. \u201cCan\u2019t catch any...\u201d</p><p>She strained against him. Erin wanted that cock in her now. She knew what he was telling her. Shifters couldn\u2019t catch the diseases humans could pass so easily during sex. Yeah, he was clean. \u201cSo am I,\u201d she whispered, and dug her heels into his ass as she lifted against him.</p><p>And shifters could only produce children with their mates. She didn\u2019t have to worry about that with Jude. Hell, not with anyone but\u2014</p><p>He drove into her. Filled every inch of her in a powerful thrust that had her hips arching and her hands flying to wrap around his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d Gritted from behind clenched teeth. \u201cAre you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFantastic.\u201d Her hands released the strips of sheets and curled around his shoulders. \u201cJust don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>A strangled laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t...worry. Too...good!\u201d</p><p>Then it began. Withdraw. Thrust. Withdraw.</p><p>Thrust.</p><p>Her fingers dug into him, and her legs clenched around his hips. Her strength flowed, full force, as she held tight and arched up to meet him as he plunged in a fast, desperate rhythm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her to stop. Didn\u2019t tell her to loosen her grip.</p><p>Jude just drove into her. Again and again and her inner muscles stretched for him, eager for more pleasure.</p><p>For more of him.</p><p>The thud of flesh hitting flesh filled the air. The scent of sex drifted around them. Her bed was sturdy. It didn\u2019t move with the powerful thrusts, but the bed springs squeaked.</p><p>She clenched her sex around him, and her breath panted out. \u201cHarder!\u201d Erin wanted so much more.</p><p>He could give it to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jude jerked her up, rising on his knees. She stared into his blazing eyes and wondered if her own glowed as bright.</p><p>The coil of release began deep within her.</p><p>Her mouth opened on a scream.</p><p>Flesh so close. Taste. Take.</p> <p>The thing inside would have her way.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>His throat was so close. She bit down on him, muffling her scream and tasting his flesh as pleasure ripped through her.</p><p>He stiffened against her, his hold grew even harder, and then he erupted inside her, shaking with his own release.</p><p>A drumbeat echoed in her ears.</p> <p>Aftershocks rippled over her body.</p><p>Slowly, so slowly, her head lifted and she swiped her tongue over her lips.</p><p>And she tasted blood.</p><p>Horrified, Erin shoved against him. \u201cOh, hell, Jude, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Kept his cock buried deep inside and kissed her.</p><p>When his head rose, she stared up at him, hoping, scared, and so confused. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>That half smile made her melt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t.\u201d His index finger trailed down her chest. \u201cI could fucking eat you alive, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Not running away. Not freaking out because she\u2019d gotten a little...overzealous there at the end.</p><p>Tiger.</p><p>His gaze dropped to her chest. \u201cSuch sweet breasts with their pretty pink nipples.\u201d He frowned, his head lowering. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Her scar.</p><p>How had she forgotten? Shit, shit! How had she forgotten that?</p><p>She should have turned off the light.</p><p>Shifters can see in the dark. She knew that!</p> <p>His fingers rubbed lightly over the raised flesh just below her left breast.</p><p>A claw mark.</p><p>Jude withdrew from her, a long, slow glide, and Erin had to bite back the plea for him to stay, to thrust deep again.</p><p>Again.</p><p>The passion was gone, at least for him. He was looking at her now with intense eyes and a hard face.</p><p>Looking at her like she was a victim, dammit.</p><p>Not a woman.</p><p>Before, she\u2019d been a woman with him.</p><p>Now\u2014</p><p>Erin spun away from him. She ripped what was left of the sheet loose as she moved, using it to cover her body.</p><p>How could I have forgotten? I see the thing every day.</p><p>\u201cWho marked you?\u201d Fury there, boiling beneath the surface of his voice.</p><p>She rose from the bed, careful not to move too fast. Didn\u2019t want it to look like she was running.</p><p>Even if she was.</p><p>Erin clenched her thighs, feeling a quiver in her sex.</p><p>So good. But good things didn\u2019t last long in her life.</p><p>At least Jude hadn\u2019t gone running from her, even when she\u2019d used her claws and teeth.</p><p>\u201cWho fucking marked you?\u201d</p><p>She turned back to face him.</p><p>Jude jumped from the bed, naked and damn sexy still, and grabbed her arms.</p><p>The sheet slipped to the floor.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard did it, didn\u2019t he? You said you\u2019d never seen him, you said he hadn\u2019t got close to you!\u201d</p><p>Time for some truth. \u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>At first, the wound had bled like a bitch. She\u2019d left a trail of her blood on the street when she\u2019d fled. But, lucky for her, she could heal without shifting. So her skin had mended, well, as close to mending as it could, and though her bleeding had stopped by the time she\u2019d reached safety, she\u2019d been left with his mark on her flesh. The wound had been too deep and long to heal perfectly.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>From wild sex back to business. Not the way she would have liked to spend the afterglow moments. Erin swallowed. \u201cNot tonight, Jude, okay? I don\u2019t want to talk about this now.\u201d Not while her body still vibrated with the pleasure he\u2019d given her. Not while she could still taste him.</p><p>Not while she could almost feel him inside.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go back to that other night right then.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>He stared down at her, a muscle flexing along his jaw.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Silence. Then, when her heart was squeezing because she didn\u2019t want to go back there, he gave a grim nod. \u201cBut we will talk about it, Erin. I\u2019m working this case for you. I need to know everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cTomorrow, okay? Tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped. She bent and scooped up the sheet. He\u2019d go back to his room downstairs now, she\u2019d go back to bed and try to sleep, try.</p><p>Erin brushed by him. \u201cIn the morning, we\u2019ll talk.\u201d A dismissal. Not sexy. Not subtle.</p><p>She\u2019d never really been the subtle sort.</p><p>She climbed into the bed. Eased onto the mattress and tried not to notice the way his scent surrounded her.</p><p>\u201cScoot over, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cYou\u2019re not going downstairs?\u201d</p><p>Jude shook his head. \u201cNot the way things work. Not for me.\u201d</p><p>He eased in beside her and wrapped his arms around her body.</p><p>Erin tensed.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m just going to hold you. Hold you and sleep.\u201d</p><p>Sounded good to her.</p><p>His right hand curved around her stomach. The fingers drifted lightly over her scar.</p><p>\u201cSomething you should know.\u201d His voice was soft.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cWhen I find him, I\u2019m gonna kill him.\u201d</p><p>If only the bastard out there were easy to kill. If he\u2019d been easy prey, she would have killed him herself, long ago.</p><p>It took a while for Erin\u2019s breathing to ease into the slow, natural rhythm of sleep.</p><p>Jude held her, keeping his hold nice and easy, and he waited.</p><p>And he choked back his rage.</p><p>The bastard marked her.</p><p>Close enough to mark. Close enough to kill.</p><p>Why the hell had Erin kept the truth from him?</p><p>She stirred in her sleep, moving lightly, and her nose rubbed against his neck.</p><p>In sleep, she was soft and beautiful. Delicate. A woman who needed protection.</p><p>In passion, she\u2019d been something else. Oh, still beautiful. With her shining eyes and hungry lips, Erin had been the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>But not delicate. Her hold on him had been too strong, too fierce. And her hunger had been as wild as his own.</p><p>The beast in him had been very, very hungry.</p><p>For her.</p><p>His cock was still erect, still ready\u2014because he wanted more. But when the ghost of fear had appeared in her eyes, he\u2019d known the passion was over. For now.</p><p>He\u2019d had her once. He\u2019d have her again. And he\u2019d make sure that fear never showed again.</p><p>Jude would stop the asshole out there. No doubt.</p><p>The beast inside couldn\u2019t wait to taste the blood.</p><p>The rain was falling again. Dripping through the broken glass.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>The scent of gasoline was in the air. Thick, cloying gasoline, and the coppery stench of blood.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Drip.</p><p>Erin stared at the mound of twisted metal. Her feet</p><p>crunched glass on the ground beneath her, but she didn\u2019t feel any pain. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>She wet her lips and inched forward. The broken car looked like hell. The roof had been smashed. The front four feet of the car had been crumbled to pretty much nothing by the tree.</p><p>The scent of blood grew stronger.</p><p>Shadows filled the interior of the car, but she knew someone was inside.</p><p>Living or dead?</p><p>Her hand reached out and touched the icy door handle. She yanked, but the thing wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>Someone was inside.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Another hard pull, this time, with both hands.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Her palms were wet, from the rain, from her own sweat.</p><p>She should get help.</p><p>Yeah, yeah, that was a good idea, she\u2019d go, get help.</p><p>Erin stepped back, almost falling in the slick mud.</p><p>She\u2019d find help, then she\u2019d come back as fast as she could.</p><p>Turning, she ran for the\u2014</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t...l-leave...m-me...\u201d</p><p>The voice stopped her cold.</p><p>\u201cP-please...\u201d</p><p>Erin woke, breath heaving.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t...l-leave...m-me...\u201d</p><p>The voice echoed in her head, and, dammit, it was a voice she knew.</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d Jude\u2019s growl. Sleep-roughened and deep. \u201cSweetheart, you must\u2019ve had a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>If only.</p><p>Never that simple for her.</p><p>Death dreams. The only thing, other than her black hair, that she\u2019d gotten from her father.</p><p>She\u2019d had her first one when she was twelve years old. Her mother had told her it was just a nightmare, nothing to worry about.</p><p>Then the body had been found.</p><p>The damn dreams. Sometimes they came to her right before a death, teasing her and making her believe that there was something she could do. Some way to change fate.</p><p>Other times, to torment her, they came too late. Minutes, hours after the death.</p><p>Too late to do anything but mourn the dead.</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t...l-leave...m-me...\u201d</p><p>Too late. No, she still had to try.</p><p>Erin leapt out of bed. She ran for her closet and snagged the first pair of sweats she saw.</p><p>\u201cUh, Erin?\u201d</p><p>Shimmying, she jerked them up. Then shoved her hands through the sleeves of a T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cLittle early for a jog.\u201d</p><p>Erin spun around. \u201cI have to leave.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. The man looked sleep tousled. Blond hair mussed, eyes heavy-lidded, faint stubble lining his jaw.</p><p>She swallowed. Don\u2019t mind waking up to that.</p><p>His gaze sharpened. \u201cWhere.\u201d Demand, not question.</p><p>How to explain this? The long version? The one with all the twisted shit in her past and the roots of her father\u2019s vision gifts\u2014courtesy of her great-grandfather, a Choctaw shaman.</p><p>Screw it. Better to just cut to the chase. \u201cI\u2019m psychic, okay? Just like my dad.\u201d Not exactly. \u201cLook, if I don\u2019t get to Old Dobbin\u2019s Bend soon, a man\u2019s going to die.\u201d Could already be dead.</p><p>Old Dobbin\u2019s Bend. When she\u2019d turned away from the wrecked car, she\u2019d known that road. She\u2019d been on that winding track once, just last week. She\u2019d ridden with a uniform out to question a witness. No mistaking that long, curving bend.</p><p>Jude stared at her for about five seconds, then gave a nod. \u201cRight, then let\u2019s get the hell to Dobbin\u2019s Bend.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. That was it? No questions, just go? \u201cYou believe me?\u201d</p><p>He swung his legs over the edge of the bed. \u201cWoman, you\u2019re talking to a man who can shift into a tiger. Hell, yeah, I believe you.\u201d He jerked on his pants. When had he brought those upstairs? \u201cNow let\u2019s get our asses over to Dobbin\u2019s Bend.\u201d</p><p>Hold on, Lee. The whisper slipped through her mind. The voice in her dream had belonged to Lee Givens, the attorney who usually pissed her off. But now, she was just scared for him.</p><p>Sure, Lee could be a real jerkoff, but he didn\u2019t deserve to die alone.</p><p>No one did.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Jude\u2019s hands clenched around the steering wheel. \u201cYou sure this is the right place?\u201d</p><p>His voice was cool, calm, but Erin\u2019s shoulders tensed. \u201cIt\u2019s the right place.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen this exact road in her dream. Those trees. The broken pine.</p><p>This was the place.</p><p>\u201cHow long you been having dreams like this?\u201d</p><p>Erin wet her lips. \u201cClose to seventeen years now, but I don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t have them that often.\u201d If she had them every night, she\u2019d go crazy. No question. \u201cI only have them when...when I know someone\u2014\u201d Didn\u2019t have to be an intimate knowledge, but it had to be someone she\u2019d connected with in some way. The dreams were only about people who\u2019d stirred her emotions, good or bad.</p><p>When her emotions were stirred, then the link, or whatever the hell it was inside of her, just clicked on. When it was time for someone she\u2019d connected with to die, the death dreams came.</p><p>Her dad told her it was a gift. One passed through generations of his blood by the gods.</p><p>Gift? More like curse.</p><p>Her dreams sure hadn\u2019t been enough to save him.</p><p>\u201cSo if you know somebody and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have to be close to death.\u201d For the dreams to come calling, they had to hear death\u2019s sweet whisper.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>Her brows pulled together. She didn\u2019t know quite what that sound meant. Told him I was flawed. This death dream madness is just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>She felt the glance he gave her. Questioning. Weighing.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t worry about that now, not when\u2014\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>He slammed on the brakes.</p><p>Erin shoved open her door and jumped out of the truck. This was the spot from her vision, she knew it. Her body hummed with energy. Here.</p><p>\u201cErin, wait!\u201d The grind of the tires crunched as he pulled off the road behind her. A door slammed.</p><p>Her gaze raked the road. The rain had fallen so hard during the night, it would have washed away any signs\u2014</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch.\u201d</p><p>Jude saw the markings first. Figured, his senses were better than hers.</p><p>Ten feet up the road, then right over the edge...</p><p>They ran together, then they went over that edge.</p><p>The mud sucked at her tennis shoes, making gulping sounds like it wanted to eat her, but Erin powered on through the falling mist. The broken car was in her sights now.</p><p>How can he be alive?</p><p>The car had been smashed, crumbled as if by giant hands, then thrown away.</p><p>In the distance, the shriek of a siren sounded. Help was coming. The ambulance she\u2019d called before she left her house was getting closer, fast.</p><p>Jude reached the car door first. The window was broken, shattered, and inside, Erin could see Lee\u2019s bloody form. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLee!\u201d He didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s breathing,\u201d Jude said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know for how much longer.\u201d His fingers curled over the side of the door, and he yanked.</p><p>The door broke loose and fell to the ground.</p> <p>Erin crawled inside the car. \u201cLee! It\u2019s okay. Help\u2019s coming!\u201d Still alive. Finally, she\u2019d reached someone in time.</p><p>He flinched and gave a moan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said again. Voices floated to her. The EMTs. They were running down the ravine now, having the same trouble with the thick mud. But they\u2019d get him out. They\u2019d be able to save him. They could stop the bleeding.</p><p>Because his shirt was drenched with blood.</p><p>Too much blood. And it trickled from his forehead. From the gash that went too deep.</p> <p>She swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right.\u201d Lie.</p><p>His eyes opened. \u201cT-Tommy?\u201d Rusty, weak.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Erin swallowed, fighting to stay calm. \u201cLee, who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-love y-you, s-son...\u201d His eyes fell closed. His breath came out in a soft rush.</p><p>\u201cLee? Lee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis heart\u2019s stopped!\u201d Jude\u2019s snarl. He stepped back and yelled, \u201cGet your asses over here, now! He needs help!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLee?\u201d Her whisper.</p><p>Then Jude\u2019s arms were around her and he hauled her back. A woman in a blue EMT uniform pushed by her, followed immediately by two men.</p><p>But Lee still wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t breathing.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Story of her life.</p><p>And Lee\u2019s death.</p> <p>Erin watched the swirl of red lights fade away. The EMTs had gotten Lee\u2019s heart started again, but they\u2019d been grim about his chances for survival.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you two even know he was down there?\u201d Antonio\u2019s fierce voice. He\u2019d arrived on the scene less than ten minutes ago.</p><p>Erin shook her head. The ambulance had vanished around a curve. \u201cWe...saw the car when we were passing through.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d called 911 on her cell phone. Antonio wouldn\u2019t be able to prove her story wasn\u2019t legit. Provided, of course, that Jude backed her up.</p><p>Antonio grunted. \u201cUh-huh. What, the two of you decided to go for an early morning drive on this shit-forsaken road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Jude murmured.</p><p>Thank you. He wasn\u2019t going to tell Antonio about her dream. Good. The fewer people who knew, the better.</p><p>When am I gonna die, Erin? You know, right? You can see everything.</p><p>When am I gonna die? She\u2019d been a freak show when she lived with her mother\u2019s people.</p><p>The voices from her past needed to learn how to shut the hell up sometimes.</p><p>\u201cUm...\u201d Antonio scratched his chin. \u201cThese damn winding roads. Recipe for fucking disaster, especially with the rains we had.\u201d</p><p>Erin stiffened. No, no, that wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Flawed.</p><p>Her father had been able to see all sorts of deaths. Those easy passings that came in sleep. Those tearful last moments surrounded by family and friends.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>Erin only saw the brutal deaths. Those caused by the hand of another. Blood-soaked.</p><p>Murders.</p><p>\u201cI think you better check the scene.\u201d Not an accident. No way. Not if she\u2019d dreamed it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His gaze snapped to her. \u201cWhat do you know, Jerome?\u201d</p><p>She held his stare. \u201cCheck the scene.\u201d If she was right, and Erin knew she was, there would be signs. Skid marks on the road. Paint from another vehicle on Lee\u2019s car. Something.</p><p>Lee had been forced off the road. Left to die.</p><p>Not an accident. Not some bad slip of fate.</p><p>Deliberate. Cold.</p><p>The man had enemies, everyone knew that. But Antonio would have to find out just who hated the lawyer enough to kill him.</p><p>Antonio raised one dark eyebrow. \u201cRumor is...you and old Lee got into one hell of an argument in front of Judge Went yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Erin tensed. Word traveled too fast in this town. \u201cWe\u2019re lawyers. That\u2019s we do. Argue. \u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...\u201d</p><p>Now what was that supposed to mean?</p><p>\u201cJust strikes me as odd. First the perp you\u2019re after winds up slashed and smiling, and now the attorney who pissed you off in court is barely breathing.\u201d</p><p>Her own breath caught. \u201cYou think I\u2019m involved in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with me,\u201d Jude said, voice dark and menacing. \u201cAll night.\u201d</p><p>Antonio\u2019s eyes widened, just a bit. But the guy didn\u2019t look intimidated. More like impressed. His gaze darted over her.</p><p>\u201cLike that, huh? Hunter, you work fast.\u201d</p><p>Her face flamed. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, Antonio.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cGot to question things, ma\u2019am, especially considering the report that landed on my desk right before I got the call about this accident.\u201d</p><p>Jude stepped toward him. \u201cThe blood from her house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. It was a match, just like you thought.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back and forth between the two men. \u201cA match?\u201d Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good. She didn\u2019t need the fist knotting in her gut to tell her that. Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>\u201cThe blood on your walls belonged to Bobby Burrows.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cNow why the hell would the stalker\u2014you said you had a stalker after you\u2014kill old Bobby and leave his blood dripping onto your pretty hardwood floors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a sick freak!\u201d And he was giving Bobby to me as a present.</p><p>She\u2019d gotten enough of his presents to know his routine. If someone pissed her off, if someone hurt her, he stepped in.</p><p>I keep you safe, when you don\u2019t even know it.</p><p>Bile rose in her throat. She had argued with Lee. Antonio had that part right. Had the stalker asshole been there, watching?</p><p>And she hadn\u2019t even known it?</p><p>And, oh, hell, had he gone after Lee, too? Because of her?</p><p>\u201cHas to be a reason the guy killed Bobby,\u201d Antonio continued. \u201cThis shit\u2019s never random.\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t. She opened her eyes to find the captain watching her.</p><p>Weighing her.</p><p>\u201cThink you might know that reason, Jerome?\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Tony.\u201d Jude shook his head and stepped forward. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time for this conversation and you know it. I\u2019ll come to the station, check the report\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her story I want,\u201d Antonio said. \u201cThere\u2019s a murderer out there, ADA. One who seems to have killed for you.\u201d</p><p>Not the first time, either.</p><p>\u201cThere something else about this case you need to tell me?\u201d</p><p>Jude glanced at her.</p><p>Erin shook her head. They were starting to attract attention. The other cops who\u2019d arrived on the scene were eyeing them with outright curiosity, and, once the news about Bobby\u2019s blood leaked\u2014and it would leak\u2014she\u2019d be kissing her new life good-bye.</p><p>And she\u2019d barely had time to unpack.</p><p>He\u2019d found her too fast.</p><p>Or maybe he\u2019d never lost her. Goosebumps rose on her arms.</p><p>Antonio\u2019s eyes tightened to slits. \u201cI want to know everything about this bastard, you got me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking ease up, Tony.\u201d Jude\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cDon\u2019t push this now. We\u2019ll both come to the station, but not now.\u201d</p><p>Not when they had such an eager audience.</p><p>Antonio gave a grim nod and spun on his heel, calling out to the uniforms, \u201cRake the scene! Every damn inch.\u201d</p><p>After a beat of time, Jude turned to face her. \u201cMore secrets, huh, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Her heart almost broke, but her chin lifted. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure that jerk after me had anything to do with Lee\u2019s accident.\u201d</p><p>But her instincts said he did. \u201cLee\u2019s a defense attorney. Victims, criminals\u2014they can all get pissed at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed enough to try killing him?\u201d</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Or maybe her Romeo was out there, grinning his ass off. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stand out there with the cops and the wreckage any longer. She marched away, or tried to in the muck and mud, not waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cErin! Erin, shit!\u201d The rustle of his clothes and the slog of his footsteps behind her. He grabbed her arm. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>His hold jerked her toward him and Erin glared up at his face. \u201cNot now, hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you keep saying that.\u201d His nose nearly brushed against hers as he brought his face in close. \u201cNewsflash, sweetheart, the asshole after you killed a man. This isn\u2019t some game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought it was!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna bring the bastard down, but everything you know about him, every single thing that has happened to you because of him\u2014I have to know.\u201d</p><p>Erin exhaled on a hard breath and knew there was no choice. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>How would he look at her, she wondered, when he learned the truth?</p><p>At least I had one night with him.</p><p>One wild night.</p><p>Just how many secrets was the woman keeping?</p><p>Jude sat at his desk, eyes on the computer screen before him, but not really seeing the damned thing.</p><p>Erin.</p><p>The woman was fire in his hands. The hottest, sexiest thing in bed he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>And she was dangerous. So dangerous.</p><p>Because she\u2019d been lying to him.</p><p>The woman had a freaking twisted killer on her trail. One the cops couldn\u2019t catch or stop, so yeah, maybe she had a reason for the skittishness he saw.</p><p>But there was more. He knew it.</p><p>\u201cSo, stayed at the girlfriend\u2019s last night, huh?\u201d Zane asked as he strode into Jude\u2019s office. The guy always made himself right at home. Boundaries didn\u2019t exist so much for Zane.</p><p>Jude grunted and rubbed a hand over his bleary eyes. He\u2019d stayed at the crash site, keeping an eye on the uniforms and the crime scene guys, and sure enough, they\u2019d found black paint on the side of Lee Givens\u2019s car.</p><p>He\u2019d been forced off the road. No doubt in Jude\u2019s mind.</p><p>But was the hit tied to Erin?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame ya.\u201d Zane crossed his arms and leaned back against the window frame. \u201cThat\u2019s one hot woman.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s hand dropped. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d A snarl built in his throat. Zane played free and easy with the women in the city, Other and human.</p><p>But Erin was off limits.</p><p>\u201cOooh...\u201d Zane smiled. \u201cSore spot, huh?\u201d</p><p>Jude considered planting his fist in the demon\u2019s face. Not like it would do permanent damage, and wiping that smug-ass grin off Zane\u2019s face would sure make him feel better.</p><p>\u201cYou found out yet just what she is?\u201d</p><p>A woman. That\u2019s what she was. Zane was a good hunter, but he could also be one Grade A Asshole.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll stop by the courthouse later. Get a good look at her.\u201d Zane nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what she is.\u201d</p><p>Right. Jude just bet the guy would \u201cget a good look\u201d at her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t use glamour.\u201d Glamour was the magic demons used to hide their true selves from the world.</p><p>Demons really did look a lot like humans. The only physical difference was generally their eyes. A demon\u2019s real eyes were pitch black\u2014not just the iris, but the whole eye, even the sclera. When it came to demons, there was never any waiting until you saw the \u201cwhites of their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Only darkness was in their eyes.</p><p>Glamour hid that darkness. The magic let the demons blend right in with everyone else.</p><p>Sure, the ancient demons were rumored to have a few more...obvious physical differences. But Jude had never encountered one of the horned and tailed bastards that some whispered about late at night. He figured they weren\u2019t real.</p><p>Hard to tell in this world, though.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, Donovan.\u201d Zane shrugged. \u201cLet me get a look at her, I\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>Erin was a hybrid. He knew that. She\u2019d said her father was psychic. Not a demon, just psychic.</p><p>But she\u2019d been lying. Shadows had appeared in her golden eyes.</p><p>Tonight, he\u2019d get the truth from her.</p><p>\u201cYou turn up anything on her background yet?\u201d he asked the demon.</p><p>The smile dimmed. \u201cYou know I hate doing the grunt work.\u201d</p><p>True. Zane liked to be out on the streets, kicking the shit out of the deserving. \u201cYeah, but I got seniority.\u201d Life could be a bitch.</p><p>\u201cAsshole.\u201d Zane shook his head. \u201cHer mom abandoned her, dropped her off on her father\u2019s doorstep when she was fifteen.\u201d</p><p>Jude tensed. Abandoned? Not really the shifter way. Even the damn coyotes kept their kids close.</p><p>Why would her mother leave her?</p><p>Fifteen. Right at puberty. The time of the first shift.</p><p>\u201cThe dad took her in, but he passed away during her first year of college.\u201d</p><p>Talk about getting a hard punch in the face. Abandoned by one, and death took the other. \u201cAny other family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I can tell. But with the mom? Could be.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s fingers tapped against the desk top. \u201cTrack the mom, see what you can find out.\u201d A shifter mother? And a shifter stalker. No way could he overlook that lead.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Jude frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dee?\u201d He hadn\u2019t seen her all morning.</p><p>\u201cPak called her on a vamp case.\u201d Zane looked down at his watch. \u201cRight now, I\u2019d say she\u2019s...oh, cutting the head off some poor undead asshole.\u201d</p><p>Probably. Dee did love her work. And if she was hunting during the day, she had the advantage.</p><p>Vamps were weak during the day. Almost human. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee always said that weakness leveled up the playing field. Of course, Jude figured the woman didn\u2019t really need any leveling up. She could take the vamps down just as easily when they were running at full power. A talented woman.</p><p>Jude rose to his feet. Time for him to do some hunting. No sense in Dee having all the fun.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Zane asked, straightening from the window.</p> <p>\u201cTo rattle some cages.\u201d And see just what the hell shook loose.</p><p>When Jude wanted, he could play the nice guy. Play.</p><p>But he could also be a real bastard.</p><p>He held his prey pinned against the wall, his forearm lodged against Michael McQueen\u2019s throat. \u201cNow we\u2019re gonna go over this one more time, Mickey.\u201d He smiled, and let the hyena shifter see his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m looking for the new shifter in town.\u201d</p><p>Mickey spat at him.</p> <p>Oh, wrong move. Jude threw the idiot across the room and swiped the back of his hand over his face. \u201cAre you trying to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not takin\u2019 me in!\u201d Mickey jumped to his feet. Quick little prick.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I am.\u201d Mickey liked to get a bit rough with his girlfriends. And he only dated humans. Guess beating the hell out of them was more fun for him than going up against someone with his own strength. \u201cBut before I drag your ass off to jail, you will answer my questions.\u201d</p><p>Mickey\u2019s red-rimmed eyes darted for the door. The guy reeked of alcohol. The tequila drifted off him in waves. It was barely one o\u2019clock, and Jude had found the shifter knocking them back in Delaney\u2019s bar.</p><p>Delaney\u2019s. On the surface, it seemed like a regular place, but the owner was one real witch.</p><p>Mickey picked up a table and threw it at Jude. He swore and leapt to the side, swiping out with his claws.</p> <p>\u201cDammit, you jerks are gonna pay for everything you break!\u201d Catalina\u2019s furious voice.</p><p>Noted. But no big deal because mostly, he just planned on breaking that idiot hyena\u2019s face.</p><p>Mickey screamed, a high, shrill animal cry, and hoisted up another table.</p><p>Jude sprang across the room and knocked the table out of the hyena\u2019s hands. Then he shoved the jerk up against the wall and pinned Mickey there with his claws.</p><p>Another desperate cry, one that had Jude\u2019s ears ringing. Damn hyenas. They had the shrillest voices.</p><p>Jude twisted his claws and Mickey whimpered. \u201cWho\u2019s the new shifter, Mickey?\u201d The guy was scum, but he knew every bit of shifter business that passed in the city. Hyenas and foxes always knew. They picked up every bit of gossip, every whisper.</p><p>Mickey shook his head. \u201cNo...new shifter.\u201d</p><p>Not the answer he wanted. Jude sighed. \u201cAh, Mickey, why do we have to do this the hard way?\u201d</p> <p>The hyena flinched, and a soft, familiar scent teased Jude\u2019s nostrils.</p><p>No, no way. She wouldn\u2019t be there. Couldn\u2019t be there.</p><p>But that scent\u2014his cock began to swell.</p><p>Had to be her.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>Ah, hell. Talk about piss-ass-poor timing.</p><p>\u201cJude\u2014what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Pretty much just what it looked like. Pinning prey.</p><p>\u201cHelp!\u201d Mickey the idiot shouted. \u201cThis freak\u2019s trying to kill me!\u201d</p><p>Jude twisted his claws, because he could.</p><p>The hyena\u2019s words choked off.</p><p>High heels slapped on the wooden floor. \u201cYou\u2019re in a public bar, you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he glanced back at Erin. Flushed face. Kiss-me red lips, and an are-you-crazy expression in her eyes. \u201cRelax. The chick behind the bar\u2019s a witch, the half-asleep asshole in the corner\u2019s a charmer, and this jerkoff is a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifter.\u201d A whisper from her sexy lips. Her nostrils flared, just a bit.</p><p>Of course she\u2019d know. Like to like.</p><p>Mickey whimpered and tried to appear pitiful. Jude had to give the guy credit\u2014he looked pitiful. But he always did.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice was still hushed. Maybe she wasn\u2019t buying the whole the-bartender-is-a-witch story. \u201cNo matter what he is, you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>A growl built in his throat. The rich scent of Mickey\u2019s blood teased him. Maybe it was time Erin figured out just who, what, she was dealing with.</p><p>And sleeping with at night.</p><p>\u201cNot a cop, sweetheart. Their rules don\u2019t apply to me.\u201d And what was she doing in the bar, anyway? Delaney\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly well advertised in this city. More of a paranormals only club.</p><p>Catalina\u2019s magic kept the humans out. They didn\u2019t know why, but they just always walked right past the faded blue building with the white French doors on Louis Street.</p><p>\u201cLady! \u201d Mickey\u2019s squeak. \u201cYou gotta help me! This ass-asshole\u2019s crazy. You need\u2014\u201d</p><p>He heard the inhalation of her breath. \u201cMickey McQueen.\u201d</p><p>The hyena blinked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wanted for three charges of assault and battery, McQueen.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and Jude would be collecting that bounty soon enough. \u201cI want the name, Mickey,\u201d Jude snapped, barreling right over Erin\u2019s words. She wasn\u2019t about to haul his prey away, not yet.</p><p>Mickey shook his head, a frantic move. \u201cL-lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave it your way.\u201d The burn of his lengthening canines filled Jude\u2019s mouth. His gaze narrowed on the hyena\u2019s throat, on the pulse that thudded faster, faster. Jude lowered his head, teeth barred, almost tasting\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo new shifters\u2014 none! \u201d Mickey\u2019s scream. Frantic. Mickey liked giving pain, but he wasn\u2019t so much for taking it.</p><p>Jude stilled. The little asshole had to be telling the truth. Mickey had never been good at playing chicken.</p><p>No new shifters. But one new shifter was right beside him. How come Mickey didn\u2019t realize that?</p><p>Erin grabbed Jude\u2019s shoulder, jerked him back, and sent him hurling across the room.</p><p>Jude fell into a table. The wood gave way, smashing beneath him and sending his ass right to the floor. Hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for that one, too,\u201d Catalina said. The witch was just stating a fact. She didn\u2019t sound too interested in the chaos.</p><p>Then, silence.</p><p>His gaze tracked to Erin. The lady wasn\u2019t even breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cHot damn.\u201d An impressed voice, an annoying voice. Zane. He stood in the doorway, hands on his hips, and watched Erin with narrowed eyes and pursed lips.</p><p>Well, at least now he knew why Erin had showed up at Delaney\u2019s.</p><p>Mickey rushed toward the door, his claws out as he lunged at Zane.</p><p>The demon hit him hard and fast, and Mickey went down with a sigh shuddering out of him and his eyes closing.</p><p>Problem one solved.</p><p>Jude shoved up to his feet. Erin rounded on him, her hands fisted. \u201cYou can\u2019t attack suspects!\u201d</p><p>He lunged across the room. Caught one of those deceptively delicate fists in his hands. Kissed it. The woman had just tossed his ass ten feet and he wanted her. She was sexy and strong and her eyes were so dark and gold. Perfect.</p><p>Flawed? Not fucking likely.</p><p>The tiger inside was all but licking his lips.</p><p>\u201cMickey is guilty as sin,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe both know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he is,\u201d Zane said, stepping over the prone shifter and straightening his shoulders. His gaze swept over Erin, from her head to her toes. The asshole lingered a bit too long on her breasts. He came close to getting a jab in the face then.</p><p>She ignored the demon, keeping her attention on Jude. \u201cThere are laws, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman laws don\u2019t always apply to us.\u201d She should know that.</p><p>Her jaw worked. \u201cYou were going for his throat.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d protected the little prick. Mickey sure owed her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bitten, sweetheart.\u201d He dropped her hand and missed the touch of her skin almost at once. But Zane was watching with those too-sharp demon eyes of his. And Catalina was pretending to clean a glass, but he knew the witch caught every word, every look. \u201cJust trying to push some information out of him.\u201d It was the way he worked. He wouldn\u2019t apologize for threatening the hyena. Wasn\u2019t like Mickey was one of the \u201cgood\u201d</p><p>guys, not any day of the week.</p><p>Her arms crossed over her chest. \u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like your push worked to me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he catch your scent?\u201d</p><p>A furrow appeared between her brows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Jude glared at Zane, but the guy just crept closer.</p><p>Finally, Erin glanced over at the other hunter.</p><p>\u201cSome arm you got there, lady.\u201d Zane offered her a smile. The same flirtatious grin he tossed at every female he saw, and one that usually gave him good results. Smiles back, phone numbers, even a couple pairs of panties.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d She exhaled on a hard breath. \u201cI recognize your voice.\u201d She would. Shifters were great at recognizing tones and cadences in voice patterns. Came from their acute hearing. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who called and told me to come down here.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Jude had figured as much. Glaring, he said, \u201cI thought the plan was for you to stop at the courthouse.\u201d And not bring Erin into his hunt.</p><p>The demon shrugged. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t scheduled for court today. Had to improvise.\u201d</p><p>Improvise. Right. Zane had sent her right after his ass, and Erin had seen him at the worst moment.</p><p>Well, technically, it could have been worse. Mickey had still been breathing, after all.</p><p>\u201cYou said Jude needed me,\u201d Erin\u2019s voice heated. \u201cThat it was urgent, that I had to get down to this Delaney\u2019s place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the best bar in town.\u201d A murmur from Catalina.</p><p>Erin blinked.</p><p>\u201cHe did need you,\u201d Zane defended. \u201cWhy, you stopped the guy from crossing the line, from letting that wild beast out to attack and kill.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t speak at that. He\u2019d had control of his beast. He\u2019d had control for years.</p><p>\u2018Cause the tiger had gotten loose once. He could still hear the screams sometimes. His prey hadn\u2019t gone down easy.</p><p>He crept closer to Erin.</p><p>Zane\u2019s head titled to the right, and he stared hard at Erin\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too worried, lady.\u201d A pause. \u201cYou\u2019ve already seen the beast, haven\u2019t you, Ms. Jerome?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze darted to Jude.</p><p>\u201cAnd you weren\u2019t even a little afraid of him, were you?\u201d Zane pressed.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t been. Not when she\u2019d seen him in tiger form. Erin hadn\u2019t so much as backed up a step. No, no, she hadn\u2019t looked afraid, she\u2019d looked\u2014</p><p>Thrilled.</p><p>Excited.</p><p>Not like a woman who was terrified of shifters.</p><p>And when he\u2019d come back to her after the hunt, she\u2019d done her one-eighty and seduced him.</p><p>Hands off to\u2014</p><p>Hands most definitely on.</p><p>Not afraid.</p><p>Considering the shifter asshole after her, her attitude was a bit...surprising, to say the least.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of a little cat,\u201d Erin said, voice soft and husky.</p><p>Little?</p><p>Zane\u2019s loud laughter shook the room.</p><p>Jude was pretty sure he heard Catalina snort.</p><p>More laughter came from the demon. Then, after a couple of deep breaths, he managed to say, \u201cYeah, I guess if I were strong enough to throw him across the room, I wouldn\u2019t be scared, either.\u201d</p><p>The guy could throw him across the room. And had. At least three times sprang to mind. Two of those instances had happened right there in Delaney\u2019s. Some nights, the place could get good and wild.</p><p>Erin cast a glance toward Mickey\u2019s body. The hyena was still out cold. \u201cI need to call the precinct and get a squad car out here for him\u2014\u201d She broke off, shaking her head. \u201cI-I need...\u201d Her voice thickened a bit and she lifted her hand, pushing her fingers against her right temple. \u201cTh-that h-hurts...\u201d</p><p>Jude stiffened and his stare jerked to Zane. The demon\u2019s laughter was completely gone now and he was focused totally on Erin.</p><p>Bastard. He\u2019d been waiting, biding his time to catch her off guard.</p><p>With a demon, one big-ass portion of his strength was psychic in nature. Demons could slip right into the minds of humans.</p><p>Erin could be half-human so would Zane be able to\u2014</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d A grated demand, shaking with fury. Erin\u2019s head jerked toward Zane and she bared her own teeth. Wickedly sharp teeth.</p><p>A low, pain-filled cry broke from Zane\u2019s suddenly white lips, and his knees gave way beneath him. Before he could fall face-first into the floor, the witch was there, catching him, wrapping her arms around him.</p><p>Then Catalina stared at Erin with fear in her eyes.</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>What did he see? What did he see?</p><p>The drumming of her heartbeat filled Erin\u2019s ears as she fought for control. The demon\u2014the tall, dark, good-looking asshole had to be a demon\u2014had slipped into her mind. She hadn\u2019t expected an attack. She\u2019d been too focused on Jude and the demon had slipped right past her defenses.</p><p>Broken.</p><p>Twisted.</p><p>What if he knew? If he\u2019d seen into her, he\u2019d know her secrets. If he told Jude\u2014</p><p>\u201cI want you out of my bar.\u201d A woman, her long hair so blond it almost looked white, cradled the demon. Her green eyes glinted with a swirling combination of fear and fury. A combination Erin could respect. \u201cI want you out, and I don\u2019t want to see you again\u2014 whatever you are.\u201d</p><p>Jude stepped in front of her. \u201cEasy, Catalina. I think old Zane was the one to draw first blood. And he\u2019d better explain himself, now.\u201d</p><p>The fire in Erin\u2019s temples had eased, but the ache that remained sent a wave of nausea through her. A demon\u2019s touch. Her dad had warned her about demons and their tricks. Some demons could slip so easily into the minds of humans. Some were strong enough to see thoughts, to walk in dreams, and even to control their prey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m not prey.</p><p>Zane wasn\u2019t looking quite as tan as he\u2019d been when he first sauntered into the bar. He was braced against the woman, Catalina, and she didn\u2019t so much as buckle beneath his six-foot-plus frame.</p><p>Zane licked his lips. \u201cJust...checking out the waters for you...hunter.\u201d</p> <p>Erin swallowed. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that again.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, very, very slowly, he lifted his arm from Catalina\u2019s shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t...worry. Won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d Jude\u2019s fierce voice.</p><p>\u201cJust wanted to see...what you were.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed. Not with fury\u2014that would have been good. Humiliation. What I am. No one knows, not even me.</p> <p>One person thought he knew, and that guy was a sadistic freak.</p><p>No, I\u2019m not like him. I won\u2019t ever be.</p><p>She hoped, anyway. Because with her mother\u2019s genes, there really weren\u2019t any guarantees that she wouldn\u2019t go bad one day.</p><p>\u201cNot demon.\u201d Zane\u2019s eyes were on hers now, his head up. She held that stare, refusing to look away. Erin wasn\u2019t really sure what had happened to the guy. Okay, what she\u2019d done to him. She\u2019d acted on instinct when she felt the probe in her mind.</p><p>There\u2019d been a push at her, shoving at her thoughts\u2014</p><p>So she\u2019d shoved right back.</p> <p>Instinct.</p><p>Her lip curled. Demon? Had he really thought she was like him? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d And just what the hell had Jude done?</p><p>Gone running back to his hunter friends and told them about her secrets?</p><p>Can\u2019t trust anyone. She knew that.</p><p>So why did it feel like she\u2019d just been punched?</p><p>Erin straightened her shoulders. \u201cIf this little game or test or whatever the hell it was has finished, I\u2019ll call the cops and get out of here.\u201d The sooner, the better.</p><p>\u201cErin.\u201d A rumble from Jude. Dark and intense.</p><p>Damn him. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cI told you what I am. You didn\u2019t need to have your friend attack me.\u201d</p> <p>Then, because her claws were almost out and her teeth were burning and the rage had her heart racing, Erin marched for the door. She\u2019d call for backup once she was outside. That\u2019s what cell phones were for\u2014screw making a call from the bar.</p><p>The demon and the witch very wisely sidled out of her way.</p><p>But Jude grabbed her arm, spinning her around, and she tumbled against his chest.</p><p>Too close. Her nostrils widened and she caught his heady scent. No, no, no.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t my plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it?\u201d Because she didn\u2019t believe him, not for a minute. He\u2019d wanted to know. He\u2019d said it himself. He\u2019d wanted that demon to see her. Thought the plan was to go to the courthouse. Asshole. He hadn\u2019t trusted her.</p><p>Granted, she hadn\u2019t trusted him, either. But Erin decided to ignore that point, for now.</p><p>\u201cYou just told me about your mother,\u201d Jude said, his hold tight. \u201cYou never said what your father was.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away from him. Too easy, that. \u201cHe was a man, Jude. Just a man.\u201d With psychic powers, sure. But her father had been all too human. After tossing one last glare at her hunter, she shoved open the glass door and strode into the harsh sunlight.</p><p>Silence. One minute. Two.</p><p>Catalina cleared her throat and pointed to the destruction that was her bar. \u201cNight Watch is going to be paying for that. Tell Pak I don\u2019t want a check this time. Cash only.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Her fingers trailed down Zane\u2019s cheek. \u201cNever gonna learn, are you?\u201d Then she eased away from him, shaking her head.</p><p>Jude glared at the bastard.</p><p>Zane winced and lifted a hand to his head. \u201cUh, some sympathy would be good here, man. I mean, your girlfriend just tried to fry my brain.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s back teeth clenched. Control. Probably a good idea. He should stay in\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd talk about being ungrateful. Where\u2019s my thanks? At least you know she\u2019s not a demon hybrid now. I got in her head enough to know she\u2019s human, part anyway. But she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude grabbed the demon and lifted him a foot in the air. \u201cYou hurt her.\u201d</p><p>Zane\u2019s eyes widened even as they flashed black. \u201cI\u2019m the one with the sledgehammer banging in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever hurt her again, got me?\u201d He didn\u2019t care how many cases they\u2019d worked together. \u201cA look\u2014you told me you just wanted a look to see if she was using glamour.\u201d Demons could see right past the glamour that disguised others of their kind, unless you were dealing with a level ten. Nothing and no one could penetrate a level ten powerhouse\u2019s veil.</p><p>The faint lines around Zane\u2019s eyes tightened. \u201cI was takin\u2019 a look. A real long, deep look into your girl.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and judging from the way she\u2019d looked at Jude before she\u2019d stormed out of the bar, Erin was pissed. Because she thought he\u2019d set her up.</p><p>And didn\u2019t I?</p><p>Aw, hell.</p><p>He dropped the demon. The agile asshole landed easily. \u201cWhy\u2019d your look hurt her?\u201d He\u2019d seen Zane work humans before. They usually had no clue what was happening to them. Zane\u2019s psychic skills, his ability to ferret out secrets, were part of the reason why their cases broke so quickly.</p><p>When the two of them worked together, they were usually a pretty good team. Usually.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d it hurt her?\u201d Jude demanded again.</p><p>Zane\u2019s shoulders lifted, then fell. \u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d His lips thinned. \u201cNever happened quite like...that before.\u201d He exhaled.</p><p>\u201cThat lady packs one hell of a psychic punch.\u201d</p><p>Physically stronger, psychically stronger. No way was she a weak hybrid.</p><p>Shifting abilities or not.</p><p>\u201cThere is something...something you should know\u2014\u201d</p><p>A groan from the floor\u2014one that came from a slow-waking Mickey\u2014broke across Zane\u2019s words.</p><p>Jude glanced down at the shifter, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get deep in her mind,\u201d Zane said. \u201cShe blocked me before I could, but, hell, it was dark in there, man.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s eyes rose to the demon once more.</p><p>\u201cDark.\u201d</p><p>Now what the hell did that mean?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s power there. A lot of power. You\u2019d better watch your step with her.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cShe\u2019s the victim, Zane, not the perp. The job\u2019s to keep her safe.\u201d His goal wasn\u2019t to bring her ass down. Erin hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, no matter what Zane was rambling about with his \u201cdark\u201d crap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what she is...yet.\u201d</p><p>Jude jabbed his finger into the guy\u2019s chest. \u201cI do. She\u2019s the client, and our job is to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>A rush of air as Zane sighed. \u201cGotta wonder...what would scare her?\u201d</p><p>Sirens shrieked in the distance. Erin had obviously done as she\u2019d promised and called for her backup. Being the ADA, she\u2019d gotten that backup, fast.</p><p>Jude reached down and grabbed Mickey, jerking the other shifter to his feet. The hyena\u2019s head snapped back and his bleary eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cWhat did the woman smell like to you?\u201d he grated. Not much time. He had to know.</p><p>The bastard\u2019s lips peeled back from his pointed, yellow teeth. \u201cPrey.\u201d</p><p>No, that didn\u2019t make any sense. Sure, sometimes humans could smell like prey to a hunter, especially to one as screwed-ass up as Mickey. But Erin had shifter blood. The hyena should have recognized her true scent.</p><p>He caught sight of a patrol car outside. The car slammed to a stop. The cops jumped out, fast and ready for action.</p><p>Then they hesitated outside of the bar. They looked to the left, to the right, and Jude saw them begin to step away from the bar.</p><p>Erin grabbed the arm of the taller guy and yanked him toward the entrance. She shoved open the door. \u201cIn there!\u201d he heard her say.</p><p>The cop blinked and gave a small shake of his head.</p><p>Humans.</p><p>The spell had \u2019em confused. Jude sighed and pushed the shifter toward the door. \u201cMy collar.\u201d So he\u2019d be the one to take him out. He\u2019d be earning a couple grand from Mickey\u2019s case. But, unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t learned what he\u2019d wanted from the shifter.</p><p>The humid air hit him the minute he stepped outside Delaney\u2019s. The color had come back to Erin\u2019s cheeks, giving her skin a warm glow. Her eyes were warm, scorching as she eyed him with her hands fisted at her sides.</p><p>He helped load the prisoner. Jude fought the urge to give the guy an ass-kicking, and in moments, the cops pulled away with their prisoner.</p><p>Jude turned to her, his hands on his hips. Zane hadn\u2019t followed him outside. Had to give the demon credit on that one.</p><p>Staying inside was definitely the best plan for him.</p><p>He stalked to her slowly. The woman didn\u2019t back up even a single step. Jude raised a brow and asked the question that was driving him crazy. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mickey sense you?\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cThe hyena shifter\u2014you recognized him, why the hell didn\u2019t he recognize you?\u201d Her scent had been off that first day. A mix that had tempted and teased, but he\u2019d known right away that she wasn\u2019t human. Not completely, anyway. But, Mickey had only thought of her as prey. Didn\u2019t make a bit of sense. Like to like. The other shifter should have been able to recognize her, too.</p><p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t keep a low profile, can you?\u201d she grated, craning her neck to the left then the right as she searched the street. \u201cHow in the world you\u2019ve kept your tiger hidden\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s around.\u201d Thanks to Catalina. He pinned her with his gaze. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he know, sweetheart?\u201d The words were easy, but the demand underlying them was steel hard.</p><p>Her delicate nostrils widened. \u201cMost don\u2019t.\u201d A shrug. \u201cYour senses must be stronger than the average shifter\u2019s\u2014or you wouldn\u2019t have known about me at first, either.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were stronger. Came from being a white tiger. Rare breed, stronger shifter talents.</p><p>But if her scent couldn\u2019t be detected by the others...shit. The woman had some serious camouflage going on. \u201cSo you\u2019ve been just slipping right by your kind haven\u2019t you? Walking right past the shifters your whole life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my kind,\u201d she interrupted, voice rising.</p><p>His turn to blink. \u201cYeah, we are.\u201d A slow anger began to burn in his gut.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI-I\u2019m not going to do this with you, not now. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Because she hasn\u2019t told me a damn thing. The lady kept telling him, \u201cnot now.\u201d Well, when? He stared her down. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters...\u201d Her shoulders straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s not my world. When I didn\u2019t change at puberty, the shifter world kicked my ass out and left me in the cold.\u201d</p><p>Her mom abandoned her, dropped her off on her father\u2019s doorstep when she was fifteen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived as a human since then. I don\u2019t transform. For all intents, I am human, and that\u2019s the only world I know.\u201d</p><p>No, last night, she\u2019d found another world, with him. He\u2019d felt her beast, raging just below the smooth, controlled surface she presented.</p><p>Erin turned away and began walking toward her waiting car.</p><p>Stop her. \u201cShifters don\u2019t play by the same rules as humans.\u201d She knew that. He shouldn\u2019t have to shout it at her. Shouting.</p><p>He winced. Good thing that spell of Catalina\u2019s was keeping the humans away. \u201cSometimes we have to play rough.\u201d Like when he\u2019d dug his claws into Mickey the asshole.</p><p>Erin glanced back at him, black hair sliding over her shoulders. \u201cI know how shifters play.\u201d Anger. Fear?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find the bastard after you, and believe me, I\u2019ll play by any rules that I have to. I\u2019ll break any rules I have to, in order to find that bastard.\u201d Find him, stop him, put him in a shallow grave.</p><p>He\u2019d marked her.</p><p>The killer wasn\u2019t gonna play nice and easy. And Jude had never been that dumb nice-and-stupidly-easy type.</p><p>Their eyes held. When Erin spoke, her voice was soft but it carried easily to him as she said, \u201cMy job is about protecting the rules of the human world. Following the law.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes, you had to bend that law.</p><p>And maybe even break it in order to stop the bad-asses. \u201cHuman laws and human jails don\u2019t do much for our kind.\u201d Oh, yeah, maybe he\u2019d put too much emphasis on the our, but screw it. She was just like him beneath the skin.</p><p>Animal to animal.</p><p>Night Watch brought down criminals and sometimes, bringing down the supernatural scum meant putting a power-mad demon, a blood-sucking vamp, or even a rabid shifter out of his misery.</p><p>No, human jails couldn\u2019t hold a strong supernatural for long. Hell, a level ten demon could blow the walls out of a jail with barely a thought. And if a guard got too close to a vamp...</p><p>Some monsters couldn\u2019t be stopped by the normal means.</p><p>That was the reason Night Watch had been formed.</p><p>Night Watch\u2019s mission was to bring down the supernatural criminals\u2014one way or another.</p><p>When Mickey got to the jail, his ass would be tossed in a cage. Just where he belonged. And he\u2019d stay in the pen, doing his time, kicking the crap out of any human foolish enough to cross him.</p><p>But someone stronger than low-life Mickey...hell, no, a prison would never work.</p><p>\u201cAccept it,\u201d Jude said. \u201cYour laws just don\u2019t work for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cLike that bastard after you. Do you really think a cage will hold him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She swallowed and he saw the hard movement of her throat. His hands clenched when she said, \u201cI know it won\u2019t. Why do you think I\u2019ve been running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door to Catalina\u2019s swung open with a soft swoosh. Zane\u2019s head appeared and his brows lifted. \u201cJude, you ready to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Footsteps. The slam of a car door.</p><p>Jude swore when he saw his ADA drive away. Running away. \u201cNot finished, Erin.\u201d</p><p>Not by one hell of a long shot.</p><p>By the time she got back to her office, her hands had stopped shaking and the ball in the pit of her throat, that weird tangle of fear and fury, had finally dislodged.</p><p>Erin managed to make it through the rest of the day in a semi-normal fashion. No snarling at the other lawyers. No flash of claws or teeth.</p> <p>But Jude\u2019s words kept echoing in her head.</p><p>And they twisted with her mother\u2019s words, spoken so long ago. \u201cKill or be killed, that\u2019s the only way we know.\u201d</p><p>Her mother had been very, very good at killing.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to be like her mother. But the freak on her trail was giving her no choice.</p><p>Hell, yes, she knew the prisons couldn\u2019t hold some paranormals. She knew that. But the only other option\u2014</p><p>Death.</p> <p>She\u2019d never taken a life before.</p><p>The bastard was wrenching her choices away. Because she knew\u2014she knew he wanted her to kill.</p><p>So she\u2019d be just like him.</p><p>Dammit, no.</p><p>Erin went to court at the end of the day. A last-minute trip. The demon had been right. She hadn\u2019t been scheduled for a court appearance, but the cops needed her help, so she had to go. Erin needed a warrant to search a suspected drug dealer\u2019s house on Grant Avenue, and the cops waiting in the wings didn\u2019t have any more time to waste. They needed to get in that house before midnight.</p><p>At 6:09 p.m., the warrant was signed, the cops were ready, and Erin was so damned ready to get back to her house that she was all but growling. She headed across the middle of the big atrium of the courthouse, eager to\u2014</p><p>A rich, musky scent teased her nostrils.</p><p>Erin froze.</p> <p>Pine trees. Sweat. Animal.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest just as some guy with a too-large briefcase crashed into her back. He grunted an apology and stumbled away, but she didn\u2019t even spare him a glance.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment and drank in that scent.</p><p>He was there. Close enough to smell.</p><p>The whiff of his scent was deliberate. She knew it. She\u2019d learned that lesson the hard way. He could control his scent, disguise it. The bastard had told her about his little secret technique that fateful night. He\u2019d bragged about it.</p><p>But now, he was baiting her with his smell. Letting her know that he was close. Watching.</p><p>Her hands curled and her claws dug into her palms. Her eyes opened and her head turned to the left. There. The door marked exit in bright red letters. The stairwell.</p><p>Erin was at the door before she had time to fully realize what the hell she was doing. She shoved it open, sucking in a hard breath, then she climbed down the steps. The jarring metal echoed with every move she made, and she followed that scent with her palms sweating and the hair on her nape rising.</p><p>Tired of running. Tired of the blood.</p><p>The killings had to stop.</p><p>The stairs ended at another door. Big and thick. Erin knew the parking garage was on the other side of that door. She\u2019d mapped out the building before her first court date. Since she\u2019d attracted the freak, learning all the exits in the buildings she frequented had become a priority for her.</p><p>Erin licked her lips. The guy\u2019s scent hung in the stairwell. He\u2019d been there, recently, and he could be waiting for her now, just on the other side of that door.</p><p>Her fingers lifted. Touched the cold metal.</p><p>Was she strong enough to take him?</p><p>Not if he shifted. No way she could handle him then, but if he was in human form, well, his ass was hers. Nice little side benefit from her mother\u2019s side of the family.</p><p>Not that dear Mom had ever cared about how strong I was.</p><p>Erin exhaled. Run or fight? Her choice was simple, and she really was tired of running.</p><p>Her cell phone vibrated in her purse, the shaking followed immediately by a loud chime.</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>Erin grabbed the phone, yanking it out. Jude. She recognized his number now. She pressed the receive button on the screen and lifted the phone to her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d A whisper.</p><p>Static crackled in her ear. Stairwells were bad for cell phones, she knew that but\u2014\u201cJude, the asshole is here.\u201d Waiting for her on the other side of that door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d A bark. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCourthouse.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have been there. Another lawyer had been assigned to this case but he\u2019d wanted to wait until morning for the court order and the cops had needed someone to move now. \u201cParking garage.\u201d A quick breath. \u201cI can smell him.\u201d Almost feel him.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell out of there! Don\u2019t give him a chance to get close to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019m going to get close to him.\u201d No more running. No more dead bodies or blood in her home.</p><p>\u201cNo! No, I\u2019m coming. Shit, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen hurry,\u201d she whispered, and ended the call. Hurry because I\u2019m not going to run again.</p><p>He was too close. She couldn\u2019t just stand there and let him get away. She couldn\u2019t let him escape and attack someone else, for her.</p><p>Lee\u2019s bloody face flashed before her eyes. The guy was in ICU, hooked to a dozen tubes and needles. Because of her stalker?</p><p>No one else could get hurt. She couldn\u2019t stand by and let another person face the shifter\u2019s fury.</p><p>The sick bastard needed to be stopped, and she\u2019d do her damnedest to fight him.</p><p>Hurry, Jude.</p><p>And then the scent changed.</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p>When Jude\u2019s pickup screeched to a stop in the dim garage, his claws were out, his fangs barred, and he was ready to kick ass.</p><p>And he was scared\u2014dammit, scared. When the hell was the last time he\u2019d been scared of anything?</p><p>She\u2019d better be all right. Better be completely safe. Completely unharmed. \u2019Cause if she had so much as a scratch on her, the freak would beg for death.</p><p>Beg.</p><p>He shoved open his door, jumped out, and ran across the parking area. His nostrils twitched as he caught the other shifter\u2019s scent. He\u2019d stalked her, tracked Erin here.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice. Quiet. Steady.</p><p>Jude whirled around and found her standing in front of an open door, a stairwell.</p><p>She was alone. Hell. \u201cYou should have gone for help.\u201d The words blasted out of him, deeper than normal, because the beast was too close to the surface. She\u2019d stayed there, come looking for the freak. Was the woman crazy?</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. \u201cI\u2019m sick of running, Jude. I tried that. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not how I\u2019m going to play this game anymore.\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them in two seconds flat. Jude grabbed her arms and pulled her toward him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. He\u2019s a killer. A cold, seriously fucked-up\u201d\u2014he could still see the blood on her walls and the grin that he had sliced across Bobby\u2019s face\u2014 \u201ckiller.\u201d A game. His hold tightened on her. \u201cIf he gets hold of you, he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what he\u2019ll do.\u201d Erin jerked away from him. Just broke from his grasp as if he weren\u2019t even holding her.</p><p>Why do I keep forgetting how strong she is?</p><p>Her eyes were stark. \u201cHe caught me once before.\u201d</p><p>His heart seemed to stop. No, not here. He didn\u2019t want to learn this here, with that bastard\u2019s stench in the air around him.</p><p>Jude swung away from her, his gaze searching the shadows of the garage. \u201cHow the hell do you know he\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Jude glanced back at her. \u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>Her hand lifted, pointed to the right. \u201cHe left me a present.\u201d</p><p>He stalked forward and saw the roses propped up against the cement wall.</p><p>Fresh. Bloodred. Not a bloodstained message this time. Flowers.</p><p>Oh, yeah, a real perfect Romeo.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Lee\u2019s parking space.\u201d No emotion in her voice.</p><p>Jude\u2019s eyes lifted and he saw the reserved spot with the lawyer\u2019s first initial and last name.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a card, but I-I haven\u2019t read it yet.\u201d</p><p>He would. Jude grabbed the flowers, jerked out the card and tossed the roses onto the pavement. The scent of the flowers was sickeningly sweet, combining with the stench of the shifter, a stench that seemed lighter now, weaker.</p><p>\u2018Cause the bastard was gone.</p><p>For now.</p><p>With steady fingers, Jude pulled out the card. Maybe he should have taken it to Tony. He should have used gloves, he should have\u2014</p><p>Did you like my present?</p><p>What in the hell? His gaze flew to Erin, and he found her staring at him, her body still.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jude shoved the note back into the envelope. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d A car horn sounded in the distance. The place was all but deserted. He knew most of the lawyers and assistants would have checked out around five. Being there, standing in that empty garage felt too much like a trap.</p><p>One Jude wasn\u2019t about to get caught in. \u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cThe note, Jude. What did it say?\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. \u201cScrew your car, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d He shoved the note in his pocket. If the jerkoff had been dumb enough to leave any prints, and Jude figured the guy hadn\u2019t, they were probably long gone by now. A guy smart enough to sneak into a police station and kill a man while the cops were less than twenty feet away really wasn\u2019t gonna be the type to leave fingerprints on his little delivery.</p><p>Crossing to her side, Jude reached for Erin\u2019s arm. She didn\u2019t fight him, and he knew the lady could have used her strength.</p><p>She climbed in the passenger side of his pickup. He slammed the door shut behind her, raced back around, and jumped inside.</p><p>He cranked the truck and the engine snarled to life. His fingers curled around the gear shift.</p><p>\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d Her hand brushed over his. Soft. Delicate.</p><p>With an effort, he managed to unclench his jaw enough to growl, \u201c\u2018Did you like my present?\u2019\u201d</p><p>A sharp inhalation of air. Her hand fell away and she sagged back in the seat.</p><p>He twisted the wheel, slammed on the gas pedal, and got the hell out of there.</p><p>The green pickup raced down the street, the motor rumbling as the tiger drove away, too fast.</p><p>Running scared. He watched that truck, and he smiled.</p><p>Erin had found his note. She knew what he\u2019d done for her. Proving his love wasn\u2019t hard. He enjoyed giving presents to his mate.</p><p>The tiger would soon realize he didn\u2019t have a place in this equation. Erin would know he didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Just the two of us, love. Just us.</p><p>He\u2019d been angry when he found the shifter at her house. In her house.</p><p>No other male should be so close to Erin.</p><p>But he\u2019d investigated the tiger today. Found out that he was a hunter. One Erin had foolishly hired.</p><p>As if the bastard would be a match for him.</p><p>Perhaps Erin had already realized her mistake.</p><p>He could still smell her. He\u2019d been so close to her today. Close enough to touch and to taste.</p><p>When she\u2019d found his roses, had she smiled? Had her lips lifted in that slow, beautiful smile he liked so much? Erin loved red roses. Always had.</p><p>That dick of a lawyer never should have gone after her like he had in court. The prick had been in her face, screaming.</p><p>No one treated Erin that way.</p><p>The traffic light turned red and he walked across the street, keeping his gaze on the shrinking taillights.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to see Erin again. Couldn\u2019t wait to claim her. It had already been so long since he\u2019d held her body beneath his and given in to the hunger.</p><p>Did she miss him as much as he missed her? Did she long for him?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>The answer came from the beast inside. The beast that wanted Erin just as much as the man did.</p><p>Soon it would be time for the games to end.</p><p>Time to take what was his.</p><p>If the tiger got in his way again, well, he\u2019d just slice the bastard apart. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time he\u2019d killed a rival.</p><p>Not the first time. Not the last.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cYou just missed my exit.\u201d The first words she\u2019d spoken since they left the parking garage. Erin thought the words came out pretty calm. Pretty steady.</p><p>Did you like my present?</p><p>She\u2019d managed, barely, not to flinch when Jude told her the words of the note. But even before he\u2019d said them, she\u2019d known.</p><p>It was the freak\u2019s MO.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to Jude\u2019s face. His jaw was clenched, the eye she could see narrowed. \u201cJude?\u201d Her hands were balled into fists. The better to not touch him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to your place.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his gaze off the road. \u201cThe bastard was there last night, he was inside the night before that. Sweetheart, your place is sure as shit not safe.\u201d</p><p>But it was hers. And right then, she needed some security, some\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending the night with me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>The truck slowed, then turned off on the next exit. \u201cAnd before we get there, you\u2019re gonna start talking. You\u2019re gonna tell me everything I need to know about that asshole.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019ll turn from me. Jude won\u2019t touch me again.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t look at her with hunger in his eyes. Wouldn\u2019t touch her with desire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fingers uncurled and pressed against the tops of her thighs. No choice. \u201cI-I think he attacked Burrows and Lee because he was...giving them to me as presents.\u201d Yeah, sounded sick and twisted as all hell\u2014because it was.</p><p>His knuckles tightened around the wheel but he didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>\u201cHe watches me. It\u2019s what he does.\u201d Always watching. \u201cIf he sees someone that he thinks hurts me or disrespects me, then he attacks.\u201d And in the case of Burrows, leaves a body for her to find.</p> <p>Because that was the kind of present every girl dreamed of. Forget diamonds. She wanted mutilated dead men.</p><p>No, no, even she wasn\u2019t that broken.</p><p>\u201cOne hell of a Prince Charming you got there.\u201d The engine revved as he shot off the exit ramp and down the long, deserted stretch of road.</p><p>Tell me something I don\u2019t know. \u201cHe hurt a man I dated back in Lillian. My...friend was shot. The bullet barely missed his heart.\u201d A human. He\u2019d been in the hospital for weeks. When he\u2019d gotten out, she\u2019d stayed the hell away from him.</p><p>Stayed away\u2014yeah, leaving the city definitely counted as staying away. The real bitch was...she\u2019d cared for him, but she\u2019d had to leave to keep him safe.</p> <p>Ben wouldn\u2019t have survived much longer in her world.</p><p>\u201cNo one else but me. You\u2019re mine, Erin. Blood, bones, beast\u2014mine.\u201d She\u2019d never forget that voice. Whispering to her in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cThe first time I ever heard from the guy,\u201d she licked her lips and said, \u201che sent me roses. A dozen red roses.\u201d</p><p>Jude flinched.</p><p>Roses. Just like the ones that had been left in Lee\u2019s parking spot. The truck flew under the streetlights. \u201cI used to love red roses.\u201d He\u2019d taken that from her, too. Now when she saw them, her entire body tensed up, and she could only think of blood and death. She swallowed and looked out the window at the blur of pine trees. \u201cHe sent me a note with them. Told me I was the woman he\u2019d been looking for his whole life.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d been flattered. Excited. Nervous. Smiling and looking around the office as she tried to figure out who her secret admirer really was.</p> <p>\u201cI got mugged a few nights after that.\u201d A rough laugh broke from her lips. \u201cI could have taken the guy. He was a kid, couldn\u2019t have been more than fifteen, but I was with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans.\u201d</p><p>A nod, one she didn\u2019t even know if he saw because she wasn\u2019t ready to look back at him yet. Since moving in with her father, she\u2019d always stuck with the humans. They might fear her sometimes, when she slipped up, but at least they\u2019d never thrown her away. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to see\u201d\u2014 how strong I am, how deadly I can be\u2014\u201cso I gave the guy my purse.\u201d Not like she\u2019d had much money in the bag. Maybe thirty bucks. No credit cards.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d He turned off the winding road. Took a left. \u201cRomeo punished the mugger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed his claws to slice open his throat.\u201d She glanced down at her own nails. Short now, manicured. What a joke.</p><p>\u201cSomeone saw them fighting and called the cops. He didn\u2019t get to finish the kid.\u201d The boy had survived, barely. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have even connected the stories. I was mugged. Some kid on the news had a knife wound.\u201d Right. \u201cI mean stuff like that happens every day.\u201d</p><p>He pulled into his drive. She could see his cabin. Right where the woods and the swamp seemed to meet. A stark building standing against the glittering stars and the glow of the moon.</p><p>Jude killed the ignition, but made no move to get out of the truck. Neither did she. Get it over with. Tell him everything.</p> <p>A touch on her shoulder.</p><p>Erin whirled around and found Jude staring at her with blue eyes that shone in the dim interior of the pickup.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out it was your admirer? \u201d</p><p>She licked her lips again. Nervous habit. Erin saw his gaze drop, then rise, slowly, back to hers. \u201cWhen I-I got home from work the next night, my purse was there. Stained with blood. He left me a note. The bastard always liked his little notes.\u201d Though he\u2019d never left a fingerprint on them. She\u2019d checked. The guys in the lab had owed her a few favors back in Lillian.</p><p>His note had been simple. Terrifying.</p><p>I made the bastard pay.</p><p>After that, he\u2019d broken into her house. The first time. No security system had kept him out. And, being like she was, getting a dog, a really big, mean-ass dog, hadn\u2019t been an option.</p><p>Not that a dog would have stopped him. Or even slowed him down.</p><p>Erin wanted to drop her gaze and because she wanted to, she didn\u2019t. Lifting her chin, she stared into Jude\u2019s eyes and said,</p><p>\u201cThings escalated from there.\u201d The scar seemed to burn.</p><p>Tell him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you ran.\u201d Flat. Jude shook his head and drummed the fingers of his left hand against the steering wheel. \u201cNo cops\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLillian isn\u2019t like Baton Rouge.\u201d Too small. Not quite the atmosphere and size most paranormals craved. \u201cThe cops there wouldn\u2019t have had the first clue about how to deal with this guy.\u201d</p><p>The drumming fingers stilled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a clue.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she knew that and Jude had given her hope. Maybe the nightmare would finally end. Maybe.</p><p>Not alone now.</p><p>She reached for him, skimming her fingers down his cheek. She loved the soft sting of the light stubble on his flesh.</p><p>Jude stilled. His gaze held hers. Then his head moved, a graceful curl into her touch, just like a cat seeking a good rub.</p><p>The truck\u2019s cab suddenly seemed very, very small.</p><p>Tell him.</p><p>But he was looking at her with hunger and need and such lust on his face. In his eyes.</p><p>I want him. Just like before. No holding back. No worrying about hurting him.</p><p>They were alone out there. Far away from prying eyes and listening ears.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>One more time. She wanted him again. Couldn\u2019t she be greedy? A little greed never hurt anyone.</p><p>Her tongue swiped along her lower lip and she wished that she could taste him.</p><p>Do it.</p><p>She leaned toward him and heard the hard rasp of his breath. Her lips hovered over his.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know\u201d\u2014the words were a growl, so deep and rough they sent a shiver over her\u2014\u201cnot to play with a tiger?\u201d</p><p>Oh, but a tiger shifter was exactly the kind of guy she wanted to play with. \u201cI can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d The words slipped out and after a second, she jerked back, horrified. No, she\u2019d said\u2014</p><p>His head tipped back and his brows lifted. \u201cAh...makes sense.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>He caught her hand, pulled it between them. \u201cThe humans didn\u2019t like it when you played rough, huh?\u201d The tips of her claws had just begun to appear.</p><p>\u201cI have a...hard time holding back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna complain over that.\u201d His hold on her hand tightened. \u201cNot gonna complain one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be the first who didn\u2019t.\u201d Could she not keep her mouth closed? Erin tried to tug her hand back.</p><p>No dice. The tiger wasn\u2019t letting go. She could force the issue but...</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve been with damn idiots. A woman with power is a fucking beautiful thing to behold.\u201d His eyes held the glow of the beast. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d just\u2014oh, hell. \u201cI got to third base for the first time when I was seventeen. The guy was the high school quarterback.</p><p>I-I\u2019ve always been strong and\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to hold him so tight.\u201d But she\u2019d almost broken both his wrists. When she\u2019d realized what was happening and eased her hold, he\u2019d run, much faster than he\u2019d ever moved on the field. Come Monday, no guy at the school had so much as given her a second look.</p><p>Freak.</p><p>\u201cIn college, I\u2019d been seeing this guy.\u201d Lyle had always been able to make her smile. \u201cThings got hot and my claws came out.\u201d</p><p>Erin, what the hell? You cut me! How did you...?</p><p>Her teeth snapped together. \u201cAfter that,\u201d she gritted, slamming the door on that particular memory, \u201cI learned fast that I had to always have control and be very careful in bed.\u201d Human lovers were too weak. She could break them if she wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>So she\u2019d taken her pleasure, weak though it had been, and she\u2019d done it by always holding herself back during sex. If she let go, her partners would have found out what she really was.</p><p>Not an option.</p><p>Jude unhooked his seat belt and leaned over her. \u201cI like your claws and you\u2019re welcome to hold me as tight as you want.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed against hers. Took. Tasted. His tongue slipped inside.</p><p>A moan rose in her throat.</p><p>His head lifted and he told her, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold back with me. Last night should have proven that to you.\u201d</p><p>It had. And being with him had made her want so much more.</p><p>The past was all around her then. Reaching out with greedy hands and claws, while the only man who\u2019d ever made her feel like a normal woman waited before her with bright eyes and a mouth that made her sex clench.</p><p>One more time. She needed him, just once more.</p><p>And she was going to have him.</p><p>Screw the voice that demanded she tell him all of her secrets. She didn\u2019t want to see pity in his eyes.</p><p>She wanted the lust that burned hot enough to singe her flesh.</p><p>Her fingers sank into his hair as she urged him close again, and she took his mouth.</p><p>No holding back. As wild as she wanted to be. Finally.</p><p>The fury of lust was in his kiss. She could taste the reckless need and the hunger. She loved it. Her heart pounded, drumming hard and fast in her ears, and she pressed against him, loving that thickly muscled chest. Damn, the guy was perfect.</p><p>But he had on too many clothes.</p><p>So did she.</p><p>Her tongue snaked over the raised edge of his scar, and, this time, the moan was his.</p><p>Her nipples pebbled, the points aching and hard. She knew that he\u2019d smell her arousal in the close confines of the truck\u2019s cab. It would be impossible for a guy like him not to notice.</p><p>If only the gear shift weren\u2019t so close to her leg, she could try to straddle him and\u2014</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cWe...have to talk...the guy after you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Talking wasn\u2019t what she wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re safe here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cOut here\u201d\u2014he ran his tongue over his lips as if catching her taste\u2014\u201cI\u2019d know long before anyone got close.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what she\u2019d thought. Out in the wild. The perfect place for her tiger. \u201cGood.\u201d Her right hand dropped between them and rubbed over the obvious bulge of his arousal. \u201cI want you\u2014 now.\u201d Oh, hell, had she just said that? Sounding all confident, like she wasn\u2019t shaking inside? What if he could see right through her? What if\u2014</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The edge of his growing canines appeared when he gave a hard grin. \u201cYour smell is driving me insane.\u201d Then his hand was on her thigh, shoving up her skirt. She hadn\u2019t bothered with panty hose. Living in Louisiana, a girl learned to ditch those at an early age. So his callused fingertips touched skin and sent a little shock right through her. Especially when those fingers curled around the inside of her thigh and slid up...</p><p>Her breath hitched. \u201cInside.\u201d</p><p>His mouth lifted in a half-smile. \u201cHell, yeah, sweetheart. I\u2019m going right\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed. \u201cI mean...\u201d His fingers worked up an inch and brushed against the crotch of her panties. Those panties were getting damp, fast. \u201cNot...here.\u201d Because the fear was always there in the back of her mind.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>He\u2019d be smart enough to stay back, so Jude wouldn\u2019t hear his movement. But he could use binoculars. She knew the guy would do just about anything to keep tabs on her.</p><p>No, no, she didn\u2019t want that asshole to see a thing. \u201cYour house.\u201d</p><p>One finger eased under the elastic edge of her panties and pushed up between her folds. Erin stiffened.</p><p>Not because she didn\u2019t like his touch, but because she did. Too much.</p><p>That finger stroked over her, spreading her cream in a long swipe and Erin gasped. \u201cInside.\u201d The house. She meant the house.</p><p>He pulled away. It seemed like more beast than man stared at her from his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d better move fast, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She shoved open the door. Fought to untangle herself from the seatbelt. Then she was all but racing for the porch, ignoring the chirp of insects and the distant lap of water.</p><p>He reached the door first, by about a good two seconds. She flew in behind him, mouth dry, body throbbing, so ready.</p><p>Jude caught her, yanking her close and crushing his lips to hers. Her back rapped against the wall and her mouth opened wider.</p><p>His cock pushed against her belly. Long and thick and just what she wanted.</p><p>No, he was what she wanted.</p><p>She grabbed the front of his shirt, jerked, and heard the pop of buttons.</p><p>He didn\u2019t lift his head. Didn\u2019t look horrified. No, he growled against her, and caught her skirt in his fist.</p><p>Her hands slid over his chest. Hot flesh. Strong man.</p><p>The skirt was bunched at her hips now and she knew her panties weren\u2019t going to last long, not when he got his claws on them.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t just want to be taken. She wanted to take. The tiger was about to see just how wild she could get.</p><p>The fingers that had curled to caress now flattened and she pushed against him, hard enough to make him stumble back.</p><p>\u201cErin? What the hell?\u201d</p><p>She caught his arms and spun them around so that he was the one pinned. And she smiled. \u201cLet\u2019s see how much you can handle.\u201d Power pulsed through her. The kind she\u2019d never really felt before because she\u2019d had to be so careful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not this time.</p><p>She locked his hands against the wall. His eyes widened. But then he flashed her that grin, that wicked grin that made her sex melt and her heart kick-start too fast. \u201cTake your best shot at me.\u201d</p><p>She would.</p> <p>Erin rose up on her toes and pressed her mouth against his throat. Right there. Where the pulse raced, where she could taste the beat of his heart. She touched him once with her lips closed. Then her mouth opened and she tasted him with her tongue.</p><p>And let him feel the edge of her teeth.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered, and her mouth moved to his shoulder. He\u2019d played with her before, an almost exact reversal of this position.</p><p>Only she wasn\u2019t playing.</p> <p>For shifters\u2014this spot, oh, yeah, it could sure be very sensitive.</p><p>She bit.</p><p>Jude shuddered against her.</p><p>Erin\u2019s hands released their hold and her fingers skated down his chest. And her mouth followed them. Lips and tongue. She touched the small, brown nipples. Then her mouth closed over one nubbin, and she sucked.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d His hands clenched around her hips and he tried to yank her closer.</p><p>Not yet.</p> <p>She used her grip to hold him back against the wall. \u201cJust getting started.\u201d There was more of him that she wanted to see, to touch, and most definitely to taste.</p><p>Her eyes dropped to the buckle of his belt. Her hands skated down his body and she lightly raked his skin.</p><p>Her fingers were steady when she unhooked the belt. The button popped free, and his zipper slid down with a nearly soundless hiss.</p><p>No underwear.</p><p>His cock bobbed toward her, the thick head glistening.</p><p>She just had to touch.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his shaft and he jerked, choking out a breath. Oh, she liked that. Erin squeezed, then stroked, a root to tip pump that had Jude tensing.</p><p>Erin lowered before him, her knees hitting the hardwood floor and her skirt fluttering around her. Just a taste. A quick sample.</p> <p>Her lips closed over him.</p><p>\u201cErin.\u201d Gravelly, barely human.</p><p>She took more of his length. Licked him. Sucked.</p><p>Enjoyed the hell out of the moment.</p><p>Her hand cradled the base of his cock, controlling the depth and motion as she tasted and took and licked.</p><p>His hands clamped down on her shoulders. He didn\u2019t push her away. Didn\u2019t pull her closer.</p><p>She looked up at him. Saw that his jaw was clenched. Those burning blue eyes were locked on her. Red stained his cheeks. And his expression\u2014</p><p>Erin swallowed.</p><p>A ragged groan broke from his lips. \u201cEnough.\u201d</p><p>One more swipe of her tongue then she rocked back on her haunches. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>He jerked her up. \u201cNow.\u201d A table was beside them. A big, sturdy wooden table with a lamp sitting back on the far edge.</p><p>He dropped her on top of the table. Pushed her legs apart. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her panties. One slice of his claws and they fell away.</p><p>Erin knocked the lamp out of her way. She heard the thud when it hit the floor. At least it hadn\u2019t bro\u2014</p><p>Long, strong fingers pushed between her thighs. Her head fell back against the table.</p><p>\u201cHot and wet.\u201d His voice was pure sex. So low and deep and rumbling.</p><p>Her legs dangled over the edge of the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy, \u201d he charged.</p><p>Yeah, like she was feeling all sane and in control right then. Erin squirmed beneath him. \u201cJude!\u201d</p><p>One finger thrust inside. He lowered over her. His left hand caught her shirt, wrenched it open. Then he shoved her bra out of the way.</p><p>When his mouth closed over her nipple, she gasped because dammit, she\u2019d wanted this. Erin arched toward him, riding his finger and twisting as she fought for her pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAw, damn, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>The eyes she couldn\u2019t remember shutting flew open. \u201cNow.\u201d This time, the demand was hers.</p><p>A grim nod. Then he pulled her closer to the table\u2019s edge. Fitted himself to her opening as he positioned the head of his cock. She loved that first brush of flesh on flesh. No condom for them. Just sex to sex and\u2014</p><p>His cock drove into her. No tentative thrust. Just a hard plunge. Balls-deep and so thick.</p><p>Her legs locked around his hips, and she slammed up to meet him. Again and again. Her body tightened.</p><p>His mouth took her breast again. Licking and sucking, scoring her lightly with his teeth while he kept thrusting. Driving as far into her as he could go. Hard and fast.</p><p>Just the way she wanted him.</p><p>His cock withdrew, then slid right back inside her, the length rubbing along her sensitive flesh. Her sex clenched as her climax approached. So close, so close.</p><p>He kissed her when she came, drinking in the sounds of her pleasure even as his hips pumped faster, faster, against her.</p><p>Her fingers dug into his back. She wanted to feel his release inside her, the hot splash of his climax.</p><p>Jude raised his head and stared down at her.</p><p>An aftershock, warm and sweet, rippled through her sex and he erupted. Her name broke from his lips as she saw the wave of pleasure sweep over his face.</p><p>She held him, with arms and legs, as tightly as she could. Held him and tried to make the pleasure last. Tried to memorize every feeling, tried to imprint the feel of his body on hers.</p><p>Because moments like this didn\u2019t last. Especially not for her.</p><p>After a time, he sagged against her, sweat slick on his body. Erin didn\u2019t loosen her hold. Not yet.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>A squeak sounded beneath her. Then a weird little creak. Then\u2014</p><p>They fell to the floor as the table gave way beneath them.</p><p>Her breath was knocked from her and the wood bit into her back and arms.</p><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Jude\u2019s flushed face. \u201cErin? Sweetheart, are you all right?\u201d He pulled her up, cradling her in his arms as his gaze darted over her body.</p><p>They\u2019d broken the table.</p><p>He was still lodged inside her. Spikes of pleasure still trembled through her body.</p><p>And they\u2019d broken the table.</p><p>Erin laughed, a helpless, rusty bubble of sound that lifted her lips.</p><p>Jude shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. And laughed again.</p><p>A deep rumble burst from him. Small lines appeared around his eyes and his mouth curved. She\u2019d never seen him smile so fully before.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d laughed. Laughed, and meant it. Not the fake crap that so often slipped out.</p><p>But really laughed.</p><p>She stared up at Jude. The man really was gorgeous. She should have noticed it from the beginning. How had she ever thought that he looked cruel or cold?</p><p>She traced his scar with a fingertip.</p><p>Sexy.</p><p>And\u2014damn it all\u2014she was very afraid that she was falling for him.</p><p>Erin hadn\u2019t come home.</p><p>He stared up at the dark house, his body taut as a slow anger pumped through him.</p><p>He\u2019d expected her to run home. Expected her guard to be there, standing watch again. He\u2019d planned for the asshole.</p><p>He\u2019d been more than ready to rip the hunter wide open.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t there. Neither was he.</p><p>A growl built in his throat. Not part of the plan.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way things were supposed to go, dammit. Why couldn\u2019t she ever show her appreciation? Why the hell did she keep jerking him around?</p><p>And if she\u2019d let that cat touch her...</p><p>His teeth snapped together.</p><p>The tiger shifter would be dying soon. And it would be a long, painful death.</p><p>This time, he\u2019d let Erin watch\u2014every moment. She\u2019d understand then. She\u2019d realize how much he loved her. She\u2019d see that he would do anything for her.</p><p>When he offered her the blood, she\u2019d smile that slow smile, and be his.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Jude\u2019s fingers trailed over her breast, skimming the nipple gently, then sliding under the round globe. Slowly, softly, then he touched her scar.</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t flinch and she didn\u2019t even pull away\u2014 pretty impressive, she thought. Swallowing, she stared up at the ceiling of Jude\u2019s bedroom. He was all around her, surrounding her with his scent and his body. A dangerous shifter. A man who could rip apart his enemies.</p><p>But she\u2019d never felt safer.</p><p>His thumb brushed over the raised flesh. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>No more running. She\u2019d decided that. No more running, no more hiding. Better start now. \u201cHe caught me once, broke into my home, reached my bedroom.\u201d She\u2019d woken to his touch. Cold claws sliding down her face.</p><p>Jude tensed against her, but he didn\u2019t speak and his hands didn\u2019t fall away from her.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really know how he does it but, he can hide his scent.\u201d Tricky bastard. \u201cMaybe herbs or something. Hell, maybe he can just control it at will. I don\u2019t know.\u201d A light chill seemed to cover her flesh. \u201cToday, I caught his scent because he wanted me to. That\u2019s the way he plays his games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was luring you out, and you walked right to the bastard.\u201d Anger there, vibrating in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of running,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this. He\u2019s not going to stop. He\u2019ll just keep killing and hunting me, and I can\u2019t keep running.\u201d The rules in this twisted game were changing. One way or another.</p><p>She wanted the warmth of Jude\u2019s flesh against her, but she couldn\u2019t just lay there anymore. She rose, pushing from the bed, pushing away from him, and tugged a sheet with her. Erin wrapped it around her body and stared down at him. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t shift.\u201d</p><p>A nod. He sat up, the bed covers draped over his naked groin.</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t have all of a shifter\u2019s enhanced senses either.\u201d Flawed. \u201cMy sense of smell\u2014yeah, it\u2019s strong.\u201d Actually, she\u2019d learned it was stronger than most shifter\u2019s. \u201cBut my hearing is just like a human\u2019s, so that bastard was able to sneak right up to me, and I didn\u2019t even know he was there until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>Blue eyes held hers. \u201cToo late?\u201d No emotion there. Flat and cold.</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the bed and she saw that his claws were out.</p><p>Not really so cold after all.</p><p>\u201cI never saw his face.\u201d Now she was the one without emotion. \u201cAs soon as I woke up, he shoved some kind of hood over me.\u201d</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>Razor sharp claws.</p><p>Fear.</p><p>How many nights had she stayed awake in her bed? Too scared to sleep because she\u2019d been afraid he\u2019d come back?</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsed his claws to...cut away my clothes.\u201d She paced away from him. The guy had been so fast. She\u2019d been stunned, terrified. \u201cI knew what he was going to do.\u201d Her chin rose. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t know how strong I could be. I fought the bastard.\u201d The stupid scar. In one way, she was like other wolves. Her wounds always left a mark on her body. Her flesh healed, but it didn\u2019t forget. Her hand dropped to hover over the rough ridge. \u201cI got my own swipes in, but he got his, too.\u201d</p><p>Jude jumped from the bed, caught her shoulders and hauled her close. \u201cErin...did he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got away.\u201d Run, run. The words had been driving her for so long. \u201cRan naked and bloody down the street. I was afraid he\u2019d chase after me, but\u201d\u2014her lip curved in a smile she knew wasn\u2019t pretty\u2014\u201che had his own wounds.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d snagged a pair of sweats and a T-shirt off a clothesline down the street. Sweet Mrs. Sara Copeland\u2014still doing her laundry the old fashioned way.</p><p>\u201cI had already planned to leave Lillian before that night. After the attack, I never went back to my house.\u201d A different hotel every night. Always looking over her shoulder. \u201cThe cops there couldn\u2019t help me. What were they going to do against a shifter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d he told her, his fingers tight around her.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She didn\u2019t doubt his strength. \u201cNight Watch was made for hunting guys like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMade for putting \u2019em down.\u201d</p><p>Oh, but his eyes were bright and he was still holding her, staring at her with need and worry in that gaze.</p><p>Tell it all. \u201cHe\u2019s after me because he thinks I\u2019m his mate.\u201d Shifters and their mates. For some of their kind, a primal, instinctual thing.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucking wrong.\u201d</p><p>Was he? \u201cHe\u2019s like me, Jude. A hybrid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re the same. Not weaker, stronger. They don\u2019t have a fucking clue.\u201d The voice from her nightmares.</p><p>\u201cSo? There are thousands of hybrids in the world. He can go pick one of them for his mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnew we were meant for each other, from the first moment I saw you.\u201d His weight had shoved her into the mattress.</p><p>A light shake from Jude. \u201cErin.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to swallow over the fist in her throat. \u201cHe\u2019s a hybrid, but-but he can still shift. I know, because I saw him change once.\u201d Deliberate. Everything with that asshole was deliberate.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSo what\u2019d the freak turn into? A bear? Coyote? A\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wolf.\u201d</p><p>She caught the slight widening of his eyes.</p><p>A wolf shifter. One of the strongest and the most dangerous of the shifters. And, unfortunately, one known to sometimes cross the line that led into the realm of the psychotic.</p><p>But Jude shook his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t change a thing for me. You really think I\u2019m afraid of some mangy wolf?\u201d</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t think he feared much. Perhaps he should. \u201cYou know what they say about wolf shifters. They can recognize their mates\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot at first sight, it can take time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I was his mate.\u201d Her hand rose between them. Flattened over his heart. \u201cA wolf shifter only gets one true mate.\u201d</p><p>Broken.</p><p>\u201cAnd for him, seems like I\u2019m...it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe hell you are.\u201d He lifted her up, bringing her to eye level and letting her toes dangle in the air.</p><p>Erin blinked. \u201cUh, Jude...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the idea out of your head, got me? Just \u2019cause some fucked up psycho thinks he\u2019s your mate\u2014hell, screw that!

Hard and deep and her toes curled and her heart raced and she held on to him and she hoped.</p><p>Let him be right.</p><p>Because being the perfect mate for that freak\u2014no, even God didn\u2019t hate her that much.</p><p>Her lips parted and his tongue swept inside. He still wanted her. He didn\u2019t care about the wolf so it was okay and she could tell him\u2014</p><p>He broke the kiss and muttered, \u201cWolves are insane. Everybody knows that.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart thudded to a stop.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re in a pack, they follow their alpha like blind dogs,\u201d Jude continued.</p><p>Not always. Some packs were family, strong and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd if the bastard is Lone, well, shit, that means even the pack didn\u2019t want him. And if pack doesn\u2019t want you, then you\u2019re fucking screwed,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>She shoved against him.</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>A quick step back. \u201cI need to shower.\u201d She grabbed the sheet, right before it started a fast slither down her body.</p><p>Fucking screwed.</p> <p>Her cheeks iced, then burned. Her right hand clenched, holding the sheet close to her chest.</p><p>\u201cErin\u2014what is it? What did\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she shook her head and skirted around him. About six more steps and then she\u2019d be in the bathroom. Just six more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a night. I just need to take a hot shower.\u201d To wash away the memories.</p><p>She pushed open the bathroom door.</p><p>\u201cLet me come in with you.\u201d</p><p>No. Not now. Too close to breaking. Erin cleared her throat. \u201cMaybe next time, tiger.\u201d Then she was inside, kicking the door shut behind her.</p><p>And turning the lock. Not that the flimsy lock would do much good if Jude wanted inside.</p><p>The soft creak of the floorboards reached her ears. Coming this way.</p><p>The sheet fell to the floor and she put both hands on either side of the sink, holding tight.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d He sounded hesitant. Maybe even worried. \u201cWhat happened, it doesn\u2019t change you.\u201d</p><p>No, it didn\u2019t. Nothing would change her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hide from me.\u201d</p><p>She stared at her reflection, seeing the eyes that held their own golden glow. The cheeks that had hollowed, the teeth that had lengthened.</p><p>Her claws dug into the undersides of the sink. \u201cI\u2019ll be out soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>More hesitation. She could feel it.</p><p>Then that soft creak again. He was moving away now.</p><p>Her breath flooded out.</p><p>If the pack doesn\u2019t want you, then you\u2019re fucking screwed.</p><p>Yeah, she was.</p><p>Because she was a Lone wolf, one fighting to survive. She had a psychotic mate on her trail, and a lover who apparently hated her kind.</p><p>Jude stared at the closed bathroom door, his fists clenched. He could hear the roar of the shower, so trying to speak to Erin then was not really an option.</p><p>She\u2019d locked him out. No mistaking the soft snick of the lock.</p><p>He could get inside, no problem. A quick shove against the door and he\u2019d be in that small room with her, the steam from the shower around them. He could join her in the shower stall. Take her into his arms and let the spray pour over their bodies.</p><p>If she thought her story about that asshole had changed the desire that he felt for her, well, she was dead wrong.</p><p>Her story had just shown how tough she was, how determined to survive. A woman with that much strength was damn sexy.</p><p>Nothing would make him stop wanting her.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But he turned away from the door. If Erin wanted space, he\u2019d give it to her. At this rate, hell, he\u2019d pretty much give her anything she wanted.</p><p>The bastard out there would pay. He\u2019d see to it. A wolf. There had been whispers and rumors about the wolves for years.</p><p>Centuries.</p><p>They kept to themselves, always locking tight in their packs. Very, very rarely did they mate with non-wolf shifters. The wolves fought dirty, they fought hard, and they generally fought to the death. It was their way.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been kidding when he\u2019d talked about the Lones. The wolves out there who either turned their back on the pack or who had the pack turn on them were the badasses the Other kept away from, if they were smart. Because some of the wolves had been known to become absolutely freaking insane.</p><p>When you were crazy, with the full strength of a wolf shifter, folks were smart if they avoided you.</p><p>Jude liked to think he was a smart guy. Not genius, nah, but smart enough. But he wasn\u2019t gonna be avoiding that wolf. He was going after him, and he would take the bastard down.</p><p>The dog had better get ready to do some running of his own.</p><p>The hunt was on.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jude!\u201d Dee\u2019s yell caught him the minute he stepped inside the Night Watch office. \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d be dragging your sorry butt in here.\u201d She flashed him a grin, then bent low over her desk as she dove into a pile of paperwork. \u201cI\u2019ve been digging up your girl\u2019s past, and man, she had quite a reputation.\u201d</p><p>Jude cleared his throat.</p><p>Dee\u2019s head popped up, a furrow between her golden brows. \u201cWhat? You got\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stepped to the side.</p><p>He saw Erin flash one hell of a sharp, toothy grin at the other woman.</p><p>\u201c\u2014something caught in your throat?\u201d Dee finished. \u201cAh.\u201d Now it was her turn to make a weird-ass gurgle in her throat.</p><p>\u201cUm, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re the new ADA, huh?\u201d Dee didn\u2019t flush. Come to think of it, he\u2019d never seen her cheeks redden. But her eyes did narrow as she fired an assessing glance over Erin.</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re right,\u201d Erin murmured, her fingers tightening around her purse strap. \u201cThe woman with the reputation.\u201d</p><p>Dee blinked and pasted what Jude knew to be a false smile on her face as she pointed to the left. \u201cThere\u2019s a waiting room for clients down that way. You can just go take a seat while I brief Jude on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life?\u201d Erin shook her head and took a step forward. \u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019d rather hear this.\u201d</p><p>Dee glanced at him. Jude shrugged. He didn\u2019t know what to expect from Dee\u2019s reports. She\u2019d been on the computer, with her hacker buddy Jasper, for the last twenty-four hours. If there\u2019d been secrets to uncover, she would have found them all.</p><p>So what kind of reputation did his little hybrid have?</p><p>He stepped toward Dee\u2019s desk. There was no sign of Zane, for now, and he figured that was probably a good thing. His associates sure seemed to be making friends right and left with Erin.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d Dee whispered when he got close to her. Her skin looked even paler today. The lady must be getting too much night hunting. If she didn\u2019t watch it, she\u2019d start to look like the vamps she tracked. \u201cYou knew I didn\u2019t realize she was there. Hell, I\u2019m not you, I can\u2019t smell a person from thirty feet away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were digging in my past.\u201d Erin\u2019s smooth voice cut across Dee\u2019s furious snap. She paused next to the smaller woman. Dee\u2019s skin seemed too white next to Erin\u2019s burnished gold. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes narrowed on him. A look that promised she\u2019d get her payback. Then she grabbed the leaning pile of paperwork. \u201cI found out that you can be a pretty tough bitch.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t alter.</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d Dee said, flashing a real smile. \u201cSo I tend to respect that.\u201d</p><p>The mask cracked on Erin\u2019s face for a moment as confusion flashed through.</p><p>\u201cThere were some stories about you getting a bit rough with some guys back in high school and college.\u201d</p><p>Her golden gaze shot to Jude\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNothing too bad. One guy had a sprained wrist, the other mild lacerations.\u201d</p><p>Erin winced at that. \u201cI can explain those.\u201d</p><p>Dee waved her hand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re Other. You like to play rough.\u201d Her hand stopped the wave and her index finger pointed at Erin\u2019s chest. \u201cYou stopped playing with the humans, though, when you realized you could hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d Erin asked quietly.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t. Jude knew she\u2019d just learned to play better. Holding the beast back. Not a lot of fun in that for their kind.</p><p>Especially not during sex.</p><p>Shifters were wild for a reason.</p><p>Dee\u2019s head cocked to the right. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe you just learned how to play better. But either way, there weren\u2019t any more stories about the down and dirty Erin after you hit twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>The down and dirty Erin? Jude tensed.</p><p>\u201cYou graduated from Tulane\u2014both for your undergrad work and your JD\u2014with honors. I figure you must have hooked up with some of the paranormals while you were in New Orleans. Always happens in the bigger cities. Guessing they didn\u2019t care about you being a bit out of control in the bedroom, or they showed you how to control yourself.\u201d</p><p>Erin gave a nod at that and Jude had to wonder\u2014which option was she agreeing to? And why the hell did the idea of Erin with other men make his jaw clench, his heart race and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDude, get your claws out of my desk.\u201d Dee\u2019s pissed voice. \u201cThis desk is new! I don\u2019t want you marking it the way you idiots always mark everything you want.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his claws from the wood. \u201cSorry.\u201d Hell, he\u2019d have to repair her desk. He hadn\u2019t meant\u2014</p><p>\u201cShifters do have a habit of marking things that don\u2019t belong to them.\u201d Erin seemed way too calm when she said that. \u201cA flaw in genetics, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like him, sweetheart.\u201d The words rasped out before he could stop them. Not that he would have stopped them.</p><p>She\u2019d put an icy wall between them since last night. He was tired of the distance and more than ready to knock that wall apart.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t like that asshole. Erin should know that by now.</p><p>Her eyes held his. So beautiful. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Was that a thaw? Was she going to open back up to him? Last night had been heavy for her, he knew it, but he sure didn\u2019t want her turning from him now.</p><p>No, now, she was supposed to turn to him.</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, great. Whatever this is\u201d\u2014Dee\u2019s hands fluttered between them\u2014\u201ckeep it in the bedroom, okay? I haven\u2019t been laid in two months and all this weird-ass tension in the air is making me jealous.\u201d</p><p>Now Erin did smile, a slow stretch of her lips.</p><p>Jude\u2019s heart kicked into his ribs.</p><p>\u201cEase up, Romeo.\u201d Dee\u2019s elbow rammed into his chest. \u201cBack to business.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cAfter law school, you did some work in different parishes. A few years later, you settled in Lillian. Started working for the DA\u2019s office and got the reputation for being the bitch who went after the monsters.\u201d A fast glance at Jude. \u201cNot your kind.</p><p>Rapists, domestic abusers. Those pigs that make me want to deliver a bit of my own abuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee, we\u2019ve talked about your eye-for-eye punishments before,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we talked about how they work. \u201d</p><p>Phones rang in the background. Jude caught Zane\u2019s voice, the guy was talking to Pak. \u201cCut through the crap. Did you find anything we can use on this guy?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s mouth tightened, just a bit, and her focus shifted back to Erin. \u201cI found out you were working the biggest case of your career and all of a sudden, you seemed to lose your nerve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I sure as hell didn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never lost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo missed court appearances. Five late arrivals. You didn\u2019t have your witnesses ready, and when it came time to step up to the plate in the Trent case, you struck out.\u201d</p><p>Dee could be a vicious fighter, one who went right for the jugular when a person least expected it.</p><p>Jude lifted his hand toward Erin because the lady looked\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d she snapped at Dee. \u201cYou get on your computer and you sneak around and you think you\u2019re looking into someone\u2019s life and you\u2019re learning about them. Well, you\u2019re wrong. I worked my ass off on that case. I did everything I could, but Trent had an in with Judge Harper. Court times kept changing, with no notice to me. Witnesses vanished, and even though I did my damned job, that bastard walked.\u201d</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t back down. He\u2019d never seen the woman back down. \u201cAnd when you were in the middle of this case, fighting to get that abuser locked up, that freak out there made first contact, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Erin shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI saw his pattern. The attacks on the people around you. When someone hurt you, pissed you off, or just got in your face, he attacked. This case was the deal breaker. You were fighting on your own, getting knocked around by the judge and the defense attorney\u2014and that guy out there made his move...on you.\u201d</p><p>Jude wrapped his fingers around Erin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIs this when he made first contact?\u201d Dee was the best research agent he\u2019d ever met, and the best attacker he\u2019d ever seen in a bar fight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A nod. \u201cYeah, yeah. I-I was working three other cases at the same time, but the Trent case was the one eating me alive.\u201d</p><p>Echoes of frustration. Anger.</p><p>Dee tapped her chin. \u201cHe found you on that case.\u201d Her gaze drifted to Jude as she eased into her chair and leaned back.</p> <p>Like the lady didn\u2019t have a care. \u201cJude, I\u2019d lay odds that if you went to that city, used your usual finesse, you\u2019d be able find him through that case.\u201d</p><p>The beast inside jerked on his leash. Hunt. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure I can finesse my way in Lillian.\u201d Finesse had to be slang for biting and clawing his way to some answers. His shoulders rolled. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ll be taking a road trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean we will.\u201d Erin\u2019s determined voice.</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cUh, civilians don\u2019t normally go on hunts.\u201d</p><p>Erin flashed her perfect smile, then punched down at Dee\u2019s desk. Her claws plunged into the wood. \u201cNot your normal civilian.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDammit! \u201d The human glared at them, hands fisted on her hips. \u201cNew desk, Donovan, got that? I expect a new freaking desk! I will go to Pak with this, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s dainty hand lifted. The claws were gone. Nice control. \u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Despite the little show she\u2019d just given, he shook his head. Claws really weren\u2019t going to do the trick on this one. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying you. I go.\u201d</p><p>He braced his legs apart and stared her down. \u201cTwice before, I\u2019ve had clients bitch to ride shotgun with me. The first guy wound up with two broken arms and a concussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause hunts aren\u2019t for civilians,\u201d Dee chimed in.</p> <p>Erin\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t waver.</p><p>\u201cThe second guy,\u201d Jude continued, \u201cdied on me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>\u201cLucky for him, I managed to bring the asshole back.\u201d But for that five minutes when the guy had lain lifeless, Jude had been nervous as all hell. A dead client didn\u2019t pay.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause hunts aren\u2019t for civilians,\u201d the too-helpful Dee said again.</p><p>Erin\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cI\u2019m tired of standing on the sidelines and being afraid. Things are changing for me, now. I know that city. I\u2019ve got connections that you don\u2019t. I can help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get killed.\u201d And if she slipped away from him, well, nervous as all hell, really wouldn\u2019t be how he\u2019d be describing the\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd if I stay here, without you, what\u2019s to say the bastard won\u2019t make a try for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf he comes, I\u2019ll be by your side.\u201d Zane sauntered in, halting close to the now ravaged desk.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Erin\u2019s hair whipped as she shook her head. \u201cNot an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I can explain about yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an option.\u201d Her hand lifted toward him, palm flat. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because of that bullshit yesterday. It\u2019s because you can\u2019t handle this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot down,\u201d Dee murmured and it looked like she was biting back a grin.</p><p>And Zane looked insulted. \u201cThe day I can\u2019t handle a shifter is the day you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014throw my ass in the grave. What? A wolf shifter? \u201d Not fear in his voice. More like shock.</p><p>Dee whistled. \u201cI am so jealous. You get all the good kills, Jude.\u201d</p><p>He slanted her a quick glance. The lady needed some therapy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your power scale, demon?\u201d Erin asked and her voice was loud. It seemed like the gloves were definitely off now.</p><p>Jude figured it was a good thing the office was pretty much deserted. Most of the agents were out on their own hunts.</p><p>Choking out a laugh, Dee shook her head. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask a demon that. I mean, it\u2019s like asking a man the size of his di\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh damn enough!\u201d Zane cut through, face reddening.</p><p>But Erin\u2019s lips curved down. \u201cDoubt it. If the stories are true, a wolf shifter can take down a level ten demon. Are you really up for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Jude.\u201d Her steely words sliced through the air. \u201cSo all this doesn\u2019t really matter. My life, my choice.\u201d Her eyes had begun to glow.</p><p>Jude stared down at her. Weighing. Deciding. \u201cI can\u2019t risk your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you leave me here, you risk my safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Zane began hotly.</p><p>Erin flashed him a feral stare. He shut up.</p><p>\u201cYou take me, you risk me.\u201d A shrug. \u201cGuess it\u2019s one of those lose-lose situations.\u201d</p><p>Those were real bitches.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my life,\u201d she said again. \u201cAnd I am sick of running and sick of blood. It\u2019s time to go back. Escaping didn\u2019t work.</p><p>Trust me, I can see that now.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop until I stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until you\u2019re dead.\u201d A piss-poor comment from Dee.</p><p>Jude glared at her. Like fuck that would happen.</p><p>Erin\u2019s chin lifted. \u201cIf I have to, I\u2019ll just follow you to Lillian. But I am going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, don\u2019t you have a job?\u201d Zane asked. \u201cCases to prosecute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m off until Monday.\u201d She waited until Jude looked back at her and asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s it gonna be, tiger? You taking me?\u201d</p><p>Again and again, sweetheart. He bit back the words and sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cYou go, you follow my rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, fool number three riding shotgun.\u201d Dee squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cCan no one trust professionals these days?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cAt the first sign of trouble, you back the hell off and let me handle things.\u201d</p><p>A nod.</p><p>Mistake. Oh, this was such a mistake, but\u2014</p><p>But if he left her behind, he\u2019d worry about her every second. Because the truth was that Jude could all but feel the bastard\u2019s eyes on them.</p><p>Watching.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Poor fucked up Lee Givens\u2014the guy still hadn\u2019t woken up yet. He was in the ICU, with a guard stationed at his side, courtesy of Tony\u2019s pull. Erin had called to check on him first thing that morning, but there had been no improvement.</p><p>The docs thought it was a miracle he was still breathing. Well, breathing with the help of all those beeping and buzzing machines.</p><p>The guy out there after Erin didn\u2019t play around. Vicious, twisted, and quick to kill.</p><p>Not exactly a dream date.</p><p>No, leaving Erin in Baton Rouge, even with Zane for protection, wasn\u2019t an option he liked.</p><p>So that just left...shotgun.</p><p>Jude gave a grudging nod. Dammit.</p><p>The tiger brought her back. Fucking finally. His body tensed when he saw the familiar pickup truck. Then Erin appeared, midnight hair shining, and the two of them hurried toward her house.</p><p>The shifter\u2019s hand pressed against her back right before they disappeared inside.</p><p>A familiar gesture. Too familiar.</p><p>He waited, barely glancing at the truck. He\u2019d already marked the license down. He\u2019d done that days before.</p><p>Less than five minutes later, the shifter was back at the door. The hunter glanced down the drive with narrowed eyes. He held a suitcase in one hand, the other hand was intertwined with Erin\u2019s.</p><p>Too familiar.</p><p>They hurried out. Erin climbed into the passenger seat. The shifter hesitated. Looked around. Seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Then the tiger smiled.</p><p>He leaned back inside the truck, caught the back of Erin\u2019s head, and kissed her.</p><p>No.</p><p>A snarl broke from his lips and the tiger jerked up, gaze sweeping past the azaleas.</p><p>He shoved back the fury, nearly choking on the rage.</p><p>Erin\u2019s slender hand reached up and touched the shifter\u2019s chest. \u201cJude, what is it?\u201d</p><p>Her voice drifted to him on the wind. So sweet and husky. Sexy.</p><p>And saying another man\u2019s name.</p><p>You\u2019re next, bastard. You\u2019ll beg.</p><p>The tiger\u2019s fingers closed around hers. \u201cThought I heard a damned dog,\u201d he said, voice loud.</p><p>Too loud. Deliberate that.</p><p>So the cat wanted to play.</p><p>The fool didn\u2019t understand who he was going up against. The tiger was big, tough, and deadly in his own right, but he didn\u2019t understand a hybrid\u2019s strength.</p><p>His mistake. One that would be fatal.</p><p>The tiger shifter tossed her suitcase in the bed of the truck, then took his time stalking around the back of the vehicle.</p><p>The urge to attack, to rip and kill and smell the sweet scent of death, had his blood heating in his veins.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t stupid. He knew how to hunt. And when to hunt.</p><p>Too many witnesses. Too many neighbors out and too many cars buzzing on the street.</p><p>For this hunt, this kill, he wanted to take his time and enjoy the moment.</p><p>Because after this, there would be no more games. The chase would finally be over and Erin would be his.</p><p>He just had to kill the cat first.</p><p>Easy.</p><p>The bigger they were, the louder they screamed.</p><p>And Erin would scream too. She\u2019d have to be taught a lesson. He\u2019d enjoyed the games. They roused his appetite, but her playing with the cat hadn\u2019t been part of the deal.</p><p>The truck drove past him. So close.</p><p>He glanced down, surprised to see that his claws were out and embedded in his palms. Blood dripped onto the ground.</p><p>The blood was dark on the dirt. Fat blobs that spread over the grainy surface.</p><p>He looked back up just as the tiger turned the corner.</p><p>Where are you running to now, mate?</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. Wherever she went, he would find her.</p><p>That was the way he played the game.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Erin turned away from the traffic and focused on the sharp lines of Jude\u2019s profile. \u201cWhat was all that about back at the house?\u201d</p><p>His fingers were at a perfect ten and two position on the wheel. He didn\u2019t glance her way, but the truck accelerated, and weaved in and out of traffic as he flew through the intersection. \u201cThought I heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d she repeated quietly, \u201cor someone?\u201d</p><p>She caught the curl of his lip. \u201cWhat do you think, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think baiting the asshole out there might not be our smartest move, and I think that next time, you better let me know your plans.\u201d Because being in the dark sucked, and if she was going up against the wolf, she wanted to know everything.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d A quick glance her way. \u201cBut, for the record, I kissed you because I wanted to do it. Because you\u2019ve got the sexiest mouth I\u2019ve ever seen, and because I wanted to taste you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...okay.\u201d Erin reached out and fiddled with the air conditioning vent because she was suddenly feeling a little warm.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d His mouth had sure given her plenty of fantasies. It was the scar\u2014scars weren\u2019t sexy, she knew that. Well, they weren\u2019t supposed to be sexy, but his...</p><p>Damn. It was his mouth. The man sure knew how to use those lips.</p><p>And his tongue. He was very, very good at using his tongue and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour breathing\u2019s changed on me, Erin.\u201d She caught the flare of his nostrils. \u201cAnd your scent...\u201d</p><p>Shifters. She couldn\u2019t quite get used to being around another shifter again. The rules were so different. The whole polite society thing was thrown right out the window. Her legs stretched. Yeah, her scent had changed, and she figured the guy probably had caught the smell of her arousal. No point playing a game with him. \u201cI want you, Jude.\u201d There. That sounded confident and tough and like she didn\u2019t give a crap if he knew that her panties were getting a bit...wet.</p><p>Just from thinking about the guy and the things he could do with his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby.\u201d He accelerated as the pickup zoomed off the ramp and onto the interstate. \u201cYou know how to make me suffer, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, we\u2019re getting one room when we get to Lillian.\u201d Gruff words, hard with a lust she couldn\u2019t miss.</p><p>Her hand reached out, trailed up his thigh and she felt the strong clench of his muscles. \u201cSo I have to wait until then, huh?\u201d</p><p>A couple of hours. Shouldn\u2019t be too bad.</p><p>Her fingers rose just a bit more and traced the swollen length of his cock. Maybe she could\u2014</p><p>Jude caught her hand. He tangled his fingers with hers. \u201cUnless you want me plowing into the semi in front of us, yeah, you have to wait.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot to the windshield and she saw the lumbering big rig.</p><p>He rubbed the back of her hand over the ridge of his cock in a rough caress. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll make it worth the wait.\u201d</p><p>Lillian.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d Because going home was hard. There were too many secrets there. Too much pain. Being with Jude, touching him, taking the pleasure from his body would help her pull through.</p><p>She tugged her hand back. After a slight hesitation, he let her go. Erin settled into her seat and tried not to look at his crotch. Maybe she\u2019d sleep. If she could stop thinking about him. Maybe she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>\u201cGonna tell me about the \u2018down and dirty\u2019 Erin?\u201d</p><p>She winced. Oh, but she\u2019d known this would come. Her eyes closed. \u201cYou\u2019ve already met her. Not much to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm...\u201d</p><p>Her left eye opened. Then the right.</p><p>\u201cPlaying with humans, were you?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ll find those males don\u2019t always have the stamina you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A choked laugh broke from her. \u201cWasn\u2019t really a question of stamina. More like the problem of them freaking out when I got too, um\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRough? Wild?\u201d</p><p>Yes, to both.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I like wild and I like rough.\u201d His index finger tapped on the wheel. \u201cBut I think you already know that.\u201d</p><p>One room.</p><p>This drive was going to be hell.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know...I can also do slow.\u201d</p><p>She gulped. Damn dry throat.</p> <p>\u201cI can do easy. Thrusting as light as you want, kissing and stroking the whole night long.\u201d</p><p>Her clothes were too thick. Or maybe the truck\u2019s cab was too hot because she was sure starting to sweat.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, I can give you.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t she know it.</p><p>\u201cBut, Erin, you\u2019ve got to trust me.\u201d</p><p>Easier said than done.</p> <p>And Jude knew it.</p><p>She crossed her legs, fought to ignore the growing tension in her body, and stared out her window at the pine trees.</p><p>The silence in the car wasn\u2019t comfortable and it wasn\u2019t easy.</p><p>Just like her relationship with Jude.</p><p>Loose ends were a bitch.</p><p>He paced down the shining white hospital corridor, the green scrubs rustling softly as he walked.</p><p>If Lee Givens had been an accommodating bastard, he would have already been dead. But no, he was still alive. Still fighting to survive as he clung to life.</p><p>And why?</p> <p>There was no reason for that piece of garbage to keep living.</p><p>A woman brushed by him, pretty, but scrawny. Her thin arms were around a kid, some little freckle-faced brat who had thick tears sliding down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay, Tommy,\u201d she whispered, clutching the boy. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be\u2014\u201d</p><p>He rounded the corner and caught sight of the room he wanted. 409.</p><p>But a guard stood outside. What the hell? He stumbled to a stop. Why was a cop there?</p><p>Loose ends were a bitch.</p><p>He\u2019d learned that back in Lillian when one of those loose ends had tried to confront him one night. Better to just cut them off before they could do any harm.</p><p>Givens hadn\u2019t seen his face. Well, he didn\u2019t think the lawyer had. The road had been dark. Too dark for a human to see, surely and\u2014</p><p>\u201cSomething I can help you with?\u201d The drawling voice came from behind him and was followed by a tap on his shoulder.</p><p>One that was a little too hard.</p><p>He spun around, his clipboard up and ready. \u201cUh, what\u2014\u201d He let his eyes widen, then narrow as he studied the man before him.</p><p>A Night Watch hunter. He\u2019d seen the guy with Donovan. Tall, dark, with eyes that seemed too sharp for a human\u2019s.</p><p>Probably because the guy wasn\u2019t.</p><p>His nostrils flared, just a bit, as he caught the hunter\u2019s scent. Not shifter.</p><p>But that still left at least a dozen Other possibilities.</p><p>He forced a smile. \u201cJust making my rounds.\u201d He shifted the clipboard, a light move to draw attention to it.</p><p>\u201cRoom 409 isn\u2019t on your rounds, Doctor\u201d\u2014the green gaze dropped to his nametag\u2014\u201cWalters.\u201d</p><p>Smug jerk. \u201cNo.\u201d He bit back the rage and kept his voice flat. \u201cBut room 407 is.\u201d And he was standing right in front of that door then. \u201cSo if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014ah, sorry, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m one of the babysitters for room 409.\u201d A grim smile. \u201cSince you don\u2019t know my patient, there\u2019s no need to know me.\u201d</p><p>Ripping him apart would be fun. One fast swipe with his claws. He could slash the jerk\u2019s throat. Let the blood spray and soak the too-white tiles and walls. Or he could cut down the guy\u2019s chest. Catch the bastard\u2019s heart and tear it out.</p><p>So many choices.</p><p>The hunter inclined his head and sauntered toward the waiting cop.</p><p>Two guards. Too much attention. The lawyer would have to wait.</p><p>A loose end he\u2019d get\u2014sooner or later.</p><p>The hunter glanced back at him, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Asshole.</p><p>With a curt nod, he hurried into room 407. The patient, an elderly man with a white mane of hair, glanced up at his approach. \u201cFuck. Another one of you assholes?\u201d</p><p>Really, it was the wrong thing to say. Because his day was already pretty shitty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of you pricks coming in here! I\u2019m tired of everybody poking and prodding me. I\u2019m eighty-seven. You can\u2019t fix me. I\u2019m just gonna die.\u201d</p><p>Sooner than the jerk realized. He shoved his hand into his pocket. Felt the capped syringe he\u2019d prepared especially for Givens. No sense in letting all that preparation go to waste. He\u2019d known he wouldn\u2019t be able to attack with claws and teeth on this one. Though he sure did prefer to kill that way.</p><p>So he\u2019d bribed a nurse. Gotten exactly what he needed for a fast, clean kill.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just take your overpaid, arrogant ass right back out of my room!\u201d</p><p>He smiled and headed toward his patient. Some people really didn\u2019t do much for the world. He stopped at the foot of the bed and glanced at the patient\u2019s chart. \u201cTell me, Mr. Pope, have you had a good life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell kind of question is that? No, asshole, I haven\u2019t. I got my knee blasted in the war, stupid bitch of a wife sent me to jail for ten years, the cancer fucking ate me up when I got out, and now I have to look at your sorry ass!\u201d</p><p>No, some people really didn\u2019t do much for the world. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sir, you\u2019ll be leaving the hospital soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I will! I heard them other assholes! I\u2019ll only be leaving in a body bag!\u201d</p><p>True enough.</p><p>He uncapped the syringe. This wouldn\u2019t hurt. That was the only downside. He rather liked to watch pain and blood.</p><p>Hmmm...no blood. Another downside. But it would be fast. And the doctors and nurses would run in, so worried about this patient that they wouldn\u2019t even notice him slipping out.</p><p>And a kill would really improve his day.</p><p>Not one for Erin this time. Just for him.</p><p>It had been so long since the kills had been for him alone.</p><p>He rounded the bed. \u201cJust relax, Mr. Pope, this will only take a few seconds of your time.\u201d</p><p>The old man gave a grim nod. \u201cFine, just hurry the hell up.\u201d</p><p>They reached Lillian just after lunch. Jude didn\u2019t drive to a motel first, good thing that because she probably would have jumped him. Instead, he took them straight to the police station.</p><p>Erin licked her lips as she stared up at the gleaming doors of the Lillian PD. The place was less than half the size of Baton Rouge\u2019s department. It was a fat, square building, one surrounded by police cruisers and motorcycles.</p><p>She\u2019d spent hours there before, grilling cops, talking to suspects and perps.</p><p>Coming back was bittersweet.</p><p>Erin climbed the steps with her head up.</p><p>Jude shadowed her. \u201cWe need to find out if there were any more attacks after you left town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell a lot of folks I was leaving,\u201d she said, as the doors drew closer. \u201cI didn\u2019t want everyone to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust anyone. \u201cI still don\u2019t.\u201d Her clothes were wrinkled, courtesy of the long ride and she hadn\u2019t bothered with makeup that morning\u2014there hadn\u2019t been time\u2014so Erin knew she probably looked like hell.</p><p>Not the perfectly pressed ADA image she\u2019d worked so hard to maintain.</p><p>Her shoulders straightened. \u201cOnly one person knew I was up for the job in Baton Rouge. I wanted to keep it as quiet as possible. The bastard after me seemed to know too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still does.\u201d Jude reached for the door and closed his tanned fingers over the gleaming handle. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be seeing the one who knew about your transfer after we leave the station.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they were. Seeing the DA again was one of the reasons she\u2019d wanted to come along. She\u2019d worked hard to disappear. The stalker shouldn\u2019t have found her. Unless someone had told him about her plans.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jerome!\u201d A bellow loud enough to shake her bones. A cop, a tall, skeletally thin black man with faint gray in his hair, jumped up from behind the check-in desk. \u201cYou finally brought your butt back home!\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cHi, Pat.\u201d Patrick Ramsey. Patrick one-more-year-til-I\u2019m-out-give-me-a-desk Ramsey. The guy had taken four bullets in his career. Tossed hundreds of perps into the pen, and he\u2019d once told her he couldn\u2019t wait for the day he got to kiss the badge good-bye and go lay on a Mexican beach.</p><p>He shot around the desk. Pretty fast for a guy whose knee had been blasted two years ago. He wrapped her in a hug that squeezed her bones. He\u2019d always been so much stronger than he looked. \u201cWhat the hell? You didn\u2019t even tell old Pat good-bye!</p><p>That tightass DA had to give me the news.\u201d</p><p>She tried to breathe. Quick, shallow breaths. That was all she could manage right then.</p><p>He dropped his hold.</p><p>She sucked in a deep gulp of air. \u201cSorry, Pat, I-I had some personal things I had to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal, huh?\u201d He fired an assessing glance back at Jude. \u201cGuess he\u2019s to blame?\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped.</p><p>But Jude gave a nod. \u201cGuess I am.\u201d</p><p>Pat sized him up. \u201cYou look like a cop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Pat\u2019s raised brows called him a liar.</p><p>\u201cBounty hunter.\u201d Jude pulled out his ID. Pat never glanced at it. \u201cErin\u2019s helping me on a case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He stared down at her and then gave a nod. \u201cAlways said the law was too tame for you.\u201d</p><p>Too tame. Pat had always been good at seeing below the surface. That was one of the reasons he\u2019d done such good undercover work back in the day. She smiled but the motion of her lips felt too fake. \u201cI need a favor.\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cFigure I owe you a few of those.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. And she was sure glad he\u2019d been the first cop she saw. Maybe fate was trying to throw her a bone.</p><p>But, ah, now for the delicate part. \u201cI need to check some case files. We\u2019re after a guy, a real bad asshole, and I need to see if his MO matches up with any unsolved crimes here.\u201d</p><p>Pat scratched his chin. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit dicey.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him. \u201cI need this. You know me, I wouldn\u2019t ask if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held hers. Then he smiled and looked ten years younger. \u201cWhat the hell. I\u2019m down to days here now and it\u2019s not like the bastards are gonna fire me for letting the ex-ADA review some of her old files, right? Besides, Ben isn\u2019t here now. Gone on vacation. So it\u2019ll be all right with the other guys in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ben isn\u2019t here.</p><p>Erin exhaled. One less worry. Because she\u2019d sure been dreading seeing her ex-lover.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t sure what to say to him. How to explain...</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>Her head jerked. \u201cUh, thanks, Pat.\u201d She pointed toward the stairwell. \u201cThis way, Jude.\u201d Vince would be on duty. He was always on the day shift. He\u2019d run the search for her, and they\u2019d see what turned up.</p><p>The door slammed behind Jude, echoing hollowly. \u201cWho is Ben?\u201d</p><p>Her right foot came down too hard on the step.</p><p>\u201cI saw your face when the cop mentioned him.\u201d A pause. \u201cHe\u2019s...something to you.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him, slowly. \u201cYou caught any other shifter scents while you\u2019ve been in the station?\u201d</p><p>His brow wrinkled.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think so.\u201d Her arms crossed. \u201cYou won\u2019t. The city\u2019s too small. Full of humans. Humans like Detective Ben Greer.</p><p>Humans who don\u2019t realize what\u2019s really happening in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...like that, is it?\u201d But there was still something in his eyes and in the lines bracketing his mouth. Anger.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard after me\u2014he shot Ben.\u201d Her left foot was tapping. With an effort, she managed to still its fast beat. \u201cCops on the scene thought it was a robbery gone wrong, but I knew it wasn\u2019t. The bastard left me one of his notes.\u201d</p><p>Always the damn notes.</p><p>\u201cThis Ben\u2014you were seeing him, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Seeing him. Hoping to live a normal life with him. Even thinking about the brick house and the stupid picket fence with him.</p><p>\u201cI was, until I realized that being with me wasn\u2019t safe for him.\u201d Not safe for many guys. But it had been easier with Ben. He\u2019d been a good lover. She\u2019d held tight to her control with him. So tight. He\u2019d always been patient, and if he sensed she\u2019d held back, he hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>Jude caged her with his body. The stairs put them at eye level. \u201cI\u2019m not real worried about being safe.\u201d His gaze searched hers.</p><p>Her stomach knotted. \u201cMaybe you should be. You know this guy could set his sights on you, too.\u201d</p><p>The tiger\u2019s smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on, sweetheart. That\u2019s what I\u2019m counting on.\u201d</p><p>And why he had kissed her so hard and deep back at her house. Thought I heard something. \u201cYou\u2019re playing a dangerous game.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI know the rules and the risks\u2014and I\u2019ve always liked to play.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she just bet he did.</p><p>His hand lifted and cupped her cheek. \u201cSomething I need to know, though.\u201d</p><p>His touch jolted her. Callused fingers should never have been so gentle. And his claws, just waiting below the surface. I can do soft and easy. \u201cWh-what\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou carrying a torch for the cop?\u201d</p><p>The grated question had her mind going blank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI won\u2019t be a stand-in, not for any damn one.\u201d</p><p>As if he could ever be. No, Jude was too strong, too dominant, for something like that. \u201cI wanted to be with Ben.\u201d</p><p>Wanted to fit in. To be loved. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what?\u201d His thumb brushed over her mouth. Her eyes closed at that touch and heat streaked through her.</p><p>\u201cBut I knew, even before the attack, that we weren\u2019t going to make it.\u201d She\u2019d broken it off with him just days before the attack, but the bastard out there had still gone after him. Her eyes opened and she found Jude watching her with a predatory stare. \u201cBen had no clue about me.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cOur relationship wasn\u2019t fair to him or to me. So I ended it.\u201d He\u2019d wanted her to be someone that she wasn\u2019t. Someone that she could never be.</p><p>Someone normal.</p><p>\u201cYou got regrets about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d She\u2019d be honest about that. \u201cBut what we had is over.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed his fangs. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>His mouth crashed onto hers.</p><p>Her hands flattened against his chest. Not normal\u2014she wasn\u2019t, he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>But she was still pretending, dammit.</p><p>Jude would have to learn the truth about her sooner or later.</p><p>Maybe later...much later.</p> <p>His breath panted when he raised his head. \u201cNow let\u2019s go see what we can find out about the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jude realized right away that the cops liked her. Respected her. It was in their eyes. On their faces. They opened their offices to her. Broke rules that they shouldn\u2019t have and they did it for her.</p><p>Jude and Erin poured over files. Searched databases. They looked for clues in the crimes that might have been overlooked.</p><p>Links that weren\u2019t noticed.</p><p>They found jackshit.</p><p>At six o\u2019clock that night, Jude leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes and stretching his back. As far as they could tell, the attacks by Erin\u2019s stalker had ended as soon as she left town.</p><p>The precinct had been a dead end for them.</p><p>Time to try his way.</p> <p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d A slim female cop with a long braid of red hair tossed a file onto the already overflowing desk. \u201cLast info on the Trent case. Shame about the wife...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Erin\u2019s brows snapped together. \u201cWhat are you talking about, Wendy? What happened to the wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Wendy shifted from her right foot to the left. \u201cThought you\u2019d heard. Sylvia was the vic in a hit and run. The kids were with the grandmother at the time. Sylvia had just gone out for some groceries. She was walking across the street, headed back to her car when she got hit. Such a shame.\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed the file and began flipping through the notes. \u201cYeah, it sure as hell is.\u201d</p><p>Jude waited until the cop shut the door, then asked, \u201cDid you know her well?\u201d She\u2019d paled at the news of the woman\u2019s death. Her breath had caught.</p><p>She glanced up at him. \u201cDonald Trent spent five years beating his wife whenever he wanted. I wanted to put the bastard away, but Sylvia recanted on the stand.\u201d A hard exhalation of air. \u201cShe had twins, two little boys, real cute kids.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cBut the boys would jump anytime a door slammed or a voice was raised.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched. Through Night Watch, he\u2019d seen kids, human and Other, with shadows in their eyes\u2014and it always pissed him off to know where those shadows came from. Whenever he could, he tried to make that fear go away.</p><p>Permanently.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t want him back.\u201d Erin was definite on that. \u201cShe had a new life going. She\u2019d moved in with her mother. Filed for divorce. But he got to her. I know he did. Threatened her or the kids, and she changed her story so that he could walk.\u201d Her gaze fell to the folder. \u201cNow she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>And the kids would grow up without a mother and with a piss-poor excuse for a father.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead and\u201d\u2014her brow furrowed\u2014\u201cand the kids are living with her mother because\u201d\u2014she glanced back up at him\u2014\u201cbecause Donald Trent has been missing for the last two months.\u201d</p><p>Well, well. The trip to the PD might be paying off, after all. They\u2019d already figured the stalking began with the Trent case.</p><p>Maybe because the stalking had come from the asshole Trent? \u201cYou ever get a sense this guy was more than human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a sense the jerk was less than human.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the file. Scanned the details available about Donald Trent. Age: forty-five. Height: Six-foot-three. Weight: one ninety. An ex-football player who\u2019d busted his knee the first year in college. He\u2019d bounced around after that, gotten into bar fights, racked up a few restraining orders from former girlfriends.</p><p>The guy liked to play rough. And he liked to hurt his ladies.</p><p>\u201cYou ever see any sign of this guy in Baton Rouge?\u201d</p><p>A shake of her head. \u201cYou think Trent could be the one after me?\u201d</p><p>Maybe. One way to find out. \u201cLet\u2019s go see the grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause old Trent might have been able to hide his shifter scent, but he left his kids behind. They won\u2019t be so skilled at cloaking without dad around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around the boys, I never noticed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said he might have been taking herbs to hide his scent.\u201d He\u2019d heard of that before. Even used some herbs himself once on a case. \u201cCould be he was feeding the kids the same herbs he was taking.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t overlook any possibility. \u201cBut with him gone...\u201d</p><p>Their systems would be clean.</p><p>Erin grabbed her bag. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>With him gone, no one would have been around to pump the kids up, and if they were hybrids, he\u2019d know it on sight.</p><p>Or rather, on scent.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t talk about their father. They never ask about him.\u201d Katherine LaShaun brushed away a stray lock of gray hair that had escaped from the bun at her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s Sylvia they talk about. They keep asking when she\u2019s coming home.\u201d</p><p>Erin glanced into the kitchen where the two boys were sitting at the table, pushing bright race cars back and forth. Jude stood over them, talking and smiling.</p><p>One of the boys\u2014she\u2019d never been able to tell Jake and Joseph apart\u2014gave a loud laugh and revved his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad the bastard is gone, and I hope he never comes back. These boys, they\u2019re mine. I know what he did to my Sylvia. He\u2019s not gonna get the chance to hurt my boys, too.\u201d</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019re going to call that lawyer, right?\u201d Erin had written down the name and number of the best child custody lawyer she knew. She\u2019d given the slip of paper to Katherine. Just in case, just in case, Trent showed up again, she wanted to make sure Katherine and the boys were protected. Permanently.</p><p>Katherine gave a grim nod. \u201cI just\u2014I don\u2019t have much money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Larry does a lot of pro bono work.\u201d Larry Myers. He didn\u2019t handle many cases anymore, but she\u2019d call him and tell him this one was important. His semi-retirement was built for cases like this.</p><p>\u201cYou sure I can trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Larry had been the lawyer her father used all those years ago, when she\u2019d first appeared on his doorstep.</p><p>Is she coming back? The question had been hers, as she watched her mother\u2019s taillights disappear into the darkness.</p><p>Her father\u2014a stranger\u2014had pulled her close. \u201cI hope to God not.\u201d</p><p>Erin glanced back at the boys. She\u2019d looked for her mother for so many days after that. Years. But her mother never came back.</p><p>Erin blinked, clearing vision gone foggy. Kids always got to her. They were so vulnerable. Too easily hurt.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Jude stood in front of her, eyes seeing too much.</p><p>Great. Just what she wanted. Him to see her as some kind of emotional wreck. \u201cFine. We should go. The boys need to eat their supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He offered his hand to Katherine. \u201cPleasure, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a weak smile, and her gaze drifted back to her grandchildren.</p><p>Moments later, they were out of the house. Back in the heat and the darkness.</p><p>Erin waited until they were in Jude\u2019s truck, then asked, \u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cDidn\u2019t catch a trace of shifter on \u2019em. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d So much for that theory. But if Donald Trent wasn\u2019t the shifter after her\u2014</p><p>\u201cTrent pissed you off. Beat his wife. Was a general asshole who made the world a hell of a lot worse by living in it.\u201d He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and glanced her way. \u201cYou went toe-to-toe with this guy in a courtroom.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she had. He\u2019d threatened her. Screamed at her. Even had to be restrained by his lawyer once.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help but think...the last guy who went after you in court wound up left for dead.\u201d</p><p>She knew where this was going, dammit.</p><p>\u201cSure does make me wonder\u2014if Trent isn\u2019t the perp, maybe he\u2019s the victim.\u201d</p><p>And in that case, Donald Trent wouldn\u2019t be making an appearance in that town again.</p><p>Another present? Hell.</p><p>And what about Sylvia? Had she been some twisted gift, too? She and Sylvia had fought that last day in court. In the hallway, where she\u2019d thought they were away from prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Sylvia? Why the hell are you doing this? He\u2019ll walk, and he\u2019ll come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice!\u201d Sylvia had screamed at her. \u201cMy life, not yours! You don\u2019t understand, you don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her forehead fell against the glass of the window.</p><p>An image of the two boys flashed before her eyes.</p><p>Damn you, bastard\u2014stop!</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The motel room was small. The bed was big. And Erin was close.</p><p>He\u2019d never been good at resisting temptation, but, this time, he was gonna have to fucking try.</p><p>Jude clenched his back teeth and tried not to notice the way her breasts stretched the front of her blouse, urging the buttons to pop loose.</p><p>He\u2019d been trying not to notice and so had all those cops at the precinct.</p><p>Seeing the other men eyeing his lady...well, his beast had been ready to attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the next move?\u201d she asked, kicking off her pumps and making her way to the bed.</p><p>The next move? Stripping her, spreading her out over that bed, driving deep and hard inside her sex.</p><p>Jude cleared his throat and glanced up at the ceiling. A job. The job came first.</p><p>Hell, she was the job. And as much as his dick would like to lead him around on this case, he had to focus.</p><p>And keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep, and I\u2019m going to find out just what kind of paranormals rule this town.\u201d</p><p>The mattress squeaked when she sat down. \u201cWhat? Jude, I told you, there aren\u2019t any supernaturals\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, sweetheart, you\u2019re not the only Other here.\u201d Sure, the paranormals loved the big cities, but there were just too many of their kind. If you looked, you could find paranormals just about everywhere, and he knew there had to be more Other in this city\u2014more vampires, shifters, demons.</p><p>To find them, you just needed to know exactly where to look.</p><p>\u201cYou were at the station with me, you saw the cops\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, none of \u2019em were shifters.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t have been vamps either. He\u2019d never met a vamp cop. Vamps couldn\u2019t usually hold day jobs. They just weren\u2019t cut out for it. They were stronger at night, so most of them just stayed shut in when the sun was up.</p><p>There could have been some demons on the force, though. Maybe one or two, but without Zane there to spot his own kind, Jude wouldn\u2019t see them.</p><p>\u201cI worked with those cops for years.\u201d She shook her head. Her dark hair gleamed. \u201cI never saw anything that made me think they weren\u2019t humans.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMaybe they were all human, but, see, the problem is, you\u2019re looking at this situation all wrong.\u201d</p><p>She blinked and a furrow appeared between her brows. \u201cUh, I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d That top button would be popping soon. Hell, he could use one claw and have it off in less than a second. Then he could see those perfect breasts, with the pink nipples that were so sweet.</p><p>Focus.</p><p>He looked back up at her eyes. \u201cYou were looking for a supernatural to help you. In a town this size, you\u2019ve got to realize, not all paranormals will be the good guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I found out.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna look for the good guys tonight.\u201d Hunting the bastards was always easier. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go out, rattle some cages, break open some coffins, and see what the hell shakes loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you really think you can come into this town, knowing nothing about the place, and find Other? \u201d</p><p>He flashed her a smile. \u201cOne of my talents, sweetheart.\u201d It was all in knowing where to look. He hadn\u2019t worked his way up the food chain at Night Watch by not knowing his cesspools.</p><p>Walking on the dark side was old hat to him. He knew, better than most, just how deadly the beast inside could be.</p><p>White tigers...rare. So very rare. Because they had an unfortunate reputation and an appetite for death. Other people\u2019s.</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t know that about the tigers. If she did, she would be running away from him as fast as she could.</p><p>And she thought a wolf was bad.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d he ordered, turning away. \u201cI\u2019ll be back before dawn.\u201d Not much use hunting in the daylight. The creatures he wanted lived by darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So did he, most of the time.</p><p>\u201cI want to come with you.\u201d</p><p>He froze, hand poised above the door knob. Hell. Hadn\u2019t she seen enough at Delaney\u2019s? Much more and\u2014</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t want him near her. Wouldn\u2019t want him touching her. Kissing her. Taking her.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t want him in the same room, much less the same bed.</p><p>Not when she saw just what he could become.</p><p>Had become, so long ago.</p><p>No, no, I won\u2019t lose control again.</p> <p>There was more to this world than blood and screams and claws and death.</p><p>There was\u2014</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>Her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to see\u201d\u2014 what I do\u2014\u201cthe bastards out there. Where I\u2019m going would be hell to most humans.\u201d He always knew just how to get to hell.</p><p>Like to like.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not human.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her. She\u2019d risen from the bed and put her shoes on again. Her lips were pale and plump.</p><p>\u201cI can handle a few interrogations.\u201d Her smile was twisted. \u201cI\u2019ve seen my share, you know.\u201d</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t. Not his way.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to leave her in the hotel. Didn\u2019t want her to be alone, not with that freak out there.</p><p>Freak\u2014and what am I?</p><p>So fucking be it. \u201cWhen the blood starts pouring, just stand back, got me? Don\u2019t interfere and don\u2019t try to stop me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what has to be done.\u201d Always did. \u201cNo innocents will be hurt.\u201d His one rule. \u201cJust...stand back, okay?\u201d Don\u2019t try to stop me.</p><p>And, hell...don\u2019t fear me.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t cross the line. Hadn\u2019t, in years.</p><p>Because the one time he had lost control, the beast had run wild.</p><p>The guy was looking for a hooker.</p><p>Erin sat beside Jude, her lips pressed together, as he cruised down the strip she\u2019d never visited.</p><p>Oh, she knew this particular strip was there. It just hadn\u2019t been on her list of places to visit in Lillian.</p><p>\u201cUh...can we go over this plan again?\u201d Because the fist in her stomach told her this was a bad idea. Very bad.</p><p>Searching for a hooker with her lover. Um, not really her thing.</p><p>But Jude didn\u2019t even seem to be listening to her. His gaze was on a blonde. A woman with long hair, the shortest skirt Erin had ever seen, and legs clad in fishnet stockings.</p><p>Fishnets? Seriously? She\u2019d thought that was just some kind of really lame-ass stereotype, but no, the lady was strutting in her fishnets.</p><p>The blonde led the guy with the thinning hair\u2014the guy who\u2019d just hurried out of his car and run to her\u2014into the mouth of the nearby alley.</p><p>Jude shoved open his door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Jude\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s feeding. Come on!\u201d</p><p>Feeding? Was that really the right word for it? Erin unhooked her seatbelt and bolted after him. Her stupid shoes didn\u2019t make for the easiest of runs, but she kept up with him, snaking across the street and into the alley that reeked with the stench of garbage and sewage and hell knew what else and\u2014</p><p>And the john was on the ground, head twisted to the side. The blonde was over him, her mouth working on his neck even as her fingers shoved into the front of his jeans.</p><p>Erin\u2019s head jerked to the right. She really didn\u2019t need to see this scene. Watching others screw wasn\u2019t her idea of a good time.</p><p>\u201cSo what, drinking from the idiot isn\u2019t enough? You\u2019re robbing him, too?\u201d</p><p>Now that had her gaze flying back toward the couple on the ground.</p><p>The blonde\u2019s head snapped up and she glared at them with\u2014was that blood dripping down her chin?</p><p>The guy on the ground gave a weak moan and whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t...stop...don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d the woman screamed, her barely covered breasts heaving. Erin noticed that the hooker had the guy\u2019s wallet in her right hand. Ah. So that was what she\u2019d been looking for in his pants.</p><p>Jude took a step forward and a rat raced across the alley.</p><p>Not my kind of place. Erin braced her legs apart and tried to look like she wasn\u2019t in the middle of hell.</p><p>The woman swiped her hand over the back of her mouth, leaving a red swatch on her chin. \u201cUnless you\u2019re a cop, you ain\u2019t got no business\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude growled. A low, menacing rumble that wasn\u2019t human. Not even close.</p><p>The woman rocked back, eyes widening. \u201cWh-wh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d A fierce cry from the man. His eyes were open, but he didn\u2019t seem to be staring at anything. Erin wasn\u2019t even sure he\u2019d noticed them.</p><p>The woman\u2019s lips peeled back, and Erin caught sight of her teeth.</p><p>Fangs.</p><p>Vampire?</p><p>The hooker shifted, moving like a snake on the ground as she sized them up and put her prey between them.</p><p>Her eyes\u2014why hadn\u2019t Erin noticed the woman\u2019s eyes before? They were black. A vamp in hunting mode.</p><p>Erin\u2019s breath jerked out. She\u2019d only ever seen two vampires\u2014 okay, three now\u2014in her life. The assholes she\u2019d seen before had done nothing to make her like the bloodsuckers, or even to have vague semi-warm feelings for them.</p><p>The first guy had jumped her in a park when she\u2019d been in New Orleans. Her first week in the city. She\u2019d broken his nose, possibly given him a concussion, then she\u2019d run like hell.</p><p>And she\u2019d run right into another vamp. The two had been some kind of sick team. Caging in their prey.</p><p>They\u2019d picked the wrong prey.</p><p>That guy had gotten tossed ten feet. By the time he\u2019d gotten up, she\u2019d been gone.</p><p>But Erin had never forgotten their eyes or the stench of death that clung to them like a second skin.</p><p>\u201cCome closer, and I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d the blonde grated, lifting her claws over the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>Erin believed her. One swipe would be all that was needed to cut open his jugular and\u2014</p><p>Jude lunged forward. He grabbed the man\u2019s arm and jerked him away from the vamp in a lightning fast move. The vamp\u2019s claws raked across the john\u2019s neck and shoulders, drawing blood and eliciting screams from him.</p><p>Jude snapped, \u201cShut the hell up!\u201d Then he shoved the guy away from him and away from the rising vampire.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes were finally open and aware. He raised a trembling hand to his throat and touched the trickling blood. His saucer-sized eyes stared first at Jude, then the vamp. After a few stunned seconds, he turned and ran.</p><p>\u201cNow what are you gonna do?\u201d Jude put his hands on his hips and sized up the vampire. \u201c\u2019Cause I doubt you\u2019re gonna be able to take me.\u201d Erin saw that his claws were out. \u201cBut, just for fun, why don\u2019t you come and try?\u201d</p><p>Well, damn.</p><p>So much for using the victim.</p><p>The vamp\u2019s chin lifted and her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou know how hard it is to find a donor in this city? One who likes the bite?\u201d</p><p>A donor. Nice way of putting it.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I give a shit?\u201d Jude demanded. \u201cBesides, I get the feeling you don\u2019t care if your donors are willing or not.\u201d</p><p>A smile from the vamp. One that probably would have been pretty, if the woman hadn\u2019t been flashing bloodstained fangs.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Then her gaze shot to Erin.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>That toothy grin widened. \u201cHello, there.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s hands flew up, and those claws were wicked sharp. \u201cI don\u2019t have much use for vamps, so let\u2019s make this short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm...and I don\u2019t have much use for shifters.\u201d Her gaze was still on Erin. \u201cEven those who bring me pretty presents.\u201d</p><p>Pretty what? Presents? And why had the blood ho been looking at her when she said that?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not for you.\u201d Jude moved a bit to the right, putting himself between Erin and the vamp.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was low, taunting. \u201cAnd I\u2019m to think she\u2019s for you? Humans don\u2019t go for shifters. Everyone knows that. They hate the beasts in you.\u201d</p><p>Jude just shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this shit.\u201d He flew toward her. Seriously seemed to fly although Erin knew he had to have jumped or\u2014or something. His hand locked around the vampire\u2019s throat, and he lifted her up into the air. Her feet kicked out at him, her claws ripped at the flesh on his arms, but he didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cI need information.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, her claws buried in his arms. \u201cAnd I need you\u201d\u2014she spat at him\u2014\u201cto get the fuck off my street!\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t...kill me...this way.\u201d Her voice was hushed, broken, but her lips were still twisted in a smile.</p><p>Erin stepped forward. No, this wasn\u2019t what she wanted, there had to be\u2014</p><p>Jude lifted the vamp higher, then threw her back.</p><p>\u201cJude!\u201d</p><p>The vamp twisted in midair, and landed easily, too easily on her feet. Then she charged, running fast for her prey.</p><p>Not Jude.</p><p>Me.</p><p>Jude snarled and reached for the vamp, but she struck out, swiping her claws over his chest and arms and sliding right through his grasp. She came toward Erin, laughing, mouth wide, fangs bared, eyes too dark and\u2014</p><p>Erin punched her as hard as she could, right in the face, aiming for that wide, gaping mouth and those freakishly long fangs.</p><p>There was a crunch, then a crack, and something flew to the ground.</p><p>Then the vampire fell backwards, hard.</p><p>Before she could rise, Jude was there, crouched over her, his claws at her throat. \u201cNever said she was human,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The vamp stared at Erin in horror. There was more blood on the vamp\u2019s mouth now. No, more blood coming from her mouth.</p><p>Erin glanced down at the broken cement. What was that? Was it a\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy tooth!\u201d At least, that\u2019s what Erin thought the vampire said. It was a bit hard to understand her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like it won\u2019t grow back.\u201d Jude\u2019s voice was mild.</p><p>The vamp heaved against him, but his hold was unbreakable. Erin glanced around the alley, then back at them, worried someone else would come by.</p><p>\u201cBut your head, now that\u2019s a different matter.\u201d His smile sent a shiver through Erin. \u201cThat won\u2019t be growing back once it\u2019s cut off. And if you don\u2019t answer my questions, fast, well, I\u2019ll just have to start using my claws.\u201d</p><p>Erin tensed. He could do it. The surefire way to kill a vamp was to take off the head. A tiger\u2019s claws could cut through bone and muscle so easily.</p><p>No. They hadn\u2019t come to kill. Just to get information.</p><p>I don\u2019t hurt innocents. His words drifted through her mind. No way could the vamp count as innocent.</p><p>How long had she been in the city? Taking her donors\u2014willing and not? How long?</p><p>And I never knew.</p><p>No, she hadn\u2019t wanted to know. She\u2019d been working her cases, taking down the humans who broke the law, thinking she was safe in her little town. Far away from the Other.</p><p>She\u2019d been so wrong. Dead wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a wolf shifter.\u201d</p><p>The vamp froze beneath him.</p><p>Her eyes gave her away instantly.</p><p>\u201cYou know where the wolf is, don\u2019t you?\u201d His claws broke the skin of her neck, just a bit. Blood welled.</p><p>\u201cYou...don\u2019t want to...find the wolf.\u201d The vamp pulled her head back, trying to ease away from those claws. \u201cKill...you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t worry about me. I think I\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d He leaned in a bit closer. \u201cWhile you\u2014you\u2019re gonna find it real hard to keep bloodsucking without a head.\u201d</p><p>That would be a challenge. Erin cleared her throat. \u201cJude...\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to let him do this. Couldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cMy rules, Erin, remember?\u201d He didn\u2019t glance her way. The air in the alley was thick and hot and sweat trickled down her back.</p><p>\u201cMort\u2019s Bar! S-seen the wolf...last Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Mort\u2019s Bar. Erin\u2019s breath rushed out. She knew the place. The owner, Jacques, was old-school Cajun. And Mort...that meant death.</p><p>\u201cGuess you get to keep your head.\u201d Jude rose slowly, keeping his eyes trained on the woman.</p><p>\u201cAsshole!\u201d She scrambled to her feet. Her hand rose to her mouth and she touched the hole that had been her right fang.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>Erin stared back at her. The blood ho had been trying to attack her. Defending herself had been the only option.</p><p>\u201cI hope the wolf...rips you apart!\u201d Screamed at them. Then she was gone, bounding toward the back of the alley.</p><p>Disappearing into the shadows.</p><p>Erin finally took a deep breath and tasted shit.</p><p>She choked back her gag.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Jude ordered. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that sounded like a great plan to her.</p><p>Jude slammed the door to the motel room. He threw the lock and waited for Erin to pounce.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t pounce. Didn\u2019t glance his way. Didn\u2019t speak.</p><p>Same routine she\u2019d had in the car.</p><p>Hell, I let the vamp live. Shouldn\u2019t that count for something?</p><p>\u201cErin.\u201d</p><p>She jumped. Jumped. She\u2019d been the one to knock the vamp\u2019s tooth out, and, he was pretty sure she\u2019d broken the blonde\u2019s jaw.</p><p>The lady had a killer right hook.</p><p>He\u2019d remember that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014it\u2019s late.\u201d Said without looking at him. But, yeah, it was late.</p><p>Hitting close to three a.m. late. It had taken him forever to find a working girl he thought might be a vamp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Same rules, different city. Vamps liked to get their prey in the easiest possible way.</p><p>Sex worked. Always had. Always would.</p><p>While the men were getting ready, so busy fantasizing and stroking their dicks, the vamps locked those teeth on \u2019em and took.</p> <p>Some humans liked the pain of the bite.</p><p>Some were scared shitless.</p><p>Some fought. Some died.</p><p>Vamps didn\u2019t usually care, no matter what the victim did.</p><p>Erin\u2019s fingers rose to the front of her shirt and fumbled with the buttons.</p> <p>Jude swallowed. Okay. She was stripping. Right in front of him. He could see the edge of her bra, dark blue. So if she was stripping here instead of heading to the bathroom, she wanted him to look and that meant\u2014</p><p>Her fingers paused and she glanced up at him. The woman totally froze him with her stare.</p><p>It meant jackshit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hard man, Jude Donovan. Dark\u2014darker inside than I realized.\u201d</p><p>A slow rage began to simmer in his veins. He took a step toward her, then another. His hands fisted. \u201cI\u2019m not a man, sweetheart. You can\u2019t make that mistake with me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. Pale and moist and he could see the tip of her tongue.</p> <p>The beast inside lunged against his leash.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d let the tiger go. Show her how dark he really was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve killed, haven\u2019t you, Jude?\u201d The top two buttons on her shirt were undone, but the striptease seemed to be over.</p><p>And the interrogation had begun.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t lied to her yet. Wouldn\u2019t start now. So he kept his eyes on hers, didn\u2019t look at those sweet breasts, and left the leash in place, for now.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I have.\u201d And to protect himself, or her, he\u2019d do it again. In a heartbeat. \u201cWant to know how old I was the first time? Want to know how I did it? Want to know who I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him, and he clenched his jaw, biting back the words. What the fuck did she want? She knew what he was. She\u2019d seen everything. Every fucking thing.</p><p>Man to beast.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t run. She\u2019d turned to him. Taken him after the brutal shift. But now, because he\u2019d gotten rough with the undead scum in order to help her, Erin was acting like he wasn\u2019t good enough for her.</p><p>Because maybe I\u2019m not.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told her about his folks. Not yet. With that asshole after her, he just hadn\u2019t wanted to\u2014</p><p>Make her run.</p><p>Make her fear me.</p><p>\u201cI want to be normal.\u201d A whisper that he could hear all too easily. \u201cI want a normal life, normal\u2014\u201d</p><p>He lunged across the room. Grabbed her elbow and spun her back around. He was afraid, very afraid, that her next word would be\u2014</p><p>Lover.</p><p>I want a normal lover.</p><p>He sure didn\u2019t fit that bill. \u201cYou\u2019re not normal. You\u2019re damn better than normal. Normal isn\u2019t for us. Fire, lust, the power of the beast\u2014 that\u2019s for us. Ball games and barbecues aren\u2019t our cup of tea.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t blink. Just stared up at him, her gaze stark.</p><p>He fought to pull back the fury. Because she was slipping away.</p><p>Standing right in front of him, but slipping away.</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve killed, and if it comes to it, I\u2019ll kill again. My job\u2019s not easy.\u201d Hunting freaks like Burrows sure wasn\u2019t easy, and he had the scars to prove it. But someone had to do the dirty, bloody work. He\u2019d been born stronger than others so hunting, yeah, he could do it. Sometimes, he needed to do it. \u201cAnd yes, there\u2019s darkness in me, but, sweetheart, that same darkness is in you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen it from the beginning.</p><p>Her lashes lowered.</p><p>Then, softly, she said, \u201cI know.\u201d She looked up at him again. \u201cThat\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>Her hands lifted to his chest and he felt the sting of her claws press into his flesh.</p><p>\u201cErin, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She rose on her toes and kissed him. Not an easy kiss. Hard and fierce, bruising in its strength.</p><p>The tiger jerked free of his leash.</p><p>They fell onto the bed. Hands ripping, fighting the clothing. Mouths taking. Hearts pounding.</p><p>He tossed her bra across the room, then caught her breasts in his hands. The nipples were tight and hard and when his fingers plucked them, she moaned into his mouth.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>He pushed her onto her back and took her breast in his mouth. Jude sucked and licked and bit and had her arching off the bed toward him. The scent of her rich cream flooded his nostrils and the drumming beat of his heart just grew louder in his ears.</p><p>Her claws raked down his back.</p><p>His shirt was gone\u2014hell knew where.</p><p>He caught the waistband of her skirt and yanked it down, jerking her panties away at the same time.</p><p>My turn.</p><p>Jude shoved her thighs apart. He eyed the ripe flesh just waiting for him. Dark pink, plump, glistening and\u2014</p><p>He put his mouth on her. Jude swiped his tongue over the button of her need, got that taste of sweet and tangy cream and wanted more.</p><p>So he took more.</p><p>Her hips slammed up toward him as he drove his tongue inside of her. She came against his mouth, shuddering, legs trembling around him, but he didn\u2019t stop.</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t even close to stopping.</p><p>More. More.</p><p>Lips and tongue took. Learned every curve. Every secret. Drank up her taste and had her twisting against him.</p><p>\u201cJude! Jude!\u201d</p><p>His head lifted and his tongue snaked over his lips. Damn but she was beautiful.</p><p>Spread and open, ready for him.</p><p>She might not be his forever, but he\u2019d take her for as long as she\u2019d let him.</p><p>\u201cRoll over.\u201d Guttural.</p><p>He heard the rasp of her breath. The hitch that could have been fear or hesitation, but he also caught the surge of her arousal. The thickening of that rich scent in the air.</p><p>One thigh lifted over him and she rolled onto her stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo, like this.\u201d He caught her waist, lifted her up onto her knees. That perfect heart-shaped ass stared him right in the face.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>Her palms pressed into the mattress and she rose up, glancing back over her shoulder. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, oh, yeah, now.</p><p>He gripped his cock in one hand. Pushed the head toward the gleaming entrance of her sex. Sank deep.</p><p>This time, he was the one to moan.</p><p>She gripped him, squeezing so tight he thought he\u2019d go insane and he withdrew, only to thrust deep again.</p><p>Even as she slammed back against him.</p><p>The rhythm was wild, unsteady. Deep and hard. Sweat slickened his body and the bed sagged beneath them.</p><p>Thrust. Her ass was so soft and round.</p><p>Thrust. She gripped him so tight. Fuck!</p><p>Thrust. His. She was his.</p><p>The release barreled through him, a white-hot burst of pleasure that rocked every cell in his body.</p><p>He moved by instinct. Jude clamped his mouth over her right shoulder. That sweet, sweet curve near her neck. Pleasure spot.</p><p>And he bit.</p><p>Her sex contracted around him as she came.</p><p>The power of his release seemed to double. Emotions flooded through him. Needs. Whispers of longings he\u2019d buried years ago.</p><p>Erin.</p><p>He held her tight, held her wrapped in his arms and rode out the fury of the climax.</p><p>She sagged against him, and he kissed her flesh.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>The word trembled through his mind. No, no, that wasn\u2019t possible. The sex was great, but there was no way she could be a mate for him.</p><p>She turned her head, looking back over her shoulder at him, and her eyes were sleepy and satiated.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Talk about a case of seriously screwed up bad timing.</p><p>Fate, you bitch.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cWhy did you join Night Watch?\u201d Her quiet voice pierced the silence that had hung so thickly in the room. Her hand was on his chest, right above his heart. The sheet curved around her, hiding her hips and breasts, revealing a hint of the flesh along her side.</p><p>At her words, he tensed. He\u2019d known he\u2019d have to tell her. Sooner or later.</p><p>He\u2019d just wanted the later part.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his lips. Kissed the palm. \u201cDawn\u2019s coming. We need to catch a few hours of sleep before going back to the station.\u201d There\u2019d be more files to search. Witnesses to question.</p><p>Then, when the darkness fell, they\u2019d get the wolf.</p><p>\u201cI want to know about you.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head, just a bit, and met her stare. He could see her so well, even in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to you than you let the world see.\u201d</p><p>More than being a hunter.</p><p>A killer.</p><p>\u201cHate to tell you, sweetheart, but there\u2019s not.\u201d The words were cold and distant, but he couldn\u2019t make himself let go of her hand.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed, but she repeated, \u201cWhy\u2019d you join?\u201d</p><p>Mate.</p><p>Okay, so the beast inside had recognized her. It was the way with his kind. The animals could recognize potential mates. It was a physical thing. Genetics.</p><p>Mates could produce children. Shifters couldn\u2019t reproduce with just anyone. Their genetics were too complicated for that.</p><p>But the animals knew...they always knew.</p><p>It was survival of the fittest kicking in. The beasts inside were sure all about surviving. Propagating the species.</p><p>But just because someone was your mate didn\u2019t mean you loved them. Or that they loved you.</p><p>His parents were proof of that.</p><p>And proof of just how screwed up and twisted the world could be.</p><p>When I tell her, she won\u2019t let me touch her again. She\u2019ll fear me, just like she fears that bastard out there.</p><p>Her stare was so steady. Her body so soft and warm against his.</p><p>Lie. The whisper came from deep inside. He could invent some sob story for her. Get her to keep trusting him. Get her to keep giving him that beautiful body.</p><p>Her fingers moved in the smallest of caresses against his heart.</p><p>Can\u2019t lie to her. Not her.</p><p>\u201cI joined Night Watch because the tiger needed prey.\u201d Staying in control\u2014when he wanted to hunt and fight every day, when the tiger wanted to roar and bite and claw\u2014had been pushing him to the very edge of his sanity.</p><p>Night Watch had been, was his release. \u201cI know just how dangerous the Other are in this world. I know that humans can\u2019t handle them. They don\u2019t have a clue. And the bastards that cross the line, the ones that torture humans and kill \u2019em...they have to be stopped.\u201d He knew too well the nature of the beasts hidden inside the fa\u00e7ade of men. Too well.</p><p>\u201cThe men I\u2019ve hunted\u201d\u2014mostly paranormals, though he\u2019d been sent after a human or two in his time\u2014\u201cyou don\u2019t want to know what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Even he\u2019d had nightmares. \u201cI stopped them. I made a difference.\u201d When he hadn\u2019t been able to before. \u201cYou might not like my methods, but I get the job done.\u201d Period.</p><p>\u201cMaking a difference...that\u2019s important to you?\u201d</p><p>You can\u2019t change the past, boy. You got to look to the future. His grandfather\u2019s words. Hard with grief. He\u2019d been twelve that day. And he hadn\u2019t really understood what his grandfather meant.</p><p>But he did now. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s important to me.\u201d He inhaled, catching her scent and the lingering fragrance of sex in the air.</p><p>Not the best time to tell her, but, hell, when was there ever a good time to say something like this? \u201cErin, my parents...there\u2019s something you need to know about them.\u201d</p><p>A frown pulled her brows low, and she eased to a sitting position beside him, dragging that damn sheet up with her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Trust. He\u2019d give her all of his. For the first time in his whole damn life.</p><p>Can\u2019t look into those eyes and keep the truth back. \u201cThey were mates.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile curled her lips. \u201cWell, they would have had to be or you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>True. But...\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t love my father.\u201d He\u2019d known. Always felt the coldness there. But he\u2019d seen the heat in his father\u2019s stare every time he looked at her. \u201cHe was crazy about my mother though.\u201d Crazy. Good word.</p><p>Hell. It was hard to tell this story with her watching him with those big, golden eyes. Hard to speak when he was scared spitless that his words would send her running away.</p><p>Not just one screwed-up asshole in her life\u2014two.</p><p>\u201cThis story doesn\u2019t have a happy ending, does it?\u201d Quiet, tense. Her knuckles had whitened around the sheet.</p><p>He gave a hard shake of his head. If only...\u201cMost of the talk in the Other world about the shifters who go fucking psycho, well, it\u2019s about the wolves.\u201d</p><p>She tensed a bit. \u201cDid a...wolf do something to your family?\u201d Her voice seemed stilted.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The wolves had hurt plenty of others, but not him. \u201cThe Lones are the wolves you know to avoid. For tigers, we have our own twisted assholes who love to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFerals.\u201d A whisper.</p><p>They were rare, luckily, but every now and then, a tiger shifter gave into the bloodlust of the beast. When he did\u2014and it was always a male, no one knew quite why\u2014the hunger took him over. The only way to stop a Feral was to put him down.</p><p>\u201cMy mom didn\u2019t love my dad. Never did.\u201d Matings couldn\u2019t force feelings. Nature didn\u2019t work that way. \u201cOne day, she told him she was leaving him. She fell for a human. She wanted to start a life with him, and she wanted to take me with her.\u201d His mother had loved him. He knew that. Never doubted it for even a single moment.</p><p>His grandfather wouldn\u2019t let him doubt it.</p><p>\u201cI could see the pain in my dad\u2019s eyes, but what could he do? Not like you can make a tiger stay.\u201d Not when the tiger wanted to be free, and his dad had loved his mother enough to let her go. \u201cShe went to the human. She was going to send for me as soon as she was settled but\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she\u2019d never gotten settled, and he\u2019d never seen her again.</p><p>He glanced away from Erin\u2019s eyes.

He didn\u2019t look back at her. Not yet. This screwed-up story, on top of the hell that bastard was putting her through\u2014</p> <p>Oh, yeah, she\u2019ll be running. Moving that sweet ass as fast as she can, dammit.</p><p>But she deserved the truth from him. Especially if the beast inside was right.</p><p>\u201cWhen my dad found out, he broke.\u201d No other word for it. His father had shattered before him. \u201cBlamed himself. He thought if he\u2019d just been able to make my mother love him, she would have lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make someone love you.\u201d</p><p>No, you couldn\u2019t. His father had even told him those same words the night his mother left to join the human, but the grief had wrecked his mind.</p> <p>His father loved his mother so much that when she slipped from the world, he\u2019d seemed to slip away, too. \u201cHe went after the Feral.\u201d</p><p>Her hands reached for his. She unfurled the fingers he\u2019d clenched. Lightly traced the marks made by his growing claws.</p><p>Jude took a breath and caught her scent. He closed his eyes. \u201cHe never made it back from the hunt.\u201d</p><p>His grief had made him weak, and the Feral had been too strong.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Too heavy. Too thick.</p> <p>His father had been too consumed with rage and grief.</p><p>And his old man had left him alone. With the same rage and grief gnawing at his soul.</p><p>An image of those twin boys flashed before him. When he\u2019d seen those boys tonight, he\u2019d seen himself.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s Mom coming back?\u201d Stupid. He\u2019d been twelve. He knew about death. Fucking knew. But he\u2019d asked and asked Grandpa Joe. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad? \u201d</p><p>Asked and asked.</p><p>And broken when his parents never came home and he saw those coffins days later. His mother\u2019s wooden coffin had been covered with red roses.</p><p>Because she\u2019d loved red roses, too. Just like Erin.</p><p>Just like Erin.</p> <p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>He flinched at her voice. \u201cTwelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>Not the questions he\u2019d anticipated. \u201cMy grandpa Joe\u2014my mom\u2019s dad\u2014took me in.\u201d Grandpa Joe had been his anchor, and when he\u2019d finally let loose his own grief and rage, his grandpa had been there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what happened to the Feral?\u201d</p><p>This was the part Jude dreaded. His eyes were on her hands. So delicate next to his. \u201cWhen I turned twenty-one, Grandpa Joe died.\u201d There\u2019d been no one to hold him back then. No one to grieve, in case he failed. \u201cThe next day, I started hunting.\u201d</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t stopped until he\u2019d found his prey. \u201cI hunted the bastard down and I ripped out his throat.\u201d The blood had been hot on his tongue. The tiger had been so very thirsty. \u201cI found out I was good at hunting.\u201d At killing. Too good.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you ended up with Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted to her face. \u201cYeah. Pak heard about me. I\u2019d shoved my way deep into the Other world.\u201d It had taken months, but he\u2019d tracked the bastard. \u201cPak offered me a job.\u201d An outlet for the rage the guy had still seen brewing beneath his surface.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you take the job?\u201d</p><p>Huh. Again, not the question he\u2019d thought she\u2019d have. \u201cBecause the tiger\u2019s always been fighting his leash and hunting satisfies him.\u201d Me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak. Was she afraid now? Did she think he was a twisted freak like that asshole after her?</p><p>A revenge kill. Yeah, not something nice and orderly. Not something the good guy was supposed to do.</p><p>But he\u2019d never told her he was good. There were dark places in him. So damn dark.</p><p>That\u2019s why he was so good at his job. It was easy to hunt the sick freaks when you could think like them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me.\u201d The words were ripped from him. They came out as a demand, instead of the plea they should have been. \u201cI swear, Erin, I\u2019m not like the asshole out there. I would never, never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>He turned away. Jumped from the bed. \u201cI-I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d What? What was he going to do? He couldn\u2019t leave her, not with that prick out there. He couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me this?\u201d</p><p>His head jerked back toward her. She\u2019d risen from the bed and was walking toward him. \u201cBecause I wanted only truth between us. You deserved to know.\u201d She\u2019d taken him into her body so sweetly. Given him so much.</p><p>Trust\u2014he\u2019d given it to her.</p><p>She knew his darkest secret now. His darkest shame.</p><p>The next move was hers.</p><p>She stopped in front of him. Her hand lifted and stroked his cheek. Then her arms wrapped around him, and she held him close.</p><p>And he held her tighter than he\u2019d ever held anything in his life.</p><p>The bastard was in the motel with her. Touching her. Kissing her. Taking her.</p><p>Did Erin really think that cat would keep her safe?</p><p>Or was this to punish him? Was she angry with him? Hadn\u2019t he shown her how much he cared for her?</p><p>That he\u2019d do anything for her?</p><p>Anything.</p><p>She\u2019d gone to the Trent house. He knew it. She\u2019d seen those kids.</p><p>Did she know what he\u2019d done? For her. Always.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d wanted that kill for herself. Maybe that\u2019s why she was with the hunter. She was angry\u2014</p><p>No, no, he couldn\u2019t have that.</p><p>She had to understand that the kill had been for her.</p><p>He yanked out his cell phone. Punched in the numbers for 911. Yes, yes, this was the easiest route. They\u2019d report his call, but they wouldn\u2019t be able to trace him. Not with a disposable cell like the one he\u2019d picked up hours before.</p><p>The call was answered on the second ring.</p><p>\u201c911. What is the nature of your emergency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Detective Benjamin Greer that he can find Donald Trent\u2019s body buried in the woods behind Trent\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Wh\u2014who is this?\u201d</p><p>He pressed the small button on the cell, ending the call.</p><p>When Erin found out exactly what he\u2019d done, she\u2019d appreciate him again. After all, he\u2019d returned Donald to his boys. To his family.</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he whispered, and turned away from the hotel window.</p><p>The next day, Jude worked beside Erin, digging into case files she\u2019d snagged from her old office. Good thing the DA was slow as hell about reassigning cases and cleaning up paperwork.</p><p>They were in the old Lillian government building, home of the District Attorney\u2019s office, and the files were spread around them. Jude still thought there was a link to the crimes somewhere but she\u2014</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was happening.</p><p>Erin snuck a glance at him. Last night, he\u2019d pulled away after his confession. She\u2019d tried to reach out to him, but, she\u2019d hesitated.</p><p>Because his story had scared her. To know that he could kill so easily. Had killed so easily.</p><p>Two men in her life. One who swore she was his mate\u2014and he was killing for her.</p><p>The other man\u2014 her lover\u2014with a past bloodier than her own.</p><p>But at least Jude wasn\u2019t claiming to be her mate.</p><p>What should she say? She knew he wouldn\u2019t hurt her. Maybe she should just start with that. As for the darkness inside him\u2014</p><p>Like to like.</p><p>Who the hell was she to judge?</p><p>\u201cErin Jerome? \u201d</p><p>The deep voice, rich with surprise, had her tensing.</p><p>Jude shot to his feet and turned to face the door.</p><p>A man stood there, tall, with broad shoulders, his black hair graying just a hint at the temples. He wore a gray suit, not his usual long, black enveloping judge\u2019s robe.</p><p>Because they weren\u2019t in court. Because it was a Saturday and they were in the bowels of the pit and I sure didn\u2019t expect to see\u2014\u201cJudge Harper?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her, but then flashed a worried glance Jude\u2019s way. \u201cAh, I...didn\u2019t realize you were back with us.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019m not. Just finishing up some old business.\u201d True enough.</p><p>Judge Lance Harper. The judge with a reputation for playing with the ladies. The judge with three ex-wives. The judge with the giant house on Blakely Road.</p><p>The judge who\u2019d let Donald Trent walk.</p><p>He was the judge she and a half dozen cops suspected was on the take. Because Harper let too many criminals walk from his court.</p><p>Too many bastards like Trent.</p><p>His handsome face turned solemn. \u201cIf you\u2019re reviewing your files, then you know about...Sylvia.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. What was that? Regret? Did the guy feel guilty about what had happened?</p><p>She sure did. \u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d He sounded like he meant it. Where had his pity been when he\u2019d let Trent walk? \u201cI remember she had those two boys...\u201d</p><p>Jude straightened his shoulders. He had at least three inches on the judge and a good forty pounds. \u201cThe boys are being taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Harper blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you the new ADA?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A growl. His gaze raked the older man. Harper was in his early fifties but the guy could have passed for forty. All those gym memberships she\u2019d heard about.</p><p>Brown eyes narrowed. \u201cThen who are you?\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed Jude\u2019s hand. \u201cHe\u2019s with me.\u201d That was really all the judge needed to know.</p><p>Arrogant ass. She\u2019d always hated going into his court. She\u2019d made a point of wearing her longest skirts and her most concealing blouses.</p><p>Hot Harper might have been a favorite with some of the other female lawyers, but no way had she ever wanted to be considered for wife position number four.</p><p>\u201cAh...I see.\u201d Harper blinked. \u201cDoes Cartwright know you\u2019re down here?\u201d</p><p>District Attorney Kent Cartwright. \u201cYes. He knows.\u201d Kent had been the one to help her get the job in Baton Rouge. He\u2019d also been the guy Jude grilled for half an hour that morning. Kent swore he hadn\u2019t told anyone where she went, and Erin was inclined to believe him. His responses had been too genuine.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you down here, Judge?\u201d The demand came from Jude, but it was a question also on the tip of Erin\u2019s tongue.</p><p>Being in the basement was on par with slumming for Harper.</p><p>And on a Saturday?</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI was...planning to meet an associate here. To discuss a private matter.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. Right. Ten to one odds said the associate was a female.</p><p>A most likely married female if they were meeting in the basement, far away from prying eyes.</p><p>\u201cErin!\u201d Cartwright\u2019s sharp voice. He shouldered into the room, casting a quick, somewhat bemused stare at Harper. \u201cErin, I just got a call from the PD, thought you\u2019d want to know...\u201d</p><p>Not good. Couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cA tip came in last night.\u201d The tiny room was too crowded. \u201cThe caller said he knew where Donald Trent\u2019s body was buried.\u201d</p><p>The air seemed to leave her body in a hard rush.</p><p>Her eyes locked on Cartwright. The DA was just a few years older than she was. He had a politician\u2019s open face. Light brown hair. Worried blue eyes.</p><p>Good old Kent. He hadn\u2019t given her secrets away. No, not him.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d The question was soft.</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cAccording to the tapes from 911...the body is in the woods behind Katherine LaShaun\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>She slammed the files closed. Jude was already moving, shoving past the other two men. Clearing her way.</p><p>He was real good at clearing the way.</p><p>Erin hurried into the hall. Rounded a sharp corner behind Jude and\u2014</p><p>Smacked right into Lacy Davis. A clerk in the DA\u2019s office. Friendly, flirty, married Lacy.</p><p>The woman grunted and stumbled. \u201cErin?\u201d Her eyes, dark green, widened. \u201cWhen did you get back in town?\u201d Her gaze drifted over Erin\u2019s shoulders and a red flush stained her cheeks. \u201cJ-Judge H-Harper, what are you doing here? I thought you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>She did not have time for this. Jude stood next to the elevator, holding the doors open and waiting for her. Great. \u201cGot to go, Lacy, we\u2019ll catch up\u201d\u2014not really, they\u2019d never been close\u2014\u201clater.\u201d</p><p>She hurried forward, heart racing. Donald Trent\u2019s body? Oh, hell.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, Jerome.\u201d</p><p>Kent\u2019s voice. The hard and sharp tone that he usually just delivered in court.</p><p>She glanced back at him. She saw the judge reach for Lacy\u2019s hand. He leaned in close and murmured something to her.</p><p>Erin\u2019s jaw locked and she gritted, \u201cKent, if they found his body\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slanted a quick glance over at the judge, then stalked to her side. \u201cYou don\u2019t work for me anymore,\u201d he said, softer now. Probably so the judge wouldn\u2019t overhear. Like that guy was paying them any attention now. \u201cYou can\u2019t go storming onto a crime scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was my case.\u201d Still was, if he only knew what was really happening.</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d he threw back at her. \u201cIt\u2019s just mine now.\u201d His shoulders straightened. \u201cI always liked you, Erin.\u201d A gentleness in his eyes. Flashed there so briefly. \u201cYou\u2019re tough, smart, but my favors for you end here. You don\u2019t work for me anymore,\u201d he said again. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t let you interfere with an investigation.\u201d</p><p>Hell. The damn thing was\u2014he was right. No way should she be at a crime scene. But she needed to be at this one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho is the detective on this?\u201d Jude asked.</p><p>\u201cBen Greer. He\u2019s coming in early to handle things.\u201d Kent\u2019s stare bored into her. \u201cYou know he\u2019ll do this right.\u201d</p><p>Yes, and she also knew he wouldn\u2019t let her anywhere near the case, either. Erin gave a grudging nod.</p> <p>Then the DA brushed by her. He caught the elevator Jude had kept for her and vanished behind the heavy metal doors.</p><p>Erin looked over her shoulder. The judge and Lacy were gone. They\u2019d probably ducked into one of the rooms for a</p><p>\u201cmeeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t have anything for hours anyway,\u201d Jude said. \u201cThe cops will have to search the woods with dogs.\u201d</p><p>He was right.</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll take \u2019em time to dig up the body.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. \u201cWhat will it do to the boys?\u201d They\u2019d already been through enough.</p><p>A brief hesitation, then, \u201cCall Katherine. Tell her to get the boys out of there\u2014and to keep \u2018em out until this mess is over.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s lashes lifted. \u201cBut that\u2019s against protocol\u2014\u201d She stopped. She didn\u2019t work for the Lillian DA any more. He\u2019d just said so himself.</p><p>\u201cCall her,\u201d Jude repeated, eyes intense. \u201cTell her to get the boys the hell out of there.\u201d</p><p>The cops would be on their way over to her place now. There wouldn\u2019t be much time.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to see their old man\u2019s body dug up.\u201d</p><p>No, and they didn\u2019t need their only safe haven turned into hell right in front of their eyes.</p><p>Screw protocol. Not her case? Fuck it. Those boys were hers. She snatched out her cell phone. Dialed the number she\u2019d memorized yesterday. When a woman\u2019s soft voice answered, she said, \u201cKatherine, it\u2019s Erin Jerome. We don\u2019t have much time, and I need you to listen carefully...\u201d</p><p>A line of motorcycles blocked the entrance to Mort\u2019s Bar. Pickups snaked and twisted, filling up the parking lot, and the blare of country music trembled in the air.</p><p>Erin slammed the door of Jude\u2019s truck and stared at the bar. Night had fallen, bathing the city in darkness. The thick darkness hid the sagging sides and the dipping roof of Mort\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019d been in this bar once before. A blind date that had gone to hell very fast.</p><p>Not her kind of place. Too loud. Too drunk. Too many men with free hands.</p><p>Gravel crunched beneath Jude\u2019s shoes. She glanced at him when he rounded the front of the vehicle. \u201cYou think the vamp was telling the truth?\u201d The guys in this place tended to run more toward the \u201cgood old boys\u201d and not the paranormal predators.</p> <p>Though she sure knew those good old boys could be predators, too.</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d He sounded absolutely certain.</p><p>Erin raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cShe knows if she lied, I\u2019ll just come back for her.\u201d A barring of his fangs. Damn, he already had his fangs out. This wasn\u2019t going to be a good night. \u201cAnd if I do that, I won\u2019t be so nice.\u201d</p><p>Right. Because he\u2019d been all goodness and light during that first showdown.</p><p>Her eyes darted back to the entrance. Smoke drifted lazily from the front door. Not a fire, just a shitload of folks with cigarettes, cigars, and who knew what else inside. Her hands balled into fists. \u201cNo sense standing around here all night. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They started forward together. A loud wolf whistle split the air, and Jude froze. His gaze immediately tracked to the left, to the two men sitting on the back of a gray pickup truck. His growl vibrated in the air. \u201cDon\u2019t make me come over there and kick the shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>The men jumped up and hurriedly ran into the shadows. Erin figured they weren\u2019t in the mood to lose their shit.</p><p>Jude spared her a glance. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for assholes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I.\u201d But she smiled. Because Jude made her feel...aw, hell, he just made her feel.</p><p>A burly bouncer blocked the bar\u2019s door. \u201cTwenty bucks.\u201d He didn\u2019t look up from his comic book.</p><p>Jude tossed him the cash and sauntered inside.</p><p>As soon as she crossed the threshold, the smoke got five times thicker. It flooded her nostrils, seeming to burn her nasal passages. What was that? Not cigarettes. This was stronger. Almost like incense but\u2014</p><p>\u201cGot us someone smart in here,\u201d Jude whispered, reaching for her hand and pulling her close as he surveyed the crowd.</p><p>\u201cBastard\u2019s blocking all the scents with the kymine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Ky-kymine? What\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scent that fucks up a shifter\u2019s nose, that\u2019s what.\u201d His eyes swept the crowd again. \u201cVamps in the west came up with it a few years back. They use it to even up the hunting field.\u201d</p><p>Erin felt like she had to sneeze. She rubbed her nose, trying to stop the itch.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t do you any good.\u201d He glanced up at the air vents. \u201cBet they\u2019re pumping it in from there.\u201d</p><p>Great. \u201cSo...they knew we were coming?\u201d Not a good thought. Hell, she didn\u2019t even know who \u201cthey\u201d were. The good old boys? The not so good old boys?</p><p>She inched a bit closer to Jude and felt the sting of her claws as they began to stretch beneath her skin. If they were in for a fight, she wanted to be ready. \u201cYou think the vamp sold us out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d He didn\u2019t sound particularly concerned. \u201cOr maybe this isn\u2019t for us.\u201d</p><p>The wolf.</p><p>\u201cIf the bastard has been hunting here, the kymine could be for him.\u201d A man in an oversized cowboy hat and his giggling girlfriend staggered past them. \u201cIt\u2019d explain how the vamp knew he was here.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it would. Erin breathed slowly through her mouth. If she didn\u2019t use her nose, didn\u2019t move it at all, she\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d He steered her away from the door. So much for not moving. Jude didn\u2019t stop advancing until his back was against the wall and he had a good view of the crowd. \u201cWe can march up to the bar and announce that we\u2019re here for the wolf.\u201d</p><p>She eyed the bar. It was surrounded by men with thick stomachs and big arms, and the women with them\u2014short skirts and give-em-hell grins.</p><p>How would that conversation go? Hi. We\u2019re looking for a werewolf. Um, no. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her. Winked. \u201cGot a little voyeur in you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hunt in here, and neither can he. But outside...that\u2019s fair game.\u201d He pointed to an exit in the back. A rounded ceiling led the way to darkness. A couple, kissing, groping, headed for the thick door.</p><p>Voyeur. \u201cWatching\u2019s not so much my thing.\u201d But she had a feeling choice wasn\u2019t going to be a big option right then. \u201cI\u2019m more for doing.\u201d</p><p>His teeth were a brilliant white flash. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>Then he stalked toward the back exit.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>And she followed him.</p><p>No choice.</p><p>The kymine was driving him crazy. Jude shoved open the back door and sucked in a sharp breath of clean air.</p><p>Vampires. One day, he\u2019d pay them back for the kymine. That crap was being sent all over the U.S., funneled by the undead freaks.</p><p>Sometimes, he really hated vamps.</p><p>\u201cJude? You okay?\u201d Erin\u2019s voice. He glanced back at her. She hadn\u2019t been hit as hard. He\u2019d noticed that right off. So he hadn\u2019t told her that the kymine was blistering the inside of his nostrils. Hadn\u2019t told her that if they hadn\u2019t gotten the hell out of that stinking bar, blood would have started pouring from his nose in another two minutes.</p><p>But now that they were out, he\u2019d start healing. Unfortunately, even for the strong shifters, it took some time to get kymine out of the system.</p><p>Admitting weakness with so many others around hadn\u2019t been an option. Better to just suck up the pain and move on.</p><p>Story of his life.</p><p>Whispers floated to his ears.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d A thread of worry thickened her voice. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re\u2014\u201d \u201c</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>But her brows were drawn low and she crept closer to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good.\u201d</p><p>The door swung shut behind her.</p><p>Moans teased his ears. Pants. The couple he\u2019d followed outside were already busy. Judging by the man\u2019s groans, they sure seemed to be having one great time in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said again and turned away to scan the thicket of woods around the bar. The perfect place for sex. Groping in the dark. Fucking in the wild.</p><p>The man and woman were completely oblivious to everything but their need. Great prey for a wolf, one who wouldn\u2019t have to bother going inside the bar\u2014 damn hole in the wall\u2014and dealing with the kymine.</p><p>The vamp hadn\u2019t told him about the kymine. Probably because she\u2019d been the one to sell it to the bar owner. No wonder she\u2019d known about the wolf.</p><p>This really was the perfect place to hunt. Pity he wouldn\u2019t be able to smell the beast coming. It would take at least an hour for the kymine\u2019s side effects to clear up, but if the wolf came hunting, he\u2019d be able to hear the bastard.</p><p>The door squeaked behind him. He reached for Erin, pulling her into his arms and dipping his head toward her mouth.</p><p>They\u2019d pass for a lust-driven couple. Hell, he was lust driven around her and\u2014</p><p>Click-click. Fuck. He knew that sound.</p><p>The unmistakable cock of a shotgun.</p><p>Jude froze. His lips hovered over Erin\u2019s, close enough to taste the sweetness of her breath and the sudden fear on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cMove away from her! Do it, freak! \u201d</p><p>His fangs burned as they lengthened even more in his mouth. His claws ripped through his skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 tired of yer kind comin\u2019 here, screwin\u2019 with my bar!\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Jude dropped his hands and moved his body a few precious inches from Erin\u2019s. He kept himself between her and the asshole with the shotgun.</p><p>He turned his head and found himself staring down the double-barrel.</p><p>A short, gnarled old man with tufts of greasy gray hair had a white-knuckled grip on the gun. His finger looked all too ready to pull that trigger.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him, girl!\u201d</p><p>Jude tried to figure out his next move. He was fast, but that shotgun was close.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Erin\u2019s voice had been too calm. Didn\u2019t the woman see the gun?</p><p>The old guy\u2019s face scrunched. \u201cGirl, I\u2019m savin\u2019 yer life! Knew what he was soon as I saw his face. Bastard couldn\u2019t take that gas.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so he had this gun-toting jerk to thank for the kymine.</p><p>The jerk spat a wad of tobacco on the ground. \u201cGet away from him. He\u2019ll rip ya apart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I will,\u201d Jude snapped and got ready to rip that little gnome apart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a girl.\u201d Her fingers curled around Jude\u2019s shoulder. He looked down, saw her claws and knew when the gnome whispered, \u201cShit\u201d that he had, too.</p><p>But the hold on the gun never wavered. The gnome just shrugged and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll blow both yer asses away. No fuckin\u2019 werewolves are comin\u2019 in my bar and wreckin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not werewolves,\u201d Jude said quickly. He could take the gun, but what if the gnome got off a shot and it hit Erin? He didn\u2019t know how fast she could heal.</p><p>Or if she could heal like a shifter.</p><p>No. No way could he risk her.</p><p>\u201cThe fuck ye say. I see them claws!\u201d</p><p>Yeah, and the guy didn\u2019t look like he was real interested in learning about all the differences between shifters. No, the fellow looked like he was only interested in firing that big-ass gun.</p><p>\u201cSorry, sweetheart,\u201d Jude said to Erin and meant it. Odds were good this would hurt her.</p><p>But not hurt as bad as a shotgun blast.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Jude\u2014\u201d</p><p>The gnome\u2019s finger tightened around the trigger.</p><p>Jude shoved Erin away\u2014shoved hard. Her body flew into the air.</p><p>He grabbed for the gun just as the deafening blast blew the hell out of his ears.</p><p>Fire scorched his right side. Sonofabitch.</p><p>He caught the smoking barrels and wrenched the gun from the old man\u2019s hands.</p><p>The guy whimpered.</p><p>Jude glared at him, all too aware of the blood trickling down his side. He didn\u2019t even want to look at that wound. \u201cNow you\u2019ve pissed me off,\u201d he snarled, the words sounding distorted to him, thanks to the ringing in both ears. \u201cYou have no idea who you\u2019re messing with.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. Fear had his face going slack.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, now you\u2019re getting the picture.\u201d He threw the gun aside. The day he\u2019d ever choose a gun over claws, well, that was a day that hadn\u2019t ever come for him.</p><p>The gnome scrambled back, his fingers clawing at the door.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, Jude lurched forward. He caught the little bastard around the neck and lifted him high into the air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d His side hurt. \u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>A muffled groan. He jerked around and saw her pushing up onto her knees. She tossed back her hair, glaring at him. \u201cYou could have just said \u2018duck.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Duck or fuck? He couldn\u2019t tell for sure because his hearing was still screwy, but since they had an audience he\u2019d go for duck.</p><p>Jude shook his head. Ducking hadn\u2019t been good enough. He\u2019d needed her clear and safe.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell, Jude!\u201d He saw her lips form the horrified words. Erin jumped to her feet. Raced to him. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Like a stuck pig.</p><p>She reached for his shirt, but it was already wet with blood and plastered to his skin. Or what was left of his skin.</p><p>His fingers tightened around the old man\u2019s throat. A wheeze slipped from the guy\u2019s mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to shift,\u201d he muttered. No choice. The tiger was stronger than the man. He\u2019d heal faster with the beast\u2019s power.</p><p>No choice.</p><p>Erin gave a grim nod.</p><p>And the gnome suddenly started fighting in his hold. Clawing at him with stubby nails and kicking out. \u201cNo, no, no! \u201d</p><p>This was the last thing he needed. Jude could hardly hear, and he still couldn\u2019t smell a damn thing.</p> <p>Some hunter he was right then.</p><p>With a growl, he slammed the gnome\u2019s head into the back of the building. A nice thud sounded and the guy\u2019s eyes fell closed. Jude dropped him to the ground.</p><p>Then fell down beside him.</p><p>Erin dropped to her knees. \u201cJude, what can I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fire heated his veins. The tiger roared, and Jude arched his back, more than ready for the burn of the shift. The tiger fought his way to the surface as the man sank back into the pain and let the beast have his way.</p><p>Bones popped. He saw the fur spring up on his hands and arms. This was it, this was what he needed\u2014</p> <p>\u201cBehind you!\u201d Erin\u2019s scream.</p><p>He realized that her arms were pulling at him, trying to yank him closer to her. He hadn\u2019t even felt her touch because the shift was too intense.</p><p>Jude forced himself to glance back. Caught between man and beast, he struggled to hold on, just for a moment more.</p><p>Glowing yellow eyes stared at him. Shining from the darkness of the woods.</p><p>Oh, shit. The old man hadn\u2019t been afraid of him in those last few moments. No, not of him.</p><p>The wolf raced out of the trees, body thick with muscles and black fur. Its mouth was open, the razor sharp teeth glinting with saliva.</p><p>The bastard was heading straight for them.</p><p>Jude opened his mouth to cry, but he couldn\u2019t speak anymore. The hellfire of the shift blasted through him. Sweet, sweet pain.</p> <p>No, the man couldn\u2019t speak, but the tiger roared his challenge into the darkness\u2014and to the wolf.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>A shifter\u2019s weakest moments came during the time of change from man to beast. The shift wasn\u2019t instant. It was fast, yes, but the bones had to snap and reshape and the flesh had to change and the\u2014</p><p>It was brutal. Hard.</p><p>And dangerous.</p><p>Erin had seen her share of shifts before. She knew the game. And she knew that Jude couldn\u2019t take the wolf right then.</p><p>So she did the only thing she could.</p><p>Erin ran in front of him. The tiger snarled in fury behind her, but he couldn\u2019t attack yet. He was trapped between man and beast.</p><p>She stared at the wolf. She hadn\u2019t smelled him. Because of the kymine or because he\u2019d cloaked his scent? The bastard had been able to sneak right up on them.</p><p>All the better to kill.</p><p>\u201cYou stay the hell back!\u201d She lifted her claws, ready to do as much damage as she could.</p><p>The wolf was big, with a long, muscled body. A thick muzzle, pointed ears, and those glowing eyes\u2014</p><p>Her heart slammed into her chest.</p><p>Those eyes.</p><p>The wolf froze, staring up at her. A rumble rose in the beast\u2019s throat.</p><p>Oh, God, no.</p><p>She\u2019d seen those eyes before.</p><p>Something bumped against her thigh, a hard jolt that had her stumbling. Erin looked down, eyes wide, scared, stunned.</p><p>Jude had finished his shift. The tiger stood near her, using his weight to force her to the side.</p><p>So he could stand before her.</p><p>Red stained his fur, darkening that thick, white and black pelt. But the tiger easily outweighed the wolf. Hell, he had to be twice the other animal\u2019s size. His teeth were bigger, sharper. His claws far longer and stronger.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The cry was ripped from her. She couldn\u2019t let this happen.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s head swung toward her and the beast howled. A long, mournful sound.</p><p>A sound she knew too well.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d a whisper this time.</p><p>The tiger\u2019s muscles bunched as he prepared to attack.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let him do it. Erin threw herself against him, holding on tight as she sank her fingers into that fur and clung with all her strength. \u201cJude, let the wolf go!\u201d</p><p>He trembled against her, and his head turned toward her as he opened his mouth with a cry loud enough to rattle her bones.</p><p>The wolf lunged forward, ready to attack.</p><p>\u201cLeave him alone!\u201d Erin screamed and held on even tighter. This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>But the wolf was there. Watching with eyes that never blinked.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here.\u201d Erin stared into those eyes. The tiger\u2019s body was too tense against her, and she knew Jude was using all of his control in an effort to hold back his attack.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s black muzzle lowered toward the ground.</p><p>Jude\u2019s left claw lifted as he got ready for a deadly swipe.</p><p>\u201cRun, now!\u201d Erin pressed all of her weight against the tiger. Dammit, go!</p><p>The wolf turned and fled into the darkness.</p><p>Her breath choked out. She turned her head and buried it in the tiger\u2019s soft fur. Oh, hell.</p><p>Jude leapt away from her. Erin slipped and almost fell flat on her face. For the second time that night.</p><p>Jude shot toward the twisting trees.</p><p>\u201cNo! Jude, stop!\u201d She knew the man inside the tiger understood her perfectly.</p><p>She just wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d listen to her.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t slow down, she shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s not the asshole after me!\u201d</p><p>Still didn\u2019t slow.</p><p>Another few seconds and he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>\u201cJude, that\u2014that\u2019s my mother!\u201d</p><p>The big cat\u2019s claws dug into the ground as he came to a shuddering halt. He glanced back at her, blue eyes too bright in the darkness.</p><p>Now he knew. The last secret.</p><p>She pushed to her feet. Wished that her knees didn\u2019t feel so weak. \u201cRemember those crazy, psychotic wolves you told me about? Guess it\u2019s time I told you, I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, a wolf howled and the sound ripped right into her heart.</p><p>\u201cJude! Jude, dammit, wait! You\u2019re still bleeding!\u201d</p><p>He shoved open the motel room door, heard the crash as it banged back and hit the wall. Keeping his head low, he stormed across the threshold, fighting to keep his rage in check while\u2014</p><p>Erin grabbed his arm. \u201cStop! Listen to me!\u201d</p><p>Teeth clenched, he spun to face her. He\u2019d managed to jerk on the spare jeans he kept in the truck, for shifting emergencies, but with his side still burning like hell, a shirt hadn\u2019t been an option.</p><p>Erin stared up at him, face stark, lips quivering. So beautiful.</p><p>A wolf?</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cI-I should have told you before.\u201d</p><p>Uh, yeah. She should have.</p><p>Her fingers curled around his arm. \u201cYou made it clear how you felt about wolves\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s the way everyone feels.\u201d All the Other anyway. They all knew the rule: If you were smart, you stayed away from the wolves.</p><p>Smart. He grimaced. Not him because he sure hadn\u2019t stayed away. He\u2019d run straight to her and gotten his ass addicted to her sweet flesh.</p><p>Sweet wolf flesh.</p><p>A tiger tangled up with a wolf. His grandfather had to be someplace, laughing his striped ass off.</p><p>Her hand fell away. \u201cHow many wolves have you actually met, other than me?\u201d</p><p>His brows flew up, and he ignored what was turning into a dull throb in his side. At least he was healing. \u201cUm, you mean other than the asshole stalking you?\u201d</p><p>She kicked the door shut with her heel even as her eyes slit. \u201cNo one\u2019s perfect, Jude. Not wolves. Not tigers. You should know that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, no, she hadn\u2019t just thrown his past into his face. He grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back against the mud-brown wall. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, sweetheart.\u201d He\u2019d trusted her. Bared his soul. While\u2014what? All the time she\u2019d been keeping her secrets from him? He\u2019d been trying to help her.</p><p>But the woman was working her own agenda.</p><p>Wolf.</p><p>\u201cI-I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d She broke off, shaking her head and sending those silky locks flying. His nose was working again\u2014he\u2019d felt lost for a time without the onslaught of scents teasing him\u2014and the heady fragrance that was Erin filled his nostrils.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean then?\u201d Her mouth was close. Tempting and close and he would not kiss her. Not now. Because, dammit, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder...what other secrets was she keeping?</p><p>She wet her lips.</p><p>Damn her. That swiping pink tongue had his cock jerking.</p><p>\u201cDo you\u2014do you remember what you told me about Lones?\u201d</p><p>No, he had no idea.</p><p>His expression must have said as much because she glared at him. \u201cHow screwed up do you have to be,\u201d she quoted, \u201cto get kicked out by the pack?\u201d</p><p>Okay, he remembered. Jude tried real hard not to wince. So he\u2019d been a hardass on the Lones, but after that Feral butcher who\u2019d killed his family\u2014</p><p>\u201cI got kicked out.\u201d Said with dignity. Said with a stare that was straight and unflinching. \u201cThey thought I was weak.</p><p>Unworthy.\u201d A pause. \u201cNot fit for the pack. When I couldn\u2019t shift, they threw me away.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched into fists. It was either ball \u2019em up or grab her again and hold tight. And he couldn\u2019t hold her, not yet.</p><p>She\u2019d kept this secret from him after he\u2019d bared his soul to her.</p><p>He should have seen this coming.</p><p>He says I\u2019m his mate.</p><p>Because the bastard after her was a wolf. Just like she was. Like to like.</p><p>So why the hell was the beast inside him screaming that she was his mate?</p><p>No way could a woman be a mate to two shifters.</p><p>\u201cMy mother took me to my father\u2019s house. Dropped me on the doorstep without a word, and left.\u201d Memories trembled in her voice. \u201cShe\u2019d kept me from him for fifteen years, because while they were mates\u201d\u2014Erin said the word like it was a curse.</p><p>Maybe to her, it was\u2014\u201cshe didn\u2019t love him, because he wasn\u2019t pack.\u201d</p><p>He tried to think. Hard to do, when she was so close and his fury still rode him. \u201cYou could have just been delayed.</p><p>Shifters don\u2019t change until puberty. If you were just fifteen\u2014\u201d</p><p>A slow motion of her head, back and forth. \u201cI don\u2019t change, Jude. The claws and the teeth are all I have. All I\u2019ll ever have.</p><p>There\u2019s no running in the woods for me. No beast who can break through the surface. There\u2019s just\u201d\u2014her hands lifted, fell\u2014\u201cwhat you see. And that wasn\u2019t enough for the pack or for my mother.\u201d</p><p>The mother who\u2019d appeared tonight, more than ready to attack him. \u201cWhy is she here?\u201d He didn\u2019t believe in coincidences.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Erin exhaled on a hard breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since then\u2014until tonight, anyway. I-I remembered those eyes.\u201d She straightened her shoulders. Stiffened her spine. \u201cMy father was scared of me because he was scared of her. He loved me, I know he did, but I think he was always worried the wolf would come out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2014you said he was human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a shaman for his tribe. He was used to helping people. When he first met my mother, she was hurt. He told me she\u2019d been attacked by vampires. He wanted to help her, but in the end, she didn\u2019t want to be helped. She wanted the blood and the violence and pack. \u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d taken Erin into that world.</p><p>Then tossed her out.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>\u201cMy father was psychic. He could see things, change lives.\u201d She blinked quickly. \u201cHe was a good man.\u201d</p><p>Erin had loved him. No denying the emotion in her voice. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d he asked, because there was so much pain there.</p><p>\u201cHe was killed. One of those horrible wrong place, wrong time things. He was mugged. Caught one night coming home.</p><p>The guy stabbed him and my father bled out on the street. On the filthy street, with his eyes wide open.\u201d Her lips twisted. No smile this time. \u201cI saw it happen. My damn dreams. But by the time I got there, it was too late. He\u2019d left me, too.\u201d</p><p>He jerked her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m pissed as hell at you,\u201d he growled, but held her all the tighter. What was she doing to him? What?</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let you kill her,\u201d she said, words muffled against him.</p><p>His side stung, but no way was he gonna let her go. \u201cYeah, well, sweetheart, looked to me like she was the one wanting to do the killing.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cAnd if that gnome with the gun was anything to go by, she\u2019s made a habit of hunting folks at that bar.\u201d A wolf who hunted humans was a wolf that had crossed the line.</p><p>Rogue.</p><p>Her pack wouldn\u2019t take her ass back if she\u2019d gone Rogue.</p><p>Erin\u2019s head lifted. Her long lashes were spiky, wet. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore. I just want things to go back to normal.\u201d</p><p>Ah, normal. That word again. The one she liked so much. \u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d His nose twitched. So many scents assaulting him now that his enhanced smell was back. But, what was\u2014</p><p>Hell.</p><p>He pushed Erin behind him and glared at the door.</p><p>\u201cJude!\u201d Erin\u2019s nails scraped down his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d Looked like Erin\u2019s sense of smell was working, too.</p><p>This time, he could catch the lighter, feminine scent of the wolf shifter. Yet knowing that it was Erin\u2019s mother on the other side of that door didn\u2019t make him relax his guard for a second. No, it only made him tense more. \u201cStay back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabbed the doorknob. Wrenched it open\u2014</p><p>And came face-to-face with Erin. No, not his Erin. An older version, one with faint lines around her eyes. One whose face was more haggard, whose hair was a bit shorter.</p><p>And whose eyes were more yellow than gold.</p> <p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>She stared at him, measuring him. Then one black brow shot up and she said in a voice too much like Erin\u2019s, \u201cYou gonna stand there staring all night, cat, or are you gonna let me see my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Detective Ben Greer eased under the bright yellow line of police tape, his gun holster pressing into his side. He\u2019d had exactly two days of vacation\u2014two days of sitting on his ass and going insane at the cabin\u2014and then he\u2019d gotten the call about Donald Trent.</p><p>Trent. Like he\u2019d ever forget that bastard. He\u2019d put down ten to one odds that the guy had offed his wife a few months back. Not that Ben had enough evidence to prove it, though.</p><p>But after being on the job for ten years, some things were just pure instinct.</p> <p>Trent was a killer. A psychopath who got off on hurting women. If Trent\u2019s body really was buried in those woods, then the women in Lillian would be one hell of a lot safer, and their sleep would be easier.</p><p>\u201cDetective!\u201d</p><p>A female uniform waved him over. Kristen Langley was still pretty fresh to the force, but she was a fast learner, and she knew how to keep a scene safe.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we got?\u201d he asked as his gaze swept the area. That house. He\u2019d been there before. Been to tell Katherine LaShaun the news about her daughter. He\u2019d seen the boys, peeking from behind the stairs.</p><p>Sometimes, the job really sucked.</p><p>\u201cThe dogs found something...\u201d Excitement had her voice cracking. \u201cCome on, we\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Ben ran past her. He could hear voices rising in the distance. The rest of the team. He caught the thud of a shovel. Dammit, they\u2019d better be careful with his scene.</p><p>He twisted, avoiding the thick brush as best he could, then he broke into the area with his group. Stumbling to a halt, he eyed the large hole his men had sectioned off. Not too deep. Not deep at all, really. The spotlights lit up the area, and in the black dirt, he saw the faded blue fabric.</p><p>A shirt. Ragged.</p><p>More of the thick dirt was carefully brushed aside and he glimpsed\u2014</p><p>Bones.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019s Trent?\u201d Kristen asked, that excitement still in her voice.</p><p>He glanced at her, mouth grim. \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d Tests would have to be done. Dental records checked. But he could see a long, thin necklace, one with intertwined snake heads, laying across the bones.</p><p>Trent had worn that piece of crap around his neck every time Ben had seen him.</p> <p>\u201cCareful, people!\u201d Ben yelled. \u201cI want every piece of evidence here! Tag it, bag it, and don\u2019t miss anything!\u201d This case was going to have a shitload of media scrutiny. There would be no room for mistakes on this one.</p><p>Buried behind his kids\u2019 house. How freaking twisted.</p><p>And who\u2019d done the bastard? Who\u2019d finally managed to kill Trent?</p><p>Even he\u2019d been tempted. Especially after he\u2019d seen Sylvia\u2019s broken body.</p><p>Ben rubbed his hand over his face. His eyes were gritty. \u201cI want to talk to the family.\u201d Had to be done. Better to just get it over with now.</p><p>Kristen nodded, her short red hair bobbing around her face. She looked barely eighteen, but Ben knew that image was deceptive\u2014and one that Kristen used to her advantage on the streets. When you were expecting fluff, it was easy to get taken down by a bulldog.</p><p>Crickets chirped around them. The cadaver dogs barked as their handlers held them back.</p><p>When they approached the house, he saw Katherine walk onto her back porch. A worn robe covered her thin shoulders and she hugged herself. \u201cYou found him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to suspect her, but the questions in his mind wouldn\u2019t stop. Had she known about the kill? Been in on it?</p><p>Katherine LaShaun. A strong woman. One who would do anything for her family.</p><p>Buried behind the house. In the woods that the boys probably played in every day.</p><p>Sick.</p><p>He walked onto the porch. He hesitated under the bright light. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a body. Too early for identification yet.\u201d</p><p>Kristen crept to his side, almost soundlessly. The lady knew how to move and she knew how to track killers. One day soon, she\u2019d make a good detective.</p><p>Katherine nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s him, then.\u201d Certainty. A jagged breath. \u201cMy boys won\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ben glanced around. The house seemed too quiet. Sure, the boys should have been sleeping\u2014but no, they would have woken up with all the cops and dogs there. It was too loud for the kids to still be sleeping. \u201cKatherine, where are the boys?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze left the woods and came to rest on him. \u201cAt a friend\u2019s house. They\u2019re safe. They don\u2019t know...won\u2019t know...about this.\u201d Her lips shook. \u201cThey play there\u2014 they won\u2019t know. \u201d</p><p>She\u2019d moved the boys before the cops arrived. How the hell had she known to do that?</p><p>\u201cYou knew we were coming, didn\u2019t you, Mrs. LaShaun?\u201d Kristen asked.</p><p>Katherine glanced her way. Slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t believe I know you, honey.\u201d</p><p>Kristen slapped a smile on her face. The non-threatening one she wore so well. \u201cKristen Langley.\u201d She offered a hand.</p><p>One that wasn\u2019t taken.</p><p>Katherine rocked back on her heels. \u201cAll this time, I was afraid, and he was right here.\u201d Her gaze skittered back to Ben\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who killed him?\u201d</p><p>Not yet. But, God willing, he would soon. \u201cWho told you we were coming, Katherine?\u201d The person who\u2019d given her the tip could well be the killer.</p><p>Only the officers on his team knew about this body. The cops\u2014and the killer.</p><p>Her lips, already thin, flattened even more. \u201cI need you cops to be done by tomorrow afternoon. My boys will be comin\u2019</p><p>back then.\u201d</p><p>Kristen opened her mouth\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou got a phone call, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he pressed, not about to be led off track. He wasn\u2019t new to this game.</p><p>Kristen\u2019s mouth snapped closed.</p><p>\u201cWe can subpoena phone records, you know. We\u2019re going to find out, one way or another.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do a damn thing to help my girl! Not one damn thing! You let that bastard out and he killed her\u2014he killed her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that, Mrs. LaShaun.\u201d Yeah, right.</p><p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d</p><p>Katherine had never been one to mince words. One of the things he liked about the woman. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your daughter, Katherine. I did try to help her. Erin\u2014\u201d Don\u2019t think about her now \u201cand I did everything we could.\u201d It just hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>Her gaze fell. \u201cErin Jerome fought for my daughter even when Sylvia wouldn\u2019t fight for herself.\u201d Soft. Sadness passed over her face. She sucked in a sharp breath and her shoulders shoved back even as her chin came up with new determination. \u201cGet your subpoena if you have to! Do it! But I\u2019m not tellin\u2019 you another thing!\u201d Then she turned and stormed into the house, slamming the back door behind her.</p><p>Well, well. Katherine was hell-bent on protecting someone. From the look on her face, she thought that someone might have been involved in the killing.</p><p>Who? Who would Katherine protect? Only her boys. Just the boys.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he stared at the back door. \u201cKristen, get the DA. Let him know we need that subpoena yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed the rest of his vacation good-bye and got ready for his business of murder. Murder\u2014just what he did best and\u2014</p><p>Voices. Shouting, the snarls of fury drifting on the wind.</p><p>His stare snapped to Kristen\u2019s. What the fuck?</p><p>He vaulted off the back porch. She was with him, her smaller body hurtling behind his.</p><p>They rounded the house. Good, more police tape was up. That should keep the gawkers back, for a while anyway.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way! Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d An asshole was all but screaming at one of the uniforms, shoving a long, thick finger at the young guy\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudge Lance Harper.\u201d Bastard extraordinaire. Ben braked to a halt and glared at the idiot who would no doubt be headlining the local news for the next three days.</p><p>The judge\u2019s head jerked toward him and his muddy brown eyes slit. \u201cGreer.\u201d Sounded more like a curse than a name because, yeah, there wasn\u2019t exactly a whole lot of love lost between him and the judge, arrogant SOB that the guy was.</p><p>Ben braced his hands on his waist, knowing the move would show his holster. Shooting the judge probably wasn\u2019t an option, but a man could dream.</p><p>Oh, yes, he could dream.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got this one,\u201d Ben said to the uniform. \u201cLangley\u201d\u2014Kristen\u2019s gaze was on the judge\u2014\u201cgo make that phone call.\u201d</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw her head bob and then she backed away.</p><p>The judge\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cI demand that you tell me what is going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, you demand, huh? Since when do you have the right to demand anything at my crime scene?\u201d What was the guy even doing there? No way was this the man\u2019s business anymore.</p><p>A muscle flexed along Harper\u2019s jaw. \u201cCartwright told me about the body on the property.\u201d</p><p>Did no one in this city believe in keeping things under wraps? This was a murder for shit\u2019s sake! \u201cHis mistake,\u201d Ben managed, the words grating in his throat.</p><p>\u201cIt was my case, detective. The man was in my courtroom, he was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou let him walk.\u201d A mistake. Not Harper\u2019s first, not his last, and the judge\u2019s insanity on the bench was only part of the reason why Ben couldn\u2019t stand the guy.</p><p>The other reason? Ben had once had a lover leave him...for the judge. The guy might be old, but the bastard was hell with the ladies.</p><p>Very slowly, Harper\u2019s fists unknotted. \u201cYou think you know me, don\u2019t you, detective?\u201d</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t know him particularly well. Didn\u2019t want to, either. \u201cI\u2019m working a murder, Harper. I don\u2019t have time for your games.\u201d</p><p>Harper\u2019s chin rose. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let that bastard walk, but I had no choice.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhen the wife changed her story, what was I supposed to do? There wasn\u2019t enough evidence to hold him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he probably killed Sylvia, don\u2019t you?\u201d Ben fired right across his words. \u201cHe walked and he killed her.\u201d That knowledge had burned in Ben\u2019s gut more nights than he could count.</p><p>Harper\u2019s Adam\u2019s Apple bobbed. \u201cI-I know.\u201d A rasp. Remorse? What? From Harper? Their eyes locked. \u201cWhat I do in this world isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Harper said. \u201cJustice never is.\u201d</p><p>Ben thought of those dirty bones. Of the boys who\u2019d grow up without their mother or their worthless excuse for a father.</p><p>\u201cGo home. There\u2019s nothing left for you here. This isn\u2019t your case anymore.\u201d</p><p>Harper\u2019s gaze drifted to the house. \u201cNo\u2014no, I don\u2019t guess it is.\u201d His shoulders slumped and he turned away.</p><p>For an instant, Ben could almost feel a stir of sympathy for the fellow. Almost.</p><p>Then the instant passed. He wheeled around. Back to business. \u201cAll right, people, I want this scene combed for every bit of evidence you can find. We\u2019ve got a body, and we\u2019re damn well gonna find his killer.\u201d Because Ben didn\u2019t believe in letting monsters walk. Not in his town.</p><p>Even if the vic had been a cold-blooded asshole, he\u2019d find Trent\u2019s killer. That was his job.</p><p>He was good at his job.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Erin stared at her mother\u2014oh, damn, her mother\u2014and kept every muscle in her body locked tight.</p><p>Not going to her.</p><p>Not going to hold her.</p><p>Not going to hit her. Not!</p><p>\u201cI came to see you.\u201d Flat. No emotion there. Never had been. That one eyebrow rose again. \u201cCan I come in or do I have to stand out here all night?\u201d</p><p>Leave.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Jude growled. \u201cBut at the first sign of a shift, your ass is gone.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed and crossed the threshold. \u201cI can\u2019t talk to my daughter in wolf form. She doesn\u2019t change\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I fucking know. Big damn deal.\u201d Jude shut the door behind her. Too quietly. He crossed his arms over his chest and glared.</p><p>Her mother\u2014Theresa\u2014blinked and glanced over at Erin. \u201cYou told him? And he\u2019s still with you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, her mother was full of love and maternal instincts.</p><p>Erin felt her blood heat. \u201cHe\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanding here, big as day,\u201d Jude murmured. \u201cNot planning to go anyplace.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, her mother attacked, jumping back, and thrusting her claws right up to Jude\u2019s throat. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about hurting her. Just \u2019cause she\u2019s weak, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from him.\u201d Not screamed. Not shouted. Erin gave the demand coldly, despite the fire in her gut, and she felt the rip of her claws tearing through her flesh.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s head swung toward her. \u201cErin? What are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude threw her back. A hard toss with his hand that had Theresa flying through the air and slamming into the floor. She scrambled up, fast, crouching, snarling and spitting.</p><p>Erin hurriedly stepped in front of Jude. \u201cDon\u2019t come at him again.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face went slack with surprise.</p><p>Looking at her hurt. Erin sucked in a breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here, and I really don\u2019t care.\u201d Lie, lie. \u201cBut you are not going to attack Jude. He\u2019s done nothing but help me, and he doesn\u2019t deserve that shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yellow eyes slit. \u201cYou care for him?\u201d</p><p>The silence behind her was thick. Good thing Jude couldn\u2019t see her face right them. \u201cWhat I feel for him is not your business.\u201d</p><p>But her mother saw too much. Always had.</p> <p>After a moment, Theresa rose to her feet. Tossing back her hair, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up hard.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, because being abandoned by her mother should have made her grow up easy. A growl built in Erin\u2019s throat.</p><p>Jude\u2019s hands came down on her shoulders. Squeezed.</p><p>She stiffened. He shouldn\u2019t touch her. No. Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t show her any weakness.</p><p>Too late. Her mother\u2019s gaze had already noted the telling move.</p> <p>\u201cAttached to her, are you, tiger?\u201d She smiled and seemed satisfied. \u201cI hope you\u2019re a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Close to a snarl.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes raked Erin. \u201cLong time, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Baby girl, her ass. This wasn\u2019t some movie-of-the week reunion. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>A shrug.</p> <p>Red lights danced before Erin\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen get out.\u201d</p><p>Jude pulled her back against his chest. \u201cEasy.\u201d Breathed in her ear.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to be easy. She wanted to scream. To rage. Like she\u2019d done years ago.</p><p>The yellow eyes dropped. \u201cBeen looking for you,\u201d Theresa said, lifting her hand to rub the back of her neck. \u201cYou disappeared on me. I got...worried.\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cYou left me years ago. You knew where I was.\u201d She hadn\u2019t moved until her dad died. \u201cNot like I was real hard to find.\u201d Theresa had never come looking for her. Not once.</p><p>Still gazing at the floor, her mother said, \u201cNot then. I...watched you then. Had to stay far back. You would have caught my scent.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t have hurt more if someone had carved her heart out with claws right then.</p><p>\u201cLost you...a few months back.\u201d</p> <p>What? All that time? All that damn time, her mother had been close by\u2014and she\u2019d never contacted her. Why?</p><p>Theresa glanced up. Her mother had to see the question burning Erin alive because she said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t fit in my world.\u201d</p><p>Like Erin didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fit in yours.\u201d Another shrug of Theresa\u2019s shoulders. But this time, the move seemed...tired. Sad. \u201cBut I still...wanted to make sure you were okay. I-I needed to see you.\u201d</p><p>Erin shook her head. Jude felt solid behind her. Strong and steady\u2014just what she needed then. \u201cYou threw me away.\u201d A whisper, one she hadn\u2019t meant to voice.</p><p>That stare bored into her. \u201cHad to. You couldn\u2019t shift\u2014\u201d</p><p>She flinched.</p><p>\u201c\u2014and the pack would have torn you apart. No way were you strong enough to handle what they would have thrown at you.\u201d Theresa\u2019s shoulders set. \u201cI did what I had to do in order to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Erin stared at her mother. At the tense expression on her face. The steady hands. And she said, simply, \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Theresa\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t leave me on that doorstep because you wanted to protect me.\u201d Not buying that. Not for a minute. Jude\u2019s hold on her tightened. \u201cYou did it because you were ashamed of me.\u201d</p><p>She saw the hit in the slight widening of her mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou think I didn\u2019t know?\u201d Erin asked, stomach knotted. \u201cYou think I didn\u2019t see the way you looked at me?\u201d Not a proud mama. Never that. Always pushing her into the shadows. Away from the others who might see her.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be like me!\u201d A scream of fury and pain that broke fast and hard from her mother\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cSupposed to shift and fight\u2014 just like me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t just like you.\u201d Sadness there. \u201cI was like my dad.\u201d</p><p>Theresa\u2019s head jerked. \u201cI should have been mated to the alpha! He loved me! We were supposed to be together, but then I screwed everything up and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd had me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s mouth snapped closed but she gave a grim nod.</p><p>Honesty, at least.</p><p>\u201cYou had me,\u201d Erin continued, \u201cand you didn\u2019t think I was good enough for the pack\u2014or for you.\u201d This hurt.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be with him,\u201d a stark whisper. \u201cI loved him.\u201d</p><p>Erin knew the him hadn\u2019t been her father.</p><p>\u201cHe saw me,\u201d Theresa said, voice soft. \u201cSuch dark, dark eyes that saw into me so well.\u201d Her shoulders sagged. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look at me the same way after he learned about your father.\u201d</p><p>And what? That was Erin\u2019s fault? Her father\u2019s? Erin bit back the snarl that rose within her.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got pregnant,\u201d her mother said, \u201che knew I wasn\u2019t his mate. Knew that somewhere out there, another woman waited...only a matter of time.\u201d A tear trickled down her cheek. \u201cI lost you.\u201d</p><p>Not real hard to lose something when you threw it away.</p><p>\u201cBut first, I lost him.\u201d She swiped away the tear with the back of her hand. \u201cHe left the pack before you were born. I-I kept thinking he\u2019d come back, but he...turned his back on everyone. On me.\u201d</p><p>Just like Erin\u2019s mother had turned away from her. The woman wasn\u2019t going to be getting any sympathy from her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come here tonight?\u201d Jude\u2019s gravelly voice.</p><p>Her mother blinked. \u201cTo...see Erin. I caught her scent at Mort\u2019s. I wanted to...talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what? Make up for lost time?\u201d he demanded. \u201cOr just jerk her around some more?\u201d</p><p>Theresa\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cI wanted to make certain she was happy and safe. I didn\u2019t know what you were to her, I was afraid\u2014\u201d She exhaled. \u201cShifters go after the weak.\u201d</p><p>Weak. Was that how her mother truly saw her? Erin glanced down at her hands. Her claws were gone.</p><p>But they could come back in a second\u2019s time.</p><p>\u201cOther hybrids were in the pack,\u201d her mother said, swallowing, \u201cbut you were the only one who couldn\u2019t change. You were in danger, you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was fourteen,\u201d Erin said softly, cutting through her words, \u201cthe girls in the pack jumped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey thought I was weak, too.\u201d They\u2019d taunted. Teased. Then attacked her with claws and teeth.</p><p>But, luckily, they\u2019d been in human form.</p><p>So she\u2019d wiped the floor with their asses.</p><p>Erin met her mother\u2019s shocked stare. \u201cThey were wrong about me, too.\u201d She\u2019d bet some of them still had the scars to prove just how wrong they\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cY-you never said\u2014and they didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I didn\u2019t want you to worry.\u201d She\u2019d always tried to protect her mother. Stupid really. Theresa was the last person on earth who needed protection. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell\u2014well, I guess because they didn\u2019t want everyone knowing the little freak had kicked their furry butts.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d left her alone after that. No more teasing. No more taunts. She\u2019d thought she was fitting in\u2014</p><p>Until she\u2019d been forced out.</p><p>Her spine straightened. \u201cSo don\u2019t talk to me about being weak, okay? I know why you left me, but what I don\u2019t know is why the hell you\u2019ve come back now.\u201d Or why she\u2019d been coming back. Spying, all these years.</p><p>She\u2019d never known. It hurt.</p><p>\u201cI...missed you.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t weaken.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see how you turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when Dad died? When I stood by his grave, crying, alone, where were you?\u201d</p><p>No answer. She hadn\u2019t expected one. Enough. \u201cThe reunion\u2019s over, mother. Time for you to go.\u201d Hopefully, before her mother decided to go after Jude\u2014or her\u2014with claws and teeth.</p><p>Theresa held her gaze, then gave a grim nod.</p><p>Erin and Jude stepped away from the door.</p><p>Her mother hesitated. \u201cThings are...good for you. I know you used to be a lawyer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill am.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014but now you\u2019ve got a mate.\u201d A smile. Wistful, dammit. Her mother had been given a wonderful mate. \u201cA strong shifter, someone who can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mate is a fucked-up wolf shifter, a hybrid like me who kills and tortures people because it gets him off.\u201d</p><p>The smile vanished. Horror took its place on her mother\u2019s face. \u201cA-a hybrid...wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin.\u201d Jude\u2019s tense voice. \u201cDon\u2019t. There\u2019s something that I need\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she just rolled right over him, the rage too much to hold back. \u201cSo don\u2019t think I\u2019ve walked off into some sort of happily-ever-after la-la land for wanna-be shifters. I\u2019ve got a mate, all right, mother. A mate who thinks he\u2019s my perfect match in every single, sick way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know, does she?\u201d</p><p>Jude led Erin\u2019s mother outside and closed the door behind him. A thud shook the motel room wall. Huh. Wonder what Erin threw. \u201cAh...Doesn\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. Oh, but he hoped the door and walls were thicker than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>He grabbed the woman\u2019s arm and hauled her away from the room. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>His jaw locked.</p><p>\u201cI smell her on you. Smell you on her. That\u2019s the way with mates. Like she\u2019s under your skin and you\u2019re under hers.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t deny it, because Erin was under his skin. In his very blood. \u201cThen you tell me...how is it possible for a woman to be a mate to two shifters? One a wolf and one a tiger?\u201d Because it wasn\u2019t possible. No way.</p><p>\u201cErin\u2019s not your usual shifter. Maybe the rules don\u2019t apply to her.\u201d Her fangs flashed as she said, \u201cOr maybe that asshole who\u2019s claiming her is dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>Good emphasis on dead.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with her again,\u201d she told him. \u201cI know I\u2019ve screwed up, but I miss her. I\u2019ve missed her for years and I want back in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat why you\u2019re in Lillian? Hunting the locals? \u2019Cause you\u2019re looking for her?\u201d This setup wasn\u2019t making sense to him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A hiss.</p><p>He just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cHunting the local idiots was just bonus.\u201d Her hands went to her hips. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt anyone. Just had some fun.\u201d</p><p>Right. The kind of fun that had led the gnome to his shotgun. Jude figured he owed the wolf before him for that. Another damn scar on his body.</p><p>But, curious now, he asked, \u201cIf I\u2019d been after Erin at Mort\u2019s, if I\u2019d been going to have some...fun with her, what would you have done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRipped your throat out.\u201d Said immediately.</p><p>Good to know.</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m messed up,\u201d she told him with a straight stare. \u201cAnd I know I\u2019m not the mother she needs.\u201d The woman wet her lips. \u201cBut I need her.\u201d Her hand dove into her back pocket. When her hand came back up, she shoved a bent business card at him. \u201cWhen... if she ever wants to talk to me, give her that number, okay?\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for his answer, she spun away from him and marched toward the line of cars waiting in the parking lot.</p><p>After five feet, she stopped. \u201cYou gonna get that bastard claiming to be her mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>She tossed a quick glance over her shoulder and the smile on her face was pure Erin. \u201cGood. Do me a favor\u2014rip his throat out for me.\u201d</p><p>Then she jumped into one of the cars and spun out of the lot.</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d he whispered, watching her go. Ripping the bastard\u2019s throat out was the plan, after all.</p><p>The early morning sunlight burned her eyes. Thanks to her mother and the not-so-small matter of a murder, last night had been a real bitch. Erin marched away from the motel room, her bag clutched tightly in her hand. Coming back home had been exactly as hard as she\u2019d thought it would be.</p><p>And just when she\u2019d thought her life couldn\u2019t get any more screwed up...</p><p>\u201cErin.\u201d Jude grabbed her arm, jerking her to a stop. She blinked, trying to shove her way out of the pity party and focus on him.</p><p>\u201cCompany,\u201d a breath of a whisper from Jude.</p><p>She followed his gaze and saw the gleaming curves of a BMW sweep into the old lot. Erin caught a glimpse of the driver\u2019s face.</p><p>Judge Harper. \u201cHe must have another meeting,\u201d she muttered. A meeting at the motel. No big surprise for the judge.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d She was more than ready to hit the road.</p><p>The BMW jerked to a halt, and Harper shoved open his door. He sprang from his car and his gaze instantly zeroed in on her. \u201cJerome! Erin Jerome! Wait!\u201d</p><p>Great. Erin took a deep breath, aware of Jude stiffening behind her. Pasting a fake smile on her face, she asked,</p><p>\u201cSomething I can do for you, judge?\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward her. As usual, he looked all determined and cocky and confident\u2014then he stumbled. The judge jerked to a halt and stared down at her.</p><p>She lifted a brow and stared right back.</p><p>\u201cI-I had to find you. Cartwright told me you were leaving.\u201d A heavy pause. \u201cI went to Katherine LaShaun\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Erin blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d The last thing she\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cI had to go! When I heard about the body\u201d\u2014his nostrils flared\u2014\u201cI needed to see for myself what was happening out there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, she\u2019d wanted to see the scene, too. But she hadn\u2019t been allowed on sight.</p><p>Harper\u2019s eyes darted to Jude, then back to her. \u201cErin, can we talk, privately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The instant answer came from Jude and from Erin.</p> <p>Harper\u2019s lips thinned and he dragged a shaking hand through his already tousled hair. \u201cYou and Greer have to understand.</p><p>Trent\u2019s death wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>Oh, what? Was it hers?</p><p>\u201cThe wife recanted, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven without her testimony, there was more than enough evidence to convict.\u201d Flat, cold. \u201cWe both know that Trent was abusing her. The guy was guilty as the devil, and we had the chance to stop him.\u201d But he\u2019d walked.</p> <p>Then, well, died.</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d The judge rocked back on his heels, and for a moment, he didn\u2019t look as strong or as fit as he\u2019d appeared in the past. He looked...tired. \u201cI guess he\u2019s stopped now, though, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he is,\u201d Jude said, voice like a cool breeze.</p><p>Death had a nice way of stopping folks.</p><p>Harper flinched. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this would happen. I just\u2014I just made the only judgment I could.\u201d</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t know what to say to the judge. After a moment, he turned away from her and shuffled back to his car.</p> <p>Erin watched him, aware of Jude\u2019s strong presence at her back. Harper felt guilty. She could see it, feel it. Guilty enough to seek her out.</p><p>And he\u2019d come\u2014to what? Neither one of them could go back and change the past. Too many ifs in the world. If he\u2019d convicted Trent...if she\u2019d worked harder to prove the bastard\u2019s guilt...if Sylvia hadn\u2019t faltered...</p><p>You couldn\u2019t go back.</p><p>The judge knew that and so did she.</p><p>Harper stopped at his car. He glanced back at her. \u201cI know what they say about me.\u201d</p><p>On the take. So many criminals walked right out of his courtroom with barely a slap on his wrist. \u201cDo you?\u201d She murmured, but Erin knew he heard her.</p><p>\u201cI want those bastards who break the law to pay,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust like you do.\u201d</p><p>Then why didn\u2019t they? Why did so many ease past him?</p> <p>He pulled open the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cI do the best I can, Jerome. Guess it\u2019s not always good enough.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever have regrets?\u201d</p><p>Too many. Erin gave a grudging nod.</p><p>\u201cIs the bastard ever gonna leave?\u201d Jude murmured in her ear and wrapped his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>A ghost of a smile curved Harper\u2019s lips. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d Then he climbed into his car.</p><p>Erin leaned against Jude. Damn but the man felt solid.</p><p>Harper drove away with a soft purr of his engine.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to get the hell out of this town?\u201d Jude asked after a moment of silence. The thick, uncomfortable kind of silence that made her want to squirm.</p><p>\u201cMore than ready.\u201d Before she had any more unwanted visitors from her past. Like a certain detective she\u2019d prefer to avoid. Talk about regrets. Erin swallowed and tried to shove the past away. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any closer to finding the bastard, did we?\u201d</p><p>He turned her toward him. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna catch him, sweetheart.\u201d Absolute certainty there.</p><p>But when? Before or after he killed someone else?</p><p>\u201cWe will catch him,\u201d Jude repeated.</p><p>And, once again, Erin forced herself to nod.</p><p>Once they were in Baton Rouge, Erin tried to get back into her routine as fast as possible. But, her routine had an unexpected addition.</p><p>She\u2019d been given a babysitter. Okay, not a babysitter so much as a six-foot-two, two hundred pound, pissy demon who tailed her every move.</p><p>Erin looked up from her files and stared at said pissy demon.</p><p>Zane raised his brows and stared right back at her.</p><p>He was five feet away. Slouched in her ratty spare chair.</p><p>And the man wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>When she and Jude had returned to Baton Rouge, Jude had dropped his little protection bombshell on her.</p><p>Until the wolf was caught, she\u2019d have twenty-four seven protection. One of the Night Watch hunters during the day\u2014while Jude was out digging up leads. And at night, Jude would be with her.</p><p>Now, she was all about the Jude at night part. Yeah, that worked for her. More than worked.</p><p>But Zane, and the irritating humming the guy kept doing under his breath, well, he wasn\u2019t so much her thing.</p><p>Jude even had the human woman scheduled to take a shift with her. A human.</p><p>For protection?</p><p>That was just insulting.</p><p>One of the assistants came bustling in. \u201cErin, here\u2019s the transcript from the Parsons trial\u2014\u201d</p><p>A long, loud whistle.</p><p>Amy jumped and dropped the folder. Her hand flew to her chest as her head jerked to the right and Erin saw her spy the lurking demon.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cHi there.\u201d</p><p>Erin growled.</p><p>He kept smiling at the assistant.</p><p>Don\u2019t need this. Don\u2019t. Need. This.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Amy, I\u2019ll review it later today.\u201d A dismissal. Probably too curt, but damn if Amy wasn\u2019t starting to smile right back at the demon now. Great.</p><p>Erin cleared her throat. Twice. Amy finally darted out of the office, but not before she gave one long, last look at Zane.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass.\u201d Erin told him, meaning it.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cAh, you\u2019re just mad \u2019cause I\u2019m not flirting with you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t flirt with women who can fry my brain.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least she was in his safe zone. Erin bared her teeth. She really didn\u2019t like the reminder of that vicious encounter.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t we already go over this? Demon versus wolf? Why did Jude send you to watch me?\u201d</p><p>A lazy shrug. \u201c\u2019Cause he trusts me.\u201d A pause. \u201cAnd he knows I\u2019d fight like hell to protect you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. That was new. The guy sounded like he meant those words, too. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do.\u201d A slow stretch. \u201cWould even want to fuck you, if Jude hadn\u2019t already claimed you.\u201d</p><p>Heat burned her cheeks. No, no, he hadn\u2019t just said\u2014</p><p>A soft chuckle escaped his lips. \u201cRelax. I said I would want to. Didn\u2019t say I was going to.\u201d His right foot swung in a small circle. \u201cI like women with a wild side.\u201d</p><p>Oh, then he\u2019d probably love her.</p><p>But\u2014</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t interested. Not at all.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t Jude.</p><p>Jude.</p><p>Erin rubbed her right temple. A vague ache was starting to build there. Not enough sleep, probably. After seeing dear old Mom, she sure hadn\u2019t been able to sleep well.</p><p>And knowing that the wolf was still out there\u2014</p><p>Not exactly a situation conducive to rest and relaxation.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Jude?\u201d she asked him, sinking deeper into her chair.</p><p>\u201cHunting.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. \u201cHe\u2019s got backup, right? I mean, he\u2019s not out there alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude really isn\u2019t the backup type.\u201d</p><p>The ache turned into a throb. \u201cEveryone needs backup.\u201d</p><p>Another rap at her door. Sighing, Erin called out, \u201cCome on in, Amy, it\u2019s fine for you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door swung open. Not Amy this time. Jude.</p><p>Her lips wanted to curve at the sight of him. She could almost forget about the ache in her temple because she was just so glad to see him.</p><p>Jude. Tall and strong, with that thick mane of blond hair. Blue eyes shining so bright.</p><p>His stare heated when it landed on her. Erin rose, bracing her hands behind the desk. \u201cAh, Jude, I was...ah...wondering where you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanted to check on you,\u201d he said, breaking into her stumbling and so not suave words. He jerked his thumb toward the door. \u201cZane, give us a minute, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minute? Damn, man, no woman likes it that fast.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. No, that jerk just hadn\u2019t said\u2014</p><p>Jude\u2019s snarl had the demon jumping from his chair and heading for the door.</p><p>When the door shut behind Zane, Jude stared at her in silence.</p><p>Then he locked the door.</p><p>Erin swallowed, realizing her throat was way too dry.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She flinched because, those words, oh, they were never good.</p><p>Knew this would happen. Jude knew all her secrets now. Everything about her mother and the wolf within.</p><p>How screwed up do you have to be to get abandoned by the pack?</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d A deep rumble as he took a gliding step closer to her.</p><p>Right then, she was very grateful that the desk was between them. \u201cAh...okay. Wh-what do you want to talk about? Have you\u2014have you found out anything about the stalker?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned. \u201cI got some places to check out today. I might have some news after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Her fingers knotted together. What was she supposed to say? Sorry my mother tried to attack you and sorry I\u2019ve been lying-slash-keeping-the-truth-about-myself-from-you, but, hey, the sex between us is great and when I\u2019m with you...I feel good.</p><p>Better than good.</p><p>Almost happy.</p><p>No, not almost.</p><p>Even with that bastard on her trail, when she was with Jude, she felt safe. Like she belonged.</p><p>And, yes, dammit, happy.</p><p>\u201cI need to know...\u201d Jude\u2019s jaw set as he walked around the desk.</p><p>So much for that safety.</p><p>He caught her upper arms and held her with fingers too tight.</p><p>Both temples throbbed now in a hard, fast beat.</p><p>\u201cAre things different between us?\u201d Jude asked. \u201cBecause of what I told you? Do you...? Ah, hell!\u201d He kissed her. A deep, toes-curling- yes kiss that had her heart racing and her sex clenching.</p><p>His tongue slipped past her lips. Tangled with hers. Tasted.</p><p>And she sure tasted him.</p><p>Her nipples hardened against the lacy edge of her bra. The points ached and she rubbed them against his chest, seeking relief. No, pleasure.</p><p>Because Jude knew just how to offer pleasure.</p><p>His lips broke from hers. \u201cErin, the way you smell\u201d\u2014his nostrils flared\u2014\u201csweet cream and candy\u2014my own treat.\u201d</p><p>She gulped and knew that her smell\u2014 sweet cream and candy\u2014had to be flowing stronger right then.</p><p>His forehead pressed against hers. He sucked in a sharp breath and shuddered.</p><p>Or maybe she did.</p><p>\u201cTell me it didn\u2019t change anything,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me you know I\u2019m not like that psycho after you.\u201d</p><p>Understanding broke through the sensual need. Jude was worried she\u2019d turn from him? Because of his past?</p><p>And here she\u2019d been afraid that her wolf heritage would send the guy running.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt you, Erin. I swear.\u201d</p><p>Her lips brushed over his. Soft, so soft. When there had never been much softness between them. \u201cI know.\u201d And she did.</p><p>His past might not be pretty. Neither was hers. But the truth was that she trusted him.</p><p>Dangerous, she knew. Trusting anyone, especially a shifter, was a big risk. Born with two faces, meant to lie\u2014that\u2019s what some said about the shifters. But Jude was different.</p><p>He was fighting to protect her. Not trying to hurt her or control her.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d killed. There was darkness in him. She\u2019d felt it, seen it. Yet Erin didn\u2019t think Jude would ever turn that darkness on her or on anyone else that didn\u2019t deserve the fury of his hunt.</p><p>No innocents will be hurt.</p><p>She pulled back a bit and tried a smile, hoping to lighten the thick mood and ease a grin back to his lips. That sexy scar\u2014she loved to see it rise up. \u201cBesides, since we\u2019re not mated, I know you\u2019d never go territorial on me.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>No smile and his face, if anything, seemed harsher.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped. \u201cMated or not, I already am territorial when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dried. What did he mean? Was it more than sex for him? It was so much more for her, but she hadn\u2019t wanted to hope\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an easy man, Erin. Never will be.\u201d His shoulders were so straight. His hands had fisted. \u201cI\u2019d sooner fucking cut off my own hand than ever lift it against you.\u201d</p><p>His voice shook.</p><p>So did her knees.</p><p>\u201cBut, hell, yeah, I\u2019m territorial about you. You\u2019re in my head every minute. I close my eyes, and I see you and I want you so much I can hardly breathe.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that was\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe timing for us is shit.\u201d</p><p>True. Her timing was generally always like that.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know with that asshole out there, the last thing you need is a man trying to get too close.\u201d</p><p>Jude already was too close because the things he\u2019d said... You\u2019re in my head every minute. I close my eyes, and I see you and I want you so much I can hardly breathe.</p><p>She could have said the same things about him.</p><p>All true.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m gonna take him down,\u201d Jude growled, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna take the fear out of your eyes and I\u2019m gonna prove that you can trust me, that I\u2019m not some sick freak like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jude, I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see who I am.\u201d He stared down at her. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t fix this damn timing.\u201d She saw him take a hard gulp of his own. \u201cAnd as for the mating...\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted. \u201cI can\u2019t control the mating. If that\u2014that wolf is right, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen nothing! You...you\u2019re different from every other shifter out there, sweetheart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yeah, different. Nice, easy word for her situation.</p><p>Because she\u2019d always been different.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different...human and shifter. So what makes you so sure that you\u2019d mate like the others? What makes you so sure you\u2019d only have one mate?\u201d</p> <p>Her lips parted in surprise. \u201cJude.\u201d What was he telling himself? No, no, he had to see\u2014shifters only had one mate. One chance for children. Fate didn\u2019t care if a shifter\u2019s mate was a killer or a savior. The mating was forever.</p><p>The beast inside her had recognized the wolf. That part was the most humiliating for her. So humiliating, she hadn\u2019t told Jude. Her body had known the wolf shifter at the first touch. No, not her body, but the dormant beast inside. Erin had been horrified, afraid, but, dammit, aware of him. An instinctual response she couldn\u2019t control. One that made her sick.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Simple words, gruff.</p><p>Her gaze met his and she saw the understanding in his eyes. Understanding and a banked rage. Erin licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut I also know how your body responds to me, and I know the beast. It\u2019s awake when I\u2019m near, and it\u2019s hungry for me.\u201d</p> <p>He was right.</p><p>Erin rocked back on her heels, banging her hip into the desk. She\u2019d thought the sex was just great because she wasn\u2019t having to hold back and because, well, Jude was freaking fantastic, but what if there was something more there?</p><p>What if...</p><p>No. No one got two mates, and sure as hell not someone who couldn\u2019t even manage one shift.</p><p>\u201cForget the mating,\u201d Jude told her and his eyes burned with intensity. \u201cThe mating isn\u2019t what matters anyway.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d know. He\u2019d seen firsthand just how wrong those fated matings could be.</p> <p>So had she.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a mate for the beast.\u201d</p><p>But with full-blood shifters, the beast was never separate from the man. Not really.</p><p>His fist thudded against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m looking for someone who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck out of my way!\u201d</p><p>Erin jerked at the raised voice. Her gaze locked on her closed door. That voice...she hadn\u2019t heard that deep baritone in months.</p><p>\u201cBack up, Boy Scout, or I\u2019m gonna have to hurt you.\u201d Zane. Loud, confident, pissed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Jude strode toward the door.</p> <p>Erin, moving much slower, did the same. Shit for timing. Always.</p><p>\u201cTry it, asswipe. I\u2019m a cop. Lay the first finger on me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude yanked open the door, a snarl on his lips.</p><p>Erin scrambled after him.</p><p>She caught sight of the two men in the outer office. Tall and strong, almost nose to nose.</p><p>And she knew that her day was about to get even worse.</p><p>The throbbing in her temples flared again. Harder. Aspirin. Need aspirin.</p><p>\u201cZane!\u201d Jude\u2019s voice snapped. \u201cWho the hell is this guy?\u201d His nostrils flared and Erin knew he was trying to catch a scent.</p><p>But he\u2019d only smell a human because Lillian Detective Ben Greer was human through and through.</p><p>Ben shoved Zane out of his way and locked his warm chocolate eyes on her. \u201cErin.\u201d Softness there, and anger.</p><p>She eased to Jude\u2019s side, far too conscious of all the curious stares. Way too many people were around. Amy. Another assistant, Donna. And Karrie, the ADA next door was also peering in, though it looked like she was trying real hard not to be obvious. \u201cAh, Ben, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while since you left me bleeding out in a hospital bed, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Okay, no softness that time, only anger. She stiffened and took the hit because the way she figured it, she deserved his rage. He\u2019d been hurt because of her.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jude, come on! Let me take this prick outside and teach him some manners,\u201d Zane wheedled.</p><p>Ben jerked out his badge. \u201cI\u2019m a cop. I\u2019d like to see you try to teach me some\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane grinned and stepped eagerly forward. The fact that Ben was a cop didn\u2019t seem to matter much to him.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re Ben Greer?\u201d Jude asked quietly. His legs were braced apart. Hands loose at his sides.</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze raked him. \u201cAnd I take it you\u2019re the asshole who\u2019s sleeping with Erin now?\u201d</p><p>Amy sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>Jude just smiled. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re also the prick who was screwing around with my case files.\u201d</p><p>Jude just shrugged.</p><p>Erin knew it was time to take charge. She stepped forward, putting herself between Jude and Ben.</p><p>Ben. He looked the same. Handsome face. Thick, slightly curling brown hair. A dimple in his chin.</p><p>A solid guy. A good cop.</p><p>Human.</p><p>Not for me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand her. Never would.</p><p>Not like Jude.</p><p>\u201cBen, perhaps we should go into my office and talk.\u201d Away from all the watching eyes and straining ears.</p><p>He pulled in a deep breath. His fingers whitened around his badge. \u201cYeah, yeah, let\u2019s do that.\u201d His head cocked to the right. A move she\u2019d seen a hundred times. A move he always made just before he threw out a challenge to a suspect.</p><p>Her heart thudded too hard in her chest. He\u2019d come to Baton Rouge. Why? Not for me, but for...</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go talk, Erin, and you can tell me just why you interfered in a murder investigation this weekend and why the hell I found your picture clutched in the hands of a dead man.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that would be why.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>His claws wanted to spring free. Jude could feel the burn beneath his fingertips, but he held onto his control.</p><p>The cop. The one he knew Erin had cared for back in Lillian. They were in Erin\u2019s office now. The guy stood less than five feet away\u2014and he was watching Erin with far too much knowledge in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cJude, do you mind if I speak with Ben alone?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. He crossed his arms over his chest and glowered down at her.</p><p>She stared right back up at him. \u201cI need to speak with him alone.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. He was not happy with this crap. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside.\u201d He glanced at the cop. The guy had moved back and leaned against Erin\u2019s desk.</p><p>Human.</p><p>Her fingers skimmed over his arm. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Territorial. The word echoed in his head. The lady had no idea just how territorial he was feeling right then or how badly he wanted to rip into the cop.</p><p>Her lover. He knew it. He could see it in the man\u2019s eyes. The detective had been with Erin. Hell, maybe he\u2019d even loved her. Jude had heard the way the asshole first said her name.</p><p>And Erin\u2014how did she feel? She\u2019d told him things were over with the cop because she couldn\u2019t fit into his \u201cnormal\u201d world, but\u2014</p><p>But Jude knew just how badly Erin longed for \u201cnormal.\u201d</p><p>Rip him apart. Easy prey. Fight. Claim.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>The beast raged inside.</p><p>But he was more than the beast, and he was trying to prove that to Erin. Besides, she had her own choices to make.</p><p>He clenched his teeth and stepped back. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019m right outside.\u201d Course, she\u2019d be able to take down a human no problem, so the message wasn\u2019t so much for her.</p><p>For the cop. His gaze held the other man\u2019s. Right outside.</p><p>When he left the room, Erin swung the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cMan, are you freaking insane?\u201d Zane demanded instantly. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna let that cop stay in there alone with your woman? Did you see the way he was eyeballing her, like a good fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude turned his stare on the demon, and Zane wisely shut the hell up.</p><p>Then Jude crossed his arms over his chest and got ready to wait.</p><p>He\u2019d agreed to stay outside, but it wasn\u2019t like the thin walls would give Erin much privacy. Not to someone like him, anyway.</p><p>If that asshole cop yelled at her again, Jude was going inside, and the claws would be coming out.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Erin asked, keeping her voice cool and easing into her desk chair.</p><p>A shrug. One that tried to make him appear careless, but the lines bracketing his mouth belied the move. \u201cWhen I linked the call at Katherine LaShaun\u2019s place to your cell, the DA had to cough up the info.\u201d</p><p>Ah, the cell call. She\u2019d figured that would be traced back to her sooner or later. She just had been hoping more for later.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten just how good Ben\u2019s contacts were. \u201cI had to call her. I couldn\u2019t let those boys see their father\u2019s body.</p><p>They never would have felt safe at that house, they never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill trying to save the world?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Her lips pressed together.</p><p>Jude had understood. She\u2019d seen the way he looked at the boys.</p><p>Had he seen himself in them? Yeah, she\u2019d bet that he had. Just like she\u2019d seen herself.</p><p>Her hands flattened on the desktop. \u201cI didn\u2019t break any laws by calling Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tipped off a suspect.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to her feet. So much for playing it cool. \u201cPlease! You and I both know there\u2019s no way Katherine killed Trent! That\u2019s not the kind of woman she is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks he killed her daughter. She\u2019d do anything for her girl, you know that.\u201d</p><p>She did, but...\u201cKatherine didn\u2019t kill Trent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem awfully sure of that.\u201d He walked around the desk, moving until he stood less than a foot away from her. \u201cWhy is that, Erin? And why is it that Trent had your picture in what was left of his hands?\u201d</p><p>Because he was another freaking present. She didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cThere are things going on here that you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His lips twisted into a cruel smile. The smile didn\u2019t suit him. Not at all. \u201cLike I didn\u2019t understand about you back in Lillian? Every time I tried to get close, you just shoved me back. When I was in the hospital, you didn\u2019t even come to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was trying to protect you!\u201d The words burst out. Oh, no, she hadn\u2019t meant to tell him that. Now she was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnd I find out now that you\u2019re cozying up with some low-rent bounty hunter!\u201d His face reddened as his voice rose. \u201cI saw the way he looked at you, the two of you are\u2014wait, what the hell did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d</p><p>The door flew open. \u201cAsshole, don\u2019t raise your voice to her again.\u201d Jude stood in the doorway, his claws out and his eyes glowing.</p><p>Ben looked at him and his jaw dropped. \u201cWhat. The. Hell!\u201d</p><p>Jude kicked the door closed with his heel but never took that deadly gaze off the cop.</p><p>\u201cI told you there were things you wouldn\u2019t understand,\u201d Erin said. Then, \u201cJude, back off, okay? I\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I could hear the prick yelling at you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, with his shifter hearing, he probably would have been able to hear a whisper. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way to handle the situation, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got claws!\u201d Ben shook his head, hard.</p><p>\u201cAll the better to rip into prey.\u201d Jude took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up with his eyes? Why are they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the better to see the asshole who doesn\u2019t need to be attacking my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude!\u201d Her snarl had him faltering and glancing over at her. \u201cI can fight this one on my own.\u201d Not helping. No, his big show and tell was making everything a thousand times worse.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s time your cop learned the truth.\u201d In that devil-may-care grin, she caught the edge of his teeth, those too sharp canines. Erin swallowed and really hoped that Ben hadn\u2019t seen them, too, because if he said something about the fangs, she could already hear Jude\u2019s smart-ass response.</p><p>All the better to bite.</p><p>As much as she enjoyed his bites, Ben wouldn\u2019t appreciate the sentiment.</p><p>And he might run screaming.</p><p>It looked like that response could be a near thing right then.</p><p>Thanks, Jude. \u201cBen, relax, okay? Everything is all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right? \u201d he thundered, still shaking his head. Then he shoved her behind him. \u201cDo you see that guy? He\u2019s got claws! \u201d</p><p>She peered around Ben in time to see Jude shrug. \u201cSo does she.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some things I never told you about myself,\u201d she said to Ben, using a tone she hoped was calm and easy.</p><p>He twisted around and eyed her with too-wide eyes. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the fact that I\u2019m not...completely human.\u201d</p><p>A shocked laugh. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. Let him see her claws.</p><p>He jerked back from her and rammed into the desk. Horror was etched on his face. Disbelief filled his gaze.</p><p>The reaction she\u2019d always feared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve stumbled into a hell you can\u2019t fully imagine,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Ben just looked between them, shaking his head. \u201cNo, Erin, I cared about you, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cared about the woman you thought I was.\u201d And she\u2019d just wanted someone to love her, as she really was.</p><p>Claws and all.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t real,\u201d he muttered, running a trembling hand through his hair. \u201cCan\u2019t be, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy outside the door,\u201d\u2014Jude jerked his thumb over his shoulder\u2014\u201cis a demon. I\u2019m a white tiger shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the killer you\u2019re after\u2014the one who left Erin\u2019s picture in the hands of a dead man\u2014is a wolf shifter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben\u2019s brows bunched. \u201cWere...wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d Jude nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not even possible, there\u2019s no way\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude held up his claws and this time, he bared his teeth.</p> <p>The gulp that clicked in Ben\u2019s throat seemed way too loud right then.</p><p>Erin reached out her hand to him, claws gone, but he flinched back. Knew it would happen.</p><p>Jude had never flinched away from her. She glanced at her shifter. No, he\u2019d never flinched away, not even when he\u2019d found out she was part wolf.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted her from the beginning. No holdups. No hedging.</p><p>Taking her, as she was.</p> <p>Jude\u2019s bright blue gaze held hers.</p><p>\u201cErin saved your ass by getting the hell out of Lillian,\u201d Jude told the cop. \u201cThe werewolf who killed Trent is after her and, if she hadn\u2019t left you behind, odds are high he would have killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She managed to look away from Jude and turn her attention back to Ben. \u201cSeems that I acquired an...admirer, of sorts.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pulled down into a frown and she rubbed her temple. \u201cHe does things, hurts others, even kills, and he thinks he\u2019s doing it for me.\u201d</p><p>Jude eased closer. \u201cHe killed a perp here in Baton Rouge and smeared the bastard\u2019s blood all over the walls in her house.</p> <p>Another guy, a lawyer, made the mistake of arguing too much with Erin in court. The freak put him in the hospital. ICU.\u201d</p><p>Erin flinched at that. She\u2019d gone to the hospital that morning, before work, hoping to hear better news about Lee. His son had been sitting in his room, holding his hand. She\u2019d stepped away, ducking into the empty room beside Lee\u2019s as she fought to control her tears.</p><p>Seeing that boy, praying for his father to wake up...</p><p>He has to be stopped.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she tried to push the memory of that kid aside. Lee would wake up. Oh, but she hoped he would anyway. \u201cI have very good reason to believe that this guy is also the one who attacked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin, there\u2019s no way to know that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got good reason to believe it, because he told me he did,\u201d she broke across his words and dropped her hand. I took care of your lover. Fool wasn\u2019t worthy. He\u2019d been so proud of nearly killing Ben. He\u2019d whispered his words to her that terrible night. \u201cHe\u2019s been making my life hell for too long now. I tried running from him, hiding, but he just found me, and he started killing again.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s mouth hung open. After a moment, he snapped his lips closed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d she said. Might seem crazy, but crazy was her world.</p><p>\u201cWh-why didn\u2019t you tell me? I thought you left because you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a paranormal.\u201d Simple. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have handled him. The other cops in Lillian are human, too. They wouldn\u2019t have known how to stop him. He would have sliced right through them and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The cop\u2019s head craned toward a watchful Jude. \u201cThis guy\u2014let me guess, he can handle him, right?\u201d</p><p>Jude shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Erin was definite. \u201cWhen he\u2019s in his tiger form, he\u2019s the closest physical match the bastard has.\u201d More than a match.</p><p>Jude would be able to take the bastard down, she knew it.</p><p>\u201cWerewolves?\u201d Ben asked again and rocked back on his feet. \u201cCome on, babe, I\u2019ve dealt with some screwed-up killers in my time, but I haven\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifters have been around for as long as humans have walked this earth.\u201d Jude crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cDeny it if you want. If it makes you sleep better, do whatever the hell you have to do. But, the fact here is...you\u2019ve got a paranormal killer out there. One who is obsessed with Erin, and you\u2014well, you\u2019re playing out of your league, human.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t room for Ben in this fight. \u201cIf you try to get involved in this, you\u2019ll just get hurt.\u201d The freak out there would like his pain too much. \u201cGo back to Lillian. We\u2019re going to stop him, and when we do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ben\u2019s voice snapped out, high and sharp. \u201cWhen you stop him, I book a werewolf for murder? How\u2019s that going to fly with the mayor and DA, huh? And what kind of cage am I going to toss him into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one won\u2019t stay in a cage.\u201d Jude\u2019s voice was soft, deep. A calm opposite to Ben.</p><p>Erin knew he was right. The killer they were looking for was too strong for a human prison. \u201cA cage won\u2019t ever hold him,\u201d</p><p>she said, her stomach knotting. She\u2019d known it would come to this.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ben reached out a hand, as if he were going to touch her, but stopped, the fingers freezing in midair.</p><p>Can\u2019t touch the shifter. Not normal. Her chin lifted. \u201cI\u2019m saying we\u2019ll let you know when this threat is gone.\u201d That was all she was going to say. She couldn\u2019t really tell a cop that murder was the only option. Not really murder, though. Self-defense.</p><p>\u201cNow, I\u2019m sorry, but I have work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got more questions, human, I\u2019ll answer them,\u201d Jude said.</p><p>Ben\u2019s gaze drifted over her face. \u201cThis is the last damn thing I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d</p><p>But there was nothing more to say. Like she\u2019d told Jude, they\u2019d ended in Lillian.</p><p>His hand fisted and he turned away from her. \u201cI want to know everything you\u2019ve got on this bastard.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s claws were gone. For now. \u201cThen I guess you\u2019d better get ready for a little visit to Night Watch.\u201d</p><p>Jude took the human to the agency. Introduced him to a few of the hunters. Left him with Dee for a while so that she could brief him, one human to another.</p><p>And the fury inside him built.</p><p>Erin had been hurt. The human asshole had hurt her. He\u2019d looked at her like she was...like she was some kind of freak.</p><p>Erin.</p><p>Jude growled.</p><p>That was the prick Erin had been dating? An ass who didn\u2019t recognize how great she was?</p><p>Idiot.</p><p>The cop\u2019s hands were shaking when he finished his briefing with Dee. Yeah, she usually had that effect on men.</p><p>\u201cHeard enough?\u201d Jude asked from his slouch against the wall.</p><p>A jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cGood, then it\u2019s time to get your ass back on the road and head home to old Lillian.\u201d He straightened, then remembered the way the guy hadn\u2019t even been able to touch Erin after he\u2019d learned the truth. \u201cBut first\u201d\u2014his fingers clenched around the prick\u2019s shirtfront, and he yanked him inside the nearest office.</p><p>\u201cJude! What the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeat it, Gomez.\u201d Gomez Montiago, charmer extraordinaire.</p><p>\u201cThis is my office, I\u2019m not just gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jude slanted him a hard look.</p><p>The charmer jumped up from his chair. \u201cI had to go talk with Pak anyway.\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind him.</p><p>Jude turned his focus back to the cop. \u201cI ought to kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>The human got some spunk then, because his jaw clenched and he gritted, \u201cYou can try, but I\u2019m not as weak as you may think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Yeah, he was. \u201cAre you as stupid as I think you are?\u201d</p><p>Ben blinked and a furrow appeared between his eyes. \u201cWhat? \u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not less because she\u2019s a shifter. She\u2019s not some kind of freak or abomination or monster. \u201d The tiger roared inside.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still the same woman you knew. Still smart, still sexy, still Erin.\u201d He shook his head now, the rage burning his tongue and leaving an acrid taste in his mouth. \u201cBut after you knew the truth, you couldn\u2019t even look at her the same way anymore.\u201d</p><p>Humans. They could piss him off so easily.</p><p>Dee and Tony were the only ones who\u2019d ever been different. Dee because well, she\u2019d been introduced to the paranormal world at a very early age.</p><p>And Tony...he\u2019d come across Jude mid-shift once. The guy hadn\u2019t run or screamed. He\u2019d just stayed and watched, gun drawn because he wasn\u2019t totally stupid. When the shift was done, that gun hadn\u2019t wavered. \u201cThat you, man? You still fucking understand me?\u201d</p><p>Jude had managed a nod.</p><p>The gun hadn\u2019t disappeared, not right away, but he\u2019d helped Jude ambush two killers who\u2019d been hiding in a slum.</p><p>When a guy had seen you at your worst and he didn\u2019t flinch, but instead stepped up to the plate and helped get the job done\u2014yeah, you could respect a guy like that.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what she was.\u201d</p><p>It would be so easy to rip his head off. \u201cWhat she is. She\u2019s a woman. Strong and beautiful. The same as she\u2019s always been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to deal with, all right? My head is spinning, I\u2019ve got a body to deal with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t have to treat Erin like she\u2019s something less. \u201d Would Erin get too pissed if he clawed the guy a bit? What she didn\u2019t know...</p><p>\u201cI-I care about her,\u201d the cop mumbled and his eyes fell.</p><p>What? Care, not cared. A snarl from the tiger that was echoed by the man as he said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t act like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I saw the way she looked at you!\u201d Ben\u2019s fists rose up between them and he shoved against Jude\u2019s chest.</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t move. \u201cRun that by me again.\u201d Maybe he wouldn\u2019t use his claws on the guy. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cI always knew Erin had secrets.\u201d Another shove with those fists. Hmmm...the guy was stronger than he looked.</p><p>Jude still didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI tried as hard as I could to get close to her, but she always kept me locked out.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t keep you out, does she?\u201d</p><p>A smile curved his lips. \u201cThe woman tried.\u201d A wolf. Who would have thought\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut you got close to her. I saw it, when she looked at you, I saw it.\u201d Another shove. Okay, more of a two-fisted punch this time.</p><p>Jude went with it and let his body slide back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sleeping with her.\u201d Bitten off. \u201cDon\u2019t bother lying, I could see that, too. When you looked at her, it was all over your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Erin thinks I\u2019m not territorial,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>The cop\u2019s eyes were slits. \u201cShe cared enough to protect me, but not to confide in me, not like she\u2019s done with you.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness there.</p><p>Jude realized if the situation were reversed\u2014damn lucky it wasn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019d be bitter, too.</p><p>A hell of a lot more than bitter.</p><p>A muscle flexed along Ben\u2019s jaw. \u201cShe left me behind. Do you think she\u2019ll do the same to you?\u201d</p><p>Not if he had anything to say about the matter. He was playing for keeps.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be able to handle things if she walks on you?\u201d</p><p>Jude stared at him.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll see,\u201d the cop said and Jude thought about punching him. Ben straightened his shirtfront. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the area just yet. I\u2019ll be around if Erin should need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of your league,\u201d Jude told him again, meaning the words as a warning. He\u2019d hate for the cop to get killed. Explaining his death to Erin would be a bitch.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, maybe it\u2019s time I got into a new league.\u201d He shouldered past him and headed for the door.</p><p>Jude watched him, brows low. Easy prey, but...</p><p>Ben glanced back. \u201cIf you let that bastard hurt her, I\u2019ll come after you, tiger.\u201d A pause. \u201cShe\u2019s not mine anymore, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off and shook his head, but Jude understood.</p><p>But she\u2019s still Erin.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re getting it,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>The human let out a growl of his own and jerked open the door.</p><p>Gomez stood in the doorway, his hand raised. \u201cAh...Jude.\u201d The hand dropped. \u201cC-call for you. Some guy named Mickey.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d known the guy was there, of course, but\u2014wait, Mickey? Hyena-asshole Mickey?</p><p>Ben moved around Gomez and marched away.</p><p>\u201cThe guy says he\u2019s got a tip, but only for you.\u201d</p><p>Now wasn\u2019t that some new shit. Mickey, offering him help on a case?</p><p>Jude went back to her, almost helplessly.</p><p>A jerk of his thumb had Zane heading out of the office, and Jude shut the door behind the demon.</p><p>Then turned the lock.</p><p>Erin glanced up at the soft click.</p><p>\u201cGot rid of the boyfriend,\u201d he told her and stalked slowly forward. He eyed the room. Too much paperwork on her desk and the thing didn\u2019t look sturdy enough. He could always stand but\u2014</p><p>Ah, that chair to the left, the one made of old leather would work fine.</p><p>\u201cBen\u2019s gone back to Lillian?\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t want to lie. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the game.\u201d He\u2019d better not be. The last thing he wanted to do was stumble on to the human while he was hunting.</p><p>And he\u2019d be hunting again, very, very soon.</p><p>But first...</p><p>Erin rose and hurried toward him. \u201cJude, what is it? Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand, brought her fingers to his lips, and pressed a kiss to her palm.</p><p>Her nostrils flared, and he saw the dilation of her pupils.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have much time,\u201d he managed, his cock digging hard into his zipper. \u201cI had to come and see you.\u201d Jude swallowed.</p><p>Hell, he sucked at this relationship shit.</p><p>A frown pulled her brows low. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her over to the chair, fell back, then pulled her down on top of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She straddled him when she came down, the skirt of her dress fluttering over his thighs.</p><p>Convenient.</p><p>A startled laugh burst from her lips. \u201cOkay, hard to misunderstand that.\u201d She rubbed against his straining erection, pursing her lips. \u201cBut, seriously, I\u2019ve got to be in court in half an hour. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to walk away from me.\u201d The words fell out, hard and flat. \u201cNot like you did with Ben, with no looking back.\u201d</p><p>Her hands rose to push against his chest. The laughter was gone now. \u201cWho says I never looked back?\u201d</p><p>His fingers dug into her hips. He hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cI thought you said that you and the human were finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are.\u201d Her chin titled up and her hair brushed over her shoulders. \u201cBut I can still have regrets.\u201d</p><p>Not what he wanted to hear. \u201cA human wouldn\u2019t be strong enough for you. He wouldn\u2019t be able to handle things when they got...wild.\u201d Not just talking about the shifter bastard out there.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t always have to be wild,\u201d she told him softly, and her right index finger smoothed down the front of his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m wolf, but I\u2019m human, too. Sometimes\u2014sometimes a woman likes to go slow.\u201d</p><p>Slow. Not really his thing.</p><p>\u201cCan you handle that, Jude?\u201d she asked him and he really, really didn\u2019t like the look in her eyes. \u201cCould you handle slow with me...and soft?\u201d She tossed a look toward the shut door. A wooden door, but too thin. He could catch whispers and phone calls and about a hundred other sounds too easily.</p><p>He stared at Erin, at the elegant lines of her face. \u201cI can handle anything you\u2019ve got, sweetheart.\u201d That was why he\u2019d come to her. To tell her that he wasn\u2019t the kind she could throw away when the danger was over.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t just dicking around with her. With Erin, he wanted everything.</p><p>You gonna be able to handle things if she walks on you?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just see.\u201d Erin\u2019s fingers fumbled with his belt. Eased open his zipper.</p><p>With a shifter, generally, the fewer clothes, the better, so he never bothered with underwear.</p><p>His cock sprang into her hands and he had to watch her. Had to watch the sight of those delicate hands pumping him, clenching and stroking.</p><p>Oh, but that felt good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ready.\u201d Her pink tongue swiped out.</p><p>Sweat trickled down his brow. Hadn\u2019t counted on this.</p><p>\u201cSo am I.\u201d With her left hand, she reached under the folds of her skirt. She twisted a bit, the movements clumsy but still sexy, then she had a scrap of lace dangling from her fingers.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>\u201cNo sounds, Jude. Not fast. Not hard. Not this time.\u201d Another swipe of that tongue.</p><p>His head jerked forward and he locked his mouth on hers.</p><p>She nipped his lower lip and his cock jerked. Oh, come on, that was just too\u2014</p><p>\u201cI said soft,\u201d she whispered before her lips took his. She was soft. Her lips brushed across his mouth. Feathered over him, then broke away.</p><p>Not enough.</p><p>Her hips rose. Jude glanced down, desperate for a sight of that pink flesh, but her skirt covered her and he couldn\u2019t see a damn thing.</p><p>But he could feel her as she slid down onto his throbbing erection. Warm, wet flesh. A straining entrance that took in the tip of his cock, squeezed.</p><p>He wrenched his hands away from her and locked them onto the arms of the chair. Can\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>Leather tore as his claws dug deep.</p><p>She lifted herself higher, bracing against him, then pushed down, taking all of him in one long, slow glide.</p><p>His breath shuddered out. \u201cIs...this...some kind of...fucking test?\u201d</p><p>She rose, sank down, rose again. \u201cMaybe...for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Too slow. He wanted her creamy flesh. Wanted her breasts in his hands, her tongue in his mouth.</p><p>Her inner muscles clamped around him, her sex squeezing so tightly that he lost his breath.</p><p>Then she smiled that sexy smile. \u201cSo far, so good.\u201d</p><p>Better than good.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see how long we can last,\u201d she murmured and lowered her face to his neck. She swiped her tongue over him, and Jude\u2019s head tipped back against the chair.</p><p>The tiger jerked against his chains, desperate for more, faster, harder.</p><p>Jude\u2019s hips arched against her when she tried to rise.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Her gasp said she liked it.</p><p>So did the sting of her claws.</p><p>Her cream coated the length of his arousal, and when she pushed up onto her knees and then drove down, he met her with a deep thrust.</p><p>So fucking good.</p><p>Another thrust. Deeper.</p><p>His cock slipped over her clit and Erin bit her lip, smothering a groan.</p><p>Slow and deep.</p><p>Her breath hitched, grew faster. Her lips found his. Their tongues met.</p><p>Just what he\u2019d been wanting.</p><p>He took her mouth even as she kept taking him. Slow and deep.</p><p>His spine prickled.</p><p>Her cream thickened and her body stiffened. He held onto his control with all his strength. Held on until he felt the tremors caressing the length of his cock. Those slow, clenching spasms told him Erin was coming for him.</p><p>And now he could come for her.</p><p>His hands flew to her hips. He drove up and held her as tight as he could.</p><p>Jude thrust hard. Once, twice. He bared his teeth even as a roar rose in his throat.</p><p>Erin kissed him, muffling the cry, and he climaxed, exploding in her hot depths and plunging as deep into her as he could go.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>Zane glanced at the closed door. His senses weren\u2019t as good as a shifter\u2019s, but they were a whole lot better than a human\u2019s.</p><p>And he\u2019d heard that sound. A low groan.</p><p>His nostrils twitched.</p><p>Aw, hell.</p><p>No mistaking that particular scent in the air.</p><p>He shook his head. Lucky bastard.</p><p>The cute little redhead with the seriously cold shoulders marched toward him, a file in her hands.</p><p>Not really toward him so much as toward Erin\u2019s office...</p><p>He stepped in front of her. \u201cNow isn\u2019t a good time.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw tightened. \u201cErin\u2019s due in court,\u201d she gritted. \u201cShe needs this\u2014\u201d</p><p>He plucked the file from her fingers. \u201cAnd she\u2019ll get it. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>After a hard glare, and another temperature drop, she spun away from him.</p><p>\u201cAh, man, you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Erin stared at Jude, her heart rate slowing.</p><p>\u201cDid I pass your test?\u201d</p><p>Aftershocks had her sex squeezing around him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>He could take it any way he wanted. She swallowed, trying to ease her dry throat. Okay, jumping him like that really hadn\u2019t been her plan.</p><p>But she\u2019d seen the heat in his eyes the minute he walked into her office.</p><p>She\u2019d known what he wanted. She would have been an idiot not to know once he started sizing her up...and then glancing over at the chair like he\u2019d been trying to figure out if they\u2019d fit.</p><p>After a second\u2019s thought, Erin had realized she didn\u2019t want to wait on seduction.</p><p>And that she\u2019d wanted to break some rules.</p><p>Sex in the office.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked her and she could only stare back at him blankly.</p><p>Slow and soft\u2014that\u2019s what she told him, but it wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d wanted. Not really. She\u2019d had slow and soft for too long. She\u2019d wanted loud and wild. She hadn\u2019t wanted to worry about the others outside or\u2014or about anything but Jude.</p><p>She\u2019d just wanted him.</p><p>The truth was that she would have taken him any way she could get him.</p><p>But, yeah, she\u2019d wondered if the sex would be different if she held her primal nature back. If it would be as good.</p><p>The answer was...um, oh yeah. She felt freaking great. Sex with Jude wasn\u2019t like being with other men. Never would be.</p><p>Soft and slow\u2014still wonderful. Wild and hard\u2014 amazing.</p><p>The guy was ruining her for everyone else. \u201cSoft and slow with you,\u201d she finally managed, \u201cis one hell of a lot better than the sex I had with other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at the banked fury in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about other men, and I sure don\u2019t want to hear about them when I\u2019m still in you.\u201d The edges of his teeth had sharpened and he was eyeing her neck with a little too much attention.</p><p>Erin scrambled back, rising off him in a rush and then managing to stand with shaky knees.</p><p>She clenched her thighs, aware of the sticky residue from their\u2014</p><p>Jude jerked his zipper back up. He straightened his clothes fast, then rose, coming right at her.</p><p>Her panties were in his left fist. How had they gotten there?</p><p>Hmm...she\u2019d really need those soon. She couldn\u2019t go to court without them. \u201cJude...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you any way I can get you, but I\u2019ll be damned if I share you with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand, the one without the panties, pressed against her chest. Right over her heart. \u201cTalking about in here, sweetheart.</p><p>When we\u2019re together, there\u2019s no room for anyone else.\u201d</p><p>This moment was important. The air was thick. His hand was warm against her, and her heart galloped away with that touch. \u201cNo one else is there.\u201d It was true.</p><p>She was in trouble.</p><p>He smiled at her and she thought about jumping him again. \u201cGood,\u201d he rumbled and pressed a hot, fast kiss to her lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd, yeah, for the record, there had damn well better not be anyone else taking that sweet body.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want anyone else the way she wanted him. Never had.</p><p>\u201cThis insanity with the stalker is going to be ending soon,\u201d he told her. Can\u2019t end soon enough. \u201cYou won\u2019t need a hunter anymore.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always need him. Not for protection or for his strength. She\u2019d just...need him.</p><p>Erin hadn\u2019t needed anyone since her father died. No, she hadn\u2019t let herself need anyone.</p><p>How had Jude gotten so close, so fast?</p><p>He saw past the surface. He saw things that others didn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He always looked at me as if he couldn\u2019t wait to get me naked. Always looked at me like I was a woman.</p><p>Not a monster. Not the way Ben had looked at her hours before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna disappear from your life when he\u2019s gone.\u201d His hand was a warm, heavy weight. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not gonna disappear from mine.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? The knot in her throat\u2014what was that? Erin swallowed, shoving it down. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d She was done running.</p><p>And, maybe, she was ready to take a risk on someone.</p><p>With someone.</p><p>Jude.</p><p>He can handle anything I throw at him.</p><p>Even soft and easy. The tiger had held perfectly still and let her ride him. What a ride it had been.</p><p>She shifted from one foot to the other and realized she\u2019d kicked off her pumps somewhere. Maybe near the chair.</p><p>His hand lifted. Her heart slowed.</p><p>Jude kneeled before her. He caught one foot in his hand and began to slide her panties back on.</p><p>Strength and gentleness. Hell of a combination. How was a woman supposed to resist?</p><p>He turned his attention to the other foot, and he eased the soft material over her toes and up her calf.</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her knee and lifted the silk even higher.</p><p>Erin gulped. She lifted her skirt up for him, aware of a quiver in her belly.</p><p>And in her sex.</p><p>More, please.</p><p>He pulled the panties up. The bikini design rode low on her hips. His mouth brushed her belly, then pressed against the crotch of her panties.</p><p>She tried to suck in enough air for her starving lungs. \u201cJ-Jude\u2014\u201d</p><p>One more kiss, then he pulled away. \u201cThis case is ending,\u201d he repeated and rose to his feet, \u201cbut we aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her skirt fell seamlessly back into place. The lust gnawed at her, burning and pumping through her.</p><p>She stared into his eyes, and there was only one answer to give. \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t.\u201d Because she wasn\u2019t an idiot. No way would she walk away from a man who could\u2014</p><p>A rap at the door. \u201cUh...the DA is looking for you, Erin.\u201d Zane\u2019s expressionless voice.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Jude licked his lips. \u201cLater, we\u2019ll do things our way again.\u201d</p><p>Wild. Sounded great. She held his stare a moment longer and gave a fierce nod. That freaking knot in her throat was back so the nod was pretty much all she could manage.</p><p>\u201cI have some leads to follow, but I\u2019ll pick you up tonight.\u201d</p><p>He eased away, headed for the door.</p><p>Erin scrambled for her shoes. The DA. Court. She toed into her pumps just as he yanked open the door. \u201cWait! Jude!\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at her, and her breath caught. The man was really something.</p><p>\u201cWh-what kind of leads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that I hope will take me right to the stalker.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d told her the case would be ending soon. He\u2019d meant those words, she realized. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>Zane was waiting for him. Jude bent toward the demon and she heard her shifter say, \u201cI\u2019m going to the den.\u201d</p><p>Zane seemed to stiffen a bit at that.</p><p>Then Jude strode away. He didn\u2019t look back, and Erin stared after him, feeling like she should say something, but having no idea what.</p><p>It\u2019s not over.</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>An hour later, Jude entered hell.</p><p>From the outside, hell appeared pretty unassuming. It looked just like an old building, one with a few beat-up cars lining the broken lot. A drunk or two sprawled on the sidewalk outside the square, squat structure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Appearances were so deceiving.</p><p>Dammit, I fucking hate demons\u2019 dens.</p><p>And he really did. Of all the shitholes in the world, the demons\u2019 dens were the worst. He hated them. Hated the stench.</p> <p>Hated the blood and booze. And Jude hated the drugged out demons who flocked to the dens looking for their next fix.</p><p>Demons. Talk about an addictive personality. He\u2019d never come across supernaturals who were as hooked on drugs as demons. Some demons, all they lived for was their next hit.</p><p>They always had to get more. Had to get lost. To forget.</p><p>There were rumors that the demons had to turn to the drugs. Especially if they were unlucky enough to have the whispered Dark Touch.</p><p>The Dark Touch. It was another name, a more fitting one, for the psychic powers that turned some demons into conduits for the dregs of human society\u2014killers, rapists, child molesters.</p> <p>Yeah, the rumors were that the drugs quieted or, in some cases, even severed that twisted link. But the problem was, once the demons started the drugs, it was a fast downward spiral.</p><p>Demons just got addicted too fast.</p><p>That addiction fear was one of the reasons Zane didn\u2019t so much as drink or smoke. Jude knew the demon had seen his father go down the drug path, with gruesome results.</p><p>Jude inhaled, caught the stench in the air, and knew he was in the right place.</p><p>Or maybe the wrong one.</p><p>The den waited for him. A hole in the middle of hell. Looked like a drug house, smelled like a drug house\u2014because it was a drug house.</p> <p>But the demons in there, they would talk. They\u2019d tell him all he needed to know about Rogue wolves. Because if anybody knew about predators, it was those bastards.</p><p>It had been another grade A bastard who\u2019d led him to this sour side of hell. Mickey had called him\u2014yeah, somehow the bastard was already out on bail\u2014and told him about the den. According to fast talking Mickey, Jude would find exactly what he needed in there.</p><p>The tip hadn\u2019t been free, of course. Nothing was free. He\u2019d just have to wait and see what price Mickey demanded. Not that he\u2019d actually pay the bastard.</p><p>Jude rapped hard on the old door. A demon with a giant rod shoved through his nose jerked it open. Jude flashed him a twenty.</p><p>The demon\u2019s gaze darted over him, then he smiled and eased back.</p><p>Erin\u2019s sweet scent clung to Jude\u2019s skin\u2014he\u2019d just had to claim her once more, couldn\u2019t resist that temptation, but the stench of the den wrapped around him as he crossed the threshold.</p><p>And he went deeper into the demons\u2019 den.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Mickey McQueen rocked back and forth on his heels. He\u2019d gotten out of jail\u2014 finally\u2014and was ready to blow this city.</p> <p>But first...</p><p>First he wanted his money.</p><p>He stood on the street corner, glancing to the left and to the right. He still couldn\u2019t believe his luck.</p><p>That tiger wouldn\u2019t know what hit him.</p><p>Mickey laughed.</p><p>But he choked back the sound when a long, black car pulled up to the curb.</p><p>This was it. His ticket to fast times.</p><p>He grabbed the door handle. Jumped inside.</p><p>\u201cYou told the hunter?\u201d</p><p>Damn but it was hot in there. Didn\u2019t the guy know to turn on the fucking air in Louisiana? Mickey gave a grim nod. \u201cYeah, yeah, told him everything you said.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Money had approached him at his arraignment. Mr. Money\u2014Mickey liked to call him that because the bastard was gonna be giving him a shitload of money. He figured the name fit. Mr. Money had paid his bail in cash and promised him a hell of a lot more.</p><p>All he had to do was just make one phone call.</p><p>Easiest job he\u2019d ever done.</p><p>A soft snick of sound\u2014the doors had locked. Must be one of those automatic deals.</p><p>Mickey rubbed his fingers together. \u201cYou got my money?\u201d He already had it spent. New clothes. Fast ride. Good-bye cops.</p><p>The car eased away from the curve. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>Fucking A. \u201cSo...\u201d He had to know. \u201cWhat\u2019s gonna happen to the tiger?\u201d He hoped the bastard got torn up. Clawed from head to foot.</p><p>The car turned into an alley. Mr. Money glanced over at him, smiling with too-sharp teeth.</p><p>What the hell? The guy couldn\u2019t be a shifter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to rip him apart.\u201d</p><p>Mickey blinked. \u201cGood. Good.\u201d He realized he was sweating. It was the teeth. His nostrils quivered. No, no shifter scent.</p><p>But the guy couldn\u2019t be a vamp because\u2014</p><p>\u201cJust like I\u2019m going to rip you open, Mickey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shit! Mickey scrambled, trying to jerk open the car door.</p><p>But it wouldn\u2019t budge. Stupid lock. If he tried hard enough, he\u2019d be able to force it\u2014</p><p>Claws came at him. He saw the attack coming from the corner of his eye and he twisted, trying to fight.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>The claws slashed right across his throat and the scream building in him never broke from his lips.</p><p>Blood splashed onto the front windshield.</p><p>The claws came at him again.</p><p>I\u2019m going to rip him apart.</p><p>When he was done, he shoved the body\u2014what was left of it\u2014out of the car. Blood was everywhere. The scent surrounded him. Soaked his clothes.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>He brought his fingers to his lips and licked away the sticky liquid. He loved that rich taste.</p><p>But the hyena had been too easy. No fight at all. Like killing a human. Really, he\u2019d expected more.</p><p>The tiger wouldn\u2019t be such easy prey. He knew that and had prepared appropriately for Donovan.</p><p>After all, he liked to hunt. He liked to kill.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t believe in taking foolish chances with his own life.</p><p>The tiger would die. No question.</p><p>He\u2019d be there for the end.</p><p>He yanked the car door closed and frowned at the windshield. That wouldn\u2019t do. The last thing he needed was for someone to see that wonderful blood.</p><p>Leaning over, he unlocked the glove box and pulled out the cloths he kept for just such an occasion.</p><p>Moments later, the glass was clean. He shoved the cloths back in the glove box and turned on the car. Then he took a deep breath, because he did love that sweet smell.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t linger any longer. Not with the body just outside. The area was deserted, for now, but someone would be coming along soon. They always did.</p><p>With a flick of his fingers, he punched the button for the radio and the soft strains of Brahms floated to his ears.</p><p>A smile curved his lips. Now it was time to go.</p><p>Time for the next kill.</p><p>As he backed out of the alley, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder, how long will the tiger fight?</p><p>And when he died, would Donovan have time to scream? Or would he die like the hyena, choking on his own blood?</p><p>\u201cDown there.\u201d The demon, eyes completely black, raised his hand and pointed down the twisting steps.</p><p>The first floor of the den had been completely deserted. No big surprise there. Jude knew the demons liked to be prepared, just in case there were any unexpected and unwanted\u2014 usually human\u2014visitors.</p><p>So the real action was never up front in a den. No, it was always in the back, or in this case, below.</p><p>The faint drum of pounding music teased his ears. Jude deliberately relaxed his shoulders, ready for whatever hell he\u2019d find waiting down there. He brushed by the demon, his nostrils flaring as he caught the stale odor of sweat and cigarettes.</p><p>Carefully, he eased down the creaking steps. What was this? A basement? Lower level?</p><p>The door behind him swung shut.</p><p>Jude stiffened.</p><p>Then he heard the sound of a bolt sliding into place. Locking me in.</p><p>No, locking them in\u2014because he could hear voices from below. Laughter.</p><p>He shook his head. Like a lock was going to hold him in this den. When he was ready to leave, he\u2019d just kick the door down. Easy.</p><p>His claws broke free, the brief pain making his heart surge. His canines burned as they lengthened, readying him for the fight to come. He\u2019d go in as a man, but if the shit got too bad, he would go out as a tiger.</p><p>His claws scraped over the stair railing as he climbed down the rest of the steps. No rush. The bastards weren\u2019t going to get by him.</p><p>The room below was bigger than he\u2019d thought. Not a room, more like three rooms. Thick with smoke, from the flickering flames of candles that were the only light and from hell knew what else. The scents in the air had his nose twitching and burning.</p><p>How the demons could handle that crap...</p><p>\u201cHello, shifter.\u201d The voice was loud, mocking.</p><p>The rock music kept pounding in the background.</p><p>Jude jumped off the last step.</p><p>His gaze swept the area. Demons were lounging against the walls. Some were curled up on the floor. Maybe fifteen of them total. He eyed the dark shadows. More bodies could be in there.</p><p>Maybe twenty.</p><p>Demons and their addictions.</p><p>But the guy who\u2019d called to him, he didn\u2019t have that blank, slack look on his face. No, that guy, the big bastard with his black demon eyes, was planted about fifteen feet away. His legs were braced a shoulder\u2019s length apart. His arms hung loosely at his sides, and the guy was smiling. A come-and-get-me grin.</p><p>Never a good sign.</p><p>The demon lifted his hand. The minions on the ground didn\u2019t move. Jude figured those guys weren\u2019t gonna be moving anytime soon. But the others, those against the walls and those hiding in the shadows, jerked forward, suddenly appearing way too alert and aware.</p><p>Jude rolled his neck, getting loose and ready, and the tiger snarled.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d the demon said, that cocky-ass smile still on his face. \u201cHaven\u2019t we, guys?\u201d</p><p>A murmur swept through the group. Laughter.</p><p>Mickey. Payback would be a bitch. He raised his claws and caught the glint of a knife in the darkness.</p><p>Ready for him and armed.</p><p>Demons in a den were supposed to be so screwed up on the drugs they couldn\u2019t tell reality from\u2014</p><p>\u201cAlways hated shifters,\u201d the bastard who had to be the leader muttered. \u201cFucking animals.\u201d</p><p>The demon was trying to piss him off now.</p><p>They started to close in, a sea of black eyes.</p><p>Stairs behind him. Demons to the front, left, and right. Running wasn\u2019t an option for him. Never had been.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re messing with the wrong guy,\u201d he warned, feeling the burn of the shift pulse through him. It would take a few moments to turn. Vulnerable moments. They\u2019d attack when the shift started. The demons would catch him with their knives and do as much damage as they could.</p><p>But once he was in tiger form...</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you\u2019re the right guy, Jude Donovan.\u201d A snap of the demon\u2019s teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re the guy we\u2019re gonna carve apart.\u201d</p><p>Jude fell to the floor as his bones began to snap and crack.</p><p>The demons attacked, knives ready, blades flying. Slashing, stabbing, cutting too deep.</p><p>He opened his mouth to scream and the tiger roared.</p><p>\u201cYour Honor, I object! This is pure hearsay, the witness has no way to confirm that\u2014\u201d Erin broke off, stumbling. The judge\u2019s face swam before her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMs. Jerome?\u201d Judge Sally Chen called out. \u201cMs. Jerome, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Erin made a grab for the edge of the jury box. She barely managed to catch herself before she fell face-first onto the gleaming floor. \u201cAh, yes.\u201d She blinked. The judge\u2019s face sharpened before her, and Erin could see the firm chin and the dark green gaze again. She tried to straighten herself up.</p><p>And nearly hit the floor.</p><p>\u201cDo you need a recess, ADA?\u201d</p><p>She could only manage a faint nod.</p><p>\u201cAll right, folks. Look, it\u2019s close to quitting time anyway. Let\u2019s resume this case tomorrow morning, eight a.m.\u201d The gavel slammed down.</p><p>Erin took a deep breath. Her hand rubbed over her forehead. Her stomach was churning, her knees shaking.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Zane\u2019s voice. The guy had followed her to court and plopped down in the front row.</p><p>Right then, she was so glad he was there. Erin shook her head. \u201cNo. No, something\u2019s wrong\u2014\u201d</p><p>The courtroom disappeared.</p><p>\u201cZane?\u201d This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>Black walls. Laughter. Snarls.</p><p>Erin jerked her head around, straining to see.</p><p>A tiger, with blood matting its white body. Men attacking the beast, slashing and stabbing with knives.</p><p>The tiger fell before her. Its head hit the floor. A puddle of blood spread around the fallen animal.</p><p>The fur dissolved. Tanned flesh appeared. A man with blond hair, bloody flesh. Not moving. Not breathing.</p><p>More laughter.</p><p>\u201cToo fucking easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he wanted the shifter bastard alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter\u2014we\u2019ll still get paid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe damn well better.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes were open\u2014blue and empty. Not like Jude\u2019s at all.</p><p>Not like Jude, not anymore.</p><p>\u201cErin!\u201d Her head snapped back. Zane shook her, hard. \u201cErin, what the hell? Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, and the courtroom was back. She was on the floor. Zane\u2019s fingers dug into her arms, and he crouched above her, lines bracketing his mouth. \u201cJude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s Zane.\u201d His head lifted and he called out, \u201cHey, I need some help over here!\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his shirt front and jerked him toward her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jude?\u201d Her teeth wanted to chatter, so she clenched them.</p><p>Death dreams. She hated them.</p><p>Jude.</p><p>How long had she been out? \u201cWhere is he?\u201d Close to a scream in a courtroom. Like she cared about the rules then.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d He glanced down at her white-knuckled grip. \u201cYour claws are cutting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in trouble.\u201d Absolute certainty. Too late. Always too late. Lee was still in the hospital. Still in a coma because she\u2019d been too late. And her father was in a grave because she\u2019d been too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn dreams. Why, why did she have them if she couldn\u2019t stop death?</p><p>Not Jude. Not him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The demon shook his head. \u201cLook, you\u2019re confused. You fell hard.\u201d A wince. \u201cI didn\u2019t catch you before you slammed your head on the floor. Give things a minute, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t be. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me where he is, Jude\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Finally, that got his attention.

Please, hold on. She couldn\u2019t lose him.</p> <p>Wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Always too late.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Zane jerked out his cell phone and punched in a number. His jaw flexed as he waited. Waited.</p><p>Erin rocked forward on her heels. He could be dying.</p><p>\u201cDee! Dee\u2014where\u2019s Jude? What? No, I don\u2019t have time\u2014 just tell me which damn den!\u201d His eyes widened and Erin caught \u201cJamestown? You sure? Fuck.\u201d He ended the call, his fingers whitening around the small phone.</p> <p>\u201cZane?\u201d There had been so much blood.</p><p>Won\u2019t. Lose. Him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a demons\u2019 den on Jamestown.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe can\u2019t go there. There\u2019s no way you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jamestown. Erin spun away from him and ran for the double doors.</p><p>\u201cWait! You won\u2019t find the den. You\u2019ll never be able to\u2014\u201d</p><p>She jerked open the courtroom door. Hesitated. Demons\u2019 den. Her neck craned as she glanced back at him. \u201cYou can find it.\u201d</p><p>His face paled.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t, he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDammit.\u201d His hands clenched. \u201cThen let\u2019s go to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA demons\u2019 den is like a crack house.\u201d Zane stared at the dark building before them. \u201cOnly much, much worse.\u201d</p><p>Erin didn\u2019t really care how much worse the place was. Yeah, the place looked like some kind of hole in the wall, but if Jude was inside, she was bringing him out. \u201cYou sure this is the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Dee said he was following a lead on your stalker.\u201d</p><p>Jude was going to die because of her. The thudding of her heartbeat filled her ears.</p><p>No. Not for me.</p><p>Erin jumped up the cracking steps.</p><p>\u201cWait. There\u2019ll be a guard, armed. Always is at a place like this. He\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin kicked in the door. The wood exploded under her foot, shattering instantly. She barreled forward, ignoring the scrapes along her arms and face.</p><p>\u201cHey, bitch, what the fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>A big, lanky guy with pitch black eyes ran at her, spittle flying.</p><p>Erin caught him with her claws, right in the chest, and shoved the bastard back about ten feet. He hit the wall, sent plaster flying, and sank to the floor.</p><p>He didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>A long whistle behind her. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re scary,\u201d Zane said. \u201cAnd someone is stalking you? \u201d</p><p>Her gaze snapped to the left, then the right. Old furniture. Freaking rats running around. Enough dust to clog her nose and numb her sense of smell but no Jude. \u201cWhere is he? You said this was the right place! Where is he? \u201d So she sounded hysterical.</p><p>If there was ever a time for a freak-out, it was now.</p><p>Zane\u2019s stare swept the room. Then the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Two deep grooves dug into the old wood. Erin stared at the markings. They\u2019d started next to the far wall and they ended at the big, scarred chest on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s behind it, something\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin bounded across the room. The chest had to be seven feet high and maybe four feet wide. She rubbed her damp palms on her thighs. Then she grabbed one side of the chest and shoved.</p><p>The chest flew out of the way.</p><p>\u201cDamn woman.\u201d</p><p>A door.</p><p>\u201cThey must have blocked it off. Doesn\u2019t figure, why would they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jude\u2019s down there!\u201d Erin wrenched the knob. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t want him getting out.\u201d Not until they were finished with him.</p><p>Erin broke the lock and thrust the door open. A yawning black space stared back at her. The faint thud of drums reached her ears\u2014or, hell, was that her heart? \u201cJude! \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Erin, you\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d Zane\u2019s hushed voice. \u201cIf somebody\u2019s got Jude down there\u2014\u201d</p><p>Screw careful. He needed her.</p><p>And she damn well needed him. More than she\u2019d realized.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know\u2014didn\u2019t understand\u2014until I saw him die.</p><p>Erin ran into the darkness.</p><p>He\u2019d better not be dead.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Dim, sputtering candles lit the basement and revealed the massacre. A trail of broken, bloody bodies littered the floor. The moaning men had claw marks all over their flesh.</p><p>But all of the bastards weren\u2019t moaning heaps on the floor. More of the assholes were up and they were still fighting. Five, no six of them were on the tiger. They\u2019d backed the beast up against the far wall and they were punching him, stabbing him\u2014</p><p>Killing him.</p><p>One blade drove into his side, into the already red fur, and the tiger jerked back, a keening cry on his lips.</p><p>Erin growled.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, the hell they aren\u2019t\u2014\u201d Zane\u2019s snarl behind her.</p><p>No, they weren\u2019t. She attacked, with Zane charging at the same instant.</p><p>Erin grabbed the closest asshole and spun him around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Black eyes, darker than night, colder than hell, stared down at her. Demon. They were all demons in this den. \u201cBitch, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>Her claws slashed over his chest. His mouth dropped open as the blood soaked his shirt. He fell to his knees, screaming.</p><p>\u201cI want you to get out of my way,\u201d she gritted and shoved him to the side.</p><p>Next. She lifted her claws up, ready to fight.</p><p>But Zane grabbed the next demon and broke the jerk\u2019s wrist when the asshole lifted his knife. Smiling, Zane punched him in the face. Blood squirted, there was a sickening squish, and then that demon went down, too.</p><p>A scream of pain ripped through the room. Erin\u2019s gaze jerked up. The tiger had caught one demon beneath him. Claws and teeth took him out in seconds.</p><p>Another demon launched toward her. Bald head. Soulless eyes and skin too pale. And like the others, this guy was armed.</p><p>He grinned at her, then whispered, \u201cCome play...\u201d</p><p>Like she had to be asked twice. Taking a breath, tasting blood, Erin raced forward.</p><p>But this one was fast. In a breath\u2019s time, he\u2019d attacked and the blade of his knife sliced down her arm. Dammit! Fiery pain burned her flesh.</p><p>The music pounded around her. Where was it coming from?</p><p>\u201cI love to watch a woman bleed.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. The guy\u2019s breath was a stale wind in her face. He towered over her, grinning and flashing yellowed teeth. Giant, oozing sores covered his face and arms. He looked like some kind of Meth head. Maybe he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll slice you open, carve you up!\u201d He lunged, but, this time, she was ready. When he came at her, her claws caught him, tearing flesh and muscle, cutting to the bone. His bloodshot eyes flared wide and a choked gasp broke from his lips.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll slice you,\u201d she whispered and tried really, really hard not to think about what she was doing. Not killing, no, she wasn\u2019t killing the demons. They were still alive, just out of commission.</p><p>Fight.</p><p>Save Jude.</p><p>Fight.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t killing them, but if it came to that in order to save Jude, she would.</p><p>Her claws jerked free. The demon groaned, then fell.</p><p>Another demon landed on top of him. This one was a broken, bleeding mess\u2014courtesy of a knife-wielding Zane.</p><p>So many broken bodies surrounded them. And the tiger stood poised for a final attack. His powerful body bunched as his mouth opened over his prey.</p><p>\u201cNo, no!\u201d Erin lunged for the tiger. \u201cZane, don\u2019t let him!\u201d</p><p>Zane was already there. He grabbed the shuddering demon from the mouth of the tiger and hauled the bastard back by the scruff of his neck.</p><p>The attacking demons were done. The jerk that Zane held was the only one still conscious in the room.</p><p>Her breath caught as she looked at the tiger. So many wounds. Too many. He wouldn\u2019t be able to hold that form much longer. No way could he\u2014</p><p>The transformation began. Fur melted before her eyes. Bones snapped. Scrambling, slipping in the blood that pooled on the floor, she went to him and held him tight. She could feel the slow thud of his heartbeat against her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Not a lie. It would be okay. They\u2019d gotten there in time. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered against her and as she stroked him, her fingers skimming over his wounds. The deep cuts and slashes marked his sides, his back, his chest.</p><p>Erin swallowed. No, he\u2019d make it. Jude would live.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get him to a hospital.\u201d Her voice was cold, she was cold.</p><p>So was he. His skin had turned to ice.</p><p>Jude\u2019s blood poured on her, soaking her clothing.</p><p>In human form now, he seemed even weaker. She grabbed his face with her hands and forced him to look at her. \u201cJude?</p><p>Jude, dammit\u2014stay with me!\u201d His blue eyes were dull. Faded, not bright like they should have been.</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019re stronger than this! Fight!\u201d A scream of fury and fear. Blood burned her nostrils. Drums pounded. Turn off the damn music. \u201cStay with me.\u201d A whisper now.</p><p>Erin kissed him and tasted blood and man.</p><p>Stay with me.</p><p>His mouth didn\u2019t move against hers. Too slack. Too cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell happened down here?\u201d A sharp, furious demand.</p><p>Erin lifted her lips from Jude\u2019s but didn\u2019t glance back. Dee. Zane had called her again on the way to the den, told her to come. Armed.</p><p>\u201cIt was a setup,\u201d Zane said, voice thundering. \u201cWhen we got here, they were trying to slice him apart.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d almost succeeded.</p><p>\u201cJude.\u201d Still a whisper, but she thought she saw his eyelids flicker at the sound. \u201cI know...I know you\u2019re weak.\u201d Her cheeks were damp. Blood or tears? Both? \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to try and fight, okay? You can\u2019t stay human.\u201d</p><p>If he did, he\u2019d bleed out before help arrived. She knew it. Wouldn\u2019t lie to herself.</p><p>Her lips wanted to tremble so she pressed them together. His eyes were open, on her. Did he hear her? Did he understand?</p><p>Her fingers smoothed over his face. \u201cTry to change back.\u201d It was the only thing that would save him. The power of the shift. The beast could heal, the man couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Jude wouldn\u2019t be able to hold the tiger form long, she knew that. Probably only for a few seconds, but if he could just shift...</p><p>Some of the wounds would close. The healing powers would amp up and he\u2019d survive.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>No, no, he would survive.</p><p>The only reason he was still breathing now was because he\u2019d shifted from beast to man. Every shift worked to mend his flesh. So if he could just transform one more time...</p><p>There might be a chance for him.</p><p>\u201cShift, Jude.\u201d Her arms wrapped around him, held tight. \u201cShift!\u201d</p><p>His heart rate kicked up but his head fell forward.</p><p>She held him tighter.</p><p>A growl built in his throat.</p><p>\u201cGet an ambulance!\u201d Zane ordered.</p><p>The thunder of footsteps on the stairs as Dee ran for help.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t shift...</p><p>Soft, thick fur brushed against her skin.</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut. Yeah, tears.</p><p>The crack of bones tormented her ears. Her hold never lessened. \u201cFight.\u201d</p><p>Faster, faster\u2014his heartbeat thudded in a double-time beat.</p><p>Her eyes opened. She saw white fur and the long, lean body of the tiger.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch!\u201d Zane\u2019s cry. \u201cI knew the bastard wouldn\u2019t go down easy.\u201d</p><p>No, not easy. Not her Jude.</p><p>He bucked against her, his body trembling. The shape of the tiger began to fade.</p><p>Be enough. Enough to let him live.</p><p>Moments passed. The tiger disappeared, leaving the broken man in his place.</p><p>\u201cJude?\u201d</p><p>He slowly raised his head and stared at her with confusion clouding his eyes. \u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>Her smile felt like it was going to break her face. Too big. Too wide. Too\u2014ah, hell. Erin kissed him.</p><p>And he kissed her back. Moved his lips, his tongue.</p><p>He was back.</p><p>She pulled away, just a few inches. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again, tiger.\u201d Not too late. For once, finally, not too late.</p><p>His mouth hitched into a half-smile. \u201cTrust me, not...part of my...plans.\u201d</p><p>Her hands roved over his back. She could still feel the wounds, but they weren\u2019t as deep. The blood flow had eased. The shift had done its job.</p><p>Jude wouldn\u2019t die on her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one tough asshole, shifter.\u201d Zane whistled. \u201cFor a minute, I thought you were a corpse.\u201d</p><p>Jude winced. He was naked, his flesh rippling as he moved. \u201cFor a...minute there, I did...too.\u201d</p><p>So had she.</p><p>Dee\u2019s shoes pounded down the stairs. \u201cHelp\u2019s coming, just tell him to hold on\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin glanced back at her in time to see the human stumble to a stop. Dee blinked twice, then smiled. \u201cShifter.\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been, he would be dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Swallowing, Erin tried to ease back.</p><p>\u201cErin\u2014wait, you\u2019re hurt! \u201d</p><p>Yeah, but he didn\u2019t need to worry about her.

The demon he\u2019d hauled away lay bound near his feet. Good thing Zane carried his own cuffs\u2014 Other proof cuffs she\u2019d glimpsed in the car. They were made out of some kind of special titanium. \u201cYou\u2019re losing a lot of blood.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lost more blood than she would have liked, but her wound had already started to heal.</p><p>Jude caught her arm. Lifted it, turned it for better inspection. \u201cYou don\u2019t...have to shift.\u201d He sounded stronger. Good.</p><p>She shook her head. No, for her, the healing didn\u2019t depend on the shift. A lucky thing, because otherwise, she\u2019d be very easy prey.</p><p>His gaze rose to hers. \u201cI saw...what you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let them kill you.\u201d Her voice was rough and scratchy. She didn\u2019t want to think about what she\u2019d done to those men. No, demons, not men. Not human.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not...weak.\u201d His eyes widened and he sucked in a sharp breath. \u201cYou\u2019re the...next step, aren\u2019t you? Evolution of the whole damn...species. Why shift when you\u2019ve got all the power...in human form...\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. Next step? The guy must still be weak. She wasn\u2019t anything special. Far from it.</p><p>\u201cDonovan!\u201d The door at the top of the stairs banged open. Voices shouted in the background, but Antonio\u2019s voice was clear as he demanded. \u201cDonovan, dammit, you down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp\u2019s arrived,\u201d Dee murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe cops? Hell.\u201d Zane shook his head. \u201cYou called them, Dee? Them? \u201d</p> <p>\u201cI called 911,\u201d she told him as Antonio flew down the stairs. It sounded like a dozen men were behind him. \u201cTold them we had an officer down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not an officer,\u201d Zane said, rubbing a hand over his face and then staring at the demons littering the floor. \u201cI fucking hate dens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, Jude\u2019s also not human, but I didn\u2019t tell them that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonovan!\u201d Antonio leapt over the last few steps. \u201cWhat the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>Jude pushed up, staggering a bit as he rose to his feet. Erin wrapped her arms around him as she tried to steady him as much as possible.</p><p>\u201cAmbush,\u201d Zane explained succinctly. \u201cWho would\u2019ve thought these drugged out assholes could even manage something like this?\u201d Disgust was rich in his voice. No, not just disgust, almost...hatred.</p><p>\u201cThat...one.\u201d Jude lifted his hand and pointed to the bound demon. \u201cHe\u2019s not using.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Christ, man, you\u2019re naked!\u201d Antonio spun around. \u201cYou trying to make me go blind or something?\u201d</p> <p>There was a line of cops behind him. Men and women. A few EMTs were sprinkled in the bunch. Erin moved quickly, putting herself between Jude and the crowd. Not that Jude probably gave a rat\u2019s butt about his modesty, but she did.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to his clothes?\u201d one of the officers called out.</p><p>Antonio\u2019s hands went to his hips. \u201cThis is a crack house\u2014who knows what the drug heads were doing? Maybe they cut</p><p>\u2019em off, thinking he was holding out on them.\u201d</p><p>The man was fast on his feet, and his explanation sounded like a good cover story to her. Especially since Jude\u2019s clothes were lying in a mangled pile to the right. \u201cDee,\u201d she called softly, trying to catch the other woman\u2019s attention. Dee worked with Jude. Did that mean she knew about his policy of keeping backup clothing in his vehicle?</p><p>\u201cOn it,\u201d the woman said immediately and headed back for the stairs. \u201cUh, Tony, not to tell you how to handle your shit, but with all this Other stuff going on down here, don\u2019t you think you\u2019d better clear the scene?\u201d</p><p>He gave a grim nod then ordered, \u201cBishop and Peters\u2014get over there and see what kind of damage the assholes did to Donovan. The rest of you\u2014 upstairs. Make sure the scene is secured. None of these pricks will be leaving the area until I\u2019m done with them.\u201d</p><p>Dee brushed by him.</p><p>Antonio snagged her arm. \u201cNext time, could you let me know what I\u2019m walking into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t time for that.\u201d One shoulder lifted, fell. \u201cI thought he was dying.\u201d She glanced back at Jude. \u201cHe was dying, and I needed the cavalry to get its ass here as fast as possible.\u201d Then she jumped up the steps, hurrying her way to the top, right behind the line of retreating cops.</p><p>The EMTs moved toward Jude.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be okay. I don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStitch him up and then get the hell out of here,\u201d Antonio ordered.</p><p>The guy in the front, the one with the name tag reading John Bishop, gulped. \u201cWe\u2014we\u2019re gonna need to take him to a hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hospital,\u201d Jude\u2019s growl.</p><p>\u201cYou heard the man,\u201d Antonio said.</p><p>\u201cHe could have internal bleeding. Severe blood loss. He could have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet some thread and get a needle.\u201d Antonio glowered at him. \u201cStitch up any wound bigger than your hand, and don\u2019t worry about anything else.\u201d</p><p>Good advice. The cop obviously knew his Other business. Jude\u2019s internal wounds would already be healing and his body would be compensating for any blood loss. White tigers were amazing healers. If the stories were true, they were almost the fastest of the shifters when it came to wound repair.</p><p>The wounds on the surface would take the longest time to heal. Shifters recovered from the inside, out. Mother Nature\u2019s way of taking care of her priorities. Priorities like the heart and lungs and all the internal organs.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a fighter, Erin.\u201d His voice was a soft rumble.</p><p>The EMTs went to work on him.</p><p>She forced a smile and stepped back, knowing she was in the way. \u201cSo are you.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t fought so hard, for so long, they never would have made it to him in time.</p><p>His gaze bored into hers. Not dull anymore. So very blue.</p><p>Jude. He was back. She could almost see the strength pouring into him.</p><p>\u201cYou had one of the...dreams, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Erin forced a nod. She\u2019d never forget that vision. Until the day she died, Erin would always remember what it was like to see Jude murdered before her.</p><p>She took another step back.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t too...late this time.\u201d</p><p>No, not this time.</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t even wince when Bishop drove a two-inch needle into his shoulder. Probably not necessary, not like he could get an infection, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cThanks for...saving my ass, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled into a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d And she slipped in the blood and fell on her ass.</p><p>Come nightfall, the demons would be making his delivery.</p><p>A bound and beaten tiger shifter\u2014all ready for the kill.</p><p>He smiled as he stared into the swamp. Thick trees, lazy moss, muddy water.</p><p>When he was finished, he\u2019d toss the body out here and let the alligators take care of Donovan. What was left of him.</p><p>The body would never be found. No evidence, no crime.</p><p>It\u2019d be for the best that way. The shifter had too many friends. Too many hunters on his side.</p><p>Yes, it would be far better for the world if the bastard just vanished, and he would make certain that was exactly what the shifter did.</p><p>Erin would be all alone then. She\u2019d think her lover had abandoned her.</p><p>All lost and alone\u2014what would she do? Turn to me. He\u2019d take her, of course, but not until she\u2019d paid for bringing the tiger into their lives.</p><p>A little pain would be good for their relationship.</p><p>An alligator cruised past him, never slowing, never glancing his way.</p><p>\u201cDinner\u2019s coming,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>The woman was amazing\u2014and she\u2019d seriously saved his ass.</p><p>The EMTs were done. Done jerking on him. Done driving their needles into his flesh.</p><p>They\u2019d stitched him up. A good thing because he needed the stitches. Until the healing was finished, the stitches would keep the wounds from worsening. When the skin mended, the stitches would fall away, and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about leaving a trail of blood behind him when he hunted.</p><p>Because, hell, yeah, he was going hunting.</p><p>Dee tossed him a pair of jeans. His backup clothes. Jude jerked them on, managing not to wince at the pull from his injuries. Nudity didn\u2019t bother him a bit, but there were humans around, and they expected certain things.</p><p>Like clothing.</p><p>\u201cGood job,\u201d Tony told the EMTs.</p><p>\u201cHe needs to be in a hospital.\u201d From Bishop, the chatty one. The other guy hadn\u2019t said a word the whole time he worked.</p><p>When he\u2019d first strode from the stairs, Jude had seen the way the fellow eyed the demons on the floor. Too much knowledge had been in his stare.</p><p>The guy knew they were in a den, the demon equivalent of a crack house, and he wanted out.</p><p>Was he a demon? Could be. Then again, he could be just about anything.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure he sees a doctor,\u201d Zane said. \u201cNight Watch has a physician on staff.\u201d</p><p>Since when? The guy was a world class bullshitter.</p><p>The EMTs filed up the stairs. Most of the demons had already been hauled up to the upper level. Other paramedics had come to patch those lucky bastards. Tony had wanted them stitched, then shuttled to the jail, ASAP. The sooner the demons were off the street, the better for the rest of the city.</p><p>The door slammed behind the EMTs with a loud, hollow clang.</p><p>Jude rose, feeling every ache and pain in his body. He met Zane\u2019s stare, then Tony\u2019s. Yeah, most of the demons were gone\u2014all but one, in fact.</p><p>The ringleader. Zane had gagged the asshole when the EMTs first went to work. A good precaution, that.</p><p>Time for some payback. Jude stalked toward him, with Zane and Tony right at his heels.</p><p>The demon\u2019s eyes widened and a high cry broke against the gag.</p><p>A smile curved Jude\u2019s lips. \u201cHey there, asshole. What? Did you think I\u2019d forgotten you?\u201d No way. This one, the guy who didn\u2019t reek of drugs and decay, was the ringleader. The one who\u2019d set up his ambush.</p><p>The one who\u2019d wanted him dead on the stinking floor.</p><p>Jude lifted his claws and put them right over the demon\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m having a really bad night, as you can see...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJude.\u201d Erin\u2019s tense voice.</p><p>He stilled. This wasn\u2019t going to be pretty, but then, she\u2019d already proved she could handle the hell that came in his life. He wouldn\u2019t tell her to leave because he knew the attack was tied to her. Had to be. He\u2019d been hunting her stalker, only to become prey.</p><p>Prey.</p><p>Oh, yeah, the demon would pay.</p><p>He glanced back at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to see this.\u201d He\u2019d told her about the darkness inside of him, but this could take it to a whole new level for her. Fighting to protect was one thing. Savaging a demon for information was another.</p><p>And it just might be something she couldn\u2019t accept.</p><p>Erin\u2019s gaze held his. \u201cYes, I-I think I do.\u201d She wet her lips. Her kiss. It had been like the woman\u2019s kiss had brought him back. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you.\u201d</p><p>He sure wasn\u2019t leaving her. Jude managed a nod. Don\u2019t fear me.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>No choice. He turned back to his prey and jerked the gag loose with his left hand. \u201cTell me the name of the asshole who hired you to kill me, or I\u2019ll cut your heart out and fucking stuff it down your throat.\u201d</p><p>Erin sucked in a sharp breath. I warned her.</p><p>And he was really holding back with the asshole. If he\u2019d had his way, Jude would have already been attacking because in his mind, he could still see the demon swarm going after her.</p><p>\u201cI-I wasn\u2019t s-supposed to k-kill you!\u201d</p><p>His claws dug in. \u201cErin, you sure you want to see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see this,\u201d Tony muttered. Jude glanced his way, but never lessened his hold on the prey. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t see this! I\u2019m a cop, I can\u2019t let you assault a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zane punched Tony in the face. The cop went down, out cold. Zane shrugged. \u201cNow he doesn\u2019t have to get all cop-worried on us. Clear conscience. Nice sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Jude said because it was, unfortunately, a routine they\u2019d done before with Tony. The guy would wake up soon, pissed, but in the clear.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Dee dropped beside Tony. \u201cI think he hit his head when he fell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think his head just hit my fist.\u201d</p><p>She shoved Jude\u2019s mangled clothes beneath the cop\u2019s head. \u201cNo, that was his face. \u201d Her fingers skated through his hair.</p><p>\u201cNo bumps. No blood.\u201d She rose, brushing off her hands. \u201cNext time, watch where he falls.\u201d</p><p>Because, unfortunately, there would be a next time. For them, there always was.</p><p>But now...Jude looked at the demon jerkoff. Now the focus was on the guy who was breathing hard and sweating and clogging Jude\u2019s nostrils with his stench. \u201cReady to die?\u201d he asked the bastard.</p><p>\u201cNo! \u201d The demon tried to jerk back, but his cuffs were locked tight to the chair. \u201cH-he just wanted you hurt, w-weak\u2014not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have killed him.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice. Cold and absolutely certain. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have just hurt him.\u201d</p><p>The hair on Jude\u2019s nape rose. Knowing that Erin had experienced one of those weird-ass death dreams about him made his stomach knot. That close, huh? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Killed in a demon\u2019s den, body torn apart and left on the stained floor.</p><p>Not exactly the way he wanted to leave this world.

Jude\u2019s lips peeled away from his teeth. One good bite and he\u2019d be able to\u2014</p><p>\u201cNever saw...the guy\u2019s face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how the hell did he contact you? How\u2019d he arrange the attack?\u201d Zane demanded. Zane. Being in the den had to be torture for the guy. All those memories. Dee didn\u2019t know about the demon\u2019s past, but Jude did. Zane had told him one night when the tequila had been drained in an empty Delaney\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHe called me.\u201d The demon\u2019s fat tongue swiped over his bloody lip. \u201cT-told me you\u2019d be coming.\u201d</p><p>So the stalker had maneuvered everything. He\u2019d moved them around like freaking pawns.</p> <p>Mickey. Some tip. He couldn\u2019t wait to get his claws in that hyena.</p><p>\u201cI-I was s-supposed to deliver you...to him...tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jude\u2019s hold eased, just a bit. \u201cWere you now?\u201d This was it. The chance he needed. \u201cAnd he was going to pay you on delivery, right?\u201d</p><p>A slow nod.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d What was the going rate for a shifter\u2019s life these days?</p><p>\u201cT-ten grand.\u201d</p> <p>Now he was just insulted. Ten grand?</p><p>\u201cDamn, Jude, vamps are worth more than that,\u201d Dee said, and she would know. Vamps were her specialty, after all.</p><p>\u201cThese demons are addicts,\u201d Zane grated. \u201cThey\u2019d kill their own mothers for ten grand. Hell, they probably have.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t look away from his prey. \u201cThis one\u2019s not on drugs.\u201d</p><p>The demon spit out a tooth. \u201cJust...wanted the money. Knew the others...would do anything...for some cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame as you.\u201d Not an addict, but a killer straight to the bone. \u201cAnd you will do anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Dee let out a loud sigh. \u201cI think I know where the tiger\u2019s going with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not that crazy.\u201d A pause from Zane. \u201cUnless maybe the demons hit him too hard in the head. Could be he\u2019s not thinking straight, could be\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Tony let out a long, loud groan. Then, \u201cFuckin\u2019 bastard. Knew what you were gonna do. Couldn\u2019t you have pulled it some?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Zane\u2019s immediate reply.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you talking about?\u201d the demon demanded.</p><p>Jude smiled at him and fully retracted his claws. After all, he didn\u2019t want to damage the demon. Especially now that he knew he needed the jerk. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna earn your money tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what\u2019d I miss?\u201d Tony asked, the words a bit thick.</p><p>\u201cJude.\u201d Erin\u2019s voice was sharp.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t like the plan, but there was no option. The game was ending. He\u2019d end it. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna deliver me to the asshole who contacted you\u2014and you\u2019re gonna collect your money.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s fingers dug into Jude\u2019s shoulder and she spun him around. Her eyes were blazing as she snapped, \u201cThe hell he is.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cThis is a really stupid idea.\u201d Erin\u2019s stare could have burned a lesser man. As it was, Jude felt distinctly singed. \u201cYou\u2019re already weak. You can\u2019t seriously be considering going after this guy now.\u201d</p><p>Weak. Not a word he particularly enjoyed even though he still felt like he\u2019d been hit by a truck. Or a dozen demons. \u201cI\u2019m getting stronger every minute.\u201d True. He\u2019d always known he was lucky to be a white tiger. If he\u2019d been a fox\u2014hell, it would have taken days for him to recover. Simple shifter fact: The stronger and rarer you were, the quicker you healed. Kinda like survival of the fittest multiplied, and it was sweet old Mother Nature\u2019s way of making sure her once-in-a-blue-moon shifters didn\u2019t vanish from the earth completely.</p><p>When you were hard to kill, you got to live longer.</p><p>\u201cYou. Can\u2019t. Do. This.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never heard that particular guttural tone from her before. The lady was walking a fine edge of rage. So was he. \u201cThis is it, sweetheart. The chance to bag the bastard and take him out.\u201d The others were silent around them. Watching. Waiting. Even the demon prey had the sense to keep his mouth shut. \u201cWe finish this tonight, and there\u2019s no more running for you. No more fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he kills you?\u201d Her hands were small fists. Blood dripped onto the floor near her feet, and he knew that her claws were out, cutting her.</p><p>A rumble built in his throat and he crossed to her. Took her hands. Unfurled the fists. Her claws had dug deep. \u201cErin...\u201d</p><p>She jerked away from him. \u201cYou almost died here.\u201d Her right hand lifted, waving toward the peeling walls and sputtering candles. Luckily, someone\u2014he thought maybe Dee\u2014had broken the radio and ended the blasting stream of drums and rock.</p><p>\u201cAlmost doesn\u2019t really count,\u201d he murmured, and knew when her eyes immediately slit that he\u2019d said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cI saw you on the floor.\u201d Death dream. \u201cBlood around you. Your eyes wide open. Dead.\u201d She shook her head, sending her hair flying around her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh? What did she see?\u201d Tony asked. He was up and gingerly rubbing his jaw.</p><p>Zane shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll explain later, but, man, I really don\u2019t think you want to know.\u201d</p><p>Their voices drifted around Jude. Erin. He wanted, needed to hold her. But the others\u2014</p><p>Ah, screw them.</p><p>He caught Erin and yanked her against his chest. He held fast when she fought him and when her head tipped back, he kissed her.</p><p>She bit him...then kissed him back. \u201cBastard,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>A tremble shook her.</p><p>Or maybe it shook him. Hard to say. Her mouth widened and his tongue swept inside. This\u2014 this was what he needed.</p><p>Her taste. Her flesh. His for the taking. His.</p><p>Always his.</p><p>\u201cUh, dude, seriously, if you two have sex, I\u2019m outta here, fast,\u201d Dee said, her voice gruff.</p><p>His head lifted. Sex with Erin. Always something he was up for but\u2014</p><p>But darkness would be falling soon and a killer waited.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Erin asked as her hands rose to lock around his arms.</p><p>A nod. For her. He\u2019d stop the bastard, one way or another.</p><p>She absorbed that, then said, \u201cThen I\u2019m coming, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you are!\u201d No, no way, she\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy life, Jude.\u201d Her hold tightened on him. \u201cHe\u2019s been screwing with my life all this time. I\u2019m not sitting on the sidelines anymore, and I\u2019m sure not letting you go in alone with this freak waiting to tear you apart.\u201d</p><p>Her scent filled his nostrils, sending his cock surging to full, hard attention and making his heart race with a twisted mix of lust and need and fear. Lust and need\u2014because he always wanted her, even when he\u2019d just left death\u2019s cold door. Fear\u2014the fear came because he didn\u2019t want to risk her. She could take down demons, but if the stalker shifted, she\u2019d die. \u201cYou can\u2019t go with me.\u201d Giving her a straight order wouldn\u2019t work, but logic might sway her lawyer\u2019s mind. \u201cErin, he\u2019d catch your scent long before we closed in and the bastard would run.\u201d Then they\u2019d be back to square fucking one.</p><p>No. The game would end tonight.</p><p>\u201cUh...this really isn\u2019t police protocol,\u201d Tony pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThe police aren\u2019t gonna be handling this.\u201d Jude released Erin and stepped back. He thought maybe the move would help to ease the hunger he felt. No such luck. \u201cNight Watch has priority. The shifter asshole is expecting me and the demon, and that\u2019s what he\u2019ll get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...not quite.\u201d Zane cleared his throat. Jude glanced at him and saw the hunter\u2019s green eyes fade to pure black. \u201cHe\u2019s expecting you and he\u2019s going to get two demons. The asshole over there\u2014and me.\u201d His smile held a cruel edge. \u201cYou freaking shifters think you can scent everything a mile away. Well, when he smells me, all he\u2019ll get is demon.\u201d</p><p>An answering grin stretched Jude\u2019s lips. Zane had always been there for him, ready to kick ass and walk right into the dark. He slanted a glance at Erin. \u201cBetween the two of us, the wolf will go down.\u201d The other shifter wouldn\u2019t be expecting the threat\u2014from Zane or from him and that would be his downfall.</p><p>Erin was one hell of a fighter. She\u2019d more than proved that tonight. But now, it was his turn. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d he told her, his blood already heating. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to finish this hunt.\u201d</p><p>The struggle was on her face. Fury and fear warring together. Yeah, he knew that mix well.</p><p>Jude turned to the demon who\u2019d set him up to die. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned.</p><p>\u201cAh, does he want me to beat it out of him?\u201d Dee asked. \u201cIf I can\u2019t go hunting with you, at least let me have some fun now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKyler.\u201d</p><p>Jude grunted. \u201cOkay, Kyler, this is how it\u2019s gonna work. You\u2019ll do exactly what I say or you\u2019ll find out what it\u2019s like to have a tiger rip you open.\u201d</p><p>The black eyes didn\u2019t blink.</p><p>\u201cGot me?\u201d Jude pushed.</p><p>A slow incline of his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be watching you, demon. Every move.\u201d If it looked like the demon was going to sell him out, the bastard would feel a shifter\u2019s rage.</p><p>Erin was silent and stiff beside him. The fury and fear raged on her face and the combination seemed to come off her in waves, thickening the air.</p><p>\u201cYou hired me to do this job,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cSo let me do it.</p><p>Her golden eyes went glacial. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a job. It\u2019s your life!\u201d</p><p>And her life. \u201cThis is what I do,\u201d he said again. What he had to do, for her. Protecting what you valued most was the way of his breed.</p><p>Nothing was more valuable to him than Erin.</p><p>Her nostrils flared. \u201cYou don\u2019t get so much as another scratch, you understand me? Not a scratch. You go in, stop the freak, and you come back to me.\u201d</p><p>He blew out a slow breath. \u201cYou know, sweetheart, it sure sounds like you care what happens to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot.\u201d Her finger stabbed into his chest. \u201cYou know I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, come on, she couldn\u2019t stop there.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I do.\u201d Soft. Sad. \u201cSo don\u2019t leave me, got it?\u201d</p><p>Leave her? Not an option, now or damn ever. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>She crushed her mouth to his. Made him ache and need and lust.</p><p>Her mouth lifted. Their eyes met. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Then she brushed past him. The lady climbed the steps with her head high and her shoulders straight. The metal door screeched open when she reached the top.</p><p>Jude realized he was holding his breath. Talk about a woman with power.</p><p>She could bring him to his knees so easily.</p><p>\u201cOh, damn.\u201d Zane sounded bemused, confused, not like his usual cocky self. \u201cThat lady is...something else. Man, did you see the way she fought?\u201d Zane had always had a soft spot for a woman who could kick ass and ignore names.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d There had been no missing the way she\u2019d fought to save him. A smart man held a woman who fought like that very close.</p><p>A smart man told her how he really felt, and he worked like hell to make her feel the same way.</p><p>\u201cUh, Jude...\u201d Tony\u2019s voice was back to that drawling roll now, not dazed anymore. \u201cAre you sure about this plan? You don\u2019t know what that asshole could have waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s coming for him.\u201d No way was he backing down. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Tony, I\u2019m not scared of the big, bad wolf.\u201d No, the wolf needed to be scared of him.</p><p>The sun was starting to set when Erin marched out of the den twenty minutes later. Red gold lights shot across the sky, looking weakly like trickles of blood.</p><p>Her hands fisted. \u201cYou\u2019d better come back to me in one piece, Jude.\u201d</p><p>He stood behind her, just inside the entrance to the den. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>Right. \u201cYou almost died on me once today.\u201d Not again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have backup.\u201d</p><p>The demon.</p><p>She stared up at the sky and tried to pretend she was in control. I can handle this.</p><p>If she were going with him, she\u2019d be handling it a whole lot better. If she were watching his back...</p><p>But Erin knew he was right. The wolf would catch her scent instantly.</p><p>Straightening her shoulders, she took a step forward. Dee stood next to a gray SUV, waiting semi-patiently for her. Jude had told the human to stay with her until he returned from the hunt.</p><p>A human? For protection? Seriously, she could rip the woman apart in less than ten seconds.</p><p>If she were the ripping apart type.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something you should know, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated but didn\u2019t glance back.</p><p>\u201cI realized a few things in that filthy hole.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she\u2019d realized some damn important things too. When she\u2019d seen him and he\u2019d been so still, a jarring realization had come real quick. Can\u2019t lose him.</p><p>\u201cYou stopped being a case for me, hell, almost from day one.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She kept her shoulders straight and her hands loose at her sides.</p><p>\u201cI fell for you fast,\u201d he told her.</p><p>What? No, no, he couldn\u2019t mean\u2014</p> <p>She swallowed and stared up at that bloody sky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back from this case, and I\u2019ll be coming for you.\u201d</p><p>Her hands curled into small fists. \u201cGood.\u201d And she looked back at him, standing so big and strong in that doorway.</p><p>\u201cBecause if I don\u2019t see your sexy ass within three hours, I\u2019ll be coming for you.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d fallen.</p><p>And Erin wasn\u2019t about to lose the best thing that had ever happened to her. \u201cWatch that ass, Donovan.\u201d</p> <p>Their eyes held.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>The words stuck in her throat. She wanted to say them so badly but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou too, sweetheart,\u201d he murmured and her breath caught.</p><p>Then he was gone. Jude eased back into the den and she was left with the taste of fear on her tongue.</p><p>He watched his mate and fury iced his veins. Her face\u2014her eyes\u2014</p> <p>Fuck, no.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way the game was played.</p><p>The other shifter\u2014he was prey.</p><p>But Erin didn\u2019t look at the tiger as if he were prey.</p><p>No, not prey. So much more.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d the word was a growl that broke from his mouth.</p><p>He\u2019d done so much for her. Sacrificed and punished\u2014and this was how she repaid him?</p><p>Unworthy.</p> <p>They could have been perfect. Unstoppable. The next evolution for their race.</p><p>The tiger had ruined that for him.</p><p>Ruined every fucking thing.</p><p>\u201cYou really think this plan\u2019s going to work?\u201d Erin stood on Jude\u2019s ramshackle porch, her skin cold even though the night was too warm. She stared up at the stars and wondered just how close Jude was to death.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Be safe. Come back to me.</p><p>Because if something happened again, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d get another vision. She\u2019d sure never been able to control the dreams.</p><p>No, this time, she might not get a vision.</p><p>Just a body.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it will work.\u201d Dee stepped to her side, moving almost as soundlessly as a shifter. A good hunter, for a human.</p><p>Dee\u2019s response wasn\u2019t the reassuring answer she\u2019d wanted, but Erin was quickly coming to see that Dee wasn\u2019t exactly a reassuring kind of woman.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been on a lot of hunts with him, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Erin asked, but she didn\u2019t take her gaze off the swamp. The twisting trees, the gentle movement at the water\u2019s edge. This was where Jude ran wild. His sanctuary.</p><p>Dee hesitated. \u201cAh, usually Jude hunts alone.\u201d</p><p>Like he\u2019d gone hunting at that den.</p><p>The human turned toward her. \u201cHe\u2019s the strongest shifter I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Dee told her. Okay, that was reassuring. Erin glanced at her as she continued, \u201cAnd believe me, I\u2019ve come across more than my share of shifters since I joined Night Watch fifteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen years? But the woman barely looked thirty. Hell, more like twenty-five.</p><p>Dee laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I was legal.\u201d A pause. \u201cBarely. Jude took me under his wing. Taught me how to fight the supernaturals. How to survive. He\u2019d only been in the Watch for a few years, but he\u2019d already gotten a reputation.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d just bet he had.</p><p>\u201cJude always gets the job done,\u201d Dee said simply. \u201cYou can count on him.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she could.</p><p>A soft peal rang out from the area of Dee\u2019s left side. She shoved a hand into the pocket of her jeans and dug out a cell phone. \u201cYo.\u201d</p><p>Erin tensed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re kidding! That\u2019s great! Does he remember anything? What? Yeah, yeah, we\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call with a flick of her thumb. \u201cGivens is awake. That was McCall, he\u2019s one of the hunters we stationed with Givens for protection. A few minutes ago, Givens woke up. McCall said the guy just opened his eyes and then he asked for his son, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s breath rushed out. Alive.</p><p>\u201cThe way I figure it,\u201d Dee said, \u201cwe can sit up here with our thumbs up our asses or we can hightail it to that hospital, arrive before the cops do, and maybe get some info out of Givens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like having a thumb up my ass,\u201d Erin muttered and jumped down the steps. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Jude was already hunting, so the info might not be any good to him, but at least she\u2019d be doing something.</p><p>Other than having a thumb up her ass.</p><p>They ran toward Dee\u2019s SUV.</p><p>\u201cYou sure this is the place?\u201d Jude demanded.</p><p>Kyler gave a grudging nod. \u201cYeah, yeah, this is the address he gave me.\u201d</p><p>A cabin at the edge of the swamp. A place that looked way too much like his own home.</p><p>Gotta get a new place for Erin. Because a dump falling into the moss really wasn\u2019t going to cut it for her.</p><p>He had the cash. Sure, he liked to run in the swamp, but Erin needed something different.</p><p>And after the way the asshole had christened her home, she\u2019d probably like a fresh start someplace else.</p><p>They could get that start together. Maybe another antebellum, one they could restore together. One with a lot of land for running...</p><p>Later.</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d Jude said, testing the ropes that held his hands. Damn tight, cutting-off-his-circulation tight. Zane knew his knots, how to tie \u2019em and how to place \u2019em. Thanks to Zane, the knots were perfectly positioned next to his claws. A few slices, and he\u2019d be free. \u201cTime to get your payment.\u201d</p><p>A grunt came from the sweating demon. His black eyes darted from the left to the right. \u201cThis is a real assed-up plan.\u201d</p><p>Jude grunted. \u201cWho asked you?\u201d</p><p>Zane eyed him with raised brows. \u201cGuess I get to be the one to drag your sorry butt inside, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo... he gets the job.\u201d Because he didn\u2019t want Kyler\u2019s hands free for a minute.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Kyler snarled.</p><p>Good thing demons were strong.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this shit started.\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s foot shoved the gas pedal to the floor. She took the curves and hidden twists with ease, her gaze never darting from the road.</p><p>At this rate, they\u2019d be at the hospital in no time. The road was deserted. Dark and quiet. Well, quiet except for Dee\u2019s revving motor.</p><p>\u201cDoes Lee know he was attacked because of me?\u201d Erin\u2019s fingers tapped against the side of the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that would be a fun conversation.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know that you saved his butt yet, either.\u201d</p><p>Headlights flashed in the distance. Maybe not so deserted. \u201cSaving him has to count for something, right?\u201d Erin asked quietly. She sure hoped it did.</p><p>Zane kicked open the door of the cabin. \u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d He called out, pretty unnecessarily to Jude\u2019s way of thinking.</p><p>Kyler tossed him onto the floor. \u201cGot the shifter bastard you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Jude didn\u2019t grunt at the impact. He didn\u2019t move at all.</p><p>Old floorboards squeaked around him as Zane and Kyler edged out in the room.</p><p>Jude\u2019s nostrils flared. He couldn\u2019t scent the wolf, but Erin had told him the guy could disguise his smell. So just because he couldn\u2019t smell him, well, that didn\u2019t mean the stalker wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>His ears twitched.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Thick and heavy. Too much silence.</p><p>He slashed through his ropes and bounded to his feet. \u201cWhere the hell is the bastard?\u201d</p><p>Kyler was creeping toward the door. Jude grabbed him and slammed his head against the wall. Payback for the headfirst toss onto the floor. The demon went down and didn\u2019t get back up.</p><p>Jude\u2019s gaze raked the cabin. Not here.</p><p>But if the wolf wasn\u2019t waiting to rip him apart, then where was the bastard?</p><p>\u201cYeah, saving the guy\u2019s life has to count for something,\u201d Dee said, her fingers tightening around the steering wheel. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you could help the fact that this creep after you tried to kill him.\u201d</p><p>The headlights were growing closer. The dark shadow of that other car\u2014was it swerving a bit?</p><p>Erin licked her lips. \u201cHow many...other cabins are out this way?\u201d She\u2019d never seen another vehicle when she\u2019d visited Jude before. The guy liked his solitude. Not real big into sharing property and\u2014</p><p>Something big and black ran into the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Dee slammed on the brakes.</p><p>But whatever the hell that was out there wasn\u2019t aiming for them.</p><p>\u201cIs that a fucking dog?\u201d Dee\u2019s breath jerked out with a hard rush.</p><p>Erin\u2019s breath was gone. Not a dog. The beast was heading right for the other vehicle. Running fast and hard. The beast never halted, never faltered, just ran straight for the other driver.</p><p>Animal and car hit. Brakes squealed. Metal shrieked. Glass shattered. And the vehicle, a big, black SUV\u2014pretty damned similar to Dee\u2019s, just a different color\u2014swerved off the road and plowed into a line of trees.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Dee jerked off her belt and sprang from the vehicle.</p><p>The air from Dee\u2019s open door wafted into the SUV, and Erin\u2019s eyes widened as she caught a distinct scent. No. \u201cDee!</p><p>Dee, stop!\u201d She clawed through her own seat belt and jumped out, her heart racing. \u201cDon\u2019t get close, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly Christ!\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even known the woman was religious.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if he were awake, the guy would be a hell of a lot more useful.\u201d Zane eyed the demon on the floor, his face grim. \u201cMaybe you should have waited to bash his head until after we got some more information.\u201d</p><p>There was no more information to get. \u201cThe wolf isn\u2019t here.\u201d He\u2019d been played. Played.</p><p>And he\u2019d left Erin alone.</p><p>He grabbed his cell phone. Punched in her number.</p><p>One ring.</p><p>Two.</p><p>Then... damn CALLER NOT AVAILABLE message.</p><p>His fingers crushed the phone. Shit. \u201cTry to get Dee on the line,\u201d he growled, and his gaze raked the cabin. Minimal furnishings. A chair. A bed. Too much like my place.</p><p>Except for the framed picture of Erin.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cRinging,\u201d Zane said, and Jude glanced back to see that the demon had his cell phone positioned at his ear.</p><p>\u201cTell her to get Erin inside my cabin and to lock the doors. We\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>That picture...</p><p>He turned back around, slowly, and paced across the room.</p><p>Her hair was longer. She was smiling, walking in what looked like some kind of park.</p><p>\u201cNo answer.\u201d</p><p>Jude reached for the frame. He traced the busted glass. It looked like someone had shoved a fist into the picture.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a big problem.\u201d He looked up at Zane. No answer. Their eyes met. The broken glass bit into his hand, sending droplets of blood onto the picture.</p><p>Onto Erin.</p><p>Blood was in the air. Thick and strong and so sickeningly fresh.</p><p>\u201cI think the bastard is dead!\u201d Dee scrambled to a stop near the middle of the road, right before the prone body of the giant black wolf.</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d Erin screamed, running as fast as she could. An injured wolf was dangerous. Any wolf was dangerous, but an injured beast would rip and tear anything in its path.</p><p>With a burst of speed, she reached the human and jerked her back.</p><p>\u201cErin, stop! The wolf is barely breathing. It\u2019s over, you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin shoved Dee away. A safe distance behind her. Then she fell to her knees beside the wolf. So much blood. A growl rumbled in the beast\u2019s throat and the creature bared its teeth.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Dee blasted. \u201cGet away from him! Let him die! Your life will be one hell of a lot better!\u201d</p><p>Erin reached out a hand to the wolf. The too-sharp teeth snapped together, barely missing her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cErin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right,\u201d she whispered, but the words were a lie. A tear trickled down her cheek. No, no, this wasn\u2019t the way things should have ended.</p><p>She ignored the teeth and the claws that tried to swipe at her. An injured beast would rip and tear anything in its path.</p><p>Even if she was the one in the creature\u2019s path. Her fingers sank into the bloody fur. The wolf\u2019s hind legs were broken, no, shattered.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>\u201cCall for help,\u201d she ordered, never taking her eyes off the wolf.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I need to get help for whoever is in that SUV! But not for this mangy wolf and I\u2014aw, hell, I left my cell in the car!\u201d</p><p>A growl rose in Erin\u2019s throat.</p><p>She heard the soft fall of Dee\u2019s footsteps as the human stumbled back. \u201cErin, wh-what\u2019s up with you? I thought you...hated this guy.\u201d Suspicion now. Worry.</p><p>The wolf jerked its head against her and managed to let out a long, mournful howl. The beast\u2019s eyes jerked to the left, and it whimpered.</p><p>Such bright yellow eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the asshole who\u2019s after me.\u201d The shift began then. Fast, because the wolf was weak and so was the woman.</p><p>\u201cThis is my mother.\u201d</p><p>And she was dying.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are they?\u201d Jude\u2019s foot shoved down even harder on the gas pedal as the car lurched forward. The car was Zane\u2019s, but he\u2019d borrowed it while the demon secured Kyler.</p><p>The bastard likes to get up close and personal with his prey. That\u2019s how he makes the kills. And why he\u2019d given the order that Jude would be brought to him alive.

Every instinct he had screamed the guy had gone running, but not out of the city.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d gone\u2014</p> <p>To Erin.</p><p>For a sports car, Zane\u2019s \u201cbaby\u201d sure wasn\u2019t going fast enough. He shifted hard and the engine roared. Zane would have to trail as fast as he could on the motorcycle they\u2019d found at the cabin.</p><p>Erin. Be safe, sweetheart. His claws ripped through his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cI got Antonio on the phone. He\u2019s sending help.\u201d Dee eased onto her knees beside Erin. \u201cI-I found this in my SUV.\u201d She handed her a loose jacket.</p><p>Her mother lay on the ground, pale and unmoving. So much blood. It was the only covering she had.</p> <p>Erin put the jacket over her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t she change? Like Jude did back at the den, can\u2019t she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too weak.\u201d If Antonio didn\u2019t get there soon with the ambulance, she\u2019d be dead. Erin brushed back a clump of her mother\u2019s hair. They really looked so much alike.</p><p>When she\u2019d been a girl, her mother had combed her hair every night before bed, laughing as she stroked her\u2014</p><p>Her mother\u2019s lashes lifted, so slowly. Yellow eyes, hazy with pain, tried to focus on Erin. \u201cR-run.\u201d Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her arms. \u201cMother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRun...\u201d</p><p>Her breath whispered out and her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cOh, God!\u201d From Dee. \u201cIs she\u2014\u201d</p><p>Erin grabbed her arm. \u201cDid you check on the other driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s a guy. He\u2019s fine, just has a little cut on his forehead.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tightened. \u201cDo you have your gun?\u201d She\u2019d seen it earlier. Dee always carried her gun. Always.</p><p>Dee brushed back her shirt, revealing the butt of her weapon.</p><p>A twig snapped. Close. Too close.</p> <p>Her mother had almost killed herself? Why?</p><p>Run.</p><p>The wolf\u2014her mother\u2014had headed straight for that other SUV. Attacked it.</p><p>To protect me.</p><p>The night was too quiet then. No crickets. No croaking frogs. Just silence, smothering her.</p><p>The fingers of Dee\u2019s right hand hesitated over the gun butt. Erin held her stare and mouthed, Get. It. Out.</p><p>A growl\u2014from the left.</p><p>They spun around. Dee brought up her gun.</p><p>Erin expected to see a wolf lunge at them.</p><p>Instead, she saw a man.</p><p>One she knew. What the hell?</p><p>Judge Lance Harper\u2014 the freaking judge! \u2014walked from the brush, as calm as you please. Blood trickled down the side of his face. He smiled at her, revealing his fangs, and said, \u201cErin, beautiful Erin, I\u2019m going to have to punish you.\u201d</p><p>And he lifted his claws toward her.</p><p>\u201cShoot him!\u201d she screamed at Dee.</p><p>His smile vanished, and he lunged for her.</p><p>Dee fired. Once. Twice.</p><p>The deafening shots echoed in Erin\u2019s ears.</p><p>The judge froze. He looked down at his chest, at the blood soaking his shirt, and he shook his head. \u201cTakes more than that to stop me.\u201d</p><p>She knew that, oh, dammit, but she knew\u2014</p><p>He attacked.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Dee ran forward, her gun up, but the bastard moved too fast. His claws raked down her arm, then across her chest. The gun flew from her fingers and she screamed as his teeth caught her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo! \u201d Dee didn\u2019t understand. Harper wasn\u2019t like other shifters. He\u2019s like me. In human form, he was nearly as strong as a fully transformed shifter.</p><p>And when he transformed\u2014</p><p>Hello, hell.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, asshole!\u201d Erin sank her own claws into his side, and twisted.</p><p>He howled in fury and pain, and he tossed Dee into the air. When she came down, Dee hit the ground with a thud, and she didn\u2019t get up.</p><p>Dee!</p><p>His head turned, just a few inches, and Harper met Erin\u2019s stare. His brown eyes were muddy, so dark, and the grin on his face chilled her. \u201cAlways knew you liked the blood. Just like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing like you!\u201d She jumped back, putting some frantic space between them.</p><p>She could really have used Jude right then! When Dee had called for backup, she\u2019d called Night Watch and Antonio. Not Jude and Zane. Dee had thought they were in the middle of their trap. Thought they were catching the stalker.</p><p>But he\u2019d come for her, instead.</p><p>Harper raised a hand to his side. His fingers touched the blood that pulsed and flowed so hotly. \u201cWanted to do this...in human form.\u201d</p><p>Her claws were up, ready. \u201cDo what?\u201d Hot Harper? Lance Harper? His name blasted through her head over and over again. She\u2019d been in his courtroom so many times, been so close to him, and never suspected.</p><p>He\u2019d tried to rape her. He\u2019d killed. Tortured.</p><p>The judge?</p><p>She shook her head. No, no, this didn\u2019t make a bit of sense.</p><p>He watched her with those dark eyes, and his blood splattered on to the ground. He didn\u2019t seem to notice or even to care.</p><p>\u201cYou disappointed me, mate.\u201d</p><p>Mate. \u201cI\u2019m not your mate.\u201d</p><p>The judge blinked at that, looking vaguely surprised. \u201cWell, of course, you are. I recognized you the first moment you stepped into my courtroom.\u201d His smile had faded completely. \u201cI divorced my third wife for you.\u201d</p><p>Divorced my third wife. Erin guessed she was lucky he hadn\u2019t killed the woman. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you could have known from one look that I was your mate.\u201d Keep him talking. Backup would arrive soon. Had to. Just how many bullets would the guy be able to take and keep standing? Because when Antonio arrived, she knew he\u2019d unload on the asshole.</p><p>\u201cI knew the second I caught your scent that you were mine.\u201d</p><p>Bullshit. She hoped. Her eyes narrowed. \u201cSo what? You decided to make my life hell because you liked the way I smelled?\u201d</p><p>He jumped toward her. Harper closed the distance in less than a second. Stronger than me. Faster than me.</p><p>Dammit!</p><p>His fingers wrapped around her arms, and she felt the sting of his claws. His breath\u2014 freaking minted breath\u2014blew in her face. \u201cI gave you everything you wanted. I punished the fools who hurt you or got in your way. I made sure your life was perfect.\u201d</p><p>Insane. There was a reason for the whispers about wolves being psychotic. Some of them really were. \u201cYou killed. You murdered Donald Trent!\u201d</p><p>The claws dug deeper. \u201cBecause you wanted him stopped.\u201d His teeth snapped together and a frown pulled his brows low, as if he truly didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIf I\u2019d found him guilty in court, he would have been out in what? Two, three years?\u201d He grunted.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough for you. You wanted more\u2014so I gave you more! I stopped him, permanently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou buried him in the woods behind his kids\u2019 house!\u201d</p><p>The right side of his mouth lifted. \u201cThought it was fitting.\u201d</p><p>No, it was insane.</p><p>\u201cI just had to go and watch the cops dig him up. So fucking perfect.\u201d</p><p>Erin could only stare at him. Why hadn\u2019t she seen the madness before? Why hadn\u2019t the cops? All the other lawyers?</p><p>The insanity had hid so well behind his black robes.</p><p>His gaze swept over her face. \u201cWhen you walked in that first day, I thought you were the most perfect thing I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Just like her, that same fire burning inside.\u201d He jerked Erin closer. \u201cI knew when I saw you then, I knew why fate had put that bastard in Theresa\u2019s path so many years before.\u201d</p><p>What? Her heart iced. \u201cH-how do you know my mother\u2019s name?\u201d The mother who lay dying just a few feet away. She\u2019d risked her life to save Erin from this bastard.</p><p>He blinked and, for an instant, almost seemed confused. \u201cI thought she was mine.\u201d The words came, slow and stilted. \u201cFor years, I thought she was the one for me.\u201d</p><p>A choked moan rumbled from behind Erin. Her mother\u2019s pain-filled cry.</p><p>Erin stared into Harper\u2019s eyes and knew.</p><p>Theresa\u2019s voice drifted through her mind. \u201cSuch dark, dark eyes that saw into me so well...\u201d</p><p>Hell.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s lover.</p><p>Erin jerked against him, hard, horror giving her strength as she stumbled back from his hold.</p><p>His lip curled with disgust as he grated, \u201cWhen she went with that human, I couldn\u2019t pretend about her any more. She wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>Erin sucked in oxygen as hard and as fast as she could. Not. Happening.</p><p>\u201cI left the pack.\u201d His teeth snapped together. \u201cI went on my own, and then you came to me.\u201d</p><p>No, no, she hadn\u2019t come to him. She\u2019d just been in court, doing her job!</p><p>\u201cThe instant I saw you, I finally understood what fate had planned for me. I knew you were my reward, the mate I\u2019d always wanted.\u201d A laugh then, rough and wild. \u201cYou look so much like her,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019re better, stronger, mine. \u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not yours. \u201d Never would be.</p><p>\u201cYou know what it\u2019s like to be different from the others. Not human. Not wolf. More powerful than both.\u201d He lifted his hand toward her, long and deadly claws out. \u201cWe were made for each other. Perfect halves.\u201d</p><p>She stared at that hand and remembered the sight of Bobby Burrows\u2019s bloody body. \u201cWe are nothing alike.\u201d She held her body perfectly still. Now wasn\u2019t the time for an attack. Not yet.</p><p>He closed the space between them. His right hand lifted and his fingers trailed down her cheek. \u201cI had to bide my time and make sure there were no obstacles between us.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d tried to kill all the obstacles. Erin barely breathed as she stood before him.</p><p>One sharp claw pressed against the side of her face. \u201cPurebloods always thought they were so fucking superior. I had to show the animals how wrong they were. Every day, I had to fight and claw my way through the pack.\u201d</p><p>Alpha. Her mother had said her lover was the alpha of the pack. Alphas were the most bloodthirsty of the wolves. The most dangerous.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cThey never understood what we are!\u201d he snarled. \u201cFucking idiots!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cAnd what are we?\u201d</p><p>The claw dug into her skin, broke the flesh. \u201cThe next evolution. We can be strong in our human flesh. We don\u2019t have to wait for the wolf. We can kill and we can conquer as we are. Hell, we can rule the world. We don\u2019t have to wait for the shift. We have the power every minute of every day.\u201d</p><p>Her chin lifted and she knew the liquid sliding down her face wasn\u2019t tears, it was blood. \u201cI can\u2019t shift.\u201d</p><p>His gaze burned her. \u201cI know\u2014that\u2019s why you\u2019re so perfect. \u201d</p><p>Great, of all the people in the world, he thought she was perfect.</p><p>Harper licked his thin lips. \u201cOur children won\u2019t need to shift. They\u2019ll be born with power. Always have it.\u201d</p><p>Their children? \u201cGot news for you,\u201d she managed. There\u2019d been no sound from Dee\u2014or from her mother\u2014for several moments. Be alive. \u201cI\u2019m not planning on having any kids with you.\u201d That would be the last thing she\u2019d ever do.</p><p>Whack job for a father? Hell, no. She and her mother had very different taste in men.</p><p>His breath rushed out. More mint. \u201cIt\u2019s that fucking tiger. I\u2019ve been watching you. Always watching.\u201d</p><p>She knew that. She\u2019d felt his eyes too many times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at hiding. I was close enough to touch you so many times and you never knew.\u201d</p><p>Goosebumps rose on her flesh.</p><p>\u201cI changed my hair, used contacts, held the shift so that my face was different\u2014\u201d He broke off, giving a muffled laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou never even knew!\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d held the shift? How was that even possible? The next evolution.</p><p>\u201cI love to watch you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLove to see your face.\u201d His jaw clenched as his eyes turned arctic. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen your face when you look at that bastard!\u201d Spittle flew at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been screwing him. Fucking around on me just like your whore of a mother!\u201d</p><p>Her claws were out. Ready. His wounds were close. Keep talking. Hold his attention. Stir his fury.</p><p>Fury could make him weak.</p><p>Erin smiled. A slow, wide grin. \u201cYeah, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, bit\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shoved her hands up between them. Don\u2019t forget how strong I can be, asshole.</p><p>His mistake\u2014he\u2019d stayed in human form. She could take the jerk in human form. Because she was as strong as he was that way, maybe even stronger. Maybe.</p><p>Time to find out.</p><p>She drove her claws into his bloody wounds and wrenched up as hard as she could.</p><p>His head slammed into hers and black spots danced before her eyes.</p><p>She stumbled back. He raised his claws above her\u2014</p><p>Erin caught his right wrist, then the left, and she held him as tight as she could. Bones snapped beneath her grip.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he whispered and he crushed his mouth against hers.</p><p>She bit him, savaging his lips with her teeth and his blood flowed.</p><p>But the bastard just laughed.</p><p>Furious, scared as hell, she threw him back.</p><p>Harper didn\u2019t stumble or stagger. He landed on his feet. The bastard balanced perfectly and then swiped the back of his hand over his bleeding mouth. \u201cI like the way you taste.\u201d His stare dropped to her body. \u201cWhen you\u2019re with him...do you think of me?\u201d</p><p>What? \u201cNo! \u201d</p><p>More laughter. \u201cI bet I\u2019m in your head. Late at night, when you close your eyes, you think of me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She had, for so long. But not because she wanted him. Because...\u201cYou attacked me! Almost murdered Ben! You\u2019ve terrorized me, so, hell, yes, I\u2019ve thought about you!\u201d Her teeth ached as they extended even more. Longer, sharper than they\u2019d ever been. \u201cI thought about how I\u2019d like to kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the blood thirst, just like me.\u201d</p><p>A broken groan broke the air.</p><p>Erin\u2019s gaze flew to the left. Not her mother this time, Dee. The hunter was trying to push herself up.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you care about them?\u201d His stare followed hers. \u201cThey aren\u2019t even worth your notice.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t worth her notice.</p><p>He held out his hand to her once more, claws stained red. \u201cCome with me, Erin, and I\u2019ll let your human live, for now.\u201d</p><p>For now. Code for later, he\u2019d be back to slice her to ribbons.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy all the killings? Bobby Burrows\u2014\u201d</p> <p>His hand waited in the air, but he answered her. Harper had always loved to hear himself talk. That was one of the many reasons why his court had always been torture for her. \u201cBurrows made you look like a fool. He escaped on your watch.\u201d</p><p>Well, the cops\u2019 watch.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was worthless trash, eating away at the world. He needed to be put down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call to make! You can\u2019t decide who lives or dies! You can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand fell. \u201cI\u2019ve spent fifteen years of my life deciding who lives and dies. I damn well know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Executing his own brand of justice and claiming to kill for her. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy,\u201d she whispered. Probably not the smartest thing to say to a killer, but what the hell?</p> <p>\u201cWolves in packs don\u2019t become psychotic.\u201d His voice had chilled.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been in a pack for almost thirty years.</p><p>\u201cMated wolves out of the pack retain their sanity.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t mated. Did the guy even see where this was headed?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my mate. Since finding you, everything in my life has become crystal clear.\u201d His lips firmed and he took a step forward\u2014</p><p>And he stumbled.</p><p>The blood loss. It was finally hitting him.</p><p>She\u2019d hoped if she kept him talking, kept him focused\u2014yes!</p> <p>Harper slipped in his own blood and went down, hard.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not your mate, asshole, and even if I was, I wouldn\u2019t spend a day of my life with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tiger...\u201d His head fell down. His body shuddered. \u201cShould have...killed him...beginning...\u201d</p><p>No. \u201cJude isn\u2019t exactly easy to kill.\u201d One of his best traits.</p><p>His claws scraped over the pavement. \u201cSaw the way...you...l-looked at him...Has to...die...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re not going to hurt Jude.\u201d</p><p>He threw his head back then, and she saw his face. A wild combination of man and beast. \u201cYou\u2019re mine!\u201d A barely human howl of fury.</p><p>The transformation ripped through his body and he jerked, almost convulsing on the ground.</p><p>Not a shift. No. He should have been too weak to transform. Should have been...</p><p>Bones snapped. Fur burst from his skin.</p><p>\u201cNo! \u201d Erin flew at him, attacking, hoping to stop the shift before it was too late. Before he was too strong. Because if he shifted, he could heal\u2014and he could kill her.</p><p>But his shift was fast. Faster than Jude\u2019s. Faster than any shifter she\u2019d ever seen in her life. When her body fell against his, she sank her claws as deeply as she could into his side\u2014not the side of a man, but the body of a wolf. She thrust her claws past the thick fur and right into the muscle.</p><p>The wolf howled, and his head\u2014 long, thick muzzle, too-dark eyes\u2014turned toward her.</p><p>This was so not good. Erin stumbled back, sweat coating her body.</p><p>The wolf rose to his feet. His muscles vibrated and his fangs dripped saliva.</p><p>Too strong. The beast showed no signs of weakness.</p><p>Hybrid. The rules didn\u2019t apply to him. Or maybe they did. He could obviously heal as fast as she could. When he shifted anyway. She could heal almost that fast without a shift.</p><p>The next evolution? Had he been right?</p><p>The wolf snarled, and she stopped thinking about old Darwin\u2014and focused on the killing machine before her.</p><p>Backup! Where was Antonio?</p><p>She took a deep breath and attacked with all of her might, ripping, shredding muscle as\u2014</p><p>He rolled and his hind legs came up, catching her in the stomach. The wolf kicked her into the air.</p><p>Erin landed on her ass but jumped back up as fast as she could. Dee was inching ever closer to her gun. A fighter. She could be a fighter, too. \u201cCome on, judge. You want me so bad, huh? Then come and get me.\u201d She had to keep him away from Dee and her mother.</p><p>Erin held up her claws and bared her teeth.</p><p>And knew that he was about to kick her ass.</p><p>Can\u2019t take him while he\u2019s in wolf form. She just wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><p>But she could give him one hell of a fight. And maybe, maybe Dee could get her gun and blast the jerk with more bullets.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>She just had to hold him off long enough to\u2014</p><p>The wolf lunged at her. His teeth sank into her forearm, gouging deep holes into her flesh and biting all the way to the bone.</p><p>\u201cSonofabitch!\u201d</p><p>His claws raked across her stomach and his teeth\u2014they wouldn\u2019t let go!</p><p>Fire ate at her belly, but she took that pain and used it to feed the beast inside who could never get out.</p><p>\u201cNot a good way to treat your mate.\u201d She grabbed his jaw and had to pry the thing loose with hands that shook.</p><p>His eyes rolled. She caught the faintest sight of white in that darkness, and he twisted suddenly, shoving Erin and kicking into her legs.</p><p>What? Why was he\u2014</p><p>The hum of a motor rumbled in the distance. The wolf must have heard it before she had.</p><p>Backup. Antonio.</p><p>The wolf\u2019s ears shot straight into the air. His head snapped in the direction of the approaching car, then he looked back at her.</p><p>His muscles bunched.</p><p>And damn if it didn\u2019t look like the beast smiled.</p><p>Smiled\u2014with her mother lying there, dying. With Dee bleeding out.</p><p>When the wolf leapt forward, Erin launched herself at him. They hit, hard, and the wolf knocked her into the dirt near the side of the road, and then he locked his teeth on her shoulder, in her shoulder.</p><p>Bad idea. So fucking bad. Her claws flew up and gouged at his eyes.</p><p>The wolf leapt away.</p><p>Yeah, asshole. My dad taught me that move, before he realized I could break the hands of any touchy-feely punks who crossed the line.</p><p>\u201cGo for the eyes, girl. Don\u2019t be afraid to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>She sure wasn\u2019t afraid to hurt the wolf.</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d Dee\u2019s weak voice.</p><p>She glanced to the left. Dee was on her knees, weaving a bit. Her white T-shirt was soaked red.</p><p>The wolf snarled, and she knew he\u2019d seen Dee. His teeth snapped together.</p><p>Prey. Weak and ready.</p><p>The thought was hers, a sick instinct she\u2019d always ignored, but it was Harper\u2019s, too. She knew it.</p><p>So when he ran for Dee, she lunged after him. Her claws sank into his hind legs, and he twisted back. His paws hit her, taking her down with one hard blow, and she fell with the heavy weight of his body smothering her.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d Her cry this time, not her mother\u2019s. \u201cRun, Dee!\u201d</p><p>Because the wolf was too strong for her. Too strong for Dee.</p><p>Maybe even too strong for the backup coming.</p><p>Two bullets hadn\u2019t slowed him. She hadn\u2019t slowed him.</p><p>Saliva dripped onto her face. That breath wasn\u2019t so minty fresh anymore.</p><p>Erin looked up and found his open mouth poised right over her.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>No dreams this time. No visions. Her death.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t seen this one coming.</p><p>Sorry, Jude.</p><p>She\u2019d found him too late. A man who accepted her, wanted her, maybe even could love her\u2014too late.</p><p>So sorry.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be healing from this.</p><p>With a snarl, those fangs went for her throat.</p><p>The roar came as she felt the first puncture. A roar that filled her ears and seemed to shake the street.</p><p>Then the wolf was knocked right off her. His teeth scraped over her neck, slicing the skin.</p><p>She rolled away, lifting a hand to her throat and touching the wet warmth of her blood.</p><p>Jude.</p><p>The tiger was there, quivering with fury. Fighting with claws and teeth. Driving his fangs into the wolf\u2019s body. Picking up the smaller beast and tossing him into the air.</p><p>A match for a wolf.</p><p>Wolves were strong, no doubt about it, but a tiger shifter was no one\u2019s bitch.</p><p>She managed to rise to her feet. The blood flow was already starting to ease up. The slice hadn\u2019t gone too deep, thanks to Jude. All of her wounds throbbed, but they were healing fast.</p><p>Growls and snarls filled the air. The tiger and the wolf attacked, rolled, roared, and howled.</p><p>Blood soaked their fur. Bones crunched.</p><p>The wolf sank his teeth into the tiger\u2019s back. Jude jerked away, swiping with his front paws.</p><p>Have to help. Can\u2019t just stand here and watch!</p><p>\u201cErin...\u201d Dee\u2019s voice.</p><p>The gun.</p><p>Erin ran to her side and grabbed the gun. It slipped in her blood-soaked fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait, you need\u2014\u201d</p><p>No more waiting. The wolf had just cut open Jude\u2019s side.</p><p>The tiger seemed to move in a fast blur, launching at the wolf, his giant mouth open.</p><p>She lifted the gun, aimed. Move, Jude, move\u2014just a bit. Give me a shot. A chance to end the nightmare.</p><p>His mouth locked on the wolf\u2019s throat. Jude jerked the wolf up with his hold, and Erin had a perfect view of the beast\u2019s back.</p><p>Her finger squeezed the trigger.</p><p>The bullet thudded into the wolf.</p><p>The tiger\u2019s teeth clamped down harder.</p><p>One beat of time. Two. She fought to hold the gun steady. If she just didn\u2019t have so much blood on her hands...</p><p>The tiger dropped his prey. The wolf didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Jude threw back his head and roared his rage at the night.</p><p>Over? Please, be\u2014</p><p>Jude jumped over the fallen body of the wolf. As he ran to her, the fur began to melt from his body. He fell before her as the bones snapped and shaped with sickening crunches. His fangs disappeared and a man\u2019s face formed from the tiger\u2019s.</p><p>Naked, strong, he knelt before her.</p><p>Then he looked up at her. Jude didn\u2019t speak. He just gazed at her.</p><p>Her hands fell on to his shoulders. Over. She stared into his eyes. Finally, the bastard was dead.</p><p>And Jude was alive and strong and right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cErin...are you all right?\u201d Gruff, thick. Somewhere between the man\u2019s rumbles and the beast\u2019s growls.</p><p>She managed a nod. Too much blood on her, but...\u201cI\u2019m a fast healer.\u201d</p><p>His gaze tracked over her bloody form, then rose back to her face. \u201cJust so we\u2019re clear,\u201d he told her, his voice growing stronger. \u201cYou aren\u2019t his mate. Never were.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, sweetheart. Have been from the beginning, just like I\u2019m yours.\u201d His hands wrapped around her waist and he pulled her close.</p><p>Hers.</p><p>A tear slid down her cheek and splashed onto his shoulder. She wanted that to be true because she wanted him so much, but\u2014</p><p>His head tipped back a bit more. \u201cMine,\u201d he said again, simply, softly.</p><p>And she echoed the word as she gazed down at him. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Then he was rising up, holding her too tight and so right and his mouth was on hers and he kissed her the way he\u2019d always kissed her\u2014</p><p>With hunger and need and lust.</p><p>And love?</p><p>She wanted to sink into him, to push the world away, but there was too much pain around her. Too much blood.</p><p>She twisted back, pulling her mouth from his. \u201cJude, my mother...\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. He glanced behind her and swore. Then they were moving together, rushing to Theresa\u2019s side.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes were open, and she didn\u2019t look as pale as death anymore. No, no, a hint of color lined her cheeks. \u201cDid you...do it?\u201d she asked, her gaze on Jude\u2019s face.</p><p>Shifters\u2014always so strong. Theresa\u2019s legs were still a twisted mess, but the gushing blood had stopped. Her mother just might pull through.</p><p>Relief had Erin\u2019s breath catching. She was crouched in front of Jude, shielding his naked form as best she could. Her mother could see his face, but, hopefully, not much else.</p><p>Not that shifters were really known for any sort of modesty.</p><p>Jude gave a nod and said, \u201cI ripped the bastard\u2019s throat wide open.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, her mother managed a weak smile at that. \u201cGood...what the b-bastard...d-deserved.\u201d Blood stained the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTake it easy.\u201d Erin put a light hand on her mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHelp\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>That smile stayed on her bloody lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry...baby. Hard...to kill.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she was, and Erin had never been happier to have a wolf for a mother. Actually, it might have been the first time she was happy about that fact.</p><p>Theresa\u2019s right hand lifted and clamped down on her shirt. \u201cS-sorry...\u201d</p><p>Erin looked into her eyes and understood. \u201cHow did you know he was coming after me?\u201d</p><p>Her hand fell away. \u201cS-saw him...in L-Lillian... knew...wolf h-hybrid...f-followed h-him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have died.\u201d Anger there, the fear that wouldn\u2019t leave because her mother was still too close to death.</p><p>\u201cHad...to s-save...you.\u201d</p><p>Erin choked back the damn sob that rose in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell...is he?\u201d Dee\u2019s strained voice. Erin glanced at her. She was up now, on her feet, wavering a bit as she inched toward the naked body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fur was gone. The beast always vanished in death.</p><p>Erin\u2019s hands fisted. \u201cHis name\u2019s Lance Harper. Judge Lance Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, fuck.\u201d Comprehension darkened Jude\u2019s voice. \u201cThe dick in the basement.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah.</p><p>\u201cErin, I-I\u2019m s-sorry...\u201d Her mother\u2019s whisper.</p><p>Erin straightened her shoulders and turned her stare back to her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. What he did\u2014you had nothing to do with that.\u201d Theresa had loved the wrong man. The wrong, psychotic man. But her mother hadn\u2019t known. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Mom, just stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Her mother swallowed, the gulp loud and painful. \u201cTrying...Legs are a...m-mess...need sh-shift...\u201d</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t strong enough for that, not yet.</p> <p>\u201cA judge?\u201d Dee asked and the scent of her blood burned Erin\u2019s nose. She was still bleeding. Human. She\u2019d scar from the wounds, they were too deep not to scar.</p><p>She could sure understand Dee\u2019s disbelief. Her stalker had been Lillian\u2019s citizen of the year for five years running. He\u2019d sure been good at fooling the world.</p><p>\u201cHuh. Never did care much for judges.\u201d</p><p>At that, Erin fired a look over her shoulder in time to see Dee toeing the judge\u2019s body with her right foot. The hunter had her gun against her hip, and she was painstakingly loading fresh bullets into the chamber.</p><p>Better late than never.</p><p>Jude\u2019s hand curled around Erin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHey. You okay?\u201d</p> <p>She would be. Finally, she would be. Her eyes fell to Harper\u2019s still face. Handsome, even in death. Refined, almost\u2014</p><p>His eyelids flew open.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>Sick understanding burned through her. The shift had saved him. He hadn\u2019t shifted to die, he\u2019d shifted to live.</p><p>\u201cDee!\u201d</p><p>Too late. Harper lunged up and grabbed her, jerking Dee down onto his body and anchoring her against him. One hand rose to clutch her throat and his claws dug into her jugular.</p><p>\u201cI can kill her with one slice.\u201d His voice was hoarse, guttural. Because Jude had nearly ripped out his throat. The wound was still there, still red and jagged and angry, but he\u2019d healed enough, just enough.</p><p>Erin knew he wasn\u2019t bullshitting. He\u2019d kill the hunter in a heartbeat of time. \u201cHarper, let her go.\u201d She rose to her feet, deliberately keeping her mother behind her.</p> <p>Jude\u2019s fingers tightened around her.</p><p>Harper\u2019s eyes narrowed at that small movement. \u201cTouching her...always... touching her...\u201d He licked his lips.</p><p>Dee didn\u2019t move. Her face was blank, her body tense. Her blood pulsed from her wounds.</p><p>Erin shrugged free of Jude\u2019s hold and took a step forward. Behind her, she heard the rumble of his fury. \u201cLet her go,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>But Harper shook his head. \u201cBitch...could have been...perfect...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d Jude\u2019s hard voice. The guy hadn\u2019t stayed back. Now he stood beside her, naked and strong and more than ready to face down the devil with her.</p><p>Gotta love a man like that.</p><p>Love. Erin\u2019s breath caught.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d A scream from Harper. \u201cShould have...been mine! My mate, my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be yours.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cAnd you should know there\u2019s no way you\u2019re leaving here alive tonight.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Sirens screamed in the distance.</p><p>A cage wouldn\u2019t hold him.</p><p>But they would stop him. \u201cNow let her go!\u201d Erin demanded.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered, but sounded broken, lost.</p><p>\u201cNo, asshole,\u201d Jude growled. \u201cShe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Harper shook his head frantically.</p><p>Erin\u2019s stare jerked to Dee\u2019s face. The woman\u2019s lips moved, soundlessly. Save her.</p><p>Dammit, she was trying! Trying to save them all. Dee, her mother\u2014</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyes tracked to the right. Her gaze landed on the gun she\u2019d dropped when Harper grabbed her.</p><p>Again, her lips moved. No sound. Save her.</p><p>Dee had reloaded that gun just moments before and she\u2019d\u2014</p><p>No. Not save her. That wasn\u2019t what Dee was trying to say.</p><p>Once more, the human\u2019s lips formed words. One word, not two. Silver.</p><p>Jude tensed beside her. He\u2019d seen and understood.</p><p>\u201cI loved you,\u201d Harper whispered and his hand flexed.</p><p>Dee\u2019s head moved in the slightest of jerks, and Erin saw her body rock forward.</p><p>She\u2019d have to move, fast. They both would.</p><p>Harper\u2019s face twisted with hate, not love, and she knew he was going for the kill. \u201cFor you,\u201d he said and the claws dug deep.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Erin lunged for the gun.</p><p>Dee twisted hard, jerking and squirming, and Jude was there, slashing with his claws and yanking her into his arms as he spun, attempting to shield Dee with his body.</p><p>Erin brought up the gun.</p><p>Harper smiled. \u201cJust like me.\u201d</p><p>She fired. The bullet blasted into his chest.</p><p>Right into his heart.</p><p>Her father had taught her that, too. Shoot to kill. Kill to protect.</p><p>\u201cNo, bastard, I\u2019m nothing like you.\u201d</p><p>Harper\u2019s eyes were wide open when he fell back. All the better to see death.</p><p>Her breath came out on a hard, ragged exhale.</p><p>Jude lowered his arms and turned back to glance at the body.</p><p>A grim smile curved Dee\u2019s lips. \u201cAnd this time, you\u2019ll stay down, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Silver to the heart. According to the legends, a surefire way to kill a werewolf.</p><p>Or in this case, a hybrid wolf shifter.</p><p>Slowly, Erin stalked over to the judge. The gun was a solid weight in her hand as she gazed down at his face. Dee was right. The judge wouldn\u2019t be getting up from that one.</p><p>Over.</p><p>The wailing sirens were so loud now, screaming in her ears. Doors slammed nearby. Footsteps thudded. Voices rose.</p><p>Men, women.</p><p>One was louder, angrier than the others. \u201cAll right...get the hell out of my way! Jude! Dee!\u201d</p><p>Zane was there.</p><p>Erin dropped the gun. She spun around. \u201cMy mother!\u201d Theresa\u2019s eyes were closed and she\u2019d sagged back against the ground. Tear tracks stained her cheeks. Had she seen Erin kill Harper? \u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>Two men with stethoscopes raced toward Theresa.</p><p>\u201cEasy...\u201d Antonio appeared before her. He grabbed her shoulders, holding her steady. \u201cI need an EMT here, now! She\u2019s got severe injuries and blood loss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already healing,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut you have to understand, my mother\u2019s not human.\u201d</p><p>A quick nod. \u201cSamuels!\u201d A female EMT scrambled from the back of an ambulance. \u201cTake care of the female victim!\u201d He jerked his thumb toward Erin\u2019s mother. \u201cThen, Barlow, come over here and see about this bastard.\u201d His hand sliced toward Harper.</p><p>One of the male EMTs left her mother\u2019s side and hurried to the body.</p><p>\u201cNot much they can do for him,\u201d Jude muttered.</p><p>\u201cAh, hell!\u201d Antonio closed his eyes. \u201cClothes! Man, I\u2019m so tired of seeing your naked ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYo!\u201d Zane tossed a pair of jeans toward Jude, then his gaze snapped to Dee. \u201cWoman, what the hell happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Worry there.</p><p>A wan smile curved Dee\u2019s lips. \u201cWolf tried to play with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can do for him,\u201d Barlow said, rising. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>To hell, she hoped.</p><p>Dee\u2019s right shoulder lifted, then fell. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know I like to keep silver bullets handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd wooden stakes in your bag,\u201d Zane added.</p><p>The ambulance\u2019s siren wailed on. They were loading Theresa. \u201cI-I need to go with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d Antonio\u2019s face was grim. \u201cI\u2019ve got at least half a dozen cops who just saw you shoot that bastard\u2014 and I\u2019m real damn glad he was in human form at the time.\u201d Yeah, that after-death shift would have been a hard one to explain. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave the scene, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Samuels climbed in after her mother\u2019s gurney, and the EMT yanked the doors closed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Antonio told her. \u201cSamuels has a lot of experience with your kind.\u201d</p><p>Your kind. Erin licked her lips and managed a nod.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do this by the book.\u201d His voice barely floated in the air. \u201cThere are too many eyes here. Watch what you say, Jerome.\u201d</p><p>She would.</p><p>The ambulance pulled away. The swirling lights vanished into the darkness.</p><p>Not the same as before.</p><p>Her mother hadn\u2019t dropped her off without a word this time.</p><p>She\u2019d sacrificed herself. Almost died, for me.</p><p>You didn\u2019t risk death unless there was a very, very good reason. I\u2019d always thought she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Tonight, she\u2019d cared enough to die for me.</p><p>This time, her mother had chosen her.</p><p>\u201cDammit. Now who the hell is that?\u201d Antonio\u2019s hands fisted on his hips as he craned his head. \u201cHey, dick, get out of here!</p><p>You\u2019re not one of my guys so your ass needs to get lost!\u201d</p><p>Erin followed his glare and stiffened her shoulders when she caught sight of a familiar figure, the dick in question. Ben.</p><p>He was trying to push his way through the cops. He had his badge out, and he shoved it at the officers as they fought to keep him away from the crime scene.</p><p>\u201cAsshole, did you hear me? Get the fuck out!\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s fingers touched Antonio\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s a cop from Lillian. He...knows the judge.\u201d</p><p>Antonio\u2019s brows flew up. \u201cUh, the judge?\u201d</p><p>Jude, with his spare jeans on but his chest bare and still bleeding a bit from his battle, stalked up to them. \u201cYeah, the dead bastard was a judge.\u201d</p><p>And so much more. She\u2019d tell Jude. Tell him everything when they were alone, but her mother\u2019s secrets weren\u2019t for all the others to hear.</p><p>Antonio\u2019s jaw locked. \u201cNever. Easy.\u201d</p><p>Another ambulance sped away from the scene. Erin\u2019s attention jerked to Jude. \u201cDee?\u201d She hoped the human was all right.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay. Zane threw her bleeding butt into the ambulance. He knows how weak humans can be, and the guy wanted to make sure Dee wasn\u2019t taking any chances.\u201d</p><p>Weak\u2014Dee? Not likely. She\u2019d fought with more spirit than most shifters.</p><p>A long sigh ripped from Antonio\u2019s lips. \u201cAsshole! Get over here!\u201d</p><p>The cops holding Ben back glanced at the captain with raised brows.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Ben,\u201d Erin told him. \u201cDetective Ben Greer.\u201d</p><p>Another sigh. \u201cLong-ass night, I know it\u2019s gonna be one long-ass...\u201d He waved toward the uniforms. \u201cLet Detective Greer pass!\u201d Then, for her and Jude, \u201c\u2019Cause we\u2019re probably gonna need him to help cover our asses.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they probably would.</p><p>Ben stormed toward them, his face locked in hard lines of tension and his eyes blazing. \u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>Jude wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her back against the solid wall of his chest. \u201cShe stopped the killer.\u201d</p><p>Ben craned his neck to see around them. She knew immediately when he caught sight of the body because his eyes doubled in size and his jaw dropped. \u201cHoly Mother of Christ\u2014 Judge Harper!\u201d</p><p>Erin was pretty sure most of the citizens of Lillian would be having that reaction. \u201cHe killed Trent. He attacked you.</p><p>Murdered another man named Bobby Burrows\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cButchered him,\u201d Antonio threw in.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to rape me, and tonight, tonight, he would have killed me.\u201d And Dee and her mother.</p><p>Death had been the only way to stop him. Her mother would understand that more than anyone else.</p><p>Erin stared into Antonio\u2019s dark eyes. This part was for him and for the mess he\u2019d have at the station. \u201cHe confessed. In front of me, Dee and my mother. They\u2019ll swear to what they saw and heard.\u201d</p><p>He yanked out his notebook. \u201cAnd what else did they see, Jerome? I\u2019m guessing some things I don\u2019t want on the record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a wolf shifter,\u201d Jude said, his hold never wavering. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons he was so hard to kill, and why when your ME digs into him, he\u2019ll find a silver bullet lodged in his chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarper?\u201d Ben still seemed stunned.</p><p>She\u2019d been that way, too.</p><p>\u201cSilver bullet.\u201d Antonio closed his eyes. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt kept him down,\u201d Jude said. \u201cI\u2019d already all but ripped his throat out\u2014and he still got up. Trust me, Tony, we needed that bullet.\u201d</p><p>Some legends were based on a bit of truth.</p><p>Some weren\u2019t.</p><p>Jude pressed a kiss to her shoulder, then she felt the warm lap of his tongue as he licked lightly at her flesh. Shifters tended each other this way.</p><p>The way of their kind.</p><p>Her head tilted back against him and heat spread through her.</p><p>\u201cSave it!\u201d Antonio snapped. \u201cGet a room later, but I don\u2019t need this crap now!\u201d</p><p>One more swipe of Jude\u2019s tongue. The tending wasn\u2019t sexual\u2014well, okay, maybe it was. But the soft strokes meant more than just a prelude to sex.</p><p>To a shifter, it was the way to express affection.</p><p>Maybe even love.</p><p>Erin turned toward him.

With eyes that burned so very bright.</p><p>She touched his face. \u201cYou saved my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly fair, considering you\u2019d already done the same for me.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d do it again, any day. Because\u2014because\u2014</p><p>Antonio cleared his throat. Hard.</p><p>\u2014because she was in love with her badass, wild tiger shifter.</p><p>In love. Absolutely, freaking, crazy, I\u2019d-kill-to-protect him\u2014and had\u2014 in love. For the first time in her life. Pity that it had taken almost dying to make her realize that fact.</p><p>But, better late than never.</p> <p>Chapter 21</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ms. Jerome, but your mother isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Erin\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at the emergency room desk clerk, sure the woman was wrong. She had to be wrong.</p><p>\u201cBut she was brought in on an ambulance not even an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>The clerk, a short, balding man with a round face, flushed. \u201cAh, yes, um, I remember that.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t going to be a good story.</p><p>\u201cWhen the doors opened, the EMTs were there, but the patient\u2014ah, she\u2019d...already exited the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>Erin blinked. \u201cRun that by me again.\u201d</p> <p>His face a deeper red now, he said, \u201cThe EMTs said she jumped out when they slowed for a blocked intersection. She shoved right past them and managed to kick open the doors.\u201d</p><p>A smile lifted her lips. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Sweat beaded his brow. \u201cI assure you, this isn\u2019t normal routine, and the EMTs did everything they could to restrain her.\u201d</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cI guess she didn\u2019t feel like being restrained.\u201d If her mother was back in fighting and fleeing form, then she\u2019d be all right.</p><p>And Erin knew she\u2019d be seeing her again soon.</p><p>Thank you, Theresa.</p><p>Their life was far, far from perfect, but a mother who was willing to risk her life in order to get back into her daughter\u2019s good graces, well, that was a woman who deserved a second chance.</p><p>Erin would give her one.</p><p>Her nails tapped against the counter. \u201cAnd what about Dee Daniels? How is she?\u201d</p><p>Seriously, no human should be that shade of red. \u201cDee.\u201d He said the name like it was a curse. Based on that telling response, Erin figured the guy had probably seen Dee in the ER a few times. With the way Dee fought, that sure made sense.</p><p>\u201cDee, she\u2019s ah...in recovery. Not up to visitors yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>A weak nod. His Adam\u2019s apple bobbed.</p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. \u201cGood.\u201d Better than good.</p><p>She\u2019d come to the ER at Mercy General alone. Jude had stayed behind to keep answering all the million and one questions that the cops had.</p><p>She\u2019d gone after her mother because she\u2019d had to make certain she was all right.</p><p>If the woman was well enough to flee, then, yeah, she had to be on the mend.</p><p>Voices buzzed behind her. Machines beeped. Doctors rushed past.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see Dee yet\u2014</p><p>But there was someone else upstairs.</p><p>Erin shoved away from the counter.</p><p>\u201cAh, ma\u2019am?\u201d The desk clerk\u2019s strangled voice.</p><p>Erin walked toward the bank of elevators.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am? You\u2014you\u2019ve got a lot of blood there...\u201d</p><p>She glanced down. The shirt had dried, finally, but the blood made it thick and heavy. And her fingers, the ones she\u2019d been tapping on the counter, were stained red. Whoops.</p><p>The elevator doors opened with a chime. She walked inside and turned back to face the clerk. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she told him. \u201cOnly half the blood\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>The doors slid shut, but not before she\u2019d seen his face turn from red to a very dark purple.</p><p>The crime scene looked like chaos, but Jude knew Tony had everything under control.</p><p>The body had been tagged and bagged. The area had been sectioned off. Evidence collected. No detail would be overlooked under Tony\u2019s watch.</p><p>Erin wouldn\u2019t be charged. Hell, after she\u2019d given her story, Tony had even gotten one of the cops to take her to the hospital. A police escort.</p><p>No, she wouldn\u2019t be charged, and good old Judge Harper would go down as a twisted freak who\u2019d gotten too attached to one of the lawyers in his courtroom.</p><p>\u201cWhen we start digging into his past,\u201d Tony said, coming to stand beside Jude and staring out into the darkness of the swamp, \u201cI give you fifty to one odds\u201d\u2014 Tony loved to gamble\u2014\u201cthat we\u2019re gonna find out this wasn\u2019t the first time he got batshit crazy.\u201d</p><p>Jude grunted his agreement. No telling what skeletons were about to fall out of the judge\u2019s closet.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t his first time.\u201d Ben Greer paced toward them, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. He\u2019d clipped his badge to the front of his shirt. Lines were etched across his pale face. \u201cThere have been some...killings in Lillian over the last few years.\u201d</p><p>Jude narrowed his eyes on the cop. \u201cWhat kind of killings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kind that some cops don\u2019t care about.\u201d Ben\u2019s lips twisted. \u201cA rapist had his throat slit two years ago and his body was tossed onto the steps of the PD. Before that, a guy who\u2019d walked on a murder charge\u2014a guy guilty as fucking sin, because everyone knew he\u2019d killed his wife and her lover\u2014ah, someone cut out his heart...and then sent the package to the guy\u2019s lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Harper did this?\u201d Tony demanded. \u201cIf you knew about him, why the hell didn\u2019t you move on the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t have any proof.\u201d A shrug. \u201cI still don\u2019t.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at the bagged body. \u201cI remember though. Harper was the judge on those cases, and a few others where the defendants walked when they shouldn\u2019t have gotten off.\u201d</p><p>A pattern. \u201cLike Donald Trent,\u201d Jude said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just like Trent. And just like him these other bastards all ended up dead within six months.\u201d Disgust had faint lines appearing around his mouth. \u201cNo evidence was left behind, except, on a few of the bodies, we found some damn dog hairs\u2014\u201d He broke off and gave a loud burst of laughter, the kind that sounded a little crazy and the kind that didn\u2019t have one ounce of humor. \u201cDog hairs. Guess that makes sense now, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jude just stared back at him.</p><p>The human shook his head. \u201cHell. I still don\u2019t have a bit of solid evidence, though, do I? It\u2019s not like I can go to my captain and tell him the judge was a werewolf who liked to get off on-on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn handing out his own justice.\u201d Because Jude realized that was exactly what the judge had been doing, probably for years. If he\u2019d been Lone all that time, battling a nature he couldn\u2019t control, he would have needed prey.</p><p>The criminals would have been perfect for him.</p><p>So, during the day, Harper had presided on his bench, looking all perfect for the humans. Then at night, he\u2019d let the beast out, and he\u2019d hunted his prey.</p><p>Until one fine day, Erin had walked into his courtroom.</p><p>Not prey, something more.</p><p>Good thing the bastard\u2019s dead. His jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cHe...he left the bench after Erin disappeared,\u201d Ben spoke slowly now, as if putting all the puzzle pieces together. \u201cHe kept a house in Lillian, but he told everyone he wanted to do some traveling.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d traveled to Lillian. The better to kill and to make Erin\u2019s life hell. \u201cSonofabitch.\u201d Jude drove a hand through his hair. \u201cThat\u2019s why the woman acted so surprised to see him at the government building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSlow it down. I\u2019m the bastard you have to bring up to speed, remember?\u201d</p><p>Jude crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cWhen we were in Lillian, Erin and I stumbled across the bastard in the government basement. A woman was there, too, Lacy something. She was acting funny around the judge. I thought it was because they were screwing, but I guess she was just shocked to see the bastard there.\u201d</p><p>Ben pursed his lips and a glimmer of humor appeared in his eyes. \u201cActually, they were screwing, until the judge left the bench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe DA was focused on the Trent case, so he didn\u2019t say anything about the judge.\u201d But the puzzle pieces had all been there. Staring him right between the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna need to search the judge\u2019s place in Lillian,\u201d Tony said, nodding his head. \u201cNo telling what we\u2019ll find there.\u201d</p><p>Those skeletons. Because somebody like Harper wasn\u2019t the kind to kill and forget. Wolf shifters never were.</p><p>There would be trophies. Keepsakes.</p><p>And Ben would get his evidence to hand in to his captain.</p><p>Case fucking closed.</p><p>Erin hesitated in front of the hospital room door. Her hand lifted and touched the wood. The door was already ajar. She could hear voices. A man\u2019s voice, raspy, weak.</p><p>A kid\u2019s voice, high with excitement.</p><p>Now probably wasn\u2019t the best time. She could see Lee later, talk to him and explain.</p><p>Footsteps padded quickly toward the door. Her breath caught and she eased back a step.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>A small hand pulled open the door, and a little boy with a mop of curls stared up at her. \u201cMy daddy\u2019s awake,\u201d he said, and a broad grin split his face, revealing one front tooth.</p><p>Erin swallowed. \u201cTh-that\u2019s great.\u201d The door was fully open now. She could see Lee. Pale, bruised, and bandaged. He was propped up in bed, pillows all around him.</p><p>A woman stood beside him. She wasn\u2019t touching him. Just standing close. She had the same curly hair that the kid did, only darker.</p><p>\u201cE-Erin...Jerome,\u201d Lee spoke with the rasp again. Probably from the tubes they\u2019d shoved down his throat. Or maybe\u2014maybe just from the whole near-dying thing.</p><p>A smile swept over the woman\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who found Lee! You saved him! I-I heard the cops talking...\u201d</p><p>Oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>The brunette\u2019s stare dropped to rake down Erin\u2019s body. \u201cUh...are you\u2014are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d managed to wash the blood off her hands and she\u2019d traded in her bloody shirt for a scrub top. But Erin knew she still had to look like warm hell. \u201cMay I talk to Lee, alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ok...ay, M-Melis...sa...\u201d His blood pressure and heart rate flashed on the monitor behind him. \u201cGive us...a m-minute...\u201d</p><p>The cute kid was still smiling up at her, and Erin shifted from one foot to the other. Then his mother was there, catching his hand and guiding him outside. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered and Erin had to look away.</p><p>She closed the door behind them and knotted her fingers behind her back.</p><p>Lee watched her. Both of his eyes had thick, dark shadows around them. \u201cYou...saved me...\u201d He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...re-remember much. How\u2014how did...you know...where I w-was?\u201d</p><p>This was the hard part. Erin eased into the chair next to the bed. Okay. The guy had almost died. She figured he was owed the truth\u2014the whole truth. He might not believe her. He might think she was certifiable, but she was going to tell him. What he did with the knowledge, well, that would be up to him. \u201cLee, I\u2019ve got a story to tell you.\u201d She glanced at her small, oval nails. \u201cOne you might not believe at first, but I swear, every word of it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>The machines beeped quietly. If he gets too crazy and starts screaming for help because there\u2019s a monster next to him, I can always blame his reaction on the drugs. Yeah, the orderlies would buy that.</p><p>But maybe excuses wouldn\u2019t be needed. Erin took a deep breath. \u201cYou see, Lee, there\u2019s a whole lot more to this world than most people realize...\u201d</p><p>Jude was waiting for her when she came out of the hospital room. He\u2019d heard the soft whisper of her voice and been stunned by her words.</p><p>But probably not quite as stunned as Lee Givens had been to hear that Erin was a...sort of werewolf.</p><p>Her shoulders were slumped when she came out but her eyes seemed to lighten a bit when she saw him. Good sign. He caught her hand and led her to the elevator. It was nearing one a.m. now. A curly haired kid slept on his mom\u2019s lap in the waiting area. The mother brushed back his curls, humming softly and crying a bit with each slow movement of her hand.</p><p>Erin glanced at them, swallowed, and let him push her inside the elevator.</p><p>He waited until the doors closed before he spoke. \u201cThe guy seemed to take it well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-his grandmother was a charmer. He already knew about the Other.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d caught that part of the conversation, but he let her talk anyway. He figured she needed to.</p><p>\u201cI thought he\u2019d...blame me.\u201d</p><p>The lights on the elevator wall blinked as they descended.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe just...thanked me. He let me talk, let me tell him all about Harper\u2014 and he thanked me.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Lee wasn\u2019t as much of an asshole as he\u2019d always thought.</p><p>\u201cHe said things would be different for him, that he had a second chance.\u201d</p><p>Second chances were damn rare. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last light flashed on. They\u2019d hit the ground floor. The doors opened with a whisper. Erin stepped forward, but hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home tonight. Not there, just...not tonight.\u201d</p><p>And he wouldn\u2019t take her back to his cabin. The police were still combing that road. She didn\u2019t need to see the death scene again so soon.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he told her, catching her fingers and bringing them to his lips. Alive. She was alive. He kept having to remind himself of that very important fact because the image of the wolf with his fangs bared over her throat wouldn\u2019t stop playing in his mind. \u201cGot it covered, sweetheart.\u201d He stared into her golden eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got it covered.\u201d</p> <p>When he shoved open the hotel\u2019s front door, Jude caught sight of the same punk kid he\u2019d seen before at the front desk.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>The kid\u2019s eyes widened and Jude knew he\u2019d been recognized, too. Blue eyes darted to Erin\u2019s face, lingered for a bit.</p><p>\u201cTwo rooms again?\u201d</p><p>Smart-ass. Jude slapped the money down on the countertop. \u201cOne\u2014with a king-size bed.\u201d</p> <p>The acne hadn\u2019t cleared up a bit for the punk. \u201cYou sure you only want one room?\u201d The question was directed at Erin.</p><p>Why did he have to put up with this ass? Hadn\u2019t his night been hard enough?</p><p>\u201cOne room.\u201d Her voice was husky and soft and sounded like pure sex.</p><p>The kid gulped and shoved a key card across the countertop.</p><p>Jude kept his hand around her lush curves and guided her toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLucky bastard.\u201d The kid probably thought he wouldn\u2019t hear that, and if he\u2019d been human, maybe he wouldn\u2019t have caught the whisper.</p> <p>Jude glanced back at him. \u201cYeah, I am.\u201d He was hoping like hell that his luck continued to hold. Because now that the danger was past, he didn\u2019t want to lose his lady.</p><p>The silence stretched between them as they traveled to the room. Erin\u2019s steps were slow and heavy on the carpet. She had to be close to collapse after a night like this one.</p><p>He shoved the keycard into the lock. The light flashed green, and Erin grabbed the handle and opened the door.</p><p>Different room. Same layout.</p><p>Jude swallowed and tried to ignore the fact that his cock was fully erect, twitching with hunger, and that he was more than desperate for Erin.</p><p>Considerate. He could do that bit. For her. \u201cYou should...get some rest.\u201d The door clicked closed behind him.</p><p>Erin gave a nod and jerked the garish green shirt over her head. Her white bra was striped with red. So was her chest.</p><p>\u201cShower first,\u201d she said, and turned away from him. He watched her, his eyes on the sleek line of her back. Then his stare dropped to the soft sway of her hips and her truly phenomenal ass.</p> <p>He\u2019d loved that ass from the beginning. When he\u2019d watched her walk away from him on that hot, stinking street, he hadn\u2019t been able to look away from that sweet ass.</p><p>She paused at the bathroom door. Erin kicked off her shoes and shimmied out of her pants. \u201cThe shower\u2019s big enough for two, you know.\u201d</p><p>Not like he had to be told twice. He toed off the shoes Zane had dug up\u2014 from hell knew where\u2014and stripped as he stalked to the bathroom.</p><p>The rush of water poured into the tub. Erin had already turned on the shower. Wisps of steam began to appear in the air.</p><p>He hesitated as he watched her. She\u2019d climbed into the small space, and a clear pane of glass separated them. The water hit her, pouring over her flesh, soaking her hair and sliding in rivulets down her body.</p><p>Erin.</p><p>She soaped her skin. Lathered her stomach. Smoothed her hands over her breasts.</p><p>His mouth went bone dry.</p><p>Considerate. He could do it. Maybe.</p><p>The glass began to fog and when he lost his million dollar view, Jude jerked to action.</p><p>He grabbed the shower door and wrenched it open.</p><p>The blood was gone from her body. She was all soft, smooth flesh now.</p><p>Naked woman.</p><p>He eased in behind her. No way was she going to miss the raging hard-on, but if she didn\u2019t mind it poking her in that gorgeous ass\u2014</p><p>Erin turned toward him. The water beat down on them both. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>His lips took hers. Her tongue thrust into his mouth and stroked over his. Fuck considerate.</p><p>The vision of her on the ground, the wolf above her, flashed before his closed eyes, and he growled. His hands locked around her hips and he yanked her even closer.</p><p>His cock pressed against her. The feel of that smooth, wet skin was a stimulant that had him shaking.</p><p>Her nipples stabbed against his chest. He had to taste the tight, hard tips. Wanted them against his tongue. Jude ripped his mouth from hers. Lowering his head, he craned down and caught one sweet pink tip.</p><p>Her moan filled his ears even as his tongue stroked the peak. He\u2019d never get enough of her rich taste. The scent of her cream filled his nostrils.</p><p>She wanted him. He was dying for her.</p><p>His fingers pushed between them. Erin parted her thighs for him and Jude found her creamy heat. He drove one finger into her. Ready. She was more than ready.</p><p>So was he.</p><p>The water was too hot. No, maybe that was him.</p><p>Screw it.</p><p>Another finger plunged inside her and she moaned, a deep, guttural sound.</p><p>His cock jerked. Inside.</p><p>He backed her up against the side of the shower. He freed her breast, after one more greedy suckle, and his head rose as he stared down at her. Such golden eyes\u2014filled with lust and hunger.</p><p>His fingers pumped in her. Once. Twice. His thumb stroked her clit, just the way he knew she liked and when her breath panted, when her eyes flared, when he knew she was just about to come\u2014</p><p>Jude dragged his hand away from her.</p><p>\u201cJude!\u201d</p><p>Ah, that was what he liked. The sound of his name on her lips, grated with hunger, whispered with demand.</p><p>He lifted her up, positioning her so that he could see that perfect pink flesh.</p><p>Her back pressed against the tile. Her wet hair stuck to her face and neck.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>He drove his cock inside as deep as he could go\u2014and she came at that first plunge, her sex squeezing him and milking his erection as her delicate muscles convulsed. Her eyes seemed to go blind for a moment and her mouth opened wide.</p><p>He kissed her and kept plunging. Ignoring the pounding drive of the water, he sank into the warmth of her sex. Over and over. Thrusting hard and plunging deep.</p><p>Like nothing else. Nothing. Else.</p><p>Her sex held him tight, the flesh a greedy squeeze on his cock. Tight. So tight.</p><p>In. Out.</p><p>His groans filled the air. Mixed with her moans. The driving water caught them both.</p><p>She\u2019d come again, he knew she would, and he\u2019d be with her.</p><p>Her fingers latched onto his shoulders. Her claws bit into the skin.</p><p>Deeper. Harder.</p><p>Her legs were clamped around his hips, her heels digging into his ass.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Jude, again!\u201d</p><p>His thrusts were wild now as he shoved into that slick paradise. Again, again.</p><p>She bit him. Erin caught him at the curve of his shoulder and sank those sharp teeth into his flesh.</p><p>Jude erupted inside of her, coming on a wave of white-hot release that gutted him. His knees trembled, his spine prickled and his semen poured inside her.</p><p>Mate.</p><p>Her cry filled his ears and she came again, squeezing him so tightly with her legs and arms and sex. He loved that\u2014loved the way she held him, loved the sounds of her pleasure, the hot clasp of her body.</p><p>Loved her.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t even realize he\u2019d whispered the words until Erin\u2019s head snapped up and she clipped him in the chin. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Ben Greer stared up at the antebellum house on St. Charles Avenue. Erin wasn\u2019t there. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, really, but he\u2019d thought he might be able to catch her.</p><p>And apologize for being an ass.</p><p>He exhaled and turned away from the house. She was probably with that other asshole, the one with the icy blue eyes.</p><p>Eyes that only warmed when they were on her.</p><p>That guy\u2014Jude\u2014wasn\u2019t going to be letting Erin out of his life. And he wasn\u2019t going to be too keen on an ex-lover paying her a visit.</p><p>Too bad. Because he would see Erin again. The news she\u2019d told him and the things he\u2019d seen since then, yeah, they\u2019d made his head spin and ache like a bitch, but he was trying to play catch-up, fast.</p><p>And trying to figure out just what else he\u2019d been missing in this world.</p><p>His cell phone rang. He glanced at the number. Officer Langley. He answered the call even as he climbed into his car. \u201cYou got the clear on the Harper house?\u201d He\u2019d called his captain as soon as he\u2019d gotten the go-ahead from Antonio. They\u2019d needed to search the judge\u2019s house and see just what surprises were waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cCaptain Henderson\u2019s already inside.\u201d Disgust there, anger. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to wait for you to get back.\u201d</p><p>No, Henderson wouldn\u2019t. The guy would want as much glory as he could get.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe this place!\u201d Her voice rose with excitement. \u201cThe guy kept freaking diaries, journals of his kills.\u201d</p><p>Kills. The fingers of his left hand tightened around the steering wheel. \u201cHow many are we looking at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenderson says maybe ten, could be fifteen. The guys aren\u2019t even halfway through his place.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. How had they missed this? For all these years?</p><p>The judge had been good at pretending, and, apparently, killing.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you coming back? Henderson thinks we can close some old cases\u2014\u201d</p><p>Yeah, they\u2019d probably be closing almost all of Lillian\u2019s unsolved crimes going back for the last twenty years, right to the date when good old Harper had first appeared in the city. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d have to pay a visit to Katherine. Let her know that she and the boys were safe.</p><p>Then there would be other families to visit. Explanations to be made.</p><p>Explanations that wouldn\u2019t include a story about a man who could shift into a wolf. Not that anyone would believe that, anyway, not without proof.</p><p>Those dog hairs. They\u2019d been all over some of the vics. He\u2019d never even suspected the truth about them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d he said again and ended the call.</p><p>His eyes darted once more to Erin\u2019s dark house. He\u2019d be back. Erin had meant too much for him to just walk away with things shot to hell between them. They wouldn\u2019t be together again. Donovan would see to that. And so would Erin. The way she\u2019d watched the hunter\u2014 never looked at me like that.</p><p>The car\u2019s engine purred to life.</p><p>Maybe, maybe after this case, it would be time for his life to take a change. Maybe a new start. A new city.</p><p>Hell, maybe Antonio needed a new detective\u2014one who was learning the real score.</p><p>Werewolves. Who the hell would have thought those bastards were real? And sitting on court benches?</p><p>She\u2019d wrapped a towel around her body. After Jude\u2019s big confession, Erin had finally managed to snap her jaw back into place and now she paced next to the bed, trying to figure out what to say.</p><p>\u201cErin?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flew to him. He hadn\u2019t dressed. Ah, damn but he was sexy. Those broad shoulders. That chest with the rippling muscles and light covering of golden hair. Erin gulped as she stared helplessly at that flat stomach\u2014and that huge cock. Already fully erect again and so close. Hers for the taking if she just would reach out and touch\u2014</p><p>Focus!</p><p>She sucked in a deep breath. Okay, she\u2019d killed the wolf shifter tonight. She could handle this. Right? Right. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d</p><p>His hands were on his hips. His narrowed stare never left her face.</p><p>Okay. The knot she\u2019d hooked between her breasts seemed to dig into her flesh. \u201cYou said you loved me.\u201d Sure, lots of men were known to get a little wild and chatty during sex, but Jude wasn\u2019t most men. \u201cDid you mean it?\u201d</p><p>He took one long, gliding step toward her. Another.</p><p>She didn\u2019t retreat, and in seconds, he was right before her. \u201cHell, yeah, sweetheart, I meant it.\u201d</p><p>And that lump in her throat\u2014the one that appeared pretty often when he was near\u2014came back with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve loved you since that first hellish night at your place.\u201d Since then? \u201cYou were standing there, with the blood on your walls, and your chin was up and you were holding onto your control as tight as you could with both your hands.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed so she could speak. \u201cMy first instinct was to call you that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew you could count on me.\u201d</p><p>Should have been impossible. She wasn\u2019t the trusting sort, never had been, but, yes, she\u2019d known he\u2019d help her.</p><p>And he had.</p><p>Erin wet her lips. \u201cThere\u2019s something you...need to know about the judge.\u201d</p><p>He waited. Just waited with that steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cHe was my mother\u2019s lover. The man she left my father to be with.\u201d The man who\u2019d nearly killed them both. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, not until tonight.\u201d Because the surprises just kept coming for her. But she\u2019d been trying to make sense of things and maybe...\u201cMaybe I wasn\u2019t his mate, maybe he just got everything twisted in his mind because we look alike, maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a fingertip against her lips. \u201cHe was a fucked up bastard, sweetheart. I don\u2019t give a shit what he thought. You were never his.\u201d</p><p>His finger lifted, and her breath left her lungs on a soft sigh.</p><p>His blue stare held her gaze. \u201cSomething you need to know. This stopped being a case for me a long time ago.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m never supposed to get personal with the clients, but with you, I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d His fingers lifted and skimmed the edge of her jaw. \u201cYou were the case, and I would have fucking killed to keep you safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He almost had.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re human or wolf. You\u2019re mine, Erin. The woman I want. The only one I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, and he was hers.</p> <p>\u201cForget the past. Forget that twisted bastard and start over again\u2014with me. You might not love me yet, but give me a chance, sweetheart. The blood and hell are behind us. We can go slow now, date like humans, play normal.\u201d</p><p>Normal was losing its appeal. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want anymore,\u201d she told him and her hand brushed against his abdomen.</p><p>Jude sucked in a sharp breath and his pupils flared. \u201cErin, we can do this, we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried \u2018normal.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t really for me.\u201d Wished I\u2019d realized that sooner.</p><p>Silence for a beat, then, \u201cWhat is for you?\u201d</p> <p>A man who wasn\u2019t afraid of the darkness inside her. A man who had a wild side to match her own.</p><p>A man who\u2019d saved her from death.</p><p>A man who kissed her like she was his life.</p><p>\u201cYou are, Jude.\u201d She was taking a risk. One big-ass risk. But for him, for what they might have, she\u2019d do it. \u201cYou\u2019re the man I want.\u201d More than a man. So much more. \u201cThe one I love.\u201d</p><p>That scar, the thin line on his lip that she always wanted to lick, rose as his lips curved. \u201cYou mean that? Be sure, very, very sure, because I\u2019m not talking about a fling here. I\u2019m talking about forever.\u201d</p><p>Forever with her tiger. Sounded pretty good. She leaned toward him and used her tongue to trace that line on his lip. Then she said, \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d never thought about spending all her days with someone else before. With so many secrets, she hadn\u2019t even come close to trusting another man with her life.</p><p>But Jude knew all of her secrets, and he didn\u2019t care about her past. He didn\u2019t think she was broken or weak. When he looked at her, he looked at her with lust and hunger and\u2014</p><p>I can see it now\u2014should have seen it before.</p><p>Love.</p><p>Maybe she had seen it, but she\u2019d been afraid.</p><p>It was time to stop being afraid. Time to start living. Really living.</p><p>Her hand rose between their bodies and caught the knot of her towel. With one tug, she jerked it loose. The towel hit the floor.</p><p>His gaze brightened. Such a bright blue. The tiger was close.</p> <p>Good. She liked the beast and loved the man.</p><p>Life wouldn\u2019t be perfect for them, she knew that.</p><p>But screw perfect. She\u2019d take her tiger and she\u2019d take her wild ride.</p><p>And she\u2019d take the love she\u2019d found, forever.</p><p>\u201cFucking beautiful, sweetheart, fucking beautiful.\u201d His mouth pressed against her neck.</p><p>Her head fell back and the hunger rose. Jude.</p><p>She let her claws out and got ready to take her lover.</p><p>A man with more than a bit of the animal inside.</p><p>The perfect man for her. </p> </body></html>"]
