The dark gray clouds held it prisoner behind their foggy mist, and the day was cold and dreary at best.</p><p>Several times I wanted to dash out of the office, mumble a fabricated excuse for leaving to the secretary as I made my way through the waiting room, seeking sanctuary in the hallway. As much as I wanted to forget about the whole therapy session, the alternative was not acceptable. I desperately needed help, and it was time for me to face my fears. When I was a little girl, my mother always told me that courage is simply fear that has said its prayers. Over the years, I have tried to live by those words, and I managed to do so until this day.</p><p>My mind began to wander as I stood by the window, looking out at the cars splashing up rainwater with their tires, their windshield wipers going back and forth likependulums. It was early evening, not quite dusk, and the Friday work traffic was beginning to taper off in downtown Atlanta. Most people were already sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the interstate, ordering a round of drinks with coworkers at happy hour, or settling down in the safety of their own homes to catch the evening news on television.</p> <p>I had been lucky to get an appointment at all, since it was my first time there and I had just called pleading to see the doctor that morning. A friend of mine once mentioned Dr. Spencer in passing while I was at the salon getting my hair done. She was an avid fan of the doctor\u2019s, having used her services to get over the agony of being betrayed by her ex-husband and, ultimately, a stressful divorce. Never would I have conceived seeking her advice myself\u2014yet there I was.</p><p>Dr. Spencer\u2019s office looked about how I had visualized it: dim lighting, expensive leather furniture, including the infamous chaise longue where troubled souls revealed their deep, dark secrets, and a big cherrywood desk with a banker\u2019s lamp in the center. Bookshelves lined the walls, and a smorgasbord of degrees, certificates, and plaques adorned the wall between the two floor-to-ceiling windows behind the desk.</p><p>I noticed that my hands were trembling, even though the office was warm and toasty, a complete contrast to the cold October weather outside. She was taking too long, and my nerves were shot. I craved for just one puff of nicotine but had no cigarettes, since I had kicked the habit several years before during my first pregnancy.</p><p>Just as I was about to take the cowardly way out, walking over to the chaise and beginning to put on my black leather gloves, Dr. Spencer entered the office, making apologies for keeping me waiting. At first, I wasspeechless, and the words forming in my mind could not make their way to my lips.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Reynard,\u201d she said, more as a statement than a question, as she reached out a finely manicured hand to greet me.</p> <p>Hearing my name broke the self-induced trance. \u201cDr. Spencer. It\u2019s very nice to meet you.\u201d I gratefully took her hand and shook it. Just the warmth of her touch somehow comforted me. \u201cThank you for seeing me on such short notice.\u201d</p><p>She was making her way over to her comfortable leather desk chair as she spoke. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem, really. My secretary seemed to think your situation was quite urgent, and I\u2019m always glad to do whatever I can.\u201d I managed a slight smile as she continued. \u201cPlease, have a seat and make yourself at home.\u201d She motioned toward one of the two leather wing chairs facing the desk opposite her own.</p><p>Once she sat down at her desk, I was able to get a better-look at her. Dr. Marcella Spencer was a strikingly beautiful and classy woman. The thin lines on her face betrayed her age of about forty, yet she exuded the glow of a woman twenty years younger. Her deep chocolate, satiny skin reminded me of the fudge brownies my mother would prepare for the school bake sales to benefit the PTA, and her eyes looked like black pearls. They were hypnotic.</p><p>She wore an olive green business suit, accentuated by a sexy split up the back of the elongated skirt. The suit was even more alluring due to a cloister of overlaying matching buttons. A silk floral scarf worn around her neck added an air of class, and gold earrings gave the outfit a polished look.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mrs. Reynard.\u201d She started searching throughher center desk drawer for something, finally retrieving a gold-plated cigarette case and matching lighter. \u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Spencer, I have a request.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d She noticed the way my eyes were diverted to the cigarettes as she snapped open the case and pulled one of the long, slender brown cancer bandits out. \u201cWould you like a cigarette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Thank goodness, that\u2019s one addiction I no longer have to battle.\u201d I was trying my best to seem relaxed, but it wasn\u2019t working very well.</p><p>\u201cThen what can I do for you, Mrs. Reynard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be revealing all my hopes and dreams, my fears and nightmares, all the dragons I\u2019m battling, it would make me much more comfortable if you would call me Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s no problem, Zoe.\u201d A slight giggle escaped from her mocha-painted lips. \u201cThe majority of my patients prefer to keep our sessions on a first-name basis. Please call me Marcella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Marcella.\u201d Our eyes met. \u201cI\u2019ll do just that.\u201d</p><p>She started reaching around in a drawer again\u2014the right-hand top drawer instead of the center one. When she placed a pad, pen, and microcassette recorder on her desk pad, I almost catapulted out of my seat. The reality of being in a head doctor\u2019s office hit me, and I began to quiver all over again.</p><p>She obviously sensed my discomfiture. \u201cZoe, I\u2019m sorry if the tape recorder makes you feel uncomfortable, but I need to tape the sessions so I can go over them later for my notes. You understand?\u201d</p> <p>The way she was talking to me reminded me of my second-grade teacher, Mrs. Zachary, the old battle-ax. It made me laugh. \u201cSure, I understand. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m consideringbecoming a movie star or anything like that, so blackmail\u2019s out of the question.\u201d I started pulling at a loose string on the leg of my black pantsuit. \u201cBesides, don\u2019t you doctors have to take some sort of oath or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we most definitely do, and anything you tell me is strictly between you and I. It will never leave this room unless you request me to talk to someone, your husband for example, on your behalf.\u201d She pressed the record button.</p><p>\u201cMy husband!\u201d I uncrossed my legs, got up from the chair, and started pacing the heavily carpeted floor of her office. \u201cOh, God, what have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, would you like to lie down on the chaise? You don\u2019t have to. Only if it makes you comfortable.\u201d She never lost her cool. I guess she was used to nervous people.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d I sat back down in the chair. \u201cI\u2019m ready to begin. I know time is of the essence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, not exactly. You\u2019re my last client of the day, so we can talk as long as you like. You seem to be very distraught, and I would like to help you if I can.\u201d A kindness in her eyes halfway made me believe she was my best friend.</p><p>I blurted it out. \u201cMy husband, Jason, and I are having marital problems.\u201d My eyes dropped down to the floor. It was humiliating to even speak the words.</p><p>\u201cI see. Zoe, have you and Jason sought any form of counseling for your problems?\u201d</p><p>I began to laugh out loud then, but it was a laugh of dismay. \u201cNo, hell no! Jason doesn\u2019t even know we have any marital problems.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t even manage to look at her. I felt like a child awaiting punishment by my priest for committing a mortal sin, a sacrilege against the church. \u201cZoe, I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason doesn\u2019t know about any of the things I do. He hasn\u2019t a clue and if he ever found out, I would die.\u201d A single tear fell and began to creep down my left cheek. \u201cI could never imagine living in a world without him. That\u2019s how much I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t feel you can talk to him about your problem?\u201d She leaned forward, placed her cigarette in the ashtray, positioned her elbows on the desk, and intertwined her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNot this problem. Not now, not ever.\u201d I zeroed in on a tiny lint ball on the carpet. It appeared to be slightly moving every time I blinked my eyes.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Zoe. Let\u2019s try this a different way.\u201d She took another puff of her cigarette and then picked up the pen, preparing to take notes. \u201cWhen you mentioned earlier that nicotine was one addiction you no longer had to battle, it gave me the impression you\u2019re addicted to something else. Are you?\u201d</p><p>The tears started flowing. It took every ounce of selfcontrol I could muster not to start wailing like a banshee. \u201cYes! I\u2019m addicted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cAlcohol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you addicted to, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her finally through tear-drenched eyes and vocalized the word before my guilt forced me to suppress it. \u201cSex!\u201d</p><p>The look of astonishment on her face revealed her surprise. She was probably used to dealing with people addicted to cocaine, amphetamines, booze, food, but I got the distinct impression sexual addiction was a whole new ballpark for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarcella, I don\u2019t know where to begin. I have plenty of excuses for this, but no real reasons. I\u2019m so scared myaddiction to sex will destroy everything I have; my marriage, my relationship with my children, everything.\u201d I darted my eyes away from hers and concentrated on the smoke rising from the cigarette, now burned down almost to the filter.</p><p>She pulled a tissue out of the quilted dispenser on her desk and reached across the desk, handing it to me. I gladly took it and dabbed my gradually swelling eyes with it. \u201cWell, Zoe, the best place to start is always at the beginning, so why don\u2019t we commence there and work our way to the present.\u201d</p><p>I retreated into the bulky wing chair, letting my shoulders sink deep into the cushions, and crumpled the damp tissue in my hand. \u201cThe beginning . . .\u201d</p><p>chapterone</p> <p>The first time I ever laid eyes on Jason, I thought he was a junior-mack-daddy-wannabe that probably sat around on a Commodore 64 computer drinking grape Kool-Aid out of a peanut butter jar while watchingGood Times.I couldn\u2019t stand his ass.</p><p>The feeling was mutual, though, because our first physical interaction was when he gave me the finger and then spit on my saddle shoes. We were in the fifth grade, and from the day my parents and I drove up in our Ford station wagon, I knew he was trouble.</p><p>The movers got there about an hour after we did. I was sitting on the curb playing jacks when the big truck came flying around the corner, practically tilted on one side. I figured the driver was going to lose control of the truck for sure, and every valuable possession we owned would end up strewn all over the street.</p><p>Being the wonderful and unselfish little girl I was, my main concern was that my black Barbie didn\u2019t lose a limbor anything in the process. Table lamps, my father\u2019s eight-track tape player, and my mother\u2019s dishes were all replaceable, but the hell if I was going to be able to replace my Barbie. She was my pride and joy. I had even painted her fingernails with glittered polish and made her a sexy dress out of the red bandannas my mother made me wear to bed so my pressed hair wouldn\u2019t frizz up. Other than that, I was worried about my Snoopy Snow Cone Machine, and that was about it.</p><p>Jason and his parents lived directly across the street. He was outside that day trying to get some mail-order rocket to soar into the heavens. What a rip-off! The whole time I was watching him, the stupid thing never made it a yard off the ground. It was after about the hundredth try, when the movers had half the truck unloaded, that I noticed his ass rolling his beady eyes at me. I was using a piece of pink chalk to draw a makeshift hopscotch diagram on the street in front of my house when he approached me. His Kangol hat and leather bomber jacket made him look like a pint-size pimp. All he needed was a couple of gold teeth.</p> <p>\u201cGirl, you better quit! I\u2019m gonna tell my momma on you!\u201d I glared at him, smacking on a wad of Bubblicious like a cow.</p><p>\u201cLittle man, you better go play with your cheap broken-rocket and leave me the heck alone!\u201d</p><p>He got all the way up in my face then. \u201cGirl, don\u2019t you be ordering me around! I\u2019ll stomp your skinny behind into the concrete!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooooh, I amsoooooooscared!\u201d I rolled my eyes, chastising him.</p><p>Then, the miniature version of Shaft flipped me the finger, made a disgusting noise while he gathered saliva in his mouth, and then spit on my brand-new black-and-whitesaddle shoes. I beat his little ass too. We were the same age, but I had him by a good three inches in height. Milk wasn\u2019t due to start doing his body good for a couple more years.</p><p>Two of the moving men broke the fight up. I accidentally scratched one of the men on the nose because I was not about to stop fighting until the fat lady sang. That\u2019s when both our mothers came dashing out of our respective houses yelling, \u201cOh, my poor baby!\u201d and things like that. It was mad funny. They took over, throwing our heads into their heavy breasts and feeling all over us to make sure there was no permanent damage. Jason and I just glared at each other like two sumo wrestlers ready for round two.</p> <p>My mother helped me inside like I was handicapped. In actuality, I had never felt better in my life. I was the victorious one. Jason retreated to his house as well, and that was the end of it. My parents and I did just enough unpacking that night to get by, threw some sleeping bags on the living room floor, and munched down on some KFC. My Dad hooked up his eight-track, and I fell asleep listening to the harmonized singing of Earth, Wind and Fire. It was a Saturday.</p><p>I started school the following Monday and was anxious to get there to meet all the new kids. I rushed through a bowl of corn flakes</p><p>and caught about ten minutes ofThe Flintstonesbefore grabbing my tin lunch pail and running out the door to get to the bus stop on time.</p><p>The bus was about to pull off, and I was panting by the time I caught up to it in time to bang on the door, signaling the driver to stop. After I got on the bus, he asked me who I was. I explained I was a new student who had just moved. He snarled at me, his au naturel breath almost knocking me backward down the steps and back offthe bus, \u201cWell, you make sure your teacher gets your name put on my roster A-S-A-P \u2019cause I\u2019m not supposed to be picking up no knuckleheads I don\u2019t know! Now, find a seat, sit down, and shaddup!\u201d</p><p>I searched for an empty seat and couldn\u2019t find one in the front of the bus, so I started walking toward the back. All of the kids were checking me out, and some were even snickering. I noticed most of the seats were occupied, either by two girls or two boys, with the exception of the one in the far rear. A boy and a girl, obviously suffering from a severe case of puppy love, were seated there. He had his arm around her shoulder, and she was blushing from ear to ear.</p><p>I was ready to ask the driver if I could sit on the steps when I realized the only available seat was next to the horror film creature himself, Jason. He stopped playing with his GI Joe with the kung fu grip just long enough to smirk at me. I turned around and headed toward the front to beg the driver to ask someone to trade places with me, but he yelled at me again. \u201cYou taking too long! School starts in fifteen minutes! Now, sit yourbe-hindin a seat and shaddup!\u201d</p><p>I scurried my ass back to the seat and noticed Jason had placed his knapsack on the vinyl seat beside him. \u201cCould you move that, please?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, nor did he look at me, so I took the bag, threw it on his lap, and sat down. He was about to be a smart aleck, but I stopped him dead in his tracks. I rolled my eyes and gave him a head-from-side-to-side-with-afinger-snap combination. \u201cDon\u2019t say nothing to me, or I\u2019ll give you an even bigger beatdown than I did Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of the kids heard me and started giggling and taunting him. He just grabbed his knapsack, held it tight, and didn\u2019t look at me the rest of the way to school.</p><p>As if things weren\u2019t going bad enough, I get my class assignment from the principal\u2019s office, go to my homeroom, and his trick ass is the first face I see. Our homeroom teacher was Mrs. Williams, and she wasdispleasedto have a student transfer into her class in the middle of the fall term. She snarled at me too. Maybe it was my cherry-flavored lip gloss that was making everyone demonic toward me. \u201cLittle Miss Zoe,\u201d she started in on me as she looked over my school records, \u201chave a seat over there by the window and pay attention. You have a lot of making up to do in order to catch up to the rest of the class.\u201d</p><p>There was one glimmer of sunshine in my day. I didn\u2019t have to sit near Jason in homeroom. He was clear across the class, and that suited me just fine. He must have been a smart-ass with everybody because Mrs. Williams had his desk pushed right up against hers, several feet away from the rest of the class. Teachers always make the troublemakers sit up in their faces, and I remember thinking to myself, \u201cGoodie!\u201d</p><p>My first day at Benjamin Franklin Elementary was pretty uneventful. I made a couple of new friends, got to jump rope at recess, made a deformed clay vase in art class, and learned how to count to ten in Spanish. At lunch, I sat with this little girl named Brina that thought she was the next Diana Ross. I started to school her ass and tell her she couldn\u2019t be the next Diana Ross because I was. She would fling her hair back after every bite of her Twinkie and took special care making sure she didn\u2019t end up with a milk mustache when she rinsed it down. She spent the entire lunch period bragging about everything from her collection of ribbons for her hair to the straight A\u2019s she made on her last report card.</p><p>Jason did decide to get bold for a minute and started spitting half-frozen peas across the room at the back ofmy neck through a straw. He made the mistake of hitting the PE teacher, Mr. Lewis, in the cheek with one and was immediately dragged by the ear to the office.</p><p>When I got on the bus that afternoon, I was lucky enough to find a seat up front. I made sure I was one of the first ones on the bus, pushing a couple of wimpy boys out my way so I wouldn\u2019t have to sit next to Cousin It. Jason got on the bus about ten kids after I did. I stuck my tongue out at him and flipped him the bird. He tried to tell the bus driver on me, but all he got was an attitude. \u201cSit yourbe-hinddown, little man, and shaddup!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was playing hopscotch about an hour later when he came out of his house, stood on the curb on his side of the street, and started talking trash. \u201cYou know what? I hate you and I hope all your hair falls out and you get red pimples all over your face!\u201d</p><p>I stopped hopping on number six with my right foot up in the air, gave him an icy cold look, and decided to pay his ass back for the comment. \u201cOh, yeah? Well, I hate you too, and I hope the next time you shoot that cheap rocket of yours, it gets stuck up your behind!\u201d As an afterthought, I added, \u201cAnd I hope your itsy bitsy dang-alang falls off too!\u201d</p><p>I held up my pinkie finger to emphasize the point, and he left the curb, on his way over to my side of the street to finish off the fistfight we started the Saturday before. I was about to meet him in the middle when my mother opened up the front door. \u201cZoe, get in here and get washed up for dinner! Now!\u201d</p><p>Walking away, I placed my hands on my hips and strutted like Greta Garbo. I turned around and addressed him with my best voice imitation. \u201cNext time, Big Boy!\u201d</p> <p>I left his cross between Chewbacca fromStar Warsand Scooby Doo ass standing right there in the street withhis hands balled into fists and a look of hatred on his pathetic face.</p><p>I tried to keep my distance from Jason, other than in school, but my daddy wasn\u2019t making it easy for me. For some odd reason, the two of them bonded. Maybe it was because Jason\u2019s daddy was always working, or maybe it was because my daddy was good with his hands and Jason admired the way he fixed things around the house and made furniture out of wood as a hobby. Whatever it was, I didn\u2019t like or appreciate them being buddy-buddy at all.I was up in my bedroom one Saturday morning, sorting out my record collection and singing my ass off, when my mother yelled for me to come down. I had just taken \u201cThe Best of My Love\u201d by the Emotions off the turntable. I was about to pull my shades down and throw on \u201c Flashlight\u201d by Parliament Funkadelic and dance around my room, making circles on the walls and ceiling with the Maglite my daddy gave me when my mother interrupted my flow.</p><p>\u201cZoe, can you come down here for a second?\u201d Her voice carried well up the stairwell, and I knew she deliberately waited for a break in the music to call for me. It was a regular routine.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Momma. I\u2019ll be right down.\u201d I muttered under my breath while I gathered the dirty clothes out of my wicker hamper and tossed them in a laundry basket. It was laundry day, and I hadn\u2019t done a thing, so I lugged my clothes downstairs with me in order to save myself a return trip.</p><p>As soon as I turned the corner into the kitchen, my eyes lit up as I spotted the ice-cold pitcher of freshly squeezed lemonade and the cookie sheet of chocolate chipcookies with Hershey\u2019s Kisses hidden inside cooling on the stove.</p> <p>\u201cMomma, you made my favorite cookies!\u201d I let the laundry basket drop on the floor and gave my mother a huge, elephantine hug. \u201cYou\u2019re the most spantacular, bomb-diggity, coolest mother in the whole wide world.\u201d</p><p>She let out a slight giggle and then gently pushed my hands away. \u201cZoe, quit before you make me spill the lemonade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Momma.\u201d I licked my lips, dreaming about how delectable the cookies were going to taste hitting my throat, and decided to earn some brownie points so I could sneak a couple before dinner was ready. I retrieved my laundry basket and headed toward the basement steps. \u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and put my clothes on, and then maybe I can help you with the other cleaning like vacuuming or polishing the furniture.\u201d</p><p>My mother walked over to me, wiping her hand on the bib of her apron, and placed her right palm over my forehead, checking for a fever. \u201cIs this my child?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cYeah, Momma. I\u2019m just trying to do my share around here.\u201d</p><p>She gleamed at me. \u201cGood, do me a favor before you go downstairs.\u201d She took two glasses out of the cabinet and poured some lemonade in them. Then she put four cookies on a saucer and placed everything on a wooden tray. \u201cTake this lemonade and cookies out to the garage for your daddy and Jason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJason? What the hell, I mean heck, is he doing over here?\u201d I felt a sudden tension in the back of my neck, hotter under the collar than the pot of white potatoes my mother had simmering on the stove for dinner. \u201cWhy does he have to come over here all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, Miss Thing,\u201d my mother scolded me, \u201cJason isn\u2019t over hereall the time.Your daddy\u2019s helping him build a go-cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA go-cart?\u201d That did it! \u201cI asked Daddy to help me build a tree house like fifty million times, and he hasn\u2019t done it yet.\u201d</p><p>v style=\"text-align:center; padding: 15px 0;\"&gt; </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>chaptertwo</p><p>Three Years Later</p><p>Eighth Grade</p><p>By the time our eighth-grade-year came rolling around, milk was definitely doing a body good. Jason\u2019s body, that is. In the three years since our first meeting, or confrontation, whichever you prefer to call it, the hostility between us had continued. The only differences were physical developments. I\u2019d changed drastically from the tall, lanky, skinny girl who moved there and now had boobs and an onion ass. You know, the kind of ass that supposedly makes men cry when they see it? I may have grown another four or five inches in height but leveled off at five-foot-four. Jason, on the other hand, shot up like a tree. He was already six feet even and still growing.</p> <p>We were both thirteen, and puberty was barreling inon us like a ton of bricks. I had a crush on this boy Mohammed, a Muslim. I used to be so mesmerized when he would recite Islamic principles to me. In my eyes, he was arealman who respected his women, even when they were only thirteen. He was older than I was, sixteen, and had a car. I just knew I was the bomb, and all my girlfriends were envious. My parents hated him though. They dreaded the thought of a boy taking advantage of their little baby girl. Little did my parents or friends know, it was nothing like that. In fact, Mohammed respected metoomuch; the few times I tried to French-kiss him, he gave me a peck on my lips and sent me on my way.</p><p>Jason had himself a little hoochie mama. I\u2019ll never forget the anorexic beanpole bitch. Her name was Chandler, and she came from an upper-class family. Just because she wore the finest clothes and got her hair done every week at the beauty parlor, she thought she was the end-all and be-all. When I used to talk trash about her to Brina, who was my best friend by then, she would say, \u201cOh, girl, you just jealous! You want Jason for yourself! Just admit it, walk across the street and get that boy, because you are getting on my last nerve!\u201d</p><p>My response was always the same. \u201cHeck, no!\u201d</p><p>It was a Friday afternoon in October when I realized Brina had missed her calling as a child psychic. It was a beautiful day for that time of year. I was out in front of my house jumping rope with Brina, who caught the bus home with me to spend the night, and some of the other girls from the neighborhood. I had just jumped in between the ropes, doing the double-Dutch, when I tripped and fell on my knees. It wasn\u2019t lack of rope-jumping skills that made me take a tumble. It was Jason\u2019s fine ass mowing the lawn.</p><p>He was maneuvering his daddy\u2019s brand-spanking-new ride-on mower, and his shirt was off. I noticed hewas growing a goatee. His black, wavy hair, along with his hazel eyes, were sparkling in the sunlight.</p> <p>As I got up from the ground and wiped the dirt off my knees, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him. All the girls noticed and started chanting,</p><p>Zoe and Jason</p><p>Sitting in a tree</p><p>K-I-S-S-I-N-G</p><p>First comes love</p><p>Then comes marriage</p> <p>Then comes Zoe with a</p><p>baby carriage</p><p>Thank goodness he couldn\u2019t hear them over the engine of the lawn mower. I simply would have died. The strangest thing happened at that very moment and I know this is gonna be hard to believe. Looking at Jason and his muscles and his face and hiseverythingmade my panties wet. When I went inside, half-scared because nothing like that had ever happened before, I went to the bathroom and discovered I was bleeding. Somehow, my newly discovered puppy love for Jason brought about my first menstrual cycle. Ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>Later that evening, Brina and I went to a birthday party at our friend Eugene\u2019s house. Brina was spending the night with me so my mother could drop us both off and pick us up. Her mother was a single parent and had to work late that night.</p><p>The party was cool. However, I was depressed because Mohammed couldn\u2019t make it, and Jason was there with histhing.We didn\u2019t dance much because Eugene\u2019s parents were kind of old-fashioned and didn\u2019t want a whole lot of touchy-feely going on. They made one vitalmistake though: they bought Eugene the game Twister for his big day.</p><p>Somebody spiked the punch with grain alcohol and set the party off. I don\u2019t quite remember how it happened because I was tore up, but some time between watchingBeach Blanket Bingoon TV and playing charades, Jason and I ended up on the Twister mat together. Boy, was Chandler upset! I think she was a bit psychic as well, aware of something I wasn\u2019t. She knew Jason liked me just as much as I liked him.</p><p>I did figure it out during the game, though. Jason had to put a hand on red, I had to put a foot on blue, and his</p><p>pelvic area ended up pressed against my behind. Before the hand on the spinner landed on the next color, his dick was hard, and the gigantic, elephantine sanitary napkin my mother made me wear was twice as soaked as before the game. It wasn\u2019t soaked with blood, however, but with my pussy juice.</p> <p>I jumped up off the mat in the middle of the game\u2014 not because I didn\u2019t enjoy the way his hard dick was feeling, but for fear he would somehow catch wind of the sanitary napkin. The damn thing was so big, I thought for sure he would discover it, and I was so embarrassed.</p><p>My mother couldn\u2019t get there fast enough to pick us up, and when she finally did, I flew out the house like a bat out of hell, wanting to put the whole episode behind me. We went back to my house, and Brina was brushing my long, light brown hair that reached my bra strap. \u201cZoe, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think there\u2019s anything wrong with me?\u201d I snapped at her and immediately regretted my tone. Even though Brina was my best friend in the whole world, I was ashamed to tell her what had happened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird, is all!\u201d She pinned myhair up with a giant hair clip. \u201cIs it because you started your period? Don\u2019t sweat that. I\u2019ve been having them for almost two years now, and they\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>I got up from the padded bench of my vanity table, cut off the lamp on my nightstand, and got into my double canopy bed. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. Let\u2019s just get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Brina got in the bed and instantly fell asleep, since she was tipsier than I was. Girlfriend put a hurting on that punch. For me, sleep would not come easy, and an hour later, I was sitting in the window seat and looking up at the moon and stars. I began to imagine Jason looking at the same moon and same stars from his bedroom window, but for all I knew, he was out necking with Chandler. The mere thought of him touching her was devastating. It was hard to imagine falling for my archenemy. That\u2019s exactly what happened, though, and I made a promise to myself that somehow, some way, I would win his heart and make him mine. The sun was coming up when I snuck back in the bed with Brina, pretending to have been there the entire time.</p><p>The very next day, I forgot all that nonsense about winning Jason\u2019s heart. I think it had something to do with the way he was sucking his teeth and smirking at me when I came out of the house and started down the street to the corner market a few blocks away.I ignored him and kept walking. I winced when I heard him approaching fast behind me on his skateboard, yet another item my father had helped him make.</p><p>\u201cZoe, wait up, girl!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes for my benefit alone, since my back was still facing him. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry, Jason!\u201d</p><p>I could hear him speeding up even faster then. \u201cI said hold up, girl!\u201d</p><p>I swung around and glared at him. Damn, he was fine! \u201cWhatchu want, nucca?\u201d</p><p>He caught up to me and used his heel to kick his skateboard up into his hand, placing it underneath his arm. The sunlight hitting up against his eyes was nothing short of mesmerizing. I wanted him, and at the same time I couldn\u2019t stand his ass. I was madconfuzzled.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did, dummy,\u201d I hissed at him and folded my arms, repeating the eye roll so he could see it this time.</p><p>He sighed in frustration. \u201cAight, damn, can I ask you another question then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did, dummy,\u201d I reiterated, giggling at the ingenuity of my comment.</p><p>He glared at me like he wanted to slap me. \u201cYou\u2019re a trip, girl!\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the red-and-yellow Swatch watch I was sporting because it matched the red stirrup pants and yellow baby-doll shirt I had on perfectly. \u201cAre you going to ask this question sometime today? Because I have things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you headed? Over Brina\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrina\u2019s? Brina lives like fifty million blocks away. I\u2019m not walking all the way over there. Nucca, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where you headed?\u201d</p><p>For the first time, I noticed how deep Jason\u2019s voice had gotten. Boy, was I getting overheated! \u201cTo the store to get sumptin\u2019 I need.\u201d Jason laughed like I had just told an Eddie Murphy joke. \u201cWhat\u2019s so damn funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he chuckled. \u201cI was just wondering if thisthingyou need from the store has to do with last night and what happened at the party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSay what?\u201d I wondered what the hell he was talking about, so I asked him, \u201cWhat the hell you talking \u2019bout?\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at the sidewalk, breaking eye contact. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice while we were playing Twister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotice what?\u201d I was getting pissed off because I realized my worst fears were coming true.</p><p>He looked back up at me and blurted it out. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have on one of those sanitation napkins last night?\u201d</p> <p>That did it! I slapped his ass right across his skank face and started walking again. \u201cFirst of all, nonaya damn business, and secondly, it\u2019s sanitary napkin, not sanitation napkin, dummy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you hit me?\u201d I could hear the tremor in his voice, but his ass deserved it. \u201cYou always hittin\u2019 some damn body, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>I turned around and flipped him the finger. \u201cWhy you worried about what I have between my legs?\u201d I immediately regretted that statement the moment it left my lips. It sounded so, so, so sexual.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNow that you mention it, I do have another question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw hell, what now?\u201d</p> <p>He hopped back on his skateboard to catch up to me. \u201cCan I ask it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did, dummy!\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a hold of my right elbow, and I got weak in the knees. \u201cLook at me, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>I looked. Damn, damn, damn, he was fine! \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo witchu where?\u201d Aw dayummmmmmm, he was actually asking me to be his girl, his woman, his hoochie.</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean, Zoe.\u201d His frustration with my antics was obvious. \u201cSo do you or don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a woman already, and I have a man.\u201d Hestarted looking down at the sidewalk again, muttering something I couldn\u2019t quite make out. \u201cBesides, you talking about us kissing and all that stuff?\u201d</p><p>He gave me a quick peck on the lips but never made eye contact. I was likely to faint. \u201cYeah, kissing and going places together and you know?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows at me and I knew he meant the wild thang. \u201cEwwwwwww, hell no! Hell no, I don\u2019t want to go with you!\u201d</p><p>I stormed off, mad. Not because he asked me, and not because I didn\u2019t want to. I was mad because it seemed apparent he and Chandler had been going at it. The mere thought of it made my stomach turn.</p><p>I heard him yell behind me. \u201cWhatever, Zoe! I was just kidding with your skeeger ass anyway!\u201d</p><p>I turned around and laughed in his face. \u201cIt\u2019sskeezer,dummy! Learn how to talk, why don\u2019t you!\u201d</p><p>I picked up my pace and rubbed the edge of my training bra through my shirt to make sure the $3.00 my mother had given me to buy some more of those elephantine sanitary napkins hadn\u2019t fallen out.</p> <p>chapterthree</p><p>Have you ever been so utterly embarrassed and ashamed that you wanted to crawl up in a hole and die?</p><p>That\u2019s exactly how I felt the following Monday at George Washington Carver Middle School. Even though it was a Monday, I affectionately renamed it Hellday.</p><p>Hell! That\u2019s what Jason tried to put my ass through that day. He went to school, obviously still feeling the sting from my refusal to go with his ass, and told everyone he could get to listen that I was on my period.</p><p>Looking back, I realize it wasn\u2019t such a horrible insult. After all, periods are periods, and all women have them just like all women have coochies in the first place. Periods are a fact of life.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t relate to that philosophy in the eighth grade, though. For me, it was a traumatic experience to have all the boys pointing at me while I walked down the crowded hallways between classes.</p><p>The girls weren\u2019t any better, giggling and snickering behind my back like they didn\u2019t already have them on a monthly basis or, for the late bloomers, weren\u2019t ever planning on getting them. The nerve of the heifers!</p><p>By the time lunch period rolled around, I was doing battle with a migraine and contemplating taking Jason out in the parking lot so I could whup his ass in front of the entire student body.</p><p>I got my tray of slop. That\u2019s exactly what school lunches were\u2014slop. One of the local network news stations did an investigative report about school lunches and discovered that most prisoners in the United States ate more nutritious meals than schoolchildren. That\u2019s a damn shame, but I deemed it a true statement, even though I had never seen the inside of a penitentiary.</p><p>Usually, I sat right</p><p>smack in the center of the cafeteria, but not that day. I took my ass over to an empty table in the far corner, hoping I would become invisible to my peers.</p><p>After taking a bite of the cheeseburger I had selected over the pepperoni pizza and egg salad sandwich, I spit it back out in a napkin. I couldn\u2019t even deal: it tasted more like a rat than a cow. I wondered if the city of Atlanta had devised a sneaky, underhanded method to get rid of the rodent overpopulation.</p><p>I glanced over toward the serving station and noticed Brina standing there, surveying the room in an effort to locate me. We didn\u2019t have any morning classes together that semester, but we always ate lunch together come hell or high water. I stood up just long enough to flail my arms in the air. Once I saw her acknowledge my presence with a nod, I quickly sat back down.</p><p>She came over and plopped her tray down across from me, throwing her legs over the bench one at a time to sit down.</p><p>\u201cZoe, why are you sitting all the way over here?\u201d she asked, confused. \u201cEveryone else is at our regular table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard?\u201d I whispered, diverting my eyes from hers and trying to hold back a tear.</p><p>\u201cHeard what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s trick ass has been going around school telling everyone I\u2019m on my period and that I had on a sanitary napkin at the party Friday night,\u201d I blurted out, ashamed to even speak the words.</p><p>Brina started falling out laughing. She laughed so hard, she had to take a swig of her iced tea to prevent herself from hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cThis shit\u2019s not even funny, Brina,\u201d I hissed, ready to smack her ass for betraying me. If I was upset, she damn well better be too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she stated adamantly, holding her stomach-and sucking in air in an effort to calm down. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re the only girl in school with a period. Like I told you the other night, I\u2019ve been having them for two years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you,\u201d I said, smacking my gums and crossing my arms over my chest. \u201cBesides, when you started your periods, you didn\u2019t have a knucklehead running around school tellingevery damn body!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right! My bad! Jason should be ashamed of himself for doing this to you! I\u2019m going to tell him off when I see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay! That\u2019s my job! I\u2019m going to fix his ass but good!\u201d A look of worry overshadowed Brina\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Brina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate it when people tell me nothing. Now tell me what you\u2019re thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that when I started my period, I was bigtimeembarrassed too. That\u2019s why I never mentioned it, even to you. The only person I ever told was my mother so I could get some napkins from her. She didn\u2019t care though. She was drunk that night. She just threw a bag of Stayfree at me and slammed her bedroom door.\u201d</p><p>I was speechless. I had become suspicious about Brina\u2019s mother and alcohol about a year before but never asked any questions. This was the first time Brina had come straight out and admitted it.</p><p>I reached over the table and took her hand. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied abruptly, tearing the plastic wrapper off her utensil packet. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about!\u201d</p><p>I decided to leave well enough alone. I sat there pretending to be enthralled in my side dish selection of succotash, but I was really trying to think of another subject. I wanted to discuss anything except Jason, and Brina wanted to discuss anything except her mother.</p><p>\u201cZoe, what\u2019s up, gal?\u201d I whiffed the air and knew who it was without even looking over my shoulder. Could the day get any worse? Hell yeah! It just did! \u201cUmph, umph, umph, you\u2019re just lookin\u2019 too fine for words, baby!\u201d</p><p>Lyle Harris was by far the ugliest boy in school. We\u2019d never taken a vote on the issue, but trust me; his ass was ugmo. He was skinny, short, high yella with red zits all over his face, and thought he was an extra for the movieHouse Partywith the high-top fade he was trying to sport. On top of all that, he stank big-time. You could smell his ass coming a mile away. He was in my geometry class, and the teacher, Mr. Wilson, always had to crack a window during sixth period to try to air out some of Lyle\u2019s au naturel body fumes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even give him the courtesy of an obligatory glance. \u201cWhat you want, Lyle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat down beside me on the bench, and I almost passed the hell out. Brina started holding her nose. I wanted to puke.</p><p>\u201cListen here, Zoe,\u201d he said, rubbing his grubby fingers up and down my right arm. \u201cI heard you a woman now. Arealwoman.\u201d</p><p>I knocked his hand away. \u201cKeep your paws off of me, Rin Tin Tin!\u201d</p><p>Brina giggled. So did I.</p> <p>He threw his hands out, and the central air-conditioning-system got a hold of his underarm stench, redirecting it my way.</p><p>\u201cAight, you wanna play me like that huh?\u201d</p><p>I igged him.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to holla at you. I was wondering if you wanted to go to a movie or sumptin\u2019 this weekend. That newLethal Weaponjoint is coming out, and I figured you might want to check it out.\u201d</p><p>I glared at him then, though that was a task. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious? Besides, your armpits are already hollering at me. Those bad boys are screaming!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m dead serious.\u201d He grinned at me, and I almost lost my stomach contents for real. His gums were jet black. \u201cI want to get to know you better wit\u2019 your fine ass!\u201d</p><p>Brina fell out laughing.</p><p>\u201cLyle, why do you have to pick today of all days to get up in my face?\u201d I snapped at him. \u201cI\u2019m not even in the mood for your drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I heard you a woman now. I figured by this weekend you might be off those pads, and we can do a little sumptin\u2019 sumptin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>That did it! He obviously didn\u2019t know who he was messing with. I picked up my tray and threw the whole thing at his ugly-ass face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell you go and do that shit for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI warned you to leave me alone!\u201d I got up from the table. \u201cCome on, Brina! Let\u2019s jet! The air is mighty foul around here!\u201d</p><p>We walked away from him. People were teasing his ass with no mercy. I felt no remorse. He asked for it.</p><p>We were halfway out of the cafeteria when I spotted Jason and Chandler sitting at a table with their clique.</p><p>\u201cHold up, Brina,\u201d I said, yanking Brina backward by the elbow. \u201cI have something to take care of!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw hell, Zoe!\u201d Brina tried to drag me in the opposite direction. \u201cJust drop it already. Jason has had his fun, and the day is halfway over. By tomorrow, everyone will forget all about it.\u201d</p><p>As we approached their table, I heard Chandler bragging about trying out for the cheerleading squad later that week. She was positive not only that she would make it but that she would be the captain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so pretty, I know Miss Weeden will pick me as the captain,\u201d she boasted. A couple of the other girls at the table looked away, probably wanting to slap the hell out of her. I felt the same way. She was the most uppity Miss Thang in the school. Most tolerated her, but very few truly liked her. She leaned over and pecked Jason on the lips. \u201cBaby, will you come to the tryouts and cheer me on? I know you\u2019ll make the captain of the basketball team again this year. We\u2019ll be the top couple in the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I dunno,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cI really need to get some things done around the house Wednesday afternoon. My mom\u2019s been after me to sandpaper and repaint the shutters for months now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t your daddy do it?\u201d Chandler pouted, hoping to win Jason over.</p><p>\u201cYou know my daddy always works late,\u201d Jason replied. \u201cBesides, I like doing things with my hands. Zoe\u2019s daddy has taught me a lot about building things.\u201d</p><p>Chandler smacked her lips and rolled her eyes. \u201cZoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied. Everyone noticed my arrival at the same time. All eyes were on me, but my eyes were drilling a hole through Jason\u2019s skank ass.</p><p>Brina made one last attempt to bring me back to my senses. \u201cCome on, Zoe,\u201d she insisted, yanking on my arm. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even worth it. You might get in serious trouble. Lyle\u2019s already fuming. You and Jason can settle this at home.\u201d</p><p>Jason stood up, trying to strike an intimidating pose, and inquired, \u201cYou have a problem with me, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to call him every name in the book. I wanted to cuss his ass out, but when he looked at me, all I could think about was how luscious his lips looked. I slapped him clear across them.</p><p>Chandler jumped up. \u201cOh, no, you didn\u2019t just hit my man!\u201d</p><p>Jason held his hand over his mouth. \u201cZoe, I\u2019m sick of you and your damn hitting! What did I tell you Saturday?\u201d</p><p>I saw a window of opportunity and decided to take it. \u201cYeah, what did you tell me Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaturday? You saw her on Saturday?\u201d</p><p>Chandler asked, a perplexed expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we live right across the street from each other. Remember?\u201d He darted his eyes back and forth from me to her, probably trying to decide which one to deal with first. Then he stared me down with those sexy-ass eyes of his. \u201cI told you to stop hitting all up on me Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas this before or after you asked me to be your girlfriend? I don\u2019t quite recall.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s mouth dropped open. He was busted. Chandler looked like she was struggling for her next breath, and her stylish girlfriends didn\u2019t have a clue what to say. I had embarrassed her ass but good.</p><p>Brina intervened. \u201cJason asked you to go with him?\u201d She started blushing from ear to ear, like he had asked her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me that,gurlllllllllllll!\u201d</p><p>Cordell, Jason\u2019s best friend, decided to throw his two cents in. \u201cYou asked that gurl to go with you, man?\u201d He looked at Chandler, who still looked lost, like a whore in church, and guffawed. \u201cAwwwww snap,he played you big-time, Chandler.\u201d</p><p>I was anticipating Jason would deny the whole thing so I could recite the conversation word for word and truly humiliate him. Much to my amazement, he did no such thing.</p><p>\u201cIdidask you to go with me, and you turned me down, right?\u201d</p><p>Jason and I just gaped at each other while Cordell kept jonnin\u2019 Chandler. \u201cDang, I always knew those two liked each other!\u201d</p><p>I debated about what to say. I wanted to tell him I did long to be his hoochie, partially because I wanted to teach Chandler a lesson, but mostly because I was feenin\u2019 for his touch.</p><p>The words left my mouth before I thought them through clearly. \u201cOf course I told your skank ass no!\u201d</p><p>He stared down at the floor, obviously hurt. I wanted to reach out and caress his cheek so badly, but I remembered Lyle and his \u201cI hear you a woman now\u201d speech.</p><p>\u201cI told you no, and you decided to go spread my business all over the school,\u201d I persisted. \u201cThat was very childish, even for you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zoe,\u201d he pleaded, unable to look me in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I was just furious is all.\u201d</p><p>To this very day, I don\u2019t know where they came from, but the next second tears were gushing down both of my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI hate you, Jason. Just stay the hell away from me!\u201d I started to back away from him, almost tripping over someone\u2019s backpack on the floor by the table. \u201cStay away from me! Stay away from my house and stay away from my daddy! I hate your guts!\u201d</p><p>I ran out of the cafeteria with Brina fast on my heels. I sought refuge in the girls\u2019 bathroom, standing over one of the sinks crying while Brina rubbed the small of my back.</p><p>Neither one of us said anything for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cZoe, I realize you\u2019re upset, but you know and I know that Jason wants to be with you. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that you feel the same way, so why not stop all this foolishness and get togetherfinally?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her reflection in the mirror through tear-drenched eyes. \u201cJason goes with Chandler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he made it painfully obvious just now that he would dump her in a heartbeat for you. She\u2019s probably out there going off right now on his ass.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, picturing it in my mind. I hoped she was getting him good in front of everyone. He deserved it after what he did to me.</p><p>\u201cBrina, have you forgotten that I go with Mohammed?\u201d I asked, realizing I almost forgot about him my damn self.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget, but you and Jason belong together. Drop that zero and get yourself a hero!\u201d</p><p>I laughed. No, she wasn\u2019t using that played-out line on me.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not feeling too good right now,\u201d I confessed, turning to face Brina. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go see the school nurse and tell her I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>Brina brushed the strand of hair back that was dangling in my face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just stomach cramps,\u201d I replied. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m on my period.\u201d</p><p>We both fell out laughing. I felt much better by the time Brina headed to her afternoon classes, but I went to the nurse and faked sick anyway. I\u2019d endured enough drama for one day.</p><p>My mother picked me up out front, a look of worry shadowing her face. \u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d she inquired, rubbing my arm after I got in the car. \u201cYou want to go see Dr. Hill?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMomma, it\u2019s not that big of a deal!

I\u2019ll fix you some hot soup and a pot of tea with lemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Momma!\u201d I turned up the radio, pushing the preset buttons until I found some decent music, as opposed to that classical crap my mother always listened to in the car.</p><p>\u201cNo problem, baby.\u201d She patted my knee as she pulled out from the parking lot. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day my baby gets her first period. This is a big event.\u201d</p> <p>I thought about Jason\u2019s big-ass mouth broadcasting it and muttered, \u201cIf you only knew.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening, my daddy brought up a dinner tray with roast beef, potatoes, carrots, and greens. \u201cHey, princess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Daddy!\u201d I was so happy to see him. He always enhanced my mood. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine,\u201d he replied, setting the tray down on my nightstand. \u201cWe\u2019re having a bit of trouble getting the beams situated for the top floor, but we\u2019ll get it straight in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool!\u201d I looked over at the tray and noticed a bunch of small daffodils crammed beside the plate. \u201cOh, Daddy, you picked me flowers!\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled, flashing his cinematic smile at me. \u201c Actually, those are from Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason! That trick ass!\u201dI covered my mouth, realizing my slip.</p><p>\u201cZoe, what did I tell you about using profanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Daddy,\u201d I pouted. \u201cJason just makes me plain ole sick sometimes. You have no idea what he did to me today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. He told meeverything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d</p> <p>My daddy nodded, trying to suppress a smile, and I wastooooooooothrough. My first period was becoming the event of the freakin\u2019 century. I didn\u2019t even want my daddy to know I had one.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh, sounds like another lover\u2019s spat to me.\u201d</p><p>I popped him gently on the arm. \u201cI hate him, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate is a very strong word.\u201d He picked up the flowers and held them out to me. \u201cBesides, he can\u2019t be all that bad. He sent me up here with these flowers and his apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed! Jason\u2019s extremely sorry about spreading your private business all over the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t even want to hear all that,\u201d I hissed. \u201cHe can just forget about me ever speaking to him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo question!\u201d</p><p>My daddy pulled a crumpled piece of notebook paper out of his shirt pocket and set it down on the blanket beside me. \u201cHe must be a mind reader then, because he wrote you a letter.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say another word. I couldn\u2019t find any words to say. Part of me was dying to read the note in hopes it would declare his love for me. The other part was afraid it would be disappointing.</p><p>My daddy kissed me on the cheek and headed toward the door. \u201cGoodnight, sweetheart!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>He hesitated once he got out into the hallway. \u201cBy the way, if youshoulddecide to talk to Jason, he and I will be down in the garage for the next couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>I almost jumped out of my skin.\u201cHe\u2019s over here? Now? In this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, he sure is. We\u2019re working on that china cabinet I promised your mother for the dining room.\u201d</p><p>With that, he closed the door, and I heard his footsteps going down the stairs.</p><p>I sat there for a few moments, trying to drown myself in the episode ofMiami Vicethat was on.</p><p>As fine as Phillip Michael Thomas was back in those days, it was no use. I had to know what was in the note. I slowly unfolded the paper, smoothing out the creases as I went along.</p><p>Zoe,</p><p>I know you\u2019re pissed at me. I was wrong to do what I did. Please forgive me. It\u2019s just that I like you so much, and you hurt my feelings the other day. You probably don\u2019t care, since you\u2019ve hatedme since you moved here. Chandler was mad at me today. I told her the truth though. I told her I wanted to go with you. She said I should stay with her because you would never date me anyway. Is that true? Are you still seeing that Mohammed dude? The Muslim with the raggedy car? If so, I\u2019ll leave you alone. Either way, please accept my apology. I\u2019ll see you at school tomorrow, and maybe we can go roller-skating or to a movie this weekend. I can ask my mother to drive us and pick us up.Love Always, Jason</p><p>Now, you might find</p><p>this hard to believe, but I swear I didn\u2019t take a breath for at least five minutes. Jason and I were going to be together. Fugg a Mohammed! Fugg a Chandler! I was going to accept his apology and tell him I wanted to go with him the very next day, or there wasn\u2019t a dog in the entire state of Georgia.</p><p>chapterfour</p><p>All of the dogs must have gone farther south with the birds, because I never got the opportunity to accept Jason\u2019s apology. I fully intended to. I put on the most provocative, hoochified outfit I could find in my thirteen-year-old closet. It was a tight pink leotard with some form-fitting black capri pants. I went to school the next day on a mission to get my man, Chandler or no Chandler.</p><p>I planned to pull Jason aside at lunchtime and tell him I did want to go with him, wherever the hell it was he wanted to go when he\u2019d asked me to go with him. I sprayed on some cotton-candy-scented body spray, put on some cherry-flavored lip gloss, and pinned my hair up so I would look older and sexier. I even folded my white bobby socks down as far as they would go so I could show off a little leg.</p><p>I was on my way to the cafeteria to put my plan into action when the guidance counselor, Mr. Turner, grabbedme gently by the wrist and asked me to follow him to his office. I couldn\u2019t imagine what he wanted to talk to me about. Then I narrowed it down to throwing the tray of food in Lyle\u2019s stinky face the day before. I was all set to defend myself, but I froze when we walked into his office and my mother was sitting in one of the brown metal chairs, crying her eyes out.</p><p>I only half-listened while she explained my father\u2019s death to me. I remember hearing the wordssteel beamandconstruction siteandaccidental release. It didn\u2019t seem real. After all, my father had brought a tray of food up to my room just the night before, teasing me about Jason and delivering his note. I remembered his smile, what he had on, what he smelled like, everything. Yet in the blink of an eye he was gone, and my life would never be the same.</p><p>Ironically, the death of my father is what finally bridged the gap between Jason and I. Jason had become extremely attached to my father during the years he got to know him and was crushed when he heard the news. He came over to our house that evening, and while all the adults tried to comfort my mother, he comforted me. We sat out on the front stoop, and he held me for what seemed like hours. We both shed tears all over each other and talked about the happy memories we had of my father. Jason said he was determined to finish the china cabinet he and my father had been building together. He kept his word a month later, and my mother still cherishes it to this very day.</p><p>The day of my father\u2019s funeral was rainy and dreary. Several of his friends and family members came from near and far. It was all a blur to me. I barely made it through the service, especially when his brother, my uncle Winslow, a minister from Houston, gave the eulogy. Hetalked extensively about their childhood antics. Hearing things about my father that I never knew saddened me to the point of complete withdrawal. Jason held one of my hands at the graveside, and Brina held the other one. When it was time to leave in the limousine with my mother and the rest of my father\u2019s immediate family members, I let go of their hands and never looked back. I just wanted to be alone in my misery.</p><p>For months I kept to myself whenever possible. I would come straight home from school; I dropped out of all of my extracurricular activities and instructed my mother to tell Brina, Jason, and whoever else I was busy when they called. It was Jason who was the persistent one, though. He wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. He often came over to visit me, and we were actually civilized to one another. It was a great feeling. He was the only person my age I remotely felt like being around\u2014probably because I was head over heels in love with him.My mother was now a single parent, just like Brina\u2019s mother, and had to take on a second job to make ends meet. I felt so bad about it, but I wasn\u2019t old enough to get a real job. I baby-sat whenever I could for people in the neighborhood. Being around infants and toddlers was cool because they didn\u2019t ask me a lot of questions. I made yet another promise to myself. I swore one day I would take care of my mother and make sure money and comfort were always present in her life.</p><p>Summer came, and I was sitting on the front porch steps one night. It was a clear night, and the stars were so beautiful. I was always fascinated with stars, and my eyeswere so affixed on them that night, I didn\u2019t see Jason approaching me until he was less than ten feet away from me.\u201cWhat are you doing, Zoe?\u201d He sat down on the step below the one I was sitting on and leaned his elbow beside my thigh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooking at the stars.\u201d I moved over on the step a little,-away from his hand, because even a slight touch from him made me yearn for him. \u201cSometimes I close my eyes and imagine myself floating up among the stars. I feel weightless, and it\u2019s such a weird feeling. Yet, it makes me feel so relaxed. It\u2019s incredible!\u201d</p><p>I darted my eyes down to his, and noticed he was looking at me like I had lost my fucking mind. \u201cSorry, Jason. I know I must sound plum foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. Tell me more about them, Zoe.\u201d He sensed my hesitation. \u201cPlease, I really want to learn astronomy.\u201d</p><p>For the next ten or fifteen minutes I pointed out every constellation I could recognize to Jason, including the Little Dipper, Big Dipper, and Ursa Minor. I was surprised he actually seemed to be interested in them.</p> <p>\u201cYou see that bright star over there? The North Star?\u201d I pointed as if my fingertip could land directly upon it.</p><p>\u201cYes, I see it. It\u2019s beautiful. Just like you.\u201d I started blushing and placed my hands between my thighs, clamped them shut, and pretended to look down the street at an approaching car.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if that\u2019s my mother.\u201d I knew it wasn\u2019t but was trying to change the subject. I wasn\u2019t even prepared for the \u201cbeautiful\u201d comment. Once the car passed, I continued, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not her. Anyway, I renamed the star after my father, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jason eased up and sat on the same step as me, pressing his leg against mine. I instantly started shaking, and my knee started going back and forth. Years later, as I began to understand my sexuality better, I realized I was deliberately causing friction on my clit because I was horny. \u201cOne day, I\u2019m gonna have a little boy and name him Peter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we can make him together.\u201d He reached over and started rubbing his fingers up and down my leg. I tried to jump up, but he stopped me and put his arm around me. \u201cDon\u2019t run away from me, Zoe. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d I was frozen like a Popsicle. I couldn\u2019t move right at that moment if my life depended on it.</p><p>\u201cWhich one of those stars is ours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOurs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ours. Let\u2019s pick a star and make it our own special-star. For always!\u201d I looked him in his sexy hazel eyes and wanted to kiss him so bad but didn\u2019t have the nerve. \u201cHow about that one over there? You see it?\u201d</p><p>I had no idea which one he meant, \u2019cause I was too busy looking at him. \u201cYes!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCool! So that\u2019ll be our star. Jason and Zoe\u2019s star.\u201d</p><p>The kiss began so fast, it took me off guard. It was the first French kiss of my life, and I will never forget it. His tongue was thick and soft and penetrated my mouth after practically having to pry it open. Once I was able to relax, it was great, outstanding, miraculous, the bomb diggity.</p><p>\u201cWanna go inside your house?\u201d Jason stopped kissing me abruptly after a few moments and made the suggestion. I just sat there with my mouth hanging open and his sweet saliva all over my lips. He stood up, took me by the hand, and starting pulling me up to my feet. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside awhile.\u201d</p><p>We were standing in the doorway, tonguing the hell out of each other, with my arms over his shoulders and his around my hips, inching me farther into the house, his hard dick pressing up against my wet pussy through our jeans, when my mother pulled into the driveway.</p><p>We tried our best to play it off. Jason put his hands in his back pockets, and I crossed my arms in front of me, trying to pretend like we were just standing there having a casual conversation. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later, Zoe,\u201d Jason blurted out as he began to walk away. He waved to my mother as she was getting out of the car and managed a soft, \u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Mom! Have a good day at work?\u201d I moved out of the doorway so she could get in with the bag of groceries she was carrying. \u201cLet me take that to the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d She handed me the bag, and I started making my way toward the kitchen. I almost made it too without getting busted. \u201cBy the way, Zoe, I saw that!\u201d</p><p>I turned around, getting ready to try to fabricate a story, but she wasn\u2019t even looking at me. She was flipping through the mail from that day, so I left well enough alone.</p> <p>While I was putting away the groceries, I started wondering what would have happened between Jason and me if my mother hadn\u2019t shown up right then. I wondered if he wasexperienced,and hoped like all hell he wasn\u2019t. I wanted to be his first.</p><p>After I went to bed and</p><p>made sure my mother was fast asleep, I masturbated for the first time. I didn\u2019t know what to do exactly, and to this day, I\u2019m not sure whether or not I actually came. All I know is thinking about Jason and feeling on myself at the same time made me feel damn good.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Well, I finally got my man, and Chandler got pushed to the curb. Jason told her the truth, that he and I were an item. She took it hard, but I didn\u2019t care. That summer was the greatest one of my entire life. Jason and I spent almost every day together. We never did the nasty though. As it turned out, he was still a virgin and was not completely ready to do it, so we didn\u2019t. We used to hold hands and hug and neck heavily. He wouldn\u2019t let it go any farther, so I began to masturbate on a regular basis.I assumed masturbating at such a young age was probably strange but had no idea there were underlying reasons for it. What I did not know then but realize all too well now is that my battle with sexual addiction had already begun.</p><p>chapterfive</p><p>Things were going great between Jason and me. Just think! My soulmate had been staring me in the face all those years without me even suspecting it.</p><p>I was still completely devastated over my father\u2019s death\u2014Lawd knows no one and nothing could ever take his place. Jason helped me through it, though. We spent every second we could spare together. After school, we did our homework together unless Jason had practice. If he did, I would sit in the bleachers and wait for him.</p><p>Chandler couldn\u2019t stand me being there. As far as I was concerned, that was her personal problem. I\u2019m surprised her eyes didn\u2019t end up permanently crossed from rolling them back and forth in her head at me so damn much. A couple of times, she almost fell flat on her ass during cheerleading practice because she was so busy trying to diss me.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mohammed was still trying. I have to giveit to the brotha. He didn\u2019t give up on love easily. I tried to hook him up with Brina, but she wasn\u2019t even having it. She\u2019d developed this massive crush on Cordell. I used to beg Jason to sweat him about asking her out.</p><p>On occasion, we would all hang out together at the mall or the ice-skating rink in the Omni International Hotel. I hate the fact they closed the rink down some years ago. I would love for Jason and me to take the kids there and reminisce about the good old days.</p><p>Cordell and Brina did eventually hit it off, thank goodness\u2014she was getting on my last nerve worrying about who else he might possibly like.</p><p>I hated it when Jason traveled to away games, because I didn\u2019t have any way to tag along. I thought about pleading my way onto the cheerleading squad, even though I had no interest in it, just so I could be with him.</p><p>I wanted to take things further, but Jason was content with kissing and grinding with our clothes on. That night on the porch, I just knew he wasexperienced.He fooled my ass but good. Part of me was elated because that meant Chandler couldn\u2019t throw having sex with him up in my face.</p><p>I was growing more and more frustrated. The more Jason refused my sexual advances, the more obsessed I became with getting him to go all the way. He would let the kissing get hot and heavy, and then just get up and leave me panting despondently on the couch.</p><p>I began to wonder if something was wrong with me. Most boys his age were all about trying to get some so they could brag about it to their friends\u2014but not Jason. He wasn\u2019t having any part of climbing up inside my sugary walls.</p><p>I was willing to deal with it, yearning coochie and all, until Brina called me up on the phone after 1A.M.one Saturday night.</p><p>\u201cBrina, why are you calling me so late?\u201d I whispered into the handset, trying not to rouse my mother. \u201cMy mother will have a fit if she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you have your own phone line for, doofus!\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but I didn\u2019t see a damn thing funny. \u201cBrina, what is it? Is something wrong, Sis? Is it your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she isn\u2019t even here,\u201d Brina replied sarcastically. \u201cShe\u2019s probably sitting on a barstool somewhere rapping to one of those ugly-ass men she keeps bringing up in here.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say about that one, so I changed the subject. \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong, Zoe,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cIn fact, everything is just spantacular.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and turned on the lamp on my nightstand. \u201cOkay, now that I\u2019m completely lost, care to enlighten me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe did it!\u201dshe screamed in my ear.</p><p>\u201cDid what, dammit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCordell and I did the nasty!

Confess!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSheit, I\u2019m not lying,\u201d she giggled. \u201cWe did it, and it wasgoooooooood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Cordell had sex?\u201d I was finding this shit hard to comprehend. Jason and I had been together for months and had never even gotten naked. Here this chica was calling me up braggin\u2019 on dick, and they had only been dating a couple of weeks.</p><p>\u201cBoy, did we!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go, Brina!\u201d I can\u2019t describe my feelings, but I was hurt and didn\u2019t feel like talking anymore.</p><p>\u201cZoe, wait! I want to tell you all the details! Blow by blow, or should I say lick by lick!\u201d</p> <p>That did it! \u201cBrina, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow! Later!\u201d</p><p>With that, I hung up the phone. I knew I was wrong for that. There she was excited, wanting to share her first sexual experience with me, and I totally dissed her. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I cried myself to sleep, light on and all, wondering why in the world Brina could get some loving and I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The next day I went outside and sat on the stoop sporting a pair of dark sunglasses, a black turtleneck, and black jeans like I was in mourning. I even had on black socks.Jason came out his front door a few minutes later and headed across the street to join me. He was eating a Hostess Chocolate Cupcake and offered me half of it before he sat down.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d I mumbled under my breath, not even wanting to acknowledge him.</p><p>He sat down on the stoop beside me, inquiring, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You love chocolate cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry right now, is all,\u201d I replied, looking down at his feet and noticing he had a new pair of white Pumas.</p> <p>\u201cAww, I get it now. It\u2019s that time of the month, huh?\u201d</p><p>I pulled my sunglasses down slightly so I could snarl at him and roll my eyes. \u201cWhat do you care if it\u2019s that time of the month? It\u2019s not like we do anything!\u201d</p><p>Jason cleared his throat and starting fidgeting. He polished off the rest of the cupcake and pretended to be enthralled in a squirrel climbing the oak tree in my front yard.</p><p>\u201cYou know about Cordell and Brina having sex last night, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, finally breaking the silence.</p><p>Damn, Brina was telling the truth! \u201cCordell told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he called me early this morning to brag about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare him spread Brina\u2019s business around like that?\u201d I barked, automatically going into my protective mode. \u201cDamn, he\u2019s almost as bad as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up now! Didn\u2019t Brina call and tell you? You don\u2019t seem too surprised about it.\u201d</p> <p>I tried to hold back a smile, realizing I was in essence calling the kettle black. \u201cMaybe she did. What of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be mad at Cordell for telling me when Brina told you? Hell, she probably called you the second he left her place to spill the beans. At least he waited until this morning to call me.\u201d</p><p>Wow, Jason read Brina\u2019s ass like a book! I looped my arm around his. \u201cBaby, when are we going to do it?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his arm away from mine. \u201cZoe, I told you I\u2019m not ready to go all the way. I want us to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait how long? Till we\u2019re fifty years old?\u201d</p><p>I could tell he was pissed. He started huffing and biting his fingernails. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous! Are you such a freak that you can\u2019t wait until the time is right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreak?\u201d I started to slap him but caught myself. I was trying to make a sincere effort to lay off the violence. \u201cHow can I be a freak if I don\u2019t do anything freaky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you should call Mohammed\u2019s ass up!\u201d</p><p>Oh no, he didn\u2019t even go there! \u201cWell, maybe I should. He\u2019s areal man. He wants my body, unlike you,\u201d I said, telling a bold-faced lie. Mohammed wouldn\u2019t even give me the tongue, rather less the dick.</p><p>Jason stood up, probably just so he could look down his nose at me. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell I want, Zoe! You don\u2019t know a damn thing about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Chandler does, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChandler didn\u2019t ever ride my back like you\u2019re doing! That\u2019s for sure!\u201d</p><p>I was hyperventilating, trembling, and on the verge of an explosion. \u201cJust get the hell out of my face, Jason!\u201d He stood</p><p>there and stood there and . . . stood there. \u201cI thought I told you to get out of my face. Did I stutter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying, Zoe?\u201d Hell, I had no clue what I was saying! How dare he ask me that? \u201cAre you breaking up with me?\u201d</p><p>That was when I made the stupidest move I\u2019ve ever made in my entire life. I said, \u201cYes, I am.\u201d</p><p>He walked away from me and left me sitting there, feeling dumb. The next day he got back with Chandler; the following week I got back with Mohammed out of retaliation, and the farce continued for two years.</p><p>I made feeble attempts to get Jason back, but he wasn\u2019t even going for it. I even broke down, gave him a heartfelt apology and asked if we could at least be friends. He told me to go be friendly with Mohammed. I never didanythingsexual with Mohammed. He was still frontin\u2019 on the dick. I wasn\u2019t too upset because I was in love with Jason Reynard, and there were no two bones about it. I just dated Mohammed to try to make Jason jealous.Brina and some of the other girls discovered a hole in the wall of the locker room, and they used to peek through it to get dang-a-lang sightings. I couldn\u2019t have cared less until one day Brina yelled out that she could see Jason\u2019s ass. I knocked her on the floor like I was a linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons. I peeked through the hole and started salivating, praying he would turn aroundso I could see hisother part. Our gym teacher, Ms. Price, interrupted me though and delivered a serious tongue-lashing when she discovered what I was up to. Now, fifty-eleven girls had been looking through that hole for weeks, and no one got caught. As soon as I take a glance, I get cold busted. Ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>chaptersix</p><p>Springtime rolled around, and it was time for the annual School Fair at Central. I was reluctant to go because Mohammed had been showing out and seemed more worried about talking my ears off about the Nation of Islam than taking my pants off. Like I said before, that was cool with me. It had gotten to the point where even being around him irritated the hell out of me. The Friday night before the fair, I called him up and succinctly told him all bets were off.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want me to take you?\u201d He sounded so pitiful when he realized I was on the brink of kicking his ass to the curb. \u201cYou asked me months ago to go with you to the fair at your school, and now you\u2019re backing out at the last minute? I was supposed to be filling in for Brother Jabrail at the rally tomorrow afternoon, but I changed my schedule around andeverythingjust so I could go hang out with you.\u201d</p><p>The guilt trip was not even working. It became disturbinglyclear to me that Mohammed had been nothing more than a big waste of time. I listened to him drone on and on and finally resorted to holding the phone away from my ear while I became pleasantly immersed in another thought. I was sitting on the living room sofa when some headlights suddenly blinded me through the curtains. I moved one of the sheer curtain panels to the side slightly and peeked outside to see if it was Momma getting off work early; I was anxious to tell her about the A I received on my calculus exam. It wasn\u2019t Momma but I caught the taillights of Jason\u2019s Camaro just as they turned off. When he got out of the car, he looked like an Adonis, a god even. He was sporting this Negro League baseball jacket and some Levis\u2019 that were so tight, I wanted to reach out and spank that tight ass of his. It brought on a delightful set of ambiguous memories, including the glimpse I got of his butterball naked ass through the hole in the girls\u2019 locker room. Things could\u2019ve been so different if I hadn\u2019t gone too far and dumped him that day. It had been almost two years, and he still gave me nothing but cynical remarks, dispassionate glares, and malevolent treatment.</p><p>\u201cZoe, are you there?\u201d Damn, why couldn\u2019t he just shut up and stop whining? I was busy daydreaming about a real man. \u201cZoe? Oh, so now you just gonna igg me and thangs? That\u2019s cool!\u201d</p><p>I watched Jason use his foot to nudge the car door shut because his arms were full of some Kroger bags he retrieved from the backseat. I knew I had about thirty seconds to hit the pavement, or he would be inside and out of my reach. My mother had mentioned that Jason\u2019s parents were going out of town for the weekend and asked her to keep an eye on him, so I knew he was alone. It was time to make my move.</p><p>\u201cUmm, Mohammed, I have to go.\u201d I shifted through the repertoire of excuses I frequently used to get off the phone with him, trying to make sure the one I was about to blurt out hadn\u2019t been abused. \u201cMy mother will be home in a few, and I need to clean up the kitchen before she gets here. Call me next week. Peace.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut, Zoe, what about tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Click. Enough of all that. I jumped up off the worn and tattered sofa and quickly adjusted the dolman sleeves of the white blouse I had on with some black velveteen leggings and black leather platform shoes. I made a beeline for the front door, pausing half a second to smile in the mirror and make sure none of the meatloaf from dinner was stuck in my front teeth.</p><p>I was determined to make a classic statement of subtlety and poise, pretending like I just happened to be stepping outside for some fresh air or something. Once I saw Jason\u2019s key hitting the lock and the lights go on in his foyer when he hit the switch on the wall, I quickly discarded that option.</p><p>\u201cJason, hold up just a minute!\u201d I heard my voice and realized I was screaming, panicking even, so I toned it down a bit and then reiterated, \u201cHang on a second.\u201d</p> <p>Even from across the street, I could see his eyes crinkle-at the sides. He was probably under the automatic assumption I only wanted to say something sarcastic to him. To be honest, I had no idea what I was going to say, but I knew I needed Jason. I wanted Jason. I had to have Jason, or I might as well have slit my wrists with a plastic knife from KFC or taken an overdose of Ex-Lax or something.</p><p>\u201cZoe, what do you want?\u201d He tossed the bags down on the tile floor in the entryway.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I want something?\u201d I replied,moving tentatively toward him. \u201cMaybe I just wanted to say hey.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a sanguine smile, and I was a bit relieved. Normally, he would just snarl at me. \u201cWell, hey.\u201d</p><p>I was at his doorway by then, and I immediately got lost in his eyes, wondering how in the hell the little nucca I used to scrape in the street with grew up to be so damn fine.</p> <p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked, beginning to press on the backside of the door like he was on alert to slam it in my face if my evil twin raised her ugly head. He knew I wanted him though. I could tell. He was just basking in the glory of knowing he had control over my conflicted heart.</p><p>I hesitated and bit on my bottom lip, contemplating what to say next. He blushed and leaned against the doorframe, and it dawned on me how tall he was. I had three-inch platforms on my five-foot, six-inch frame, and he looked like the Jolly Green Giant standing in front of me. \u201cHow tall are you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and let out a slight chuckle. \u201cIs that what you came over here to ask me at this time of night? How tall I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I was just wondering. I didn\u2019t realize you were so gigantic.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, but I could tell my interest in his height was flattering to him. \u201cIf you must know, gurl, I\u2019m about six-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix-five? Damn!\u201d For some reason, I had to look at his feet. I glanced down, and he had on the biggest-ass pair of Nikes I\u2019d ever seen. Brina and the other gurls used to always talk about how a boy\u2019s feet were directly related to penis size. I had never bought into that, since penis size was never a fascination for me\u2014that is, until the day I prayed like all hell Jason would turn around in the gymshower. On my way back up to look at his face again, I made a pit stop at the crotch of his jeans. My eyes ballooned when I spotted it behind the denim fabric. Not only was it big, much bigger than it had been a couple years before when we used to grind up against each other, but he either had a coconut in his pocket or he was damn sure happy to see me.</p> <p>\u201cWell, look, I\u2019m about to go cook me some hot dogs. Aight?\u201d I must\u2019ve made him feel uneasy because he turned on me, and his grin changed to a pout. I wondered if he knew I was peeping his dang-a-lang.</p><p>\u201cOkay, cool.\u201d I started to turn around when a lightbulb went off in my head. \u201cYou mind if I grab one of your hot dogs, Jason? Momma\u2019s working late again, and I\u2019mstarved.\u201dI rubbed my belly to drive the point home. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a thing in the fridge, and I don\u2019t have a car like you, so I can\u2019t go to Kroger or grab some fast food.\u201d</p><p>I was lying my ass off, knowing good and damn well that less than an hour earlier I had munched down on the mouthwatering meatloaf and mashed potatoes with gravy Momma fixed before she left for work.</p><p>Jason glared at me, like he was registering the thought of actually letting me in the house when his parents weren\u2019t home. \u201cAight, come on in,\u201d he said, stepping aside. He must\u2019ve wondered if I would go psycho on his ass and stab him with a butcher knife, because he emphatically added, \u201cBut as soon as we eat, you need to bounce, because I have a lot to do before the fair tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatchu gotta do for the fair?\u201d I quizzed, attempting to throw a</p><p>little slang in there so I appeared cool.</p><p>He picked up the bags and headed to the kitchen. I closed the front door and followed him. \u201cThe basketball team is sponsoring some of the activities this year, and since I\u2019m the captain, I have to help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What type of activities?\u201d He laid the bags on the counter, and I became enthralled with the tightness of his ass again. It looked ten times better up close than it did from the hole in the locker room.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t notice me staring because he was busy putting some eggs, bacon, and milk in the fridge. \u201cWe got this kissing booth going on, for one thang. I\u2019m not really trying to do it, but you know how it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing booth? Word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Jason gave me a puzzled look. \u201cHmm, I\u2019m surprised, because Chandler and some of the other cheerleaders are doing it along with us.\u201d</p><p>The mere mention of Chandler\u2019s name made me cringe. Damn, why couldn\u2019t that anorexic beanpole bitch move the hell on? I had even resorted to becoming a cheerleader to get next to Jason, but it just made him laugh. The other girls on the team were all buddy-buddy with Chandler and left me out of the loop except for the required activities. \u201cNo one said a thing to me. Then again, I\u2019m not surprised, considering the fact Chandler hates my guts.\u201d</p><p>Jason put some tap water in an aluminum saucepan and then turned on a gas burner. \u201cChandler doesn\u2019t hate you. You\u2019re trippin\u2019. What makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>He acted like it was some sort of revelation. Jason knew good and damn well Chandler couldn\u2019t stand my ass. I don\u2019t even know why he was trying to fake the funk. \u201cWhatever, Jason,\u201d I hissed. \u201cSo, are you and her still hanging out?\u201d</p><p>He cut open the pack of Oscar Mayer hot dogs, dropped them in the boiling water, and then sat down across from me at the white drop-leaf table with floralplace mats adorning it. \u201cWhy you wanna know? In fact, what\u2019s up with all these questions tonight? You writing a book or sumptin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I looked at him contritely. \u201cNo, I ain\u2019t writing no damn book. I was just wondering because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause what?\u201d He waylaid the rest of my sentence and it was just as well. I was about to do something dumb and ask him to go with me like he did me years before. I could hear his smart-aleck reply in my head: Go with you where?</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d I decided to change the subject. \u201cSo how long are your parents gonna be out of town, and where did they go anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, another freakin\u2019 question.\u201d That fool laughed at me in my face, and it finally pissed me off. My evil twin came out.</p><p>\u201cGeesh, if I can\u2019t even ask a damn question, I might as well take my ass back on across the street!\u201d I jumped up from the kitchen table and started stomping toward the front door in my platforms.</p><p>Jason was right on my tail. \u201cHold up, Zoe. I\u2019m sorry. My parents are in North Carolina visiting some relatives, aight? Just chill, Boo.\u201d</p><p>Dang, he called my ass \u201cBoo.\u201d A word of affection. Everyone knew \u201cBoo\u201d was more than just a word Casper the Friendly Ghost whispered to unsuspecting children. Maybe not before the eighties, but Boo was a certified synonym for \u201cBaby,\u201d \u201cSweetie,\u201d and \u201cSnookums\u201d by the time the word left Jason\u2019s sexy-ass lips. I was a Boo. Aww, dayum!</p><p>\u201cYes, Jason?\u201d I spun around and batted my eyelashes at him, trying to keep myself from blushing, but I realized it was a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your hot dog? What you gonna eat for dinner?\u201d</p><p>I was appalled. How dare he build up my emotions and then start talking about some damn hot dogs, even if they weren\u2019t cheap-ass chicken franks? I sucked my teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll just eat some Vienna sausages and some saltines instead.\u201d</p><p>I swung the door open and headed out, muttering expletives under my breath.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014why did you ask about me and Chandler for real, though?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t even look back at him. \u201cI gotta go. I need to go condition my hair and get ready for the fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m going.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to tell him that Ms. Rankin, the principal, had asked Brina and me to be clowns. Chandler and her other hussy friends were going to kiss boys all day long, and I had to be a freakin\u2019 clown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason was still saying something to me when I slammed the door closed, but I couldn\u2019t have cared less. I was crushed, humiliated, fired up even. I kicked off my shoes, ran into the living room, and buried my head in a toss pillow to catch my tears.</p><p>Momma shook me awake a couple of hours later. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Why are you lying on the sofa in the dark?\u201dI looked up at my mother and wanted to spill it all, but she had enough problems, including but not limited to working two jobs to support me. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Momma. I was just dog-tired when I got home from school today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure, sweetie?\u201d She rubbed my back, and I sought comfort in her touch.</p><p>I got up, kissed her gently on the cheek, and took a whiff of the rose water she always dabbed behind her ears. She always smelled so feminine, even after a long day. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed now. Goodnight.\u201d</p> <p>I was halfway up the steps when she drilled me. \u201cWhat time is Mohammed picking you up for the fair tomorrow? I wanna make sure you get up on time.\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, thinking of a logical excuse why he wasn\u2019t coming. Then I remembered him mentioning the rally. \u201cUmmm, he\u2019s not coming. He has to do a Muslim rally tomorrow, so I\u2019m going with Brina.\u201d</p><p>My mother sounded slightly disappointed. \u201cOh, okay. Goodnight, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>I went in my room, left a message on Brina\u2019s answering-machine telling her to come get me the next day, fell on my canopy bed, and started wailing all over again until I was fast asleep.</p><p>I woke up the next morning about eight, still devastated and confused about my feelings toward Jason and his feelings toward me. When I got down to the kitchen, Momma was cooking some ham and cheese omelets. The aroma was kicking and I was either starved or ready to see if eating till I exploded would make me forget about my troubled, nonexistent love life.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel better this morning, sweetie?\u201d Momma ran her fingers through my shoulder-length hair while I threw down on the omelet like Wilbur fromCharlotte\u2019s Webslopping up some grub.</p><p>I wiped my mouth with a napkin and gulped down an ounce of orange juice along with some egg so food remnants didn\u2019t come flying out my mouth when I answered her. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Momma. I was just tired last night because it was a long week at school.\u201d</p><p>She sat down beside me and blew lightly into her coffee-mug. The steam amusingly fogged up her glasses, and I remembered how it used to make me fall out laughing every time that happened in my younger years.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know Ms. Rankin had you and Brina workinghard on the fair.\u201d She took a sip of her Maxwell House and grinned when her legal drug started to kick in. \u201cDid you girls get all the posters made?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they look great too.\u201d I slapped my forehead, looking dumbfounded. \u201cI meant to tell you last night. Guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, sweetie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got an A on my calculus exam! No, scratch that. Your baby girl got anA-plus!\u201d</p><p>I gleamed while she took it all in. She reached over and rubbed my shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic, Zoe! Having Jason tutor you has really paid off!\u201d</p><p>I frowned. It figured she would give him all the glory. I had asked Jason to tutor me in calculus one damn time, and my mother made it sound like he single-handedly resurrected my brain cells. It was all just a ploy to get him to pay attention to me in the first place. His math skills weren\u2019t all that. \u201cI did it all by myself. Jason didn\u2019t take the test for me.\u201d</p><p>She caught my drift. \u201cI know, baby. I didn\u2019t mean for it to come out that way. I was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>I jumped up and headed back upstairs. \u201cI have to go get ready. Brina\u2019s picking me up in a few.\u201d</p><p>I heard Momma calling after me. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything, Zoe! I really didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Brina picked me up in her hoopty twenty minutes later, and I was not even halfway dressed. I took a quick shower, and then lingered over every feature of my body in the foggy mirror on the back of the bathroom door. I had to admit that I was lacking a bit in the tit department, but my ass was good. All good!</p><p>Most boys at school seemed to be into girls with nice asses, but Jason obviously wasn\u2019t, because Momma could have fried those ham and cheese omelets on Chandler\u2019s flat ass.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure they were still dating-because his slick behind had avoided my question the night before. I was hell-bent on finding out that day, though, one way or another. By the time the sun went down that night, I was either going to be as happy as a fag in Dickland or as depressed as a whore in</p><p>church.</p><p>I never got around to conditioning my hair the night before, and it was frizzed up like I was going to audition for the role of Kizzy Kunte in the sequel toRoots. Luckily, once I got to school, I could put on the dreaded clown suit and cover my naps with a multicolor wig.</p><p>Brina was laying on the horn thick, so I threw on some white walking shorts. Okay, they were more like Daisy Dukes. I flung all of my T-shirts out of my top dresser drawer until I came across the red one that hadG.A.G.imprinted on the front and the phrase \u201cGet A Grip\u201d in small lettering at the bottom. I had a predilection for bragging on my tits even though I didn\u2019t have much of anything. I slipped my dogs into some red patent leather slides and flip-flopped my way down the steps.</p><p>\u201cGurl, hurry your slow ass up!\u201d Brina was fussing as soon as I stepped out the door into the unrelenting sunlight. It was a beautiful day for a school fair. Ms. Rankin did everything except Indian tribal dancing and casting a voodoo spell to make sure it didn\u2019t rain, and it paid off. There wasn\u2019t a storm cloud in sight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, damn! You\u2019re always rushing some damn body!\u201d</p><p>I got into the hoopty and gave Brina a brief once-over. No matter how hoochie I tried to be, she out-hoochied me every single time. She had on a skin-can\u2019t-get-no-tighter-unless-you-embed-the-clothes-in-your-ass-tight black sundress and some black leather pumps. Plus, her hair looked good as all hell. I was immediately jealous. I knewI should have slapped some conditioner in my nappy head and thrown a plastic cap on before I went to bed. I looked like one of those ugly-ass troll dolls sitting next to Cinder-fuckin\u2019-rella rolling with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you have on, gurl? We\u2019re going to a fair, not clubbing.\u201d</p><p>Brina rolled her eyes and flipped me the bird. I turned the radio up, even though there was more static in it than a woman\u2019s nylon half slip straight out the clothes dryer, and started bopping my head to Cheryl Lynn schooling nuccas about how they \u201cGot to Be Real.\u201d \u201cDang, that\u2019s my song,\u201d I proclaimed.</p><p>\u201cE-ve-rycool song that comes on is your dang song.\u201d Brina chuckled. She was right too, \u2019cause on any given day, I had at least twenty favorite songs but rarely knew the words to them. Ironically, the only songs I could ever manage to memorize were the ones I hated. Ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>Brina started bopping her head in unison with my naps while she did one last lipstick check in her rearview mirror before pulling off. We rode all the way to school with the bass controller on the system turned as far to the right as humanly possible without one of us breaking a nail. It made the car shake from side to side at every stoplight while we gyrated our hips to the beat.</p><p>I spotted Jason\u2019s Camaro the second we pulled up in the parking lot. I wondered if he was somewhere arm-in-arm with Chandler, and if he\u2019d picked her up that morning. His car was already gone when I got up. I checked.</p><p>Brina threw something on my face, blocking my vision. I yanked it off and realized it was a navy blue bathing suit. I held it up, looking at her quizzically. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops, I meant to tell you. Ms. Rankin caught me onthe way out of class yesterday and asked if you and I could sit in the dunking booth today, so I brought an extra suit for you from home.\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands on my hips and clucked my tongue.\u201cDunking booth!What the hell happened to being clowns?\u201d</p><p>Brina cut off the ignition and opened up her door. I followed her out of the car. \u201cShe still wants us to be clowns too, but we can take turns doing both. She was going to do the dunking booth herself, but she has a cold.\u201d</p><p>I raised my hands to my hair. \u201cI can\u2019t do the dunking booth. My hair is messed-da-hell-up, and I was counting on wearing that stupid clown wig to hide my naps.\u201d</p><p>We started walking toward the football field where the fair was being held. \u201cZoe, your hair\u2019s not looking bad at all. In fact, it looks real cute.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my arms and paused briefly, tapping my right foot on the gravel parking lot, to inhale her bullshit. \u201cYeah, right! You know my hair istoooooooothrough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just think that, but it\u2019s straight. You know how it is?\u201d She stopped and turned around to face me. \u201cWhenever your hair is filthy dirty, thicker than a ton of bricks, and pinned up, that\u2019s when peeps come out of the woodwork with compliments.\u201d</p><p>I had to give it to her, \u2019cause she did have a point. That always seemed to happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you spend eight damn hours at a beauty shop under a hot-ass dryer listening to old-ass women complain to each other about men, kids, and other women that you have to almost beat a hair compliment out of some damn body.\u201d</p><p>I laughed because she was right on the money. \u201cAight, whatever, but I want to do the dunking booth first. I have something I need to do a little later.\u201d</p><p>Brina\u2019s eyes bulged. \u201cSomething like what?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the gravel, kicking a few pebbles around and blushing. \u201cJust something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes this something have a name that begins with a J?\u201d I giggled. \u201cBy the way, what happened to Mohammed? I thought he was coming. I was surprised when I got your message about coming to get you this morning.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed her by the arm and started pulling her toward the field. I was suddenly in a hurry to get the whole sordid business over with, one way or another. I had no clue how I was going to approach the situation, but it had to be done. \u201cCome on, Brina. I\u2019ll explain it all to you later.\u201d</p><p>Ten seconds after I sat down on the two-by-four doubling as a bench in the dunking booth, I was regretting letting Brina talk me into the shit. First came the comment from this high-yella, snaggletoothed nucca with a lopsided high-top fade and freckles. \u201cDamn, Youngen, look at her hair!\u201d His little sidekicks, none of them out of the eighth grade, pointed and laughed at me. I just waved them off, hoping they would go try their luck at a cap toss game or something else at one of the other booths. No such luck.</p><p>Five minutes later, I was the one laughing at their asses. They couldn\u2019t hit the metal bull\u2019s-eye on the dunking booth if their lives depended on it. They all took turns, wasting some of the ten bucks apiece their mommas probably gave them to get rid of them for the day.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Youngen, you didn\u2019t even come close to her!\u201d Snaggletooth was guffawing and hitting his boy on the back after the sorry excuse for a pygmy missed the target by a good two feet, and the baseball ended up in a trash can.</p> <p>\u201cShit, not like you did any better,\u201d he retorted, trying to swallow his pride.</p><p>I started getting in on it. \u201cPersonally, I think all of you need to go home and lift some weights because you all look like skinny midgets from up here where I\u2019m sitting!\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t know how to react when agirlcame at them like that. They looked at each other dumbfounded, and finally decided to go waste some money on something else. \u201cCome on, Youngen. This shit\u2019s boring!\u201d</p><p>An hour later, I was kind of hoping to get dunked, but to no avail. At least fifty peeps had tried, and only three or four of them even hit the edges of the target, much less the bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>It was hot as hell out there. Add in the sun beaming on me through the glass surrounding the top of the booth, and it was ten times worse. I felt like I was sitting in a sauna. Thoughts of an old movie where a boy used a magnifying glass and sunlight to set a cricket on fire flitted through my head.</p><p>Just when I was convinced my dry nappy hair was going to catch on fire any second like a pile of bushweed and leave me looking like the victim of a witch hunt in Salem, Jason, Chandler, and the rest of their clique walked up to the booth. She had her arms around his waist. How dare she?</p> <p>Chandler taunted me. \u201cLook who it is! It figures they would put her in there instead of Ms. Rankin. Half the school would love to dunk her.\u201d</p><p>Jason looked from Chandler to me. I got sarcastic with him. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate me, huh, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChandler, cut that out,\u201d he demanded, systematically removing her arms from around his waist.</p><p>She got dramatic. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Afterwhat she did to you, you\u2019re taking her side over mine? I don\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe this shit!\u201d</p><p>Jason looked guilt-stricken. After all, he probably did need to save some face at that point, with all his boys looking on and all. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cIn fact, check me out while I dunk her ass real quick.\u201d</p><p>They all laughed, and Chandler smirked, looking at me like she had just hit the lottery. Jason paid for his three baseballs and threw the first one before I even had a chance to brace myself. It hit the bottom of the target, but I didn\u2019t fall. Damn, I just knew that was my ass, as big and strong as he was, but he missed!</p><p>\u201cAh-ha, Jason!\u201d I taunted him. \u201cI forgot you were blind in one eye and can\u2019t see jack shit out the other one.\u201d</p><p>His boys started howling. \u201cDamn, man, she told you!\u201d</p> <p>Jason\u2019s eyes narrowed with malice, a look I knew all too well, and he threw the</p><p>second one. He missed by a mile.</p><p>I gave an exaggerated yawn. \u201cWow, I\u2019m so impressed. Now I know I did the right thing when I dropped you like the plague. Sorry ass!\u201d</p><p>Chandler yelled out,\u201cBITCH!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one, trick ass,\u201d I replied with a grin.</p><p>\u201cHold up, all of you step back. I got this,\u201d Jason stated avidly. I was positive he would miss by a mile yet again.</p><p>Next thing I knew, my ass hit the cold water. I could hear them all falling out laughing before I even came up for air. Jason had his fists thrown up in the air and was prancing around like he had just put Ali down for the ten count. His boys gave him high fives and slapped him on the back while Chandler gave him a big fat hug.</p><p>\u201cForget you, Jason!\u201d I was ashamed, upset, and hopelessly in love with the fool but scared to admit it.</p><p>\u201cForget you, too,\u201d he bellowed while their posse moved away.</p><p>Snaggletooth and his buddies came walking past the booth while I was struggling to get back on the bench. Their hands were filled with everything from cotton candy to stuffed animals to corn dogs.</p><p>\u201cHAAAAA! HAAAAA! He got your ass good, Youngen!\u201d</p><p>I just ignored it and let them enjoy their laugh. I got back up on the bench, hunched my shoulders, covered my eyes with the palms of my hands, and listened to the annoying-ass carnival music.</p><p>A couple of hours later, Brina traded places with me. I never thought I would be so elated to put on a clown suit\u2014anything but that damn dunking booth. After Jason dunked me, a chain reaction ensued, and I hit the cold water at least twenty more times before I lost count.Ms. Rankin, who didn\u2019t have the sniffles or any other vague symptom of a cold, gave me a quick lesson on making poodles and other cute characters out of oblong latex balloons and sent me on my way. I had a ball walking around and entertaining the little kids, who were strongly representing that day.</p><p>I had on a red, white, blue, and yellow suit with a white, red, blue, and purple wig, white powder makeup with red lipstick surrounding my lips, and huge red clown shoes. I was doing just fine until . . .</p><p>. . . I spotted the kissing booth. To say I was severely rattled to see all the hoochies lined up to kiss Jason would be the understatement of the year. There were just as many nuccas in line to kiss Chandler\u2019s skank ass, for some unknown reason. Apparently the cheerleaders andthe players were taking turns at the booth. Jason and Chandler were up at bat.</p><p>I was immediately jealous, even though I could see from my vantage point some thirty yards away that he was only giving up quick pecks. Some of the shy, problematic-as-in-uglematic girls looked like they were about to faint when his fine ass kissed them on the cheek.</p><p>My heart dropped. I contemplated going inside the school to call Mohammed from the pay phone and telling him to come get me, but I knew getting with him on the rebound wouldn\u2019t suffice. It didn\u2019t work the first time, and it wouldn\u2019t work the second. Something had to be done. Desperate times called for desperate measures.</p><p>I bought a ticket for the kissing booth and got in the line behind all the other girls waiting to kiss Jason. What the hell! It made as much sense as anything else I had been doing lately. When my turn finally came, Chandler recognized me under the wig and makeup and grabbed for her man. \u201cCome on, Jason. It\u2019s Lisa and Deon\u2019s turn now.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s attention quickened when he realized it was me. Then he grinned from ear to ear. \u201cYou want me to kiss you?\u201d</p><p>Chandler tried to pull him away by the arm, but he brushed her off, anxiously awaiting my reply. \u201cJason, let\u2019s go. Now!\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cChandler, let\u2019s get something straight. You don\u2019t own me, aight?\u201d He gazed back at me. \u201cI asked Zoe a question, and I\u2019d like an answer.\u201d</p><p>I cracked a mischievous smile and held my ticket up. \u201cI bought a ticket, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, you better not kiss that ho.\u201d Chandler was near hysterics, and all her backup hussies were ready to pounce at a second\u2019s notice.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d he replied sourly. He looked deep into myeyes and bit his lower lip to suppress yet another smile. \u201cSo kiss me then.\u201d</p><p>They had a card table separating the kissers and the kissees, probably Ms. Rankin\u2019s idea to deter any feel-ups if someone got carried away. I couldn\u2019t reach him without him leaning over it, and since he wasn\u2019t budging, I climbed up on top of it on my knees and grabbed him by the collar of his jersey. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave me a peck. A freakin\u2019 peck on the forehead like my grandmother used to give me. I had my eyes closed in anticipation of a deep, passionate kiss and opened them full of disappointment.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOkay, there\u2019s your kiss. Now beat it.\u201d</p><p>I let go of his collar, and they all guffawed at me. I was about to get down off the table and sulk away, but something came over me. I grabbed his collar again, pulled his face to mine, and slipped him the tongue. He refused it.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Jason!\u201d I pleaded with my eyes, and then I saw it. A flicker in his eyes that told me everything I needed to know to let the rest of the words escape from my lips. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the way I treated you. I want you back. I wantusback, and I promise things will be different from now on.\u201d</p> <p>Chandler panicked and tried to pry my hands off him, but he knocked her hands away. \u201cJason, what is this shit? After the way she treated you, you\u2019re just gonna take her back like that?\u201d</p><p>Chandler must have been a psychic, because I was still waiting for a final decision on the matter.</p><p>Jason\u2019s eyes and voice softened. \u201cWhat makes you think things could be different?\u201d</p><p>I took the plunge. Right there in front of the whole world. I took a quick survey and noticed all eyes were onme. Even Ms. Rankin was standing over against one of the other booths, smiling at me and raising her eyebrows in encouragement.</p><p>I took a short, restorative breath and blurted it out. \u201cBecause I love you, Jason. I always have. I want to marry you and make a son named Peter and look atourstar every night while I lie in your arms.\u201d I couldn\u2019t gauge the expression on his face, but I had to get it all out. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, even when we acted like we hated each other. I\u2019m sorry for all the things I\u2019ve done, but nobody\u2019s perfect. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I just\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He put his finger on my lips and whispered, \u201cShhhh, it\u2019s okay, Boo. I never expected you to be perfect. I never expected you to be anything but you, because it\u2019s you, the real Zoe, that I\u2019m so in love with.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the back of my head and started kissing me,reallykissing me, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I could hear people applauding and cheering and Chandler cussing and stomping off, but none of that mattered. Jason was showing me some affection, and I knew everything would be perfect from that moment on.</p><p>chapterseven</p><p>Our senior year in high school rolled around, and still no sex. Jason and I had been boyfriend and girlfriend for over three years, and it was killing me. We did a lot of making out; kissing, caressing, and things like that. He sucked my breasts and fingered me quite often, but refused to stick it in. He kept saying he wanted to wait until we were married. We planned to get married as soon as we graduated, attend the same university, and live happily ever after.</p><p>All my friends were jealous, thinking I was getting my freak on all the time, but truth be known, I was jealous as hell of them. They were getting sexed better than me. Brina was still knocking boots with Cordell. Hell, even my mother was getting some. She had a new man, Aubrey, that I had mixed feelings about. I missed my daddy terribly. No one and nothing could ever replace him but at the same time, my mother deserved to be happy, so I accepted it.</p><p>Looking back, all the signs of sexual incompatibility between Jason and I were there from day one. I just couldn\u2019t see the forest for the trees. Love is indeed blind, and it makes you imagine qualities in a person that don\u2019t exist. I used to tell myself that things would change in time. I convinced myself once we became sexually active, our sex life would be the bomb. I was more than ready to spring into action, reading any book or manual about pleasing a man sexually I could find.</p> <p>Part of me wonders whether marrying Jason was the right thing. Then I think about how much fun he and I had together, how loving he was to me when my father died, how romantic he was during the years we dated, and it makes it all seem worthwhile. Besides, my love for him is real and it was the night of our senior prom when I realized that love would never die.</p><p>I was all decked out in a sexy, strapless red gown with a split going all the way up the back, showing off my welldefined legs. Jason looked too sexy for words in his black tux. My mother had taken some pictures of the two of us in our living room before she rushed off to work.\u201cI have something for you!\u201d Jason handed me a long round tube, capped at both ends. Color me stupid, but I was expecting a wrist corsage or some typical gift like that. Instead, I got a tube.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this,</p><p>baby?\u201d I tried to hide my dismay. He saw right through me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down for a sec, Zoe.\u201d He took my hand, led me to the big, fluffy armchair my daddy used to read to me in as a child, sat down, and then pulled me down onto his lap. \u201cNow, Boo, open it and see what you got.\u201d</p><p>I popped the cap off the end of the long cardboard tube,becoming more curious by the second. I reached in and pulled out several sheets of paper. It took me a moment to realize they were blueprints. Jason had taken quite an interest in architecture and planned to major in it.</p><p>\u201cBlueprints, baby?\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around my waist, pulled me closer into him and lightly kissed me on my bare shoulder. \u201cNot just any blueprints. Spread them open.\u201d He helped me to open them up and added, \u201cI wanted to do something very special for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor me? Ooooh, the plot thickens!\u201d I slipped my tongue into his mouth and gave him a long, passionate kiss. \u201cBaby, I didn\u2019t realize you actually knew how to draw blueprints already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re not perfect, nor totally to scale, but yes, I know how to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they plans of?\u201d I could make out the basic shapes and rooms but understood blueprints at the time about as much as I understood Japanese.</p><p>\u201cZoe, these are the plans for our dream house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord?\u201d My smile was hanging so wide open, I looked like I had more teeth than a set of triplets.</p><p>\u201cWord, Boo. One day, after we\u2019re married, I\u2019m going to build you this house so we can raise Peter in it and live happily ever after.\u201d I threw my arms around his shoulders and hugged him with all the strength I could muster. He started pointing out certain things to me on the blueprints. \u201cThese are all skylights. Practically the whole house will have a glass ceiling, so we can see the stars from every room. So we can seeourstar.\u201d</p><p>That was it! The moment I knew it was forever. Three significant things happened after that. We never made it to the restaurant to meet our friends for dinner; we never made it to the prom; and we made love for the very firsttime. The plans we had for waiting until after marriage became nothing more than a memory.</p><p>I was so overwhelmed by the blueprints, my heart started jumping out my chest. It was the single most romantic thing in the world to me. The mere fact Jason had spent so many hours designing the place where he wanted to build a life together made my love and admiration for him even stronger, made my desire to do something just as special for him flourish, made my pussy wet.</p><p>\u201cJason\u2014\u201d I started tugging at his bow tie, trying to get it unfastened.</p><p>\u201cYes, Boo?\u201d He grabbed hold of my wrist, trying to get me to stop. \u201cWhat are you doing? We have to meet Brina, Cordell, and the others at the restaurant in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I got up off his lap and stood in between his legs, carefully placing the blueprints on the coffee table. \u201cFuck them.\u201d After grabbing both his hands and pulling him up off the chair, I added, \u201cBetter yet, fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Jason took a double take at me, trying to come up with a response. \u201cZoe, you\u2019re trippin\u2019.\u201d He slightly pushed me aside with his chest so he could make a path to the door. \u201cCome on, baby. Let\u2019s go! We\u2019re going to be mad late!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I finally got up the nerve to stand my ground. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving this house until you make love to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned to face me, a perplexed look on his face. \u201cZoe, why are you doing this? We agreed we would wait until after we got married to make love.\u201d</p><p>I walked over to him, reached my hands into the opened jacket of his tux, and placed them around his waist so I was pressed as close against him as I could possibly get. His body was so incredibly warm, and I craved to feel him inside me. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me, Jason?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t look at him, afraid I might see a look of rejection in his eyes. Instead, I rested my head against his chest, taking special care not to get lipstick on his crisp white shirt. \u201cBaby, you know I want you. Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>As I began to run my fingertips up and down his spine, I lowered my voice to almost a whisper for no other reason than it seemed appropriate at that moment. \u201cThen why can\u2019t we make love right here? Right now? We\u2019ve waited so long. It\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Boo, but it won\u2019t be that much longer. We graduate in a few months.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I felt his dick growing in his pants and started hoping he was fighting a losing battle. I still didn\u2019t look at him. I could feel his cool breath on the nape of my neck and was just glad he was holding me back. \u201cI think about being with you all the time, Jason. I can\u2019t concentrate on anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you what. Why don\u2019t we go to dinner and to the prom and see what happens after that? Your mother won\u2019t be home until morning, so it gives us plenty of time to be together.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I looked him dead in the eyes. \u201cYou promise we\u2019ll make love later tonight?\u201d</p><p>Then the dreaded words escaped his lips. \u201cWe\u2019ll see, Boo.\u201d</p> <p>I hate the wordswe\u2019ll see:they almost always mean no. My parents spoke those words to me as a child when I asked for a new, extravagant toy or dress. They said them when I asked to do something we all knew I had no business doing. Thus, when Jason said them, they cut like a knife.</p><p>I started crying, and the tears were far from fake. My fragile and oversensitive nature, which had always beenpresent but tripled after the death of my father, came out. I let go of Jason and used my hands to gather up the bottom of my tight dress so I could run up the stairs faster in my high heels. I ran into my bedroom, slammed the door, and flung myself on the bedspread, burying my head into a pillow to catch the tears. He was right behind me. I could hear his footsteps coming down the hall.</p><p>Jason opened the door, and I could feel my mattress sink farther as he sat down on the bed beside me, seconds before he began caressing my back with his strong, warm hands. \u201cBaby, look, if it really means that much to you and you don\u2019t want to wait, then sure we can make love. We can make love right now. I don\u2019t want to see you upset like this. It breaks my heart.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head away from him, letting my lipstick smear all over my pillow when I changed positions. \u201cJason, you just don\u2019t get it. I shouldn\u2019t have to beg you to make love to me. This is supposed to be something we both want.\u201d</p><p>He started running his fingertips through my hair. \u201cWe do both want this. I was just trying to do right by you and wait, but make no mistake about it, I do want you. I\u2019m not even going to fake the funk about that.\u201d</p> <p>After that, we were both silent for what seemed like an eternity. He was running his hands from my hair down to the small of my back, and I was trying to control my sobs, which were eventually replaced with shallow breathing. \u201cZoe, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d I turned over onto my back so I could look at him. He took the tip of his thumb and cleared the smudged mascara away from my eyes. All of my lipstick had been transferred to my pillowcase. \u201cYou ready to go to the prom?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer but got up and walked over to mybookcase instead, putting on a cassette of slow jams that he\u2019d made for me to remember him by when his parents once took him out of town for a week. He was always such a romantic\u2014making me tapes of love songs, carving our names inside a heart on every tree in his yard and mine, calling me late at night so he could hear me breathe after falling asleep on the phone, letting me wear his varsity basketball jacket.</p><p>At six-five, he\u2019d finally stopped growing and was the captain of the basketball team, taking them all the way to the state finals two years in a row. He had the smoothest skin for a man, and he still does to this very day. My husband has always been fine, but he\u2019s never been finer than the night we first made love.</p><p>\u201cDance with me, Zoe.\u201d He reached out his hand for me, looking so sexy and debonair, as the first song started playing. I took it and let him pull me up off the bed into his arms. We danced, our bodies swaying back and forth slowly in the moonlight invading my bedroom through the windows.</p><p>Before the first song concluded, Jason traced the contour of my lips with his fingertips, and then our kiss began. We had kissed hundreds of times before, but this one was different. It was as if there was an exchange of souls. We became one entity as our tongues intertwined in a dance of their own.</p> <p>Jason scooped me up into his arms, carried me over to the bed, and laid me down gently. He climbed on top of me, and I pushed his jacket down over his shoulders and off. \u201cI love you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Zoe.\u201d He took my hand and kissed my palm while I turned on my side so he could easily unzip my dress and slide it over the curves of my body until it was completely removed.</p><p>The way he undressed me was so provocative. He was so gentle and took so much care with me, like I was a newborn baby. When he was done, I returned the favor. Once we were both nude, we sat on my bed face to face and placed a hand over each other\u2019s hearts, feeling the rhythm of our heartbeats coincide. It was</p><p>the most intense, arousing experience.</p><p>We started kissing again as he laid on top of me, and for the first time our private parts brushed up against one another with no clothes in between them. The warmth of his body made my heart flutter and my skin tingle.</p><p>The anticipation of making love for hours on end was overwhelming. I had waited so long for the moment to arrive and had envisioned it thousands of times\u2014no, make that millions of times\u2014in my mind. I was expecting us to explore every inch of one another with our hands and tongues, make love in every position known to man, and pass out from pure exhaustion.</p><p>What happened instead was a complete catastrophe. First, Jason got nervous because we didn\u2019t have a condom. \u201cZoe, what about protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Just pull out real quick when you feel like you\u2019re about to cum.\u201d I was tracing the curvature of his chest with my tongue, knowing my womanhood would finally be endorsed at any moment.</p> <p>\u201cUmmm, I don\u2019t know about this, Zoe. Maybe we should wait until we have some protection.\u201d He was trying to push me off him, but at the same time not putting up much resistance to my advances.</p><p>\u201cJason, do you want me to beg you? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Hell no!\u201d I started moving my hand up and down the shaft of his thick, long dick and rubbing the precum escaping from the head around with my thumb. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure I pull out in time.\u201d</p><p>He stuck it in, and it hurt like all hell when my hymen broke. Two minutes and about thirty pumps later, he pulled it out, and I wanted to scream. I lay there, thinking to myself, \u201cIs this all I get?\u201d</p><p>Jason told me he loved me, and I reciprocated. Then we just laid there, in dead silence, with his head on my left breast. A whole hour passed, and neither of us mentioned the prom, or anything else for that matter. I was depressed and Jason was . . . I have no idea what Jason was. I got up and searched through my purse for a cigarette. Smoking was a habit I\u2019d picked up when my daddy died as a method for relieving stress. I was damn sure stressed after my first sexual experience\u2014stressed, disappointed, humiliated, and depressed.</p><p>Before he drifted off to sleep, he expressed his concern. \u201cGeesh, Zoe, I hope I didn\u2019t get you pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Jason. No way am I pregnant! Never that!\u201d</p><p>chaptereight</p><p>What can I say? Never saynever!</p><p>Whoever said you can\u2019t get pregnant by having sex just one time lied like all hell, \u2019cause my ass sure got knocked the hell up. Ain\u2019t that a bitch?</p><p>In one sense, it really didn\u2019t matter all that much since Jason and I were planning to get married in a few months anyway. On the other hand, all the plans Jason and I had precisely worked out for the future went out the freakin\u2019 window. Everything, except the marriage itself, had to be reconsidered.</p><p>I just knew my mother was going to hit the roof when she found out, but much to my surprise, she informed us that she knew it was gonna happen all along. Jason\u2019s parents had pretty much the same reaction. I guess none of them were astonished because they all assumed we had been sexing each other for years and had just been lucky I didn\u2019t get knocked up sooner. Our friends all took it instride as well. From the looks of it, everybody in the world except Jason and I was predicting my impregnation.</p><p>Instead of having an elaborate wedding, we opted for a small ceremony in my mother\u2019s backyard the weekend after our graduation from Central High School. I was three months and not showing yet. Brina was my maid of honor, and Cordell was Jason\u2019s best man. That was the last time I saw the two of them together, because they broke up while Jason and I were on our honeymoon. To this day, neither one of them will discuss what happened.</p><p>It was a quaint, romantic, and intimate ceremony attended by our families and close friends. Our parents chipped in together and sent us on a week-long trip to the Bahamas as a combination wedding and graduation gift.</p><p>Our honeymoon turned out to be a culmination of fun-filled days and sexually repressed nights. After prom night, Jason and I never had sex again until after the wedding. To be honest, as much as I craved to be close to him in every way, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to another sexual disappointment. On my honeymoon, that\u2019s exactly what I got\u2014a series of sexual disappointments, in fact. It is such a strange feeling to love someone more than you love your next breath and yet be appalled when they touch you. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Jason never turned me off. He just never turned me on either. Not the way I needed to be turned on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While they say a mind is a terrible thing to waste, they neglect to mention that a body is a terrible thing to waste also. Especially when it\u2019s a body like Jason\u2019s. My husband\u2019s past gorgeous and way past fine. In fact, I can\u2019t even think of a word that would do him justice. He\u2019s a far cry from the little knucklehead I got in a fistfight with the day we met. To make matters worse, he has a scrumptious dick. He just doesn\u2019t know how to use it.</p><p>I had been working after school part-time at a fast food joint, and Jason worked with the county recreation department. We both had plans to attend college, and one of us did\u2014Jason. I chose to pursue full-time employment as an administrative assistant and worked for a dentist\u2019s office all the way through my pregnancy.</p><p>Jason had a full basketball scholarship to State, and we stuck with that plan. His major was architecture, of course. The times he was out of town at away games were dismal, but Brina and my mother tried their best to keep me in good spirits. As horrible as our sex life was, the little bit of satisfaction I was garnishing from being close to Jason was unavailable when he was away.</p><p>In fact, the further I got into my pregnancy, the more sexually repressed I became, and desperation set in.Simple masturbation was no longer good enough, so I began to play with toys. You name it, and I had it hidden away in a box on a closet shelf where Jason couldn\u2019t find it\u2014 everything from a dildo to a vibrator to Ben Wa balls. My fascination with sex was quickly turning into an obsession.</p> <p>\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Boo?\u201d He was holding my hand, caressing it gently and using his other hand to dab the sweat away from my forehead with a moistened towel.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking hate you!\u201d I pushed his hands away from me and tried to get up off the hospital bed so I could kick his ass, but the next contraction set in and kicked my ass from the inside out instead.</p> <p>\u201cZoe, just calm down and do the breathing exercises they taught us in Lamaze class!\u201d He came toward mewith all the pampering nonsense again and started taking short, quick breaths, as if a demonstration was going to make the pain go away.</p><p>\u201cJason, I hate you and I hate the fucking doctor and I hate all the fucking nurses!\u201d I paused just long enough to clench my teeth and push. The pain was excruciating, ten million times worse than I ever imagined it would be. I leaned up a little off the pillow, looking like a whale trying to do a sit-up, so I could look my doctor in the eye while he sat between my legs messing with my coochiecoo. \u201cDr. Henry, I fucking hate you!\u201d</p><p>They all laughed at me, even Jason. The nerve of the bitches! Everyone, including my mother, had warned me about labor. They warned me it is the closest to death a woman could ever come. If they weren\u2019t speaking the Gospel, then there isn\u2019t a dog in the entire state of Georgia.</p><p>The Lamaze teacher had cautioned all the fathers that their wives or girlfriends might be a bit angry at them during labor. Poor Jason had to feel my wrath, because I was past angry. I was ready to kill his ass for putting something so big in me, I was going to have to rip my ass open to push it out.</p><p>The Lamaze teacher also told the women to bring a stuffed animal or some other comforting item in the delivery room to soothe their thoughts during labor. Jason bought me a huge, stuffed brown teddy and named him Casanova Brown.</p><p>Jason retrieved it from a chair in the corner and brought it over to me. \u201cLook, baby, Casanova wants to keep you company.\u201d</p> <p>He started moving the bear around, like it was dancing the jig. Trying to focus on the damn thing made me nauseous. I grabbed the stupid-ass bear from Jason and threw it so hard, it hit a nurse in the head who was walkinginto the room. Then I slapped Jason upside his fucking head.</p><p>The rest of the delivery went about like that. I repetitively cussed everyone out and didn\u2019t care what they thought about it. It\u2019s amazing that even the shyest woman doesn\u2019t care how many people are staring at her pussy like a bull\u2019s-eye on a target during labor. At least a dozen people were in and out the delivery room, and I didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.</p><p>Seven hours and fifty-six stitches later, unto us a son was born\u2014Peter Jason Reynard, given the first name of my father, just like Jason and I had always planned. Once I heard all the stats\u20146 lb. 11 oz., 21 inches long, 10 fingers, 10 toes, and healthy\u2014I was satisfied and passed out.</p><p>I woke up in the recovery room with Jason rubbing my tummy, probably glad as hell my shape was back \u2019cause making love to a blue whale, even for only two minutes at a time, must\u2019ve been kind of frustrating.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jason!\u201d I caressed the side of his face, the same side I had slapped the shit out of during labor, with my right hand. \u201cI\u2019m so</p><p>sorry I said I hated you and even more sorry I hit you!\u201d</p><p>He started laughing. \u201cI know you love me, Boo, and this is forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways has been! Always will be!\u201d We kissed for a few moments, and then he climbed beside me on the bed, since we could both fit on that bad boy, and fell asleep in my arms. The nurse woke us up a while later so she could check my vitals.</p> <p>After the birth of our son, several landmark events took place in our lives, some very good and some very bad, but together, we always came out on top.The first emotional upset came about when Jason\u2019s mother found out she had breast cancer. His father retired from his state government job, using the early-out option, and they moved to North Carolina, where they\u2019re both originally from.</p><p>Then, my mother turned around and married Aubrey. I was devastated but had no choice except to live with it. I didn\u2019t have a clue things between them were that serious and was totally shocked when she showed up at my apartment sporting a ring.</p><p>No sooner had I recovered from that quandary when my Boo got hurt in a game and tore the ligaments of his knee to shreds. Instead of having one baby to take care of, I had two, one little and one big. Both of them as cute as they could be. I used to take pictures of Jason and Peter while they were sleeping, the baby lying comfortably on his daddy\u2019s chest, their heartbeats as if synchronized. Watching the two of them on the bed together gave me the idea of starting Shades.</p><p>Shades is my corporation. It started out on a wing and a prayer but grossed me over half a million dollars last year. Watching my son fast asleep on his father gave me the idea to make my own calendar celebrating the role of the African-American father. So many African-American women are raising their children alone, it\u2019s a blessing to see a man living up to his responsibility.</p><p>I borrowed some money from my new stepfather, who has a small contracting company, found some people willing to pose for a small stipend, and made a calendar for the following year. The cover had a photo of Jason and Peter with bare chests and sporting Atlanta Braves baseball caps. Using the computer Jason\u2019s parents bought him for his college studies, I began to advertise them on the Internet, and the most miraculous thing happened. They sold like hotcakes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t make a fortune the first year, but I made enough for us to get by between the calendar and my job at the dentist\u2019s office. Jason was able to keep his scholarship, even though his career as a ballplayer was over, and the high school we attended, Central, hired him as their head basketball coach. It worked out very well because he could attend college in the morning and coach once school let out in the afternoon.</p><p>The second year I put out three calendars: one with African-American fathers and children, one with African-American families, and an African-American swimsuit calendar featuring some coeds from the university.Business really picked up then. I started my business at a time when calendars that portrayed beautiful African-American women were few and far between. It was like selling bottles of ice-cold spring water to people stranded in 110-degree desert heat.</p><p>To make a long story short, every year Peter grew, so did our bank account. We moved out of our apartment and rented a three-bedroom house so I could use one room as a home office. The following year Jason graduated summa cum laude and got a great job with the top architectural design firm in the city.</p><p>When Peter was five, Jason kept the promise he made on our prom night and built my dream house. It\u2019s a 4,500-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bath cul-de-sac in a new development and it has over two dozen skylights in it so I can see all the stars.</p><p>We were still decorating when I got pregnant again. When Dr. Henry said the wordtwins, I wanted to faint but had to maintain my composure long enough to hold Jason up when he practically passed the hell out. The shock wore off, and the excitement took over. We turnedone of the guest bedrooms into a nursery and began shopping for two of everything.</p><p>Of course, when I went into labor, I was ready to kick everyone\u2019s ass again. This time Jason was prepared for battle and wore a baseball umpire\u2019s mask, more as a joke than for protection. I must admit the mask was mad funny and helped keep my mind off the horrific pain. He also brought in reinforcements the second time around, begging my mother to stay in the delivery room and be his tag-team partner.</p><p>Somehow, I managed to push Kyle Michael and Kayla Michelle out, instantly making our family unit expand from three to five. After a brief recuperation period, I got back to business and decided to market more than just calendars on the Net. I became an African-American arts dealer, marketing all types of artwork from up and coming artists who had the vision but lacked the sales ability. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now my art is sold not only on the Net but in department stores nationwide. Jason is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after architects in this city and recently made a 5 percent commission on a $2.1 million office complex. Financially, we couldn\u2019t possibly be doing any better, considering we thought all our hopes and dreams were destroyed because of failing to use a condom the first night we made love.</p><p>chapternine</p><p>I glanced at my watch, noticed it was almost 8P.M.and started to panic all over again. \u201cMarcella, it\u2019s getting really late. Jason\u2019s going to be worried sick.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the small crystal clock on her desk. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Zoe. It is a bit late. We\u2019ve talked a good three hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I can\u2019t wait to see the bill,\u201d I chuckled. \u201c Whatever it is, it\u2019s well worth it.\u201d</p><p>I gathered my purse, coat, and gloves and extended my hand to shake hers. \u201cThanks so much for seeing me, and I\u2019ll call your secretary to set up an appointment sometime next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very welcome, and make sure you do that.\u201d We shook hands, and I started toward the door. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a chance to discuss the foundation of your addiction. Or did we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. You have yet to hear the truly sickeningpart. I wanted to make sure you understood my love for Jason, how much he means to me and why he\u2019s my entire life.\u201d I lowered my eyes and started fidgeting with my gloves, trying to put them on, but I got the shakes. \u201cNow I have to go home and make up yet another lie to tell my husband. Lie on top of lie on top of lie. That\u2019s all I seem to do these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize you have to go, but can I ask one question before you leave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you lie to your husband about?\u201d Her eyes widened, and she seemed to be waiting to exhale until I answered. I guess the whole thing did seem a bit strange, considering I hadn\u2019t actually told her what made me an official sex addict.</p><p>\u201cWell, did I touch upon the fact Jason\u2019s not a very passionate or experimental lover?\u201d I asked rhetorically.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did get that impression. Can\u2019t you just try to work on it? It\u2019s obvious to me that you love your husband very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Jason more than my next breath.\u201d</p><p>She grinned at me, trying to make me feel at ease. \u201cZoe, just because your husband can\u2019t make you see fireworks in bed and you feel your sex life is lacking something doesn\u2019t constitute sexual addiction.\u201d</p> <p>I opened the door to her office, took a few steps into the waiting room, and turned to face her. For the first time, I was going to be honest with someone about what I had done. For the first time, I was going to divulge my deepest and darkest secret, one some people knew bits and pieces of, but no one understood the true spectrum of the way I did. If there were even the slightest chance Dr. Marcella Spencer could help me, I had to go for it no matter what the consequences. The alternative was tocontinue on the destructive path I was on, heading straight to hell in a handbasket. The words were barely audible because I whispered them. \u201cDoes having three lovers other than my husband constitute sexual addiction?\u201d</p><p>The grin on her face quickly faded and was replaced by a look of astonishment. She was flustered. It took her a moment to gather her bearings while I struggled to hold back tears. We never broke our stare. \u201cYes, I would definitely say that makes you a sexual addict!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured as much.\u201d I diverted my eyes to the door of the waiting room, ready to get the hell out of there before I broke down for real. \u201cLook, I really have to go. Jason\u2019s going to be climbing the walls if I don\u2019t get home soon.\u201d</p><p>She leaned on the door of her inner office, crossing her hands in front of her. \u201cI understand, Zoe. We\u2019ll pick up from here next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKewl!\u201d With that, I was gone. I tried to walk away nonchalantly, as if I had just told someone about the agenda for the next PTA meeting. Once I got on the elevator and pushed the button for the parking garage, I totally lost it and began wailing like a toddler throwing a temper tantrum. As the elevator descended, I kicked and hit the walls, wiping tears away with the sleeves of my suit and wishing like all hell the whole thing was a nightmare I would wake up from any minute. I knew better. It was all too real, and it was nobody\u2019s fault but my own.</p><p>While I was waiting for my black Mercedes to warm up, I repositioned my rearview mirror so I could take a good look at myself. I wanted to see what a cheating,</p><p>disgusting, nasty, lying whore really looked like. \u201c Behold, the whore!\u201d I spoke the words aloud and startedlaughing. There I was with mascara smeared all over my big brown eyes and tears covering my smooth caramel skin. There I was with ruby lipstick smudged over my trembling lips. I hated myself at that very moment. I closed my eyes and prayed for someone to throw me a life rope.</p><p>\u201cZoe, where you been, baby?\u201d The dreaded question, and I hadn\u2019t even made it all the way in the kitchen door yet.I came into the kitchen, where Jason was sitting at the table with the kids eating a Chicken Supreme pizza from Pizza Hut, and threw my briefcase on the countertop of the island. \u201cBoo, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m getting home so late. I had a problem with one of my distributors and had to hold an emergency meeting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t call?\u201d</p><p>All sorts of excuses and alibis started running through my mind. I took my coat off and flung it over a stool at the breakfast bar. \u201cTo be honest, Jason, I got so stressed about solving the problem, the time just got away from me, and before I knew it, it was after eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, you have a cell phone. You could have been considerate enough to take one moment out and call so I wouldn\u2019t be worried.\u201d He got up from the table and started clearing away the dishes, bringing them over to the sink where I was getting a glass of water. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you sometimes. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t even care about whether I know where you are or not.\u201d</p><p>Something snapped. \u201cPeter, take the twins up to their room and put on a cartoon movie for them, please.\u201d</p><p>I watched Peter gather his siblings up and do as I asked. Peter paused just long enough to ask a question.\u201cDaddy, can we watch that new movie you bought us? The one with the black Cinderella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d Jason was rolling up the sleeves of his white Bali shirt, getting ready to bust some suds. Once the kids were out of earshot, I got back to the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cLook, Jason, I really don\u2019t need this shit from you tonight. I\u2019ve had a very long day. You keep making it sound like I\u2019m never at home, and that\u2019s simply not true.\u201d He stood there rolling his eyes, his hands on his hips, and that pissed me off even more. \u201cHell, if you had it your way, I would never leave the fucking house. You want me in the kitchen, barefoot, and pregnant huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, now you\u2019re getting ridiculous.\u201d He cut the faucet off and started walking away, mumbling something under his breath, and I followed him into his drawing room. \u201cI never implied anything like that, Zoe, and you know it!\u201d</p><p>He went over to the compact stereo system on one of the built-in shelves and turned on a Nancy Crawford CD. He always listens to smooth music when he creates his masterpieces, designing some of the most beautiful and breathtaking buildings one could imagine. \u201cYou\u2019re crucifying me for expecting a phone call. A simple phone call letting me know what\u2019s up. If I did that same shit, you\u2019d never let me hear the end of it!\u201d</p><p>Jason was right, and I was ashamed. Once again, I was using my own feelings of guilt about my \u201c alternative\u201d lifestyle as a basis for arguing with him. Before I started cheating on him, we never fought but the little spats were becoming more frequent. The infidelity had to end. A lesser man would have left me, betrayed me, abused me. Thank goodness Jason\u2019s love for me overshadowed his frustration.</p><p>He sat down at his drafting table and began scribbling, breaking the lead tip out of a pencil by pressing down on it too hard in his anger. I walked up behind him and started massaging his shoulders. I could feel the tension in them, and it made me even more ashamed, knowing I was the cause of it all. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby! You\u2019re absolutely right. I should\u2019ve called. It was totally irresponsible and inconsiderate of me not to do so.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, just grabbed another pencil and started drawing again. I slowly moved my hands from his shoulders down to his chest and caressed his nipples through his shirt. He grabbed my left hand in his and kissed it. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Zoe. I just hate it when we fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Boo. So do I.\u201d</p><p>Jason twirled the base of his elevated drawing chair around so he was facing me and looked into my eyes. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do is make you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do! You make meveryhappy.\u201d I pressed my palms against his cheeks and gave him a long, wet kiss. \u201cI love you, and this is forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlways has been! Always will be!\u201d We smiled at each other, and then he started kissing me on my neck while I looked up through one of the skylights at the stars.</p><p>There was a long, uncomfortable pause. I was trying to decide whether or not I should even mention Marcella. I decided to hint around and see if the shit hit the fan.</p><p>\u201cI met this cool doctor today. A sistah.\u201d I pushed back a little from him so I could survey his expression. I didn\u2019t see a damn thing except the so-what look. \u201cHer name\u2019s Marcella Spencer.\u201d</p><p>Jason picked up another pencil and started fiddling with one of his blueprints. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, honey.\u201d</p> <p>I walked over to the stereo and flipped through the CD rack, searching for nothing in particular but seeing if he had bought anything new.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of doctor is she?\u201d Jason quizzed. \u201cMaybe I can send her some business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, actually she\u2019s a psychiatrist.\u201d I waited for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>\u201cPsychiatrist?\u201dJason acted like I said she was a hooker or something. Like the word was a four-letter one instead of a twelve-letter one. \u201cWhere in the world did you meet apsychiatrist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough a mutual friend.\u201d That was only a halfway lie\u2014I did hear about her through the lady at the beauty salon. \u201cShe\u2019s very nice and down-to-earth.\u201d Jason chuckled like I had said something funny. \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo reason. It just amazes me that people like that can even make an honest living,\u201d he stated emphatically, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cPeople like who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPsychiatrists. Shrinks. Head doctors,\u201d he said with an edge of sarcasm. \u201cI mean, really, Zoe. What kind of person pays someone to listen to their silly-ass problems?\u201d</p><p>I was offended but not about to confront him by admitting I was paying, and willing to pay out the ass if I had to if it would help. \u201cLots of people need therapy for different things, Jason. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being so closed-minded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank goodness neither one of us is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,\u201d he chuckled, laughing at his own half-ass joke. \u201cI would send her some clients if she was an internist or cardiologist or pediatrician or something normal,but apsychiatrist?No freakin\u2019 way! All my friends are sane. Stressed-out, maybe, butdefinitelysane.\u201d</p><p>I hunched my shoulders and paced to the window, debating whether to run out of the room before I started crying in despair. How was I ever going to tell him I was seeing a psychiatrist?</p> <p>\u201cGuess what, baby? I have some great news of my own!\u201d</p><p>I took a deep, restorative breath and turned to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Boo?\u201d I asked, forcing a smile.</p><p>He got up, walked over to me and put his arms around my waist. \u201cI got a huge contract today. The city wants me to design the new civic center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I was stunned. I knew my baby was the bomb-diggity all along, but he was really hitting the big time lately, having just completed the new YMCA. \u201cThat\u2019s great, baby!\u201d</p><p>We shared a long, passionate kiss. I could feel my panties getting wet. Any show of affection from Jason always turned me on. \u201cI have a great idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked me with a mischievous grin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go grab a bottle of champagne while I go upstairs and slip into something more comfortable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, sounds promising!\u201d He gave me a big, wet one right smack on the lips. \u201cBut what about the kids?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know as well as I do those chaps are probably all passed out on Peter\u2019s bed.\u201d We both laughed. It was a regular Friday-night routine for the kids to all fall out from the past week as if they had worked twelve hours a day. \u201cI just want to be with you. I want tonight to be very special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night with you is special.\u201d</p><p>I looked into his eyes, wishing things could be differentbetween us. If only he could be more receptive to my needs. I pranced off like Little Red Riding Hood on the way to her grandmother\u2019s house, grinning from ear to ear and hoping he was about to portray the part of the Big Bad Wolf and eat me, just like the one in the story. I knew there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell of that happening, but one can always maintain a strand of hope. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you get upstairs.\u201d</p><p>chapterten</p><p>When I awoke the next morning, Jason had already left to play his Saturday-morning round of golf with his two partners from the</p><p>architectural design firm. It was after nine. I was surprised all the kids were still asleep\u2014a welcome treat, as normally they would be up at the break of dawn.</p><p>Rays of sunlight invaded the haven of our bedroom through the skylights in the ceiling. The sun is the only major drawback to having a house with dozens of skylights. It\u2019s beautiful but can become a nuisance sometimes. As long as I get to see my stars at night, it\u2019s all good though. When it rains, it\u2019s so sexually stimulating. Then again, most things are sexually stimulating to me.</p><p>Unfortunately, after Jason and I proclaimed our undying love for one another in his drawing room the night before, it was followed by yet another sexual disappointment. After he fell asleep, I snuck into the bathroom, sat on the countertop, and masturbated with thedildo I kept hidden behind the cleaning supplies in the lower cabinet until I came.</p><p>Lying there thinking about it was bringing on an episode of depression, so I decided to get up and get moving. I called Brina, my partner in crime, and asked if she wanted to take the kids and hang out someplace for a little while. As expected, she was wide awake and down for whatever. We decided to hook up in about an hour at her place. I took a quick shower and got dressed. I woke the kids, who had all been bathed the night before, got them ready to go, left Jason a note on the fridge, and headed for Brina\u2019s.</p><p>When we got to Brina\u2019s, her ass wasn\u2019t ready. I could hear the shower running in her apartment as I was knocking. I opted to retrieve the key she always hid on top of the emergency lamp in the building corridor rather than wait for her to finish. The loafers I had on were killing me, and I wanted to rest my feet for a while. The kids and I bumrushed into her place. I turned on some Saturday-morning cartoons for them and went into her bedroom just as she was drying off.</p><p>\u201cGirl, hurry your ass up!\u201d</p><p>She jumped, obviously unaware we were already inside. \u201cDamn, Zoe, you scared the hell out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sis. I didn\u2019t mean to freak you out.\u201d When she dropped the bath towel to the floor, I was staring at her body. Not because I thought she was sexy\u2014lawd knows I\u2019m strictly dickly\u2014but because her arms, shoulders, and rib cage were all covered with bruises. I quickly shut the bedroom door, anticipating the highly emotional conversation we were about to have.</p><p>\u201cBrina, are you out of your freakin\u2019 mind? You\u2019re still letting Dempsey\u2019s skank ass beat on you?\u201d</p><p>Brina started throwing on clothes faster than a runway model changing clothes between appearances onstage. \u201cZoe, he doesn\u2019t mean it. Sometimes he just has a rough day at work, and shit happens, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, shit happens, and when I catch up to his ass, he\u2019s going to find out what kind of shit happens when he messes with my best friend!\u201d</p><p>I was fired up. I couldn\u2019t believe she was letting his limp-dick leprechaun midget ass beat on her. Dempsey was this little trick Brina met at a nightclub, which was hint number one she didn\u2019t have any business with him. Add to that the fact he was unemployed 90 percent of the time, drank more vodka alone than a Russian football team can drink altogether, and had five kids by four different women, and you have a shitty-ass excuse for a man, one of those scrubs TLC is always singing about: a Sexually repressed, Childish, Raunchy, Useless Bastard!</p><p>Brina was almost completely dressed in a black sweatsuit, comparable to the jeans and cardigan I was bumming around in for a Saturday escapade. I turned on the TV in her bedroom, hoping to drown out our voices even more so the kids wouldn\u2019t hear us. Then I got medieval on her ass.</p><p>\u201cBrina, let me tell you something. You\u2019re too good for that trick. He\u2019s a fucking waste of oxygen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, look, let\u2019s not start this shit again today. Let\u2019s just go hang out like we planned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang out? We need to be hanging at the damn emergency room! Look at your ass!\u201d I walked over to her, attempting to console her, and she flinched due to all the pain the bruises were causing. I took my index finger and pressed it against one of her ribs, and she collapsed on the bed, bent over in pain. \u201cSis, I think your rib is fractured.\u201d</p><p>I reached for the telephone, but she grabbed the receiver out my hand. \u201cWho are you calling? Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell naw! Jason\u2019s playing golf, and he can\u2019t help youanyway. I\u2019m calling an ambulance, and then I\u2019m calling the police so you can file charges against his trifling ass. This shit stops right now. Today!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brina and I started having a tug-of-war over the phone and I almost accidentally knocked her upside the head with it before I wrestled it away from her. \u201cNo, Zoe! You can\u2019t call the police! He\u2019ll kill me, Sis!\u201d</p><p>I hesitated for a brief moment, letting the words sink into my head, and then I replaced the receiver on the cradle. My voice suddenly went from a holler to nearly a whisper as I sat down on the bed beside her. \u201cKill you?\u201d</p><p>She started sobbing, and I got her a tissue off the nightstand. \u201cBrina, has he threatened to kill you?\u201d No reply. She blew the mucus out her nose and pretended she didn\u2019t even hear the question. \u201cWhere is he anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDempsey caught the bus home to Alabama for the weekend. It\u2019s homecoming at his alma mater.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was worried about Brina, and at the same time I wanted to kick her ass my damn self for being so stupid as to stay with him. Part of me wished I knew a voodoo priestess I could call and arrange for Dempsey to be fatally bitten by an Alabama black snake. That would have put an end to it all.</p><p>\u201cZoe, gurl!\u201d She jumped up from the bed, walked over to the dresser, and looked in the mirror while she applied some lipstick. \u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here and enjoy ourselves. It\u2019s a beautiful day out, and the kids don\u2019t need to be cooped up in here.\u201d</p><p>I picked up the phone again and started dialing. \u201cZoe, I thought I asked you not to call the police. I\u2019m denying whatever you tell them, so it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling the police. I\u2019m calling Jason at the country club and telling him to come pick up the kids so I can take you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>The line was busy, so I pressed down the reset button and started dialing again. \u201cZoe, I\u2019m not going to the hospital either.\u201d</p> <p>While it was ringing, I got pissed off for real. \u201cListen, Brina, you may have convinced me not to call the police,for now,but your ignorant behind is going to the hospital if I have to rope and gag your ass to get you there.\u201d</p><p>I had Jason paged and I was waiting outside Brina\u2019s apartment building when he pulled up in his hunter green Land Rover. After we got the kids buckled in, Jason followed me back up the walkway to the entrance so I could fill him in. He was more anxious to get his hands on Dempsey than I was, but I told him the trick had beat Brina\u2019s ass and run like all punks do.</p><p>We kissed each other good-bye, said I love you, and I watched him pull off with the kids before I went back inside to get Brina.</p><p>\u201cSo, where are Jason and the kids going? Home?\u201d We were in my car en route to the hospital, and Brina was trying to discuss any and everything but the matter at hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, he took them to Family Adventure Fun Park, that place over in SW that has the balls to jump in, crawling tubes, arcade, and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d</p> <p>The sun was irritating my eyes, even with the sun visor down, and I was nursing one hell of a migraine. \u201cBrina, you do realize you have to end the relationship with Dempsey, right?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes, smacked her lips, and turned the radio volume up to a ridiculous level. \u201cCan we just talk about something else, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, we\u2019re going to talk about this!\u201d I turned the radio completely off. \u201cThat fool has got to step. He\u2019snothing but bad news. When does this all end? When he uses you as a punching bag one time too many, fucks around, and kills your ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trippin\u2019 hard. You just don\u2019t understand my life, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen enlighten me!Please!\u201d</p><p>I almost ran a red light but was able to screech to a halt just in time. Good thing, too, because there was a police car right behind me. \u201cYou and Jason have this fairy-tale life. You always have had. Shit doesn\u2019t come easy to me like that. A good man is hard to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think Dempsey\u2019s a good man, Brina? Chile, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may not be perfect, but he\u2019s all mine, and he loves me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you come out of your face and say he loves you when he gives you a beatdown whenever the hell he feels like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink what you want, Zoe. He loves me, and I love him back.\u201d</p><p>The entrance to the emergency was dead ahead, and I could see the flashing lights on an ambulance that had just pulled in. \u201cYou need help, Brina. Serious help, and I don\u2019t mean the physical kind either.\u201d</p><p>I pondered over Brina\u2019s situation as well as my own while I waited for her in the crowded waiting room in the emergency wing. It was flu season, so people were hacking and sneezing all over the place. They almost sounded like a snot chorus. It was disgusting, not to mention unhealthy.</p><p>v style=\"text-align:center; padding: 15px 0;\"&gt; </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m barely making enough to get by,\u201d Brina continued. \u201cMy mother\u2019s always asking me for money. When I\u2019m with Dempsey, it\u2019s the only time I truly feel safe.\u201dNo\u2014she didn\u2019t say safe?\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have men knocking down my door these days. I used to, though. You remember that, don\u2019t you, Sis? You remember when I was beautiful like you?\u201d</p><p>That did it! I squeezed her hand so hard that I practically drew blood. \u201cYou listen to me! You\u2019re still beautiful! You always have been and always will be!\u201d I calmed down a little and loosened my grip. I was so upset, I had to fightback the tears. Brina was always the confident one. People used to call her conceited in high school, but I would defend her and explain that she wasn\u2019t conceited\u2014she was just convinced she had it going on. \u201cThat Dempsey bastard has destroyed your self-esteem, and I\u2019m not having it. I\u2019ll do anything to help you, Brina. Anything! Jason and I both would do anything for you. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>She looked me over with the tear-drenched eyes of a child. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t help you unless you tell me what you need.\u201d The waitress came back to the table and asked if we were ready to order our meals. I asked her to give us a few more moments. We had yet to even open up the menus. Once she walked out of earshot, I continued, \u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard about any financial problems, Brina. Why didn\u2019t you ask me for some money?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could never do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? That\u2019s what friends are for, dammit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you and Jason giving me handouts. I know how hard it was for the two of you to get where you are. I watched your dreams come true right before my eyes, and I could never take away from that.\u201d</p><p>I mulled it over for a moment in silence. I never realized Brina could be so damn stubborn. \u201cOkay, fine. I won\u2019tgiveyou anything. I\u2019ll make you earn it.\u201d Brina looked at me, full of confusion. \u201cCome work for me. It\u2019s the perfect solution, and we can spend a whole lot of time together.\u201d</p><p>She started chewing on her bottom lip, lost in thought. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this, Zoe. I don\u2019t want to mess up a good thing. I\u2019ve been at my company for a while now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd they haven\u2019t promoted you, given you a raise, or done a damn thing for you except give you a bunch of aggravation.\u201d I smiled at her, hoping to encourage her to accept.\u201cBesides, I pay well, and you won\u2019t have to fight with me to take vacation time or to leave early or anything.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s true. My boss, Mrs. Green, can be a mean old heifer when I ask to leave even an hour early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo accept my offer then, dammit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all I have are secretarial skills, and those aren\u2019t all that great. Do you even have an opening at your company in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll make one up. I\u2019m the owner. I can do whatever the hell I want.\u201d She still hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t have a personal assistant. I never have had, but now that I think about it, I could surely use one. You could go visit artists with me and hang out at galleries and art shows. Do power lunches. You would love it.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came back again, about to cop an attitude since we were taking up table space and not eating. I could understand it. Business is business and tips are tips. The Cheesecake Factory was packed since it was a Saturday afternoon. We finally put the waitress out of her misery, glanced over the menu, and ordered a couple of grilled chicken salads with blue cheese dressing, some cheese toast, and a basket of chicken tenders.</p> <p>\u201cWell?\u201d I asked, giving Brina my undivided attention while we waited for the food. \u201cWhat\u2019s your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me think about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>Now it was my time to be confused. \u201cThink about it? Do you know how many sistahs would jump at the opportunity I just offered you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, giggling, but I failed to see the joke. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I can deal with you as my boss. You\u2019re my best friend and all, but I know your temper tantrums better than anyone, and when we get into it, wereallyget into it. I remember how you and Jason used to go at it all the time when we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offended,\u201d I stated, even though she was right to an extent. \u201cI\u2019m strictly professional at work. Now as far as me getting in your ass about trifling things after work hours, that\u2019s still a free-for-all playing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, let me think about it, Zoe. Either way, thanks for the offer. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything less from you. You\u2019re always there for me.\u201d</p><p>I</p><p>dropped it. In fact, I dropped everything. The money issue, the work issue, the Dempsey bastard issue. We enjoyed our lunch and caught up on insignificant things. Once I dropped her back at her place, I asked to use her bathroom before I headed home. I can only imagine her surprise when she discovered the check for five thousand dollars I left on her vanity. I left her a note saying she better not even mention it, and she better cash it, or I would be mad at her ass. I also told her not to dare thank me for it because that\u2019s what friends are for, but urged her to give some serious consideration to my job offer. I was hoping she would see things my way and accept.</p> <p>chaptereleven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you again, Zoe.\u201d Dr. Marcella Spencer was setting up her tape recorder when I entered her office. After she had it all hooked up and ready to catch my dirt, she came around the desk and shook my hand.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, too.\u201d It was Wednesday\u2014five days since our initial conversation.</p><p>\u201cHow are you? Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>She motioned to the same wing chair, which was destined to become my home away from home, and I gladly sank into it. I was exhausted from being treated like a sex object during my creeping episodes and from the added stress of worrying about Brina. \u201cI\u2019m making it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, making it doesn\u2019t sound too positive. You want something to drink? Coffee, tea, water, maybe a soft drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d She was being extraordinarily friendly,and I began to wonder whether she had been feenin\u2019 all week, anxiously awaiting to hear about the sexual escapades of the freakazoid slut she had as a new client.</p><p>\u201cZoe, do you want to stay in the chair or use the chaise this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine right here, Marcella. Thanks!\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her pen and pad, ready to jot down all my sins, but I had no intention of having another panic attack. The thing with Brina had made me realize one thing. I needed help just as much as she did, and it was time to get it.</p><p>\u201cSo, Zoe, shall we begin?\u201d She was all ears.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I rubbed my eyes, both of them having bags underneath them from lack of sleep. \u201cWhere should I start this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I basically know about your relationship with your husband. You were quite frank regarding your lack of satisfaction sexually.\u201d There was a silence, and I waited for the other shoe to drop. It did. \u201cWhen you were leaving last time, you mentioned you were having three extramarital affairs, which, I will assume, is what you need the most help with?\u201d</p><p>I answered her sarcastically. \u201cUmmm, yeah, you could say that fucking three other people is the heart of the problem.\u201d</p><p>I regretted the way I came off at her and immediately apologized. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to take my frustration out on you. There\u2019s just been a lot of shit going on in my life lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Believe me, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and whatever I don\u2019t understand, we will work on together. Trust me, Zoe! There\u2019s nothing you can tellme that will make me think any less of you. I\u2019m here to help.\u201d</p><p>Her hands started trembling, and I got the distinct impression she was more nervous than I was. I guess a woman who fucks men like she changes panties would make anyone uneasy.</p><p>So I began. \u201cI love Jason and my kids dearly. They\u2019re my heart and soul. I only wish they were enough to fulfill all my needs. I have three regular lovers other than my husband. Each one of them gives me something different. For months now I\u2019ve tried to stop this madness, but I can\u2019t. My addiction to sex has taken me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>I hate it when you spill your guts out and someone says \u201cI see.\u201d It makes me feel like they are either bored, skeptical, or appalled. I got up from the seat and walked over to one of the windows. I don\u2019t know what my fascination is with looking at the sky, but I definitely have one. Maybe I missed my true calling to become a weather forecaster. It was cloudy that day, and the sun was about halfway tucked away for the night.</p><p>\u201cWhile I love Jason more than life itself and would die if he ever found out, he\u2019s never been able to sate all of my sexual desires. He\u2019s very old-fashioned and thinks a man should have total control in the bedroom. Jason believes in very little foreplay. He\u2019ll only have sex with me in the missionary position. He\u2019ll only have sex with the lights off, and he\u2019s totally against oral sex. I brought up the subject of anal sex once, and he almost had a heart attack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you decided to seek fulfillment of your needs someplace else?\u201d</p><p>I took a seat on the chaise longue and lay down inMarcella\u2019s office for the first time. The secrets I was about to reveal to her had tormented me for so long. While it might be painful, it was going to be a great relief to get it all off my chest. \u201cBecause we fell in love so young, I\u2019m the only lover Jason\u2019s ever had. As far as he knows, the same is true in my case. Up until a year ago, Jason was in fact the only lover I ever had. Then the madness began. . . .\u201d</p><p>chaptertwelve</p><p>I was attending the opening of a new public high school when I first met Quinton. It was a magnet school, specializing in the performing arts, and Quinton was the artist commissioned by the city of Atlanta to paint a mural in the cafeteria.</p> <p>Quinton Matthews was renowned throughout the world, and as an arts dealer, I was very familiar with his artistic talent. I had seen his picture once, but it didn\u2019t do him justice.</p><p>When I arrived at the opening, I was late, and the mayor had already done the traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony. A business associate, Rebecca Swanson, had invited me, and before I made it ten feet into the cafeteria she greeted me with a huge smile and a glass of champagne.</p><p>Meeting Quinton Matthews was my main reason for attending. At the young age of thirty, he had already achieved legendary status as a contemporary artist. I was hoping tosweet-talk him into letting me produce some of his originals as prints and add them to my sales collection.</p><p>The mural Quinton designed on the cafeteria wall was nothing short of breathtaking. It depicted dozens of teenagers, of all ethnic groups, involved in various activities, everything from ballet to playing musical instruments to portraying Shakespeare on a stage.</p><p>As I walked along the wall, pausing to glance at each scene, I shuddered to think how many hours it must have taken to create such a masterpiece. I also wondered what kind of man had the vision and creativity to commit himself to such a task. It reminded me a lot of Jason, the time and effort he put into his architecture.</p> <p>The high school wasn\u2019t the only place I had seen Quinton Matthews\u2019s work up close. His creations were all over the city. My favorite was one of the Atlanta skyline on a concrete wall in a downtown MARTA station. I used to go down to the station, just a few blocks from my office, sit on a bench, and eat lunch. The mural seemed to have a calming effect on me, and sometimes even an arousing one. I have no idea why, but I somehow equated his creative nature with sex. Then again, I equated most things with sex back then.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why I was such a huge fan of his, and perhaps the real reason I wanted to meet him was curiosity\u2014not about his work, but about the man himself. Curiosity might kill most cats, but it made the cat between my legs purr.</p><p>When I got to the section of the mural depicting a group of ballerinas with their arms neatly folded over tutus, standing on the hard toes of ballet slippers, I felt someone breathing down my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou like the mural, huh?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep and distinguished. I didn\u2019t turnaround. I assumed he was one of the several hundred patrons who had come to the opening to see how their generous donations were spent.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019tlikeit! Iloveit! Quinton Matthews is a great artist, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, if you say so.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the sarcasm in his voice and quickly spun around, ready to defend my favorite artist and confront the arrogant son of a giga monster who lacked a true appreciation of his gift.</p><p>\u201cListen, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d I froze.</p><p>\u201cYes? He\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>I must have had the most ridiculous look on my face, because I was damn sure embarrassed when I realized I was face-to-face with Quinton Matthews himself.</p><p>\u201cMr. Matthews!\u201d I grabbed his hand and started shaking it like a political science major who\u2019s just snatched up the opportunity to meet the president of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s such an honor to meet you!\u201d</p><p>He stopped shaking my hand but refused to let it go when I tried to retrieve it. Instead, he lifted it up to his mouth and kissed it. \u201cOne problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t officially met yet, Ms.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Mrs. Zoe Reynard.\u201d I flashed the wedding ring on my other hand at him as if I needed to provide some form of physical evidence to support the statement. I was really trippin\u2019. I was used to meeting men, but I was acting like a nervous teenager around Quinton Matthews.</p><p>\u201cDamn, just my luck.\u201d I noticed he</p><p>was still holding my hand and pulled it away, pretending I needed it to prevent my purse strap from falling off my shoulder. \u201cThe good ones are always taken.\u201d</p><p>I started blushing. Hell, who wouldn\u2019t blush with a man that damn fine paying them a compliment.</p><p>Like I said, I had seen his picture in the newspaper before butdayummmmmmmmm!!!!Quinton was about five-eleven, green eyes the color of emeralds and a clean-shaven bald head. His skin was the color of burnt sienna, smooth and flawless, and his smile perfect.</p><p>He was sporting a dark gray double-breasted suit with a crisp white shirt, unbuttoned just enough for me to see the baby-fine hair on his chest.</p><p>I was so busy checking his ass out, I didn\u2019t see Rebecca approaching. As a matter of fact, he was checking me out too, and making no bones about it.</p><p>\u201cZoe, I\u2019m about to leave. Bobby\u2019s running a fever, and the school just paged me to pick him up.\u201d</p><p>Rebecca could have been calling out the winning numbers for that night\u2019s lotto, for all I cared. \u201cOkay, Becca. Take care, girl.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a quick pat on the arm. \u201cAll right, girl. Take care, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>I realized how rude I was being. \u201cHold up, Becca. Have you met Quinton Matthews, the muralist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ve met.\u201d They shook hands, but nowhere near the seductive way he and I did. \u201cNice to see you again, Quinton. Your new mural is the bomb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the compliment!\u201d</p><p>While he was thanking her, I was trying to sneak a peek at the bulge in his pants. I snapped back to my senses; I knew good and damn well I had no business thinking about another man\u2019s dick.</p><p>\u201cZoe, I really have to run!\u201d Rebecca was already halfway to the door, bumping into a waiter and almost causing him to spill a whole tray of drinks, when she yelled out, \u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow!\u201d</p><p>I waved at her as she disappeared from our view.</p><p>\u201cMr. Matthews, I really have to be running along also.\u201d Suddenly, I was scared to even be near him.</p><p>\u201cAw, so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my husband will be expecting dinner at a certain time, and I still have to stop at two different places to scoop up the kids and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Domestic life must be hectic. Don\u2019t let me keep you.\u201d He was talking to my breasts and not my face, which made me even more uncomfortable. The black dress I was wearing didn\u2019t seem that revealing, but he made me feel like I was working the corner in the red light district.</p><p>\u201cWell, nice meeting you, and once again, I really do love your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I started walking away, feeling his eyes on my ass, when I remembered the business proposition I had come there to make in the first place.</p><p>When I turned around and headed back toward him, he started grinning. My lips were forming the words when he inquired, \u201cLet me guess. You want me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I felt like hollering \u201cHell, yes!\u201d but managed not to. \u201cActually, I want to talk with you about the possibility of marketing some of your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, is that right?\u201d His eyes started exploring my body again. \u201cWell, we can definitely discuss it if it means I get to see your fine ass again.\u201d</p><p>That did it! My nipples got hard, and my pussy got wet. \u201cHere\u2019s my card.\u201d I pulled one of my engraved business cards out and handed it to him. \u201cWhenever you can find the time in your busy schedule, I\u2019d appreciate it if you can call me so I can go over what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I already know what I have in mind.\u201d I startedblushing while he glanced at the card. \u201cAn arts dealer, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Exclusively African-American art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\u201d I zipped my purse back up. \u201cIt\u2019s no rush, though. I realize you\u2019re in high demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about tomorrow morning? Say nine o\u2019clock? My place?\u201d</p><p>I was shook! My lips were trembling, and his eyes held me in a trance. He dug in his pocket and handed me one of his cards. I looked at the address of his studio and made a mental note that it was within walking distance from my office. \u201cNine tomorrow would be great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He took my hand and kissed it once more.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll let you get back to your other admirers. I didn\u2019t mean to hog your attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot a problem, Zoe. I can call you that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do, Quinton.\u201d Damn, on a first-name basis already! I wondered if that meant hellified sex was right around the corner.</p><p>I was leaving, trying to get out of there before my mind went even further into the gutter than it already was, when he grabbed me around the waist from behind and spoke softly in my ear. \u201cYou cannot begin to imagine the things I want to do to you.\u201d</p><p>He took my earlobe into his mouth, small hoop earring and all, suckling on it for a brief second until I freed myself from his grasp.</p> <p>I hauled ass toward the door, face flustered and heart pounding so hard in my chest, I could actually hear the echo of it ringing in my ears. I glanced back at his fine ass one last time. He was still staring at me.</p><p>He held my business card up to his well-defined lips, smelled it like it had been hand-dipped in fine perfume, and used it to blow me a kiss.</p><p>I daydreamed about him all the way to the twins\u2019 day-care center, more worried about what might not happen the next morning than what might.I got home, threw a couple of Cornish hens in the oven, told Peter to go do his homework, popped a cartoon video into the great room VCR for the twins, and then went to my bedroom and locked the door. I laid there on the bed, fantasizing about Quinton Matthews while I masturbated and hoped I would cum before Jason got home.</p><p>I came three times in twenty minutes and would\u2019ve cum at least three more if Peter hadn\u2019t knocked on the door, informing me that he\u2019d broken the lead of his pencil and couldn\u2019t find his pencil sharpener.</p><p>chapterthirteen</p> <p>\u201cJason,\u201d I whispered, trying to wake him up gently by rubbing him on the shoulder.</p><p>Still half asleep, he answered. \u201cYes, Boo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye, sat up just far enough to glance at the alarm clock on my side of the bed. \u201cZoe, it\u2019s three in the morning. Can\u2019t this wait till later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d</p><p>It was storming that night. One of the worst lightning storms of the season, and the weather center had issued a flash flood warning. The lightning was coming in from all directions and appeared to be dancing on the carpet. I couldn\u2019t fall asleep if my life depended on it. I was like a bitch in heat. My pussy was feenin\u2019 for some action.</p> <p>Jason took a deep breath and propped himself up on his pillow. \u201cYou wanna talk? Okay, let\u2019s talk. \u2019Sup, Boo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make love.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cZoe, we made love less than three hours ago. Can I just get some sleep, please?\u201d He turned over on his stomach, his head facing away from me. \u201cI have an early day tomorrow, baby.\u201d</p><p>What I should\u2019ve done, at that moment, is tell my husband the freakin\u2019 truth. I should\u2019ve told him that, even though I love him and would take a bullet for him, I needed him to be more sexually open and willing to try new things. I should\u2019ve suggested we seek counseling. I should\u2019ve told him I started masturbating way back in junior high school and had been doing it ever since. I should\u2019ve told him about all the sex toys I had hidden all throughout the house and at my office. I should\u2019ve demanded he try harder to fulfill my needs and desires. I should\u2019ve forced him to listen to me for a change instead of just brushing me off whenever the conversation turned to sex. Instead, I lay there listening to the thunder, watching the rain and lightning, and praying I wouldn\u2019t get into trouble the next morning when I went to discuss business with Quinton Matthews.</p><p>I knocked even though the door was already ajar. \u201cMr. Matthews?\u201d\u201cCome on in, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>I entered his studio, which doubled as his apartment, at exactly nine sharp. I didn\u2019t see him, but I could hear him moving around in the loft upstairs. \u201cHello. Good morning. Am I too early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, right on time.\u201d He appeared at the top of the steps with nothing on but a pair of silk pajama pants. He was wiping the last of some shaving cream off his face with a towel when he came down the steps to join me. \u201cCare for some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks. I have enough nervous energy already. I don\u2019t need caffeine to exacerbate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just a little Energizer bunny, huh?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes, but I hardly ever wear pink and I don\u2019t own a drum.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed, and then he motioned me toward the leather sofa. \u201cHave a seat, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, putting my briefcase on the marble coffee table in front of me. I made sure I brought enough information with me to try to sell his ass on the idea the first time around.</p><p>\u201cWell, you may have natural energy, but I need some coffee. Be right back.\u201d</p><p>I watched him walk into the kitchen and then took a quick survey of his place. It was awesome. I assumed he was buying the space, because just about every wall had a mural on it. They were all magnificent, and he had a set of crates covered with black velvet in one corner. I figured they were used for people to sit on and pose while he spent hours on end painting their portraits.</p><p>I noticed there was a canvas on the easel and decided to be nosy. I went over, lifted up the oilcloth covering the piece, and looked at it. I was surprised to discover it was a portrait of the governor. The state must have commissioned him to do it for the state capitol building. Quinton made him appear so lifelike, it was unreal.</p><p>The studio was located on the top floor of an old department-store warehouse downtown, which had been renovated and turned into huge lofts. There was only one other tenant on his floor, located at the other end of the hall.</p><p>\u201cHmm, inquisitive too. I like that in a woman.\u201d I didn\u2019t notice he had returned with a steaming hot mug of coffee in his hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I replaced the cloth. \u201cI guess I was a bit out of line. It could\u2019ve been a portrait of your woman or something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for future reference, I don\u2019t have a woman.\u201d He started looking me up and down again. \u201cAt least, not yet.\u201d</p><p>I turned toward the window, away from him, so he wouldn\u2019t see me grinning from ear to ear. \u201cOh, wow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh wow, what?\u201d</p><p>I walked closer to the window so I could get a better look. \u201cThe mural you painted at the MARTA station. It\u2019s right across the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. In fact, that\u2019s how I came across this condo. They were renovating the building while I was working on the mural, and well, you know the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. I didn\u2019t realize you were right across from it. I go there a lot and eat lunch, but I approach it from another direction.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of his coffee, so close to me by that time, I could hear him gulp it down. \u201cWhy do you go there and eat lunch? I didn\u2019t know they had a restaurant over there. Unless you include the hot dog vendors on the corner.\u201d</p><p>I giggled and looked back at him. The sunlight was hitting his green eyes, and I almost fainted.\u201cVery cute! No, they don\u2019t have a restaurant. It\u2019s just that my office is not that far away, and I love the mural, so I walk over here and eat the lunch I bring from home. Walking is good exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom where I\u2019m sitting, you don\u2019t need any exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you\u2019re standing and not sitting, I\u2019ll take that as an almost compliment.\u201d I brushed past him, catching a whiff of his aftershave and the soap residue left over from a shower he obviously took before my arrival. \u201cShall we get down to business?\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the sofa, opened my briefcase, andstarted pulling out the presentation folder I had rushed to prepare that morning, since I had no idea he would agree to see me the very next day after we met.</p><p>\u201cHold up.\u201d He put his hand on top of mine, pushing the folder back into the briefcase. \u201cBasically, you want to take some of my works, turn them into marketable, affordable prints, and then sell them through your arts business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s exactly what I want to do. Now, if you\u2019ll allow me to show you some figures I worked out, we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. I trust you, and we can do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I was shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re agreeing to it just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I made some phone calls last night and checked you out. It\u2019s all good. Anyway, I\u2019ve been thinking of doing a venture like this for quite some time.\u201d</p><p>I was ecstatic and had to keep myself from jumping up and doing cartwheels. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it\u2019s a deal, and we can work on all the figures at a later date.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand to shake it. \u201cDeal!\u201d He held true to form and kissed it instead.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you have a lot to do today, so I\u2019ll get out of your way. Thanks so much for the opportunity to market your work for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I closed my briefcase and got up, headed for the door. He followed me, grabbing me by the elbow and swinging me around. \u201cJust a sec. Why are you always running away from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running! Don\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201d Damn shame he was so right! \u201cI just know you have things to do.\u201d Ipointed to the canvas on the easel. \u201cLike painting the governor and awesome things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, well, you know, you\u2019re not the first person who has asked me to do this whole business thing.\u201d</p><p>I had never thought of it that way. A man as talented as he was must have received offers on a daily basis. I looked him in his sexy, mesmerizing eyes and asked, \u201cThen why did you tell me yes?\u201d</p> <p>He started pressing up against me, and I backed up until I ran out of space and my ass was pinned against the door. \u201cZoe, I was hoping you would do something for me as well.\u201d</p><p>Talk about being a nervous fucking wreck! I wasn\u2019t sure whether to ask what he wanted or not. I was afraid I might like the request a little too much. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really.\u201d</p><p>I could feel his breath on my cheek. \u201cWhat might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me paint you.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, my mind registered him saying, \u201cLet me fuck you.\u201d Wishful thinking, I suppose.</p><p>\u201cPaint me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, paint you.\u201d He took his hand and removed a piece of lint off my black tweed business suit. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. I want to paint you. Free of charge, of course, and I want to hang the portrait of you over my bed.\u201d</p><p>I started stuttering when his bare chest pressed up against my hard nipples through my blouse. \u201cWhat, umm, I mean, why do you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>As long as there is a breath in my body, I\u2019ll never forget-the next words he spoke to me. \u201cI want to paint you and hang it over my bed so when you are here, we can make love underneath your splendor, and when we areapart, I can behold your beauty and satisfy myself just by the mere thought of you.\u201d</p><p>My lips started trembling, and I began to feel lightheaded. Maybe all of the blood rushed to my throbbing pussy like it does to a man\u2019s dick when he becomes aroused. Hell if I know. All I did know was my ass was about to be in a world of trouble. I had never thought about fucking another man before I laid eyes on Quinton, and I should\u2019ve run. I should\u2019ve never been there in the first place, but I was there, and he was real, and the desire to be with him was hypnotizing.</p> <p>When he kissed me, I tried to push him away. Okay, I tried to push him away with just a teeny bit of effort. His kiss was soft and deep all at the same time. It reminded me of the way Jason used to kiss me way back in the beginning. He reached down, picked me up, and pressed my back against the door. I straddled my legs around his back. My pussy was so freakin\u2019 wet.</p><p>Our kisses got more profound, and I should\u2019ve stopped him. Looking back, I realize there are so many things I should\u2019ve done differently. I\u2019m so ashamed about what happened next.</p><p>He carried me over to the sofa, laid me down on it, and traced a path down my body with his mouth, pausing to gently nibble on my covered nipples. He pulled on them, one at a time, with his teeth, and I could see my breasts expand through my silk blouse as he moved his head back and forth.</p><p>I sat up and tried to put my feet on the floor so I could get up. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this! I\u2019m married!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happily. If you were happily married, you wouldn\u2019t have kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019mveryhappily married, and I have to go. This just isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing has ever felt so right. You know it and I know it. You want me just as much as I want you.\u201d He started rubbing my thighs and pulling off my lace-top thigh-high silk stockings. \u201cJust lie back and relax, baby. I would never hurt you.\u201d</p><p>That was it! The moment I realized I was fighting a lost cause. My mind was saying no, but my body was saying yes, and my body won by a landslide. I lifted up my hips so he could pull my black lace panties down over my legs and off.</p> <p>I made one last attempt at salvaging my cheatless marriage record by whispering, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Then I buried my head into one of the toss pillows on his sofa, drowning my moans in it while I had my pussy eaten for the very first time.</p><p>chapterfourteen</p><p>Damn shame I did that! I let that man feast on me for a good hour, and unfortunately, I loved every minute of it. I had done extensive reading on cunnilingus, but of course, Jason didn\u2019t do anything but go downtown and window-shop. He never actually purchased</p><p>anything.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine cumming as many times back to back as I did. I lost count somewhere after twenty. Every time I tried to pull away, he would pull me back down toward him, whispering things like, \u201cGive me my pussy!\u201d and \u201cDamn, you taste delicious!\u201d</p><p>He was fingering me and pulling some of my juice out with his fingers so he could suck it off. Scared the living daylights out of me. When he finally came up for air and starting pulling down his silk pajama pants, I jumped up. I took a good look at him. His face and chest and hands were all smothered with my essence.</p><p>I started grabbing for my belongings, shoving mystockings and panties into the side pocket of my large purse. \u201cI really have to go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you taste me, baby?\u201d I looked up from the sofa, and his dick was all up in my face. I was so nervous! Lawd knows I had never sucked a dick!</p><p>I scooted down on the sofa to an available section where I could get up. \u201cI can\u2019t do that! Sorry! I\u2019m a married woman, and I love my husband very much! What we just did was wrong! Dead wrong!\u201d</p><p>He followed me to the door. I could feel the sticky substance rubbing between my upper thighs as I walked. \u201cIt may have been wrong, but we both wanted to do it.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to try to deny it. I did want him to eat me out so there was no point in even faking the funk. I looked Quinton dead in the eyes and admitted, \u201cYes, I did want it, but it can never happen again.\u201d</p><p>I opened the door and walked out in the hallway, finally feeling a bit out of danger of doing something else freaky with him. His pants were still down in the front, and I didn\u2019t even notice his dick bouncing around in the air until he reached down and covered it back up. \u201cSo, when will I see you again? To talk business, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right! Business!\u201d</p><p>I pushed the button on the elevator, which was one of those service elevators all warehouses have, with the gate you have to pull up and down. It arrived at the floor, and he came rushing up behind me to lift it. \u201cLet me get that for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>I got on, and he pulled the gate back down while I pushed the button for the garage level. As he was disappearing out of view headfirst, I heard him yell, \u201cI\u2019m sure you will be!\u201d</p><p>Driving the few blocks to my building, I broke out in a cold sweat. I parked my car and went up to my suite,informed my secretary, Shane, to hold all my calls, and retreated to the sanctuary of my private office. Once I locked the door, I pulled the chain to close the vertical blinds. Even though I was on the tenth floor, you never know who may be watching.</p><p>I took one of the wooden African figures that a fellow arts dealer shipped me from Africa off my desk. It was a small head sitting on a wooden base, it was carved in the image of an African tribesman.</p><p>The head was round like a dildo, and I didn\u2019t hesitate to throw my leg up on my desk and stick it in my pussy headfirst. The cold, hard wood felt strange inside my pussy walls, but I figured fucking it was better than fucking Quinton, and lawd knows, I wanted to fuck him so bad right at the moment.</p><p>After I came all over my desk chair, I started thinking about the way he ate me out and how much I enjoyed it. If only Jason was open enough to experiment with sex, our love life would\u2019ve been so much better.</p><p>It was after ten when Jason and I finally got all the kids bathed and put to bed. He was lying on our king-size sleigh bed watching the news when I came up from checking to make sure the stove was off and all the doors were locked.As fine as Quinton was, he couldn\u2019t compare to my husband. Jason has always been, and will always be, the finest man in the world to me. He was wearing a pair of white cotton pajama pants, and as usual, he had left the matching shirt of the set on the bed for me. We often did that, split a pair of pajamas. I grabbed the shirt off the bed and headed toward the master bath. \u201cI\u2019m about to grab a quick shower, Boo. Wanna join me?\u201d</p><p>I knew what his answer would be before he replied.\u201cNo, baby. Go ahead. I\u2019m going to catch the rest of the news.\u201d</p><p>Jason never wanted to shower or bathe together. It seemed like anything that would have brought us closer together physically was a taboo to him. I got in the shower. The warm water felt great hitting up against my skin. I thought about Quinton, all the things he had said and done to me. I realized no matter what, I had to avoid seeing him again at all costs, even if that meant forgetting about the business deal. It was inevitable what would happen between us, and I couldn\u2019t allow it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As I dried off, I looked into the huge mirror that spanned the entire length of the double-sink vanity. My body had changed a lot over the years, but my breasts were still erect and firm, and my ass was nice and round. My skin was flawless, something that has more to do with genetics than anything else. So many times, I thought the sex problems with Jason and I were my fault. A lack of attraction on his part. That night, I decided to find out.</p><p>\u201cJason, look at me.\u201dHe ignored me and opted to catch the sports section of the news instead. I walked in front of the television and cut it off.</p><p>\u201cZoe, why did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want you to look at me.\u201d I was butt naked.</p> <p>He sat up on the bed and glanced at me. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m looking. You need to put some clothes on before you catch a cold. Remember how sick you got last year after we went on that ski trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean really look at me. After all the years we\u2019ve been together, you\u2019re still uncomfortable looking at my nude body, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd!\u201d Jason really did look at me then, tracing the outline of my body with his eyes just like Quinton did at the school cafeteria. \u201cYou\u2019re very beautiful, Zoe, but you already know that. That\u2019s why I married your crazy ass.\u201d</p><p>I went over to the bed, pushed him on his back, and climbed on top of him. \u201cOh, so you married me for my looks, huh? Damn shame! All this time I thought you married me because you admired the way I beat your ass the first day we met.\u201d</p><p>We both started laughing, and he tickled me. I was laughing so hard because we were on the bed tussling about like we were kids again. \u201cI thought I told you never to bring that shit up. Besides, you were taller than me back then.\u201d</p> <p>I started laughing so hard, I was crying. \u201cWe have to make sure we tell the kids all about the day I gave you a beatdown when they get older.\u201d</p><p>He started laughing as he climbed on top of me and pinned my hands down with his own. \u201cFuck you, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>I stopped laughing and looked him in his beautiful hazel eyes. \u201cJason, that\u2019s exactly what I want you to do. Fuck me!\u201d</p><p>The mention of sex immediately threw him back into his shell. He climbed off me, propped up a pillow, and lay back down. Then he reached for the remote off the nightstand and turned the news back on.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d I whispered in his ear, propping myself up on the pillow beside him, \u201cI was thinking we could, maybe and only if you want to.\u201d I was so nervous, I couldn\u2019t barely get the words out. \u201cMaybe we could try oral sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, that\u2019s disgusting! I\u2019ve already told you fifty million times how I feel about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s disgusting unless you try it?\u201d Ipulled the string on his pajama pants and was pleasantly surprised when he didn\u2019t stop me from pulling his dick out.</p><p>I moved down on the bed and rubbed his erection with my hand. I laid there for a few minutes, my head resting on his thigh, just enjoying the sight of it, the veins popping out of it and the way it was pulsating inside my palm. Jason had never let me play with him like that before, and I got excited thinking all our sexual problems were about to come to an end. I convinced myself he was finally ready to explore other horizons, be more creative in bed, give me all the things I had always read and dreamed about.</p><p>Jason set my ass straight when I tried to put my mouth on his dick. He yanked my hand off him and pulled his pants back up. \u201cZoe, what did I tell you? I don\u2019t want to do that! Not now! Not ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jason, I want to taste you so bad. Why can\u2019t I?\u201d I was devastated.</p><p>\u201cI know what it is!\u201d he exclaimed, shaking his finger all up in my face. \u201cBrina and the rest of your hussy girlfriends have been drilling their nasty sexual escapades into your head. You need to leave all those bitches the hell alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, bitches! Did I stutter or something?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe I tried to suck my own husband\u2019s dick and was about to have an argument with him instead. \u201cFirst of all, this has nothing to do with Brina or anybody else. This is about me and you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d He turned the television off, and the lamp on the nightstand. Then he turned away from me on the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, I think it\u2019s best we just leave this whole subject matter alone. I don\u2019t want to argue with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want</p><p>to argue either. I love you.\u201d I started rubbing his back. He pulled away from me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you sound like a straight-up ho sometimes, and you aren\u2019t a ho. You\u2019re a married woman with children and responsibilities. All of your friends are too busy hanging out seeing how many men they can bed down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say another word to him. He fell asleep within minutes, and I got up from the bed and went down to the kitchen to put on a pot of blackberry tea. Sitting there on our screened-in porch, drinking my tea and listening to all the birds and animals making noises somewhere out in the trees, I became enraged. I was angry about Jason and his lack of affection toward me. I knew he loved me, but he always became irate and resentful whenever I broached the subject of our sex life, or lack thereof.</p><p>I was frustrated with myself for settling for his limitations and not demanding more. I had tried to talk to him so many times but he always ended up saying I was acting like a ho. Then I thought about it. Why shouldn\u2019t I become a ho? Why shouldn\u2019t my sex life be just as exciting as Brina\u2019s and my other girlfriends\u2019? Jason was right about that one thing. I did hear all about their sexual escapades, and it made me jealous. I was sick of hearing about great sex. I wanted tohavegreat sex.</p><p>I returned to bed and stared at Jason in the dark. Then I looked up at the stars, wondering why things had to be like this. Before I fell off into a deep slumber, I had already made up my mind. If Jason wouldn\u2019t give me the love andaffection I needed, I would find it in the arms of another man. I would find it in the arms of Quinton Matthews.</p><p>Contrary to all the nonsense I talked to myself that night about fooling around with Quinton, I lost my nerve. For two weeks, I didn\u2019t call him or go anywhere near him. I loved my husband, and betraying him was not going to be as easy emotionally as I thought.I considered asking Jason to go to a marriage counselor with me, but I knew good and damn well he would get angry. I threw myself deeper into my work and started working longer hours at the office. Jason complained because he often had to change his schedule around to accommodate mine, so I did what most women do in a time of crisis. I called my mother.</p><p>After very little convincing, my mother agreed to watch her grandchildren three evenings a week so her baby girl could pursue her career. Besides, she always complained about not getting to see Peter and the twins enough, and I think Aubrey was beginning to get on her last nerve at home. So it was a done deal, and it gave me a well-deserved break from rushing home to cook dinner every night, helping with homework, breaking up fights between siblings, and on and on.</p><p>It was on one of the evenings I was working late at the office that I decided to relinquish my wedding vows and go see Quinton Matthews. It had been a very stressful day, and when I called Jason to seek comfort in his words, he told me he would have to get back with me and then hung up on me without saying \u2019bye.I decided to go for a walk in the cool air to clear myhead and ended up at the MARTA station where my favorite mural was located. I sat there on the bench, thinking about the fact that Quinton was so close. His building was right across the street. I looked up at his loft and saw that the lights were on. I played out the best- and worst-case scenarios in my mind, and to be honest, none of them made me feel comfortable. Finally, I decided I wanted to know what real sex felt like, if only once.</p><p>When I got off the elevator on his floor, I noticed there was a young woman taking some garbage down to the trash chute. She was obviously the other tenant on the floor, and her door had been left ajar. I knocked on Quinton\u2019s door and got no answer, so I knocked harder.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, is he home?\u201d</p><p>She came prancing down the hall toward me, and I noticed she was wearing a dance leotard and tights. She felt my eyes on her. \u201cOh, \u2019cuse the way I\u2019m dressed. I\u2019m a professional ballerina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my parents bought me this loft so I could have plenty of practice space. I think they kind of wanted my ass out the house anyway, you know?\u201d She started smiling, and I returned the gesture, hoping she would not embark on telling me her whole life story.</p><p>I repeated my earlier question. \u201cIs Quinton home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I saw him leave out about ten minutes ago. You just missed him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh okay, thanks!\u201d</p><p>I turned to get back on the elevator. \u201cListen, he went over to the movie theater on Spring Street to catch that new Denzel movie. If you hurry, you can get there while the previews are still showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll just catch up to him some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, but he went to the movies alone, and I\u2019m sure he would appreciate the company of a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>I blushed, wondering why this girl would be telling me all this. \u201cThanks for the tip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>I swung around to face her. \u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinton and I are real close friends, and let\u2019s just say, he\u2019s mentioned you.\u201d She started giggling. \u201cOnnumerousoccasions, I might add. He was hoping you would come back around.\u201d</p><p>I was so flattered, and I\u2019m sure it showed all over my face. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I must say, he described your ass to a tee. You are very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d The elevator finally arrived and I pulled the gate up to get on. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, Zoe. By the way, I\u2019m Diamond.\u201d</p><p>I got on the elevator and pulled the gate back down. \u201cNice to meet you, Diamond.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the button for the garage, and the elevator started going down. \u201cAnd Zoe, if you ever decide to take a walk on the wild side with another woman, I\u2019d just love to turn your fine ass out!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe she said that shit to me. All sorts of things started going through my mind. Was Quinton fucking her, or were they just friends? Did he tell her he ate my pussy? Was I about to bite off more than I could chew?</p><p>I didn\u2019t have the answers to the questions, but nevertheless, less than five minutes later I found myself parkingoutside the movie theater. On the way in, I decided I would pretend to just accidentally bump into him, but I knew that wouldn\u2019t work, since Quinton and Diamond obviously told each other everything. So I bought my ticket, went into the dark theater and didn\u2019t even try to hide the fact I was there looking for him. I went from aisle to aisle whispering his name until I heard him call out, \u201cZoe, over here!\u201d</p><p>He was sitting on the far end of an aisle, right beside the wall, and I joined him. The theater was not crowded at all, maybe thirty people tops, and everyone was spread out. \u201cSo, what brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say the real answer. I couldn\u2019t say I had come for some dick. \u201cDiamond told me where to find you, so I decided to join you. Is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hell no. I\u2019m glad to see you. You had me worried I might not ever see you again.\u201d He reached over and grabbed a hold of my hand, pulled it up to his lips, and kissed it.</p><p>For the next hour or so, we sat there in silencewatching-He Got Game. We held hands, and I was shaking like a leaf. Quinton told me he was going to grab some nachos and a drink from the concession stand and asked me if I wanted anything. I told him I would take a soda, and he said, \u201cOkay, be right back.\u201d</p><p>I was desperately horny, and as soon as he disappeared up the aisle, I started rubbing my nipples through my blouse. I knew there was something wrong with me, even back then. Thinking about sex twenty-four/seven and playing with myself day and night had to be a sign\u2014 a sign I was not willing to recognize.</p><p>Quinton came back with the nachos and drinks. I quickly returned my hands to my lap, pretending to beMs. Innocent. But when he sat back down next to me, something snapped.</p><p>I reached over and started caressing his dick through his jeans, and he was clearly pleased. \u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about, Zoe. You want me to pull it out for you?\u201d</p> <p>I quickly replied, \u201cYes, pull it out.\u201d</p><p>He unzipped his jeans and whipped out his dick, already hard. \u201cNow, what are you going to do with Timex now that he\u2019s come out to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmmm, Timex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he takes a licking and keeps on ticking.\u201d We both started laughing, and I almost choked on the soda I had just sucked up through a straw.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. What shall I do with him?\u201d I was a nervous wreck, but not about to back down.</p><p>I sat my drink down on the floor, took the cup of warm cheese sauce that came with the nachos, and poured half of it all over his dick. He flinched. \u201cOops, my bad, let me get that for you.\u201d</p><p>I leaned over the seat and started to lick the cheese off his dick. Then I got up and moved in between his legs, kneeling down on the floor so I could get more access. I started</p><p>sucking his dick like a pro. One would have thought I had years of experience, even though it was my first time. All that reading really paid off; Quinton was moaning like crazy and holding on to the armrests of his seat for dear life.</p><p>I sucked the head first, and was hooked on the taste of a man\u2019s juices from the second some of his precum hit the back of my throat. The shit was on from that point. I deep-throated that bitch and loved it. I almost gagged a few times, but I caught a rhythm and sucked the shaft and caressed his balls until he came in my mouth. He started trembling and acting like he was having a seizure.I was hesitant to let his dick out of my mouth, even when it got soft. I wanted some more.</p><p>I sat there for a few minutes, gently licking and sucking his balls, before I got up and announced, \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, you have to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get home. Enjoy the rest of your movie.\u201d I was gathering my coat and purse.</p><p>He started getting loud with me in the theater. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy! Always running away! You\u2019re just going to come in here, suck my dick, and leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh! Keep your voice down. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m about to do. Leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget this movie. Let\u2019s go back to my place. I want to be with you.\u201d He started feeling all over my thighs, trying to get his hand between my legs, but I wouldn\u2019t let him.</p><p>\u201cQuinton, I have to go. It\u2019s been real, and thanks for the, ummmm, whatever you want to call it.\u201d</p><p>He sat there shaking his head as I made my way to the center aisle. I turned back toward him. \u201cBesides, I owed you that from the last time. One good lick deserves another.\u201d</p><p>When I got in my car and started the ignition, Quinton startled me by preventing me from shutting the driver\u2019s side with his hand.</p><p>\u201cZoe, you can\u2019t leave me like that,\u201d he said seductively, making me weak in the knees even though I was sitting down. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to my place and talk. Just talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Quinton. I really do need to get home. It\u2019s getting late.\u201d I was determined to hold my ground until he started running his fingers through my hair and I lost it.</p><p>\u201cCome take a ride with me,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI want to show you something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like what?\u201d I inquired, full of curiosity.</p><p>\u201cSomething I\u2019m positive you will like.\u201d He could tell I was about to give in and leaned over to cut off my engine and remove my keys. He pulled me up out of the car. \u201cThere\u2019s one little condition though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d I asked with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cLet me blindfold you.\u201d</p><p>Now common sense should have told me to take my ass home, but I didn\u2019t. I followed him to his car, got in, and sat there patiently while he looked in the back for something to cover my eyes with.</p><p>\u201cCan Ipleasetake this blindfold off now?\u201d Quinton had stopped his car and walked around to open up the passenger door for me. I could feel the cool night air rush inside, in direct contrast to the heat that had warmed up the interior of the car during the ride over.\u201cNot yet,\u201d Quinton replied. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>I reached my hand out. He pulled me up and out of the car. The first thing I realized was that we were standing on some sort of gravel. Now I knew what the noise had been when I heard something hitting up against his tires a few seconds before the car came to a halt. \u201cWhere are we, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice some patience, my dear.\u201d He led me by the hand and pushed my hips backward so I was sitting on the hood of the car, the engine still warm underneath my bottom. \u201cI want to make sure your first look is a perfect one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first look at what?\u201d I was getting nervous. Why, I have no idea. I had just got finished waxing his dick in amovie theater, after all. That\u2019s the one thing I was sure he wasn\u2019t planning to show me. I already had an eagle\u2019s-eye view of that bad boy. \u201cCome on, take the blindfold off, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more second.\u201d I heard him walking around, and then the driver\u2019s-side door opened. A minute later I heard \u201cGot to Give It Up\u201d by Marvin Gaye blaring from the car stereo. Before I knew it, Quinton kissed me gently on the nape of my neck and climbed on the hood beside me. \u201cI used to listen to this song all the time when I was a kid, eleven years old to be exact. I would bring a little tape player out here and play it over and over again while I worked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWorked?\u201d I was completely lost. \u201cYou had a job when you were eleven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d he replied, untying the blindfold and letting it fall in my lap. \u201cI was working on this.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open in awe at the vision before me. We were by the railroad tracks in SWATS beside an old, deteriorated and abandoned warehouse. Quinton\u2019s headlights were on, illuminating the most magnificent mural I had ever seen. I covered my mouth to keep my tongue from falling out while I climbed down off the hood to take a closer look.</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, Quinton! You did this when you were eleven years old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started it when I was eleven,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt took me almost five years to finish it, though. It\u2019s the first mural I ever painted,andthe most special.\u201d</p><p>The mural was of an African-American family sitting around a gigantic wooden table eating dinner\u2014 everything from a big, juicy turkey to corn on the cob to collard greens. A huge fire blazed in the background, both a cat and a dog were sitting on the hearth, playing with aball of red yarn together. The features of the people were so intense, so descriptive, right down to the wrinkles on the mother\u2019s brow. There were five people in the picture: a man, a woman, and three beautiful children. The youngest little boy resembled Quinton so much, there was no mistaking it was him.</p><p>\u201cIs this a mural of your family, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my family was fucked the hell up.\u201d I turned around in astonishment, not expecting such a negative response. The pain was written all over his face. \u201cMy father left my mother for a white woman when I was five. My mother let herself go after that until there was nothing left. When I was nine, she killed herself. She slit her wrists over the kitchen sink while she was washing dishes. Just decided she had endured enough bullshit from everyone, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>I rushed back over to him and drew him into my arms, letting his head rest against my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him on the forehead and he drew away. \u201cWhy are you sorry? You didn\u2019t have a damn thing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>An uneasy feeling began to wash over me. There was anger in his voice, bordering on hatred. I began to wonder what I was doing there in the first place. I should\u2019ve been home with my husband and kids, where I belonged. \u201cWhy did you bring me here, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted you to see it,\u201d he answered in a low, husky voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never shown this to anyone before. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I stated cautiously. \u201cWho are the people-in the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the family I wished I had. They\u2019re the family I should\u2019ve had. Instead, my older brother and sister and I ended up living with our grandmother. She tried thebest she could, but her heart was broken after my mother\u2019s suicide. I think every time she looked at us, it reminded her of her own failures. She always blamed herself for my mother, but it wasn\u2019t her fault. It was that bitch-ass father of mine who did it.\u201d He walked over to the wall and started fingering his mother\u2019s eyes lightly. \u201cDo you know that bastard didn\u2019t even have the decency to come to her funeral? He was off in Hawaii with that white bitch of his, lying on the fucking beach!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Quinton!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying you\u2019re sorry, dammit!\u201d he screamed at me. I started trembling in fear. He must\u2019ve recognized it, because he came over and wrapped his arms around my waist. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I replied hesitantly. \u201cI just can\u2019t think of any other words.\u201d</p><p>He looked me deep in my eyes. \u201cThen don\u2019t say any more words.\u201d</p><p>Our kiss began, and to this day, I\u2019m not sure where the passion in my lips came from. All I know is it did, and it was earth-shattering. Before I knew it, we were both naked, making love on the hood of his car. We didn\u2019t say another word to each other. The whole time I kept staring into the eyes of the woman in the picture, wondering how much pain she must have been in to take her own life that way.</p><p>Quinton and I exploded in unison. I struggled to breathe because I had never had an orgasm like that before, not even when I masturbated, and trust me, I had that shit down to a science.</p><p>Quinton finally broke the silence. \u201cZoe, I know that this is wrong,\u201d he whispered, sucking gently on my left nipple. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have these feelings for another man\u2019s wife, but I do.\u201d At that point, I didn\u2019t know what my truefeelings were, so I remained mute. \u201cI just want you to know</p><p>that I don\u2019t have any great expectations. I just want to be with you whenever and wherever I can.\u201d</p><p>My mind flashed back to Jason. I pictured him sitting at home in his drawing room, waiting patiently for me to come home to him. I pictured my kids tucked snugly in their beds, dreaming of faraway lands and fairy princesses. I sat up abruptly and started feeling around for my clothes so I could get dressed.</p> <p>\u201cQuinton, I don\u2019t know what to say right now. Something special just happened between us. I realize that, and just so you know, I\u2019ve never cheated on my husband before.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through my hair. \u201cI know you haven\u2019t.\u201d He started sucking on my earlobe, and my body yearned to give in to his desires all over again. \u201cI know this is confusing, but we can make this work, somehow.\u201d</p><p>I got lost in his eyes and I could have sworn my heart stopped beating for a brief second. \u201cCan we go back to the theater to get my car now? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d He put on his clothes, and we rode back to the theater in silence. He rewound the Marvin Gaye tape and sang the words so low they were barely audible.</p><p>When we were pulling into the parking lot, I asked him, \u201cWhat ever happened to your brother and sister, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather not discuss that right now,\u201d he replied, taking my hand and kissing my fingers one at a time. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d</p><p>I let it go. He saw me to my car and made me promise to be in touch soon. I reluctantly promised. What I should\u2019ve done is told him to stay away from me. That I was no good. That we were no good together.</p><p>When I got home, everyone was asleep. I took a quickshower to rinse away my sins and joined Jason in bed. He draped his arm and leg over me and whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d in my ear, halfway between being awake and being asleep. I kept my back to him and stayed awake for the remainder of the night, letting the tears trickle down my cheeks onto the pillowcase.</p><p>chapterfifteen</p><p>Quinton and I started seeing-each other on a regular basis after that, and while I felt guilty, I couldn\u2019t stop. It felt too damn good. I stayed away from him for about three days after the little movie theater/train yard episode, and then I decided to go over to his place. I must admit I knew he and I would end up fucking if I went over there. That was exactly what I wanted, and that was exactly what I got.</p><p>It was about dusk when I showed up at Quinton\u2019s loft. He answered the door wearing an apron, and the aroma of his cooking hit me as soon as I got off the elevator.</p><p>\u201cZoe, what a pleasant surprise! Come on in!\u201d He moved aside so I could enter his loft.</p><p>\u201cDid I catch you at a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. In fact, your timing is perfect. Now I don\u2019t have to eat alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not really that hungry, but I could use a glass of wine if you have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Have a seat, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He went into the kitchen and returned a moment later with a bottle of red wine and two wineglasses. He poured me a glass and walked over to the sofa to hand it to me. \u201cZoe, take your shoes off. Make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I will.\u201d I kicked my black high-heeled pumps off and leaned back on the sofa to sip on the wine. \u201cSo, what you got cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to try this recipe for lasagna I saw on a cable cooking show earlier today.\u201d</p><p>I started giggling. \u201cYou watch cooking shows? Wow, you are full of surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d He starting eyeing me all over again, and for the first time, it didn\u2019t make me feel uncomfortable in the least. After sucking his dick with nacho cheese on it, among other things, shyness was no longer an option. \u201cLet me go take it out of the oven so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d</p><p>I decided to be nosy again and took a peek at his easel. He had removed the portrait of the governor and replaced it with a portrait of a beautiful African-American woman. I was immediately jealous. \u201cShe\u2019s the wife of a friend. She asked me to paint her portrait as an anniversary gift for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>He walked up behind me and covered the portrait back up with the oilcloth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. This dick\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, is that right?\u201d</p><p>He started blowing in my ear. \u201cDamn skippy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He took me by the hand and started leading me up the steps. \u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaking you to bed. You have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. You\u2019re trippin\u2019, assuming I came over here to fuck you.\u201d I pulled my hand away from his, and he came closer to me, pressing his chest against mine and grabbing me around the waist.</p><p>\u201cThat is what you came over here for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell naw! I hate to bruise your male ego but I came over here to discuss business.\u201d He and I both knew I was full of shit.</p><p>\u201cYeah right, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, well, whatever. I should be going now because you\u2019re buggin\u2019.\u201d I started walking over to where my shoes were so I could put them on when he picked me up and flung me over his left shoulder. My ass was all up in his face. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>He carried me up the steps, flung me down on his queen-size waterbed, and started undressing me. \u201cListen, Quinton, I didn\u2019t come here for this.For real!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen look me in the eyes, Zoe, and tell me you don\u2019t want me.\u201d He and I gazed at each other, and I wanted to tell him I didn\u2019t want him, but the words wouldn\u2019t come. \u201cEnough said. We already crossed the line the other night, Zoe. There\u2019s no turning back now. We need to finish the feelings.\u201d</p> <p>Quinton got me totally undressed and then removed all his clothes as well. The neon sign at the hotel across the street was blinking steadily, and flashes of red outlined his body as he stood at the foot of the bed. He spread my legs open with his hands, and after that we didn\u2019t say a word to each other. We just fucked.</p><p>He ate my pussy again and then stood on the edge of the bed. I figured out he was waiting on a blow job, so I complied and loved sucking it. When he came in my mouth, I was in heaven and probably moaned louder than he did. He started fucking me, and by the timeQuinton fucked me for twenty minutes, I was a maniac. I began to think my lack of experience showed, especially when he pulled me on top of him and I froze. I had no idea how to ride a dick. I was used to the missionary position only.</p><p>I gave it a try. He helped me by guiding my hips up and down until I got the hang of it. I had remembered reading somewhere to tighten my muscles while I\u2019m on top, and I did that. He started moaning real loud while I contracted my pussy muscles on his dick. I was so proud of myself. It may sound silly, but being sexually repressed as long as I was and finally getting fucked the right way twice in one week was one of the most stimulating events of my life.</p><p>The next six months were filled with confusion, guilt, and a newfound sexual freedom. Quinton took me to heights I had never known physically, and frankly, I became a nymphomaniac. There weren\u2019t enough hours in the day to have sex, and when I wasn\u2019t with Quinton and Jason was ignoring me as usual, I began to masturbate ten times more than usual.I even masturbated with an umbrella once in my car. It was a rainy day, and I had to pull over because it was pouring down too hard to drive. I parked underneath an underpass and didn\u2019t make it five minutes without playing with myself. My obsession with sex was getting way out of hand, but it was beyond my control.</p><p>Quinton was just as creative sexually as he was with a paintbrush. He taught me so much about sex, including how to 72, a variation of the old 69, where three fingers are inserted into the ass for extended pleasure. He turned me on to liquid latex. We poured it over each other\u2019s bodiesand let it harden before we fucked each other. The only parts that weren\u2019t covered were my nipples, my pussy, my ass, and his dick. It was a wild sensation. It felt like wearing a tight, full-body mask. I loved it.</p><p>Everything was going great. I had the husband of my dreams, who loved me and was a great father to our kids, and I had the lover of my dreams as well. Everything was perfect, or so I thought.</p> <p>\u201cZoe, sit still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to, but my back is itching.\u201d I was sitting on one of the velvet-covered crates, posing for Quinton while he painted a portrait of me. It was the second one. He had already painted one and hung it over his bed, just like he said he would. He wanted another one to hang in the studio itself.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let me scratch it for you then.\u201d He put down his paint palette and came over to put me out my misery.</p><p>I started laughing while he scratched my bare back. \u201cThat tickles!\u201d</p><p>I was nude from the waist up, having agreed to let Quinton paint me that way. I was becoming bolder by the day. \u201cZoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>I thought he was going to say something like he wanted to fuck or wanted to go out</p><p>and grab a bite to eat, but never in a million years could I have been prepared for what came out of his mouth. \u201cI want you to leave him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmm, say what?\u201d I was frozen like a Popsicle.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave your husband and move in here with me. I want you to do it like yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I got up from the crate and put on Quinton\u2019s silk bathrobe I had laying nearby. \u201cQuinton, you know I can\u2019t leave Jason! Not now! Not ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Well, then, Zoe, we have a serious problem.\u201d</p><p>I started caressing his dick through his pants. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t have any problems, Boo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d He pushed my hand away from his crotch and walked over to the window. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out anymore. I need you to be here with me all night, every night. Not just when it suits you. This isn\u2019t fair to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinton, you knew from jump I was married. Why did you get involved with me if you wanted more?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, looked at me, and threw his hands up in the air. \u201cHell if I know. I just had to have you. From the moment I first laid eyes on you, I knew you were the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can\u2019t be the one. Not in that way.\u201d I started up the steps to get dressed. \u201cI\u2019ll leave and I won\u2019t ever bother you again if you don\u2019t want me to. I promise. I\u2019m sorry, Quinton. I never expected things to turn out like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t going anywhere!\u201d He caught up to me on the stairs, tore the robe off me, and pushed me down on one of the steps. Then he took his dick out his pants, moved my panties to the side with his fingers, and fucked me right there on the steps. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it your way. I would rather have a part of you than nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>For a brief moment I feared him. There were times when he seemed to have an evil side to him, but I could never pinpoint it. I would often try to ask him about his older brother and sister, but he would become tense and change the subject. The only halfway decent response I ever received from him was, \u201cThey\u2019re long gone!\u201d I had no idea what that meant.</p><p>Driving home that night, I wondered whether I should break it off with Quinton for good. In my heart, I knew it was the right thing to do, and only trouble couldcome out of it if I continued the affair. He had laid his cards on the table and made me well aware of his wants and desires. Continuing to fuck him meant three things: trouble for him, trouble for me, and trouble for my marriage. But I couldn\u2019t stop. I was straight-up hooked. I was addicted.</p><p>chaptersixteen</p><p>\u201cPeter, get Kyle down off of there before he falls and busts his head open!\u201d It was family outing day, and Jason and I had taken all the kids to the park for a picnic.</p><p>\u201cZoe, don\u2019t yell at them like that. Let boys be boys.\u201d</p><p>I sat back down on the blanket next to Jason, after being comfortably sure Kyle wouldn\u2019t fall off the jungle gym. \u201cJason, you talk that mess now, but you\u2019ll be the first one having a panic attack if one of them gets hurt.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me. \u201cWell, you have a point there.\u201d</p><p>Jason looked so gorgeous with the sunlight shining across his face and the breeze blowing through his curly hair. \u201cSo, how\u2019s work been going, Boo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m trying to finish up the blueprints on the new civic center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re really coming into your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>I started picking at the grass, pulling blades of it up and tossing it aside. I was trying to figure out a way to talk to him about sex. I was so scared. Kind of like the people on talk shows who bring their lovers halfway across the country to tell them something because they didn\u2019t have the nerve to tell them in the privacy of their own homes. \u201cJason, I think I have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat problem is that, Boo?\u201d</p><p>He was sitting there munching on some seedless grapes, intently watching me for a reply, and there was no way in hell I could come out and tell him I had been fucking another man, so I settled for a different approach. \u201cI don\u2019t think my fascination with sex is normal. Some pretty strange things have been happening lately.\u201d</p><p>I knew immediately he would get nervous. The mere mention of sexalwaysmade him nervous. He started looking away from me, pretending to be spellbound by a flock of birds. \u201cStrange things like what, Zoe?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My big chance had finally arrived. It was time to come clean and confess everything. \u201cJason, I\u2019ve been mastur\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMOMMY!\u201dJason was up off the ground before I was, rushing to see what was the matter. Kyle had indeed fallen off the jungle gym and scraped a knee. After I cleaned the wound with a towelette and put a bandage on it from the first-aid kit Jason kept in the Land Rover, Jason gave him a piggyback ride around the playground area to cheer him up.</p><p>So much for coming clean. I had the other two kids help me gather up all the picnic items and put them in the truck. On the drive home, Jason came up with what he thought was the solution to all of my problems. \u201cZoe, about what you were saying before, I think you\u2019re just stressed out from working too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never got a chance to tell you what I meant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but we can\u2019t discuss it in front of the kids. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d My heart felt like stopping. \u201cLike I was saying, I think you\u2019ve just been working too hard. Why don\u2019t you call up Brina and plan a girls\u2019 night out or something? I\u2019ll watch the kids.\u201d</p><p>Little did he know, in the past few months I had barely gotten any work done at all, since I was spending more time at Quinton\u2019s loft than at the office. \u201cOkay, Jason, maybe I\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>I decided hanging out with Brina wasn\u2019t such a bad idea. It had been ages since we spent some time alone, just the two of us, and I was hoping she would be more receptive to my problems than Jason. I needed someone to talk to, and my husband was obviously not the one.</p><p>After we got home, I called Brina and left a message on her voice mail, telling her I wanted to get together that night. She called me back while I was soaking in the tub, and Jason brought me the cordless. He acted like he was embarrassed to look at me naked and handed me the phone with his eyes averted.</p><p>Brina and I decided to meet at a club downtown about eleven. I threw on a white spandex dress with white heels and pushed my hair up in a bun. Jason kissed me good-bye and told me to have a nice time. Then I was on my way.</p> <p>When I got to the club, the Zoo, it was pandemonium in its finest form. I\u2019ve never seen so many people sweating to get into a club before in my life. I waited on the sidewalk, opposite the red velvet rope where people were lined up awaiting a chance to get in, and looked at every car that drove by, wishing Brina would hurry the hell up. I was going to suggest we go someplace else when she got there because I didn\u2019t think we had a prayer of getting in the place anytime soon.</p><p>She finally came strutting up the sidewalk about eleven-thirty, having parked around the block where I didn\u2019t see her pull up. Girlfriend wasn\u2019t playing either. I thought my dress was bordering on hoochie, but Brina\u2019s was straight-up slutty. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure you could call it a dress. Less than 30 percent of her body was covered, so it was more like a rag. Girlfriend had her torso, her arms, her legs, and half her ass exposed. She was sporting that black hoochie mama shit too.</p><p>\u201cDamn, \u2019bout time, Brina! I was getting ready to go home and take my ass to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Sis.\u201d We hugged and kissed each other on the cheek. \u201cI was trying to make sure I had everything in the right place before I left out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much to put in the right place. Your ass is half naked.\u201d She gave me a slight punch in the arm, and we both laughed.</p><p>\u201cZoe, shaddup, Sis!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrina, look at this line. We have a better chance of getting in a Michael Jackson concert. Let\u2019s go someplace else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. We\u2019re going up in this bitch right here. Follow-me, Sis.\u201d</p><p>I followed her and thought she had lost her damn mind when she bypassed the entire line of people waiting and walked straight up to the bouncers instead. \u201cHey, Snake, \u2019sup, Boo?\u201d</p><p>Damn shame she knew the man! I knew why he was nicknamed Snake right off the bat. His muscular arms were covered with snake tattoos, and to be honest, his face resembled a boa constrictor, but that\u2019s neither here nor there.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Sup, Brina? You\u2019re looking mighty fly tonight!\u201d She gave him a peck on the lips, and I wanted to hurl.</p><p>She pointed at me. \u201cThis is my best friend, Zoe. It\u2019s her first time here.\u201d</p><p>He shook my hand and held it while he gave me the once-over. \u201cNice to meet you, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>With that, he unhooked the rope and let us enter the club in front of all the others. \u201cYou ladies have a nice time.\u201d</p> <p>I joined Brina in saying, \u201cThanks, Snake!\u201d</p><p>Once we found two stools at the bar, I got all in Brina\u2019s business. \u201cI take it you come here a lot?\u201d</p><p>She lit a cigarette. I desperately wanted to take a pull but refused to even go there.\u201cGurrrrrrrrrlllllllllll,have I got some shit to tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I could use some good news, so tell me.\u201d</p><p>The bartender came over and took our drink orders. \u201cI started coming here about two months ago. A sistah from work turned me on to this bitch. Anyway, about the third time I fell up in here, I met this fine-ass nucca named Dempsey. We\u2019ve been talking ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go girl! I didn\u2019t know you had a new man. Tell me everything. I want all the details, and of course all the dirt.\u201d</p><p>The bartender returned with Brina\u2019s rum and coke and my banana daiquiri. For the next fifteen minutes, we sat there chatting and giggling while she told me all about her new love interest. Little did I know then that the Mr. Wonderful she was describing would end up beating her ass as a recreational sport in the near future.</p><p>I was a bit tipsy. Okay, I was tore the fuck up! I started looking around the club and decided it was a badass club. They had these cages with scantily clad dancers in them, both male and female, and they had live animals such as birds, raccoons, koala bears, and even a silver-back gorilla, all locked up in cages.</p><p>They were playing mostly reggae, and the dance floor was packed to the brim. The club had wall-to-wall fineass men in it. My ass had no business looking, but there was one who stood out from the rest like a black man at a Ku Klux Klan meeting. He was too damn fine but was surrounded by a shitload of woman trying to get in his pants, so I ordered another drink and just admired his fineness from afar.</p><p>He was tall,real tall,just like my husband, give an inch or two, dark like licorice and looked just as tasty. What really attracted me to him was his pearly-white smile, his dimples, and his round, muscular ass. I imagined his ass muscles contracting while he pumped his dick in and out of me. My mind was truly in the gutter.</p><p>\u201cBrina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sis?\u201d</p><p>I decided to come on out with it. \u201cI met this guy. A really famous African-American artist named Quinton Matthews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, what kind of art? Sculpting, painting, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainting. He\u2019s most famous for his murals, though. You know that mural we walked to from my office that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the one at the MARTA station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did that one.\u201d</p><p>This guy came up, interrupted me, and asked me to dance. He was a true countrified bama so I said, \u201cNo thanks!\u201d Besides, I really wanted to come clean with Brina.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. So how old is he? What does he look like? Hook a sister up, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>She was so far off base, it was pathetic! \u201cBrina, you just got finished telling me all about your new man like two seconds ago. Dempsey. Remember him?\u201d</p><p>We both giggled. \u201cHell, yeah, I remember him, but you know us bachelorettes need to have at least one man riding the bench at all times for backup purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re silly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just telling it like it is. All of us can\u2019t be lucky enough to find true love like the kind you and Jason have.\u201d</p><p>Damn, why did she have to say that! I lost my nerve. I was about to tell her I was having an affair, but how could I after she said that? Everyone on the outside looking in has always thought my life was perfect. Little did they know my life was barely satisfying at the best of times and pure agony at the worst. I was about to come on out with it anyway when this pimp daddy wannabe came up to us.</p><p>\u201cHey, lovely ladies. \u2019Sup now?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer, but Brina did. \u201c \u2019Sup with you?\u201d \u201cChillin\u2019, love. Just chillin\u2019.\u201d I pegged him to be one of those brothas who was chillin\u2019 twenty-four hours a day. \u201cWanna dance?\u201d</p><p>Brina looked at me as if she needed my permission. \u201cZoe, you mind?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe she would stoop that low for a dance, but I responded, \u201cNo, go for it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAight, girl. Hold my purse for me.\u201d I took her purse, and she made her way to the dance floor, after having a hell of a time even getting up off the bar stool with that damn hoochie dress on.</p><p>I was sitting there all by myself when the one I had my eye on came over and took Brina\u2019s place on the stool beside me. \u201cHello, beautiful!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice was deep, his eyes were mesmerizing, and he looked ten times finer up close than he did from the other side of the room. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust great, beautiful.\u201d Thebeautifulthing was turning my ass on big time. \u201cCare for a refill on your drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d He waved the bartender over to order another round. I checked him out from head to toe. Everything from his black, silky hair to his freshly polished wing-tip shoes.</p><p>We got the drinks, and our conversation took off from there. He surprised me by having a civilized conversation as compared to the I-wanna-take-you-home-and-fuck-the-shit-out-of-you one. I didn\u2019t have a lot of experience with hanging out at clubs. I married so young and started having babies, there were dozens of things my friends got to experience that I missed out on.</p><p>We danced for a long time together. In fact, the club lights came up, letting us know it was almost closing time. I searched for Brina and finally located her over at a corner table, sitting on the pimpster\u2019s lap. I peeped at my watch, and it was almost three in the morning. I just knew Jason was going to have a freakin\u2019 fit. When he told me to go out, he didn\u2019t expect me to be out so late. I was positive the all-your-friends-are-sluts speech was on my agenda before I could fall asleep.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice meeting you, ummm . . .\u201d We had talked all that time but neglected to exchange names.</p><p>\u201cTyson. The name\u2019s Tyson.\u201d</p> <p>I shook his hand. \u201cNice to meet you, Tyson. I\u2019m Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, that\u2019s a beautiful name for a beautiful woman.\u201d</p><p>I blushed as the DJ cut the music and people started to flood out the club doors on their way home to bed, with or without a partner, or headed to an all-night diner for some food to cure their munchies.</p><p>I started walking over toward Brina to tell her it was time to go. I had both our purses flung over my arm, having never tracked Brina down on the crowded dance floorto give hers back. Tyson followed me, but I was hoping he wouldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to be put in the position of having the dreaded let\u2019s-exchange-numbers conversation.</p><p>\u201cZoe, slow down, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. It\u2019s just that I really need to get home. It\u2019s late, and my husband will be worried.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHusband? Damn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, see my ring?\u201d I held my hand up so he could get a good look. \u201cI thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything unless you tell me. I really wish you had said something though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d I got defensive. \u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t have wasted all night talking to me when you could\u2019ve picked up another woman and taken her home with you instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, see now you\u2019re trippin\u2019. Nothing like that, beautiful. I just got myself all worked up this evening, hoping we could get to know each other better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t.\u201d I don\u2019t know what it was, but all of a sudden I became irate. \u201cIt was nice meeting you. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I rushed over to Brina. \u201cBrina, it\u2019s getting late, Sis, and the club\u2019s closing. You want to walk out together, or should I go on ahead?\u201d</p><p>She was obviously all into the knucklehead. \u201cZoe, you go ahead, girl. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, bye.\u201d I didn\u2019t have time for the bullshit. I got about ten feet when I realized I still had her purse, so I went back and gave it to her. When I turned around again, Tyson was nowhere in sight. I was relieved. His ass had turned me ontooooooomuch. I was afraid he might fuck around and turn my ass out.</p><p>I got outside into the cool, crisp air and started heading-toward my car when I heard some faint footsteps behind me. \u201cZoe, hold up, beautiful!\u201d</p><p>I thought to myself, Oh, shit!</p><p>He increased his pace until he caught up to me, which wasn\u2019t hard, considering his legs were so much longer than mine. \u201cYes, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to give you my number in case you want to talk sometime.\u201d He handed me a matchbook from the Zoo with his phone number written down inside of it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so mean, beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Sorry I was rude. It\u2019s just real late, and I\u2019m dog-tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll let you go. You take care, and I hope to hear from you. The ball\u2019s in your court.\u201d</p><p>When</p><p>he walked away, I was enthralled with his ass. I began to wonder why single men go after married women but didn\u2019t ponder over it too long. I tossed the matchbook into a wire trash can on the sidewalk and continued on to my car.</p><p>I got in the car and sat there for a few moments, sucking on a breath mint and trying to get my bearings together. I wasn\u2019t drunk, but I wasn\u2019t exactly sober either. I thought about how great the conversation between Tyson and I had gone before I decided to get bitchy. Then I thought about what Brina said about always having one riding the bench as a backup.</p><p>I pulled out the parking garage, stopped by the trash can, and put my hazards on just long enough for me to jump out and dig the matchbook out with the number on it. I drove home listening to jazz and endured the infamous all-your-friends-are-sluts speech from Jason before falling fast asleep.</p><p>chapterseventeen</p><p>For a while, things went on as usual. I kept creeping around with Quinton and hoping that Jason would open up to me in some form or fashion. Mostly, I was praying like all hell I didn\u2019t get cold busted.</p><p>Quinton pleaded with me dozens of times to leave Jason, but to no avail. I made it perfectly clear to him that leaving my husband was simply not an option. I admit I painted a pretty glum picture of my marriage to Quinton, but through all of our problems, I never stopped loving Jason for one second.</p><p>The little voice inside me kept telling me it would all backfire on me eventually. After all, nothing good lasts forever, and whatever you do always comes back to haunt you. I just couldn\u2019t pinpoint when, where, and how the other shoe would drop. It didn\u2019t take too long to find out.</p><p>It was a Friday night, and typically, I never visited Quinton on Fridays and Saturdays. I reserved that time for Jason and the kids. We would go out to dinner or to amovie and then cuddle up as a family and read books or play board games.</p><p>This particular Friday, I altered my routine and went to see Quinton. I had endured a rough day at the office, and I figured a round or two of hellified sex was just what the doctor ordered. My game plan was to swing by the loft, get my freak on with quickness, and head on home for a night of videos and microwave popcorn with the gang. If I\u2019d taken my ass home from jump street, I would\u2019ve saved myself a lot of humiliation, and inevitably, a hell of a lot of trouble.</p><p>When I got to the loft, the door was wide open like he was expecting me. I walked on in, but Quinton was nowhere in sight on the bottom level. I decided to tiptoe upstairs and try to surprise him. He wasn\u2019t there either.</p><p>On my way back out, having no idea what to make of the situation, I heard some slow jams coming from Diamond\u2019s loft down the hall. I sauntered on down there, hoping she could shed some light on Quinton\u2019s whereabouts. I assumed he had made a run to a carry-out or convenience store or something of that nature. He couldn\u2019t have gone too far with his place unlocked like that.</p><p>When I got within a few feet of her door, instinct told me to turn around. Curiosity made me keep walking, though. It was obvious she was throwing down with someone\u2014I could hear the loud moans. My face flushed with anger. I almost half-convinced myself what I was thinking was wrong, but I had to find out if my suspicions were on the money.</p><p>Her door was slightly ajar. I gently pushed it open wider. Diamond was knocking boots with somebody all right, and that somebody was Quinton. He was banging the hell out of her up against the wooden bar spanning the wall of the room. The wall was covered with a mirror.</p><p>I just stood there for a few seconds, letting it all register in my mind. The tears built up in my eyes, matching the hostility that was already inside me. Droplets of sweat were trickling from their bodies. He hungrily took her left breast into his mouth while he caught a rhythm and started fucking her harder.</p><p>I was turning to leave when he glanced in the mirror and saw me standing there flabbergasted in the doorway. Before his skank ass could even yell out my name, I was down the hall, pushing erratically on the call button for the elevator. I pushed it about twenty times, even though once would have sufficed.</p><p>\u201cZoe!\u201d Quinton came rushing toward me, pulling his pants up on the way. The pathetic bastard!</p><p>I started to not even acknowledge his ass, but the anger took over. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d I stated sarcastically. \u201cYou were helping her change a lightbulb when you slipped on a ballet slipper and fell in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, listen to me please!\u201d He grabbed my arm, and I immediately yanked it away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, you, you, you . . .\u201d I couldn\u2019t even think of a word to fit the bill.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened between Diamond and I was a mistake,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened before, and it\u2019ll never happen again!\u201d</p><p>He was not even fooling me! \u201cWhatever!

Diamond poked her head out of the doorway. I yelled out, \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>Quinton darted his eyes in her direction and waved her away. She went back inside her place and slammed the door. \u201cZoe, let\u2019s just go in my place and talk this over,\u201d he pleaded with me.</p><p>\u201cTalk it over?Sheeeeeeit,there\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d I pointed down the hall. \u201cTake your skank ass back in there with your skeezer. I\u2019m going to take the stairs. This elevator\u2019s taking too damn long.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed for me one last time and hooked a finger on the back waistline of my skirt. I slapped his hand away and headed for the stairwell. \u201cGet your fuckin\u2019 hands off of me, Quinton! You smell like pussy and I hate you! I fuckin\u2019 hate you!\u201d</p><p>I took the steps two at a time on the way down, hearing the echoes of him screaming out my name until I got to the garage.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t any good the rest of the weekend. On Sunday afternoon, I asked Jason to watch the kids so I could go visit Brina alone. He was down for that, since he had abunch of buddies over to watch a college football game anyway. He was probably glad to get the Mrs. out the house so boys could be boys. For a minute, I got offended; it was almost like he wanted me to be a ghost. I started to stay home out of spite, but I really needed to get away for a few hours, so I made some deli wraps and cocktail sausages for his crew before I went on my dreary way.</p><p>When I got to Brina\u2019s place, I heard a bunch of clamor coming from inside her apartment and immediately wanted to find out what the hell was going on. I knocked on the door and as soon as she answered, I asked, \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Sis! \u2019Sup? I didn\u2019t know you were coming by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI decided to surprise you, but I\u2019m the one in shock.\u201d I barged my way into her apartment, ready to kick someone\u2019s ass if need be. \u201cWhy all the yelling? I could hear you as soon as I came in the front door of the building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Dempsey and I were just having aslightdisagreement. It\u2019s all cool now. He\u2019s my baby boo.\u201d</p><p>Before I could ask where the so-called romantic Dempsey I had heard so much about was, I noticed Brina had a black eye. I grabbed her by the cheek and held her head steady so I could get a better look. \u201cWhat in the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your fucking business, that\u2019s what!\u201d His trick ass came around the corner from the bathroom, talking trash and zipping up a pair of baggy jeans.</p><p>If he was going to come at me like that, I was damn sure going to reciprocate. \u201cHmm, your pathetic beanpole, anorexic ass must be Dempsey.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d He darted his eyes at Brina. \u201cWho the fuck is she?\u201d</p><p>I decided to answer his question, since Brina seemed to have lost her tongue. \u201cI\u2019m her best friend, and the onesistah who\u2019s going to ram her foot up your ass and cut off your dick if you ever lay another hand on Brina!\u201d</p><p>He laughed like I was playing tiddly-winks with him. He must\u2019ve missed the memo, because I was not the one. \u201cYeah, right, you trifling bitch! I\u2019ll kick your little ass too!\u201d</p><p>He was clearly drunk. He was staggering, not to mention reeking of alcohol. I reached into my coat pocket and pulled the switchblade I kept</p><p>there for protection when I was walking from the office to Quinton\u2019s or wherever else downtown, popped the blade open, and pushed it up against his throat, forcing him back up against the wall.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what came over me, but I was prepared to open a can of whup-ass and take it to the bridge if need be. \u201cLooka here, trick! Don\u2019t try to play with me, and if you ever touch Brina again, I\u2019ll slit your fuckin\u2019 throat! Now get your shit and get the hell out!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, sistah, chill!\u201d He threw his hands up in the air, not willing to find out if I was frontin\u2019 or not, and slowly moved sideways away from the blade. \u201cI\u2019m going! I\u2019ll leave right now!\u201d</p><p>I put my knife away and went to hold the door open for him. \u201cI know your ass is leaving! Get out!\u201d</p><p>He put his cheap, bama tennis shoes on, got his coat, and left without saying another word. Brina sat in the fetal position in a corner, crying her eyes out. After he was gone, I put the double lock on the door and turned on her. \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p><p>She used the sleeve of her nightgown to wipe the mucus from her nose and tears from her eyes. \u201cZoe, I don\u2019t need this right now. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to getthisright now! How in the hell are you gonna let that man beat on you like a punching bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDempsey\u2019s been having a lot of problems at work and with his family back in Alabama.\u201d She got up from the corner and went into the kitchen to get a cold glass of water from the faucet. I followed her.</p><p>\u201cAnd? I fail to see what any of that has to do with him beating up on you. Lots of people have problems. They don\u2019t beat their woman to relieve their stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Zoe, I love Dempsey! That mess you just pulled was wrong! Pulling a blade on him like that!\u201d She slammed the glass down on the counter, almost breaking it.</p><p>I lowered my voice, trying not to let my true emotions show because part of me wanted to slap the shit out of her for being so damn ignorant. \u201cBrina, I love you, but I\u2019m leaving. I refuse to stand here and listen to you defend that ignorant bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wrong! You just don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You want your ass beat, so be it. Women always say people don\u2019t understand, but unless you have an awakening, he\u2019ll continue to beat up on you. I can\u2019t help you until you\u2019re ready to help your damn self.\u201d I gave her a hug and a kiss, grabbed her by the chin so I could take another look at the shiner he gave her, shook my head in disgust, and left.</p><p>I didn\u2019t feel like going back home so soon. Most of the malls were closed already, being it was Sunday, so I decided to just drive around for a while. My life had been really traumatic the past few days. First catching Quinton banging the hell out that ho and now finding out Brina was letting some bama pulverize her. I wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road and almost crashed a red light. I slammed on the brakes, and the tires screeched to a halt mere inches from the pedestrian walkway.</p><p>My glove compartment popped open. Everything in itflew all over the front seat and floor of the car. I pulled over to the curb, turned on the interior light because the sun was setting, and started picking up the mess.</p><p>Somewhere in between the tube of dried-up lipstick that had probably been in there since Peter was a baby and the car\u2019s registration certificate, I ran across the matchbook with Tyson\u2019s number inside the cover.</p><p>I contemplated things and decided since Quinton was fucking that hoochie, bringing my benched player into the game might not be such a bad idea. I knew my ass was wrong, but I pulled out my cell phone and dialed the number anyway. He answered on the third ring, sounding like he was half asleep. He perked up when I told him who was calling and rushed to give me the directions to his place before I could even dig a pen out my purse to write them down.</p><p>I arrived at his apartment complex about twenty minutes later and realized straight off the bat I had no business driving, rather less parking, a Mercedes anywhere near it. However, he lived on the bottom level, and I was able to find a space right in front of his door, so I took the risk.</p><p>Tyson answered the door after I barely tapped on it. He was obviously looking out the peephole awaiting my arrival. His one-bedroom apartment was cozy and nicely decorated. I could tell he was a man who took care of himself and his belongings. He was wet, barefoot, and in a pair of jeans only. I was flattered he had gone through the trouble of taking a shower before I showed up. We both knew I was making a booty call, and I\u2019ll take a pair of fresh, clean balls over sweaty ones any damn day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyson and I kicked it for about ten minutes, just shooting the breeze. He asked me if I wanted a drink, Itold him no thanks, and then he decided to cut the bullshit. \u201cTake off your dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said take off your dress.\u201d</p><p>He was sitting on a dining room chair, and I was standing over by his entertainment center, looking at some family photos. I should\u2019ve cussed his ass out and left, but I reached behind my back and unzipped my gray casual dress instead. I lowered it off of my shoulders, stepped out of it, and ended up standing there only in my black slip, panties, and black leather, low-heel pumps.</p> <p>\u201cCome over here.\u201d He spread his legs open and patted his right thigh, motioning for me to sit on it.</p><p>\u201cDamn, aren\u2019t you the assuming one, and demanding too! Sheeesh!\u201d I was talking junk but walking over toward him at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not assuming anything. I\u2019m just not into playing games. We both know why you\u2019re here, woman, so come and get what you came for.\u201d</p><p>I decided if he could be off the hook, I could be off the hook too. My nymphomaniac evil twin woke up and took over. \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d I sat down on his leg and started rubbing his crotch. \u201cUmmm, damn, is he hard for me already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stays hard. Take him out and put him in your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmph, I think not.\u201d I removed my hand. \u201cYou do me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so it\u2019s like that, huh, Miss Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. No licking, no sticking.\u201d He grinned as I got up off his leg and climbed up on the table. He stood up just long enough to turn his seat around so he was facing me.</p><p>\u201cUmmm, okay, I\u2019ll play along with your little game.\u201dHe raised up my slip and started trying to pull my panties down, but I wouldn\u2019t lift my hips so he could get them over my ass.</p><p>I grabbed his face with my hands and slipped him the tongue. It was a brief, rough kiss, but I was in the mood for something rough for a change. When we came up for air, I instructed him, \u201cRip my panties off!\u201d</p><p>As big and strong as Tyson was, he had to exert little effort tearing them bad boys off. He tossed them on the floor, stood up, and started kissing me again, pressing my back onto the table\u2019s cold metal surface. He decided to take it to the bridge and ripped the straps off my slip too, pulling the nylon material down over my ribcage so he could grab both my breasts at the same time and bite gently on my nipples.</p> <p>I grabbed the back of his head, bringing his mouth closer into my breasts. He pushed them together, taking both nipples into his mouth at the same time so he could suckle on them. He licked a trail with his tongue from my nipples down the middle of my stomach to my belly button, pausing there to dip his tongue in it and then blowing on it to make his saliva dry up. Damn, that shit turned me on!</p><p>He spread my legs open and went to work on my pussy. Tyson\u2019s technique was different from Quinton\u2019s. He bit on my clit, and while it was painful, it made me cum almost immediately. I was discovering yet another part of my sexual desires I never knew existed. I discovered I liked it rough.</p><p>That fact became even more obvious when he made me sit in a chair while he held my head and plummeted his dick in and out my mouth. I thought his dick was going to knock all of my front teeth out at one point. He was working his thang in and out my mouth so fast, but Iheld my own and sucked him until he came. His cum had a different taste than Quinton\u2019s. It was more salty. Once I realized that every man\u2019s cum had a distinctive taste, I began to wonder what Jason\u2019s cum would taste like. The man I wanted to taste the most wouldn\u2019t let my mouth anywhere near his dick.</p><p>\u201cI have to go!\u201d Tyson had just exploded in my mouth, and there were still a few droplets of cum trickling out the sides onto my chin when I blurted it out.</p><p>He looked at me like I had lost my fuckin\u2019 mind. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really do have to go.\u201d I got up from the chair and headed toward the door. Looking back at it now, I don\u2019t know what my issues were, but I definitely had some. It was almost as if I thought oral sex wasn\u2019t actual cheating or something. Like with what I did with Quinton in the beginning, I intended to leave it at oral sex and go home. But Tyson wasn\u2019t even going out like that.</p><p>I was standing on the backside of his couch, putting my dress back on, opting to ditch the torn panties and slip at his place, when he came up behind me and pushed me over the back of the couch so my head ended upside down and my feet were dangling off the floor. \u201cTyson, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll stop when I\u2019m done.\u201d I tried to get up, but he was too strong and forced me to stay bent over while he stuck his dick in my pussy from behind. He fucked the living daylights out of me, and there was no point in saying it wasn\u2019t what I really wanted. The streams of cum and pussy juice trickling down my inner thighs onto the floor told the true story.</p> <p>He fucked me so hard, I could feel his balls slamming up against the back of my thighs while he pumped his dick in and out of me. When it was all over and he hadbusted his second nut, he let me down. I finished getting dressed, and we were both breathing like we had just crossed the finish line in a twenty-six-mile marathon. I had never been turned out in such a fashion.</p><p>After I got my shoes on, I headed for the door. \u201cHold up, Zoe. I know you\u2019re married and all, but do you have an office number where I can reach you? I want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>I opened the front door of his apartment and glanced back at him sitting on the couch, still trying to catch his breath. \u201cNo, I\u2019m a housewife. I don\u2019t have an office number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPager? Cell phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, none of that.\u201d My ass was lying big-time, but keeping my anonymity was the one bright side to the whole fucked-up situation. Tyson only knew me as Zoe,and that\u2019s all his ass needed to know.</p><p>\u201cSo, will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch!\u201d With that, I left his place, got in my car, and drove home. Jason still had a couple of friends over when I arrived home. The game was over, but they were sitting around drinking beers and talking about various player\u2019s career statistics.</p><p>He waved at me as I came in. \u201cHey, baby. Have a good time with Brina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we had a nice, long talk.\u201d Yet another lie! I was getting too good at fabrication. Before Jason could get up to come over and give me a kiss, I told him I was going upstairs to take a hot shower because my back was sore. I didn\u2019t want him to smell sex on me, and besides, my back and everything else was sore from being fucked so hard.</p><p>When he came to bed later that night, I was asleep, but he woke me up to have sex. I was ecstatic\u2014he was the only man I ever truly wanted in the first place. Asusual, he just used me to do his do, and when I tried to go down on him, he refused me once again.</p><p>I decided to tell him the truth about what happened with Brina. Well, kind of. I conveniently made it sound like I stayed there for hours after Dempsey left, comforting her, when that wasn\u2019t even the case. However, the black eye was pure fact, and Jason told me to stay away from the stupid bitch if she was dumb enough to let herself be beat like that. I ended up having to listen to the all-your-friends-are-sluts speech, but I fell asleep in the middle of it.</p><p>chaptereighteen</p><p>\u201cMrs. Reynard, there\u2019s a Quinton Matthews here to see you.\u201d My secretary\u2019s voice screeched out over the speaker on my desk. I was in the middle of drinking a cup of hot tea and almost spilled it on a pile of prints, new additions to the collection. I had decided not to use Quinton\u2019s work because I knew the affair would eventually have to end, and I didn\u2019t want anything tying us together when it did. I wanted the break to be clean, and as far as I was concerned, the affair ended the day I caught him with his dick all up in Diamond\u2019s pussy.</p><p>\u201cSend him in, please.\u201d I released the speak button on the intercom and wondered why the hell he would risk coming to my office when he could\u2019ve called. I wasn\u2019t about to confront him in the outer office. All I needed was some drama getting into the hands of gossipmongers.</p><p>He stormed into my office like he owned the place and sat on the edge of my desk. \u201cZoe, why haven\u2019t you called me or come by?\u201d</p><p>His ass was really trippin\u2019, so I told him, \u201cYour ass is trippin\u2019. Why the hell do you think I haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me!\u201d He started getting loud on a sistah.</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d I insisted. \u201cThis is a business.\u201d Once he calmed down and started breathing through his mouth again, I added, \u201cYou know why I haven\u2019t called your ass. Get real! The last time I saw you, you were fucking the hoochie down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you that was an accident.\u201d He came closer to me, trying to give me a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s all about you and me, Boo. You\u2019re my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your fuckin\u2019 hands off me!\u201d I started getting loud my damn self. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSee, now you\u2019re the one overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, hell naw, I\u2019m not.\u201d I really didn\u2019t want to rehash the dirt, and definitely not in my office. \u201cCould you do us both a favor and just leave? I have a lot of work to do. I\u2019ve fallen way behind fooling around with you.\u201d</p><p>We were both on our feet by that time, having a good old-fashioned Mexican standoff. I didn\u2019t have a damn thing to say and neither did he. We just stared at each other until he finally broke the silence. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up on this relationship, Zoe. That\u2019s the bottom line. If I have to camp outside in your secretary\u2019s office with a sleeping bag and a box of Twinkies, so be it.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t hold the laugh in. \u201cOh, so now I\u2019m a joke, Zoe?\u201d I laughed harder until the tears starting rolling down my cheeks and I was holding my stomach. The fact of the matter was what he said was hilarious, but the situation wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>I regained my composure because he was truly getting pissed. \u201cQuinton, I\u2019ll call you. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>I rested my ass on the edge of my desk. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy tomorrow? Why can\u2019t I see you this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I really do have a lot of work backed up on me, and tonight Jason and I are having some friends over for dinner.\u201d The workload was true, but the dinner was a lie. I had something else in mind for that night.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll leave, but I better hear from you tomorrow, Zoe, or else!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else I\u2019ll come back, throw your ass over my shoulder, and carry you out of here.\u201d</p><p>We both giggled at that one. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear from me. I promise.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I forgave his ass. I guess it\u2019s hard to blame someone for going astray when you\u2019re married your damn self.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s seal that promise with a kiss, and then I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d We started kissing, and one kinky thing led to another. Five minutes later, I pushed the speak button on the intercom and told my secretary to take an early lunch. Then Quinton fucked me on top of my desk, and we devoured each other for lunch.</p><p>When I left work that evening, after calling Jason and telling him I had to meet one of my distributors to talk business, I made a beeline for Tyson\u2019s apartment. I was feenin\u2019 for his ass big-time. I simply loved the way he was rough with me that first time.</p> <p>He had just gotten home from the auto garage where he worked as a mechanic when I got there. He was covered with motor oil and grease and looked sexy as all hell to me. I was taking things to the extreme, having fucked Quinton on my desk earlier that day and now getting ready to fuck someone else before driving home to my husband.</p><p>Tyson was happy to see me and told me to hop in the shower with him. I stripped down to nothing and did justthat. He made me prop my leg up on the edge of the tub so he could eat my pussy, and then I sucked his dick before he held me up against the wall with my legs straddled around his waist and fucked me rough just like I wanted.</p><p>We got out the shower, and I told him what had been on my mind that whole day and the reason I was really there. \u201cTyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to try something real freaky!\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened; he gawked at me and said, \u201cWord? Like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d I replied because I really didn\u2019t have a well-thought-out answer. \u201cI was just going to leave it up to you. You seem like a man who knows how to turn a sistah out the right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d He paced around the bed naked while I propped myself up on a pillow so I could admire the view.</p> <p>Finally, he said, \u201cLook, if you\u2019re really down for this, I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>I decided to let all my inhibitions go and threw caution to the wind. \u201cCool! I\u2019m down for whatever.\u201d</p><p>Boy, why the hell did I say that? Less than five minutes Tyson had me tied to his bed butt-naked on my stomach with a blindfold on. I was just ass out and had no choice but to be down for whatever.</p><p>He lubricated my rear like a Corvette and then took it literally. Much to my surprise, the way he did it was painless. I realize now it was all in my head, and because I didn\u2019t have time to let fear build up, I took it in the ass without all the psychotic fears going on. He took his time with me, and when it was all in, he worked me just like he did with vaginal sex.</p><p>Tyson came, and we were lying there with his soft dick still inside me when there was a loud knocking at the door. \u201cTyson, open this damn door! You fuckin\u2019</p><p>bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I turned my head toward the door but couldn\u2019t see for jack because of the blindfold. \u201cWho is that woman banging on your door?\u201d</p><p>All he whispered was, \u201cShhhhhhhhhh, she\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntie me right now!\u201d</p><p>He covered up my mouth with my hand, and I was pissed. \u201cJust be quiet, Zoe. I\u2019m not answering the door. That ho\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyson, I know your ass is in there with some bitch! Open the damn door, now!\u201d He stayed on top of me, his dick in my ass, trying to prevent me from squirming. \u201cYou ain\u2019t nuttin\u2019 but a lying, cheating, male tramp! Just wait till your ass comes out that bitch! I got something for that ass!\u201d</p><p>Then she left\u2014at least, we thought she did. He got off me, removed the blindfold, and untied me. I hurriedly got dressed. I didn\u2019t need yet another lover that was fucking someone else.</p><p>\u201cZoe, she\u2019s my ex. I\u2019vebeenfinished with her skank ass.\u201d I didn\u2019t need another lame explanation either.</p><p>\u201cWhatever!\u201d I got fully dressed and started looking for my keys. \u201cShe\u2019s not my problem, Tyson! She\u2019s yours!\u201d</p><p>Wrong again! She was my problem. He walked me outside and came to find out the heifer had cut all my tires and scratched the wordBITCHon the side panel of my car with her keys. She was long gone, and good thing she was, because I would\u2019ve been going down the river for homicide that night.</p><p>People sitting out on their stoops were having a goodlaugh, saying, \u201cOh shit!\u201d \u201cDamn, must be some good dick!\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s what your ass gets for fucking around!\u201d</p><p>I went back into Tyson\u2019s place to call the auto club. I couldn\u2019t believe this shit was happening. How in the world was I going to cover my ass on this one? Like they say though, where there\u2019s a will . . .</p><p>I instructed the tow truck driver to haul the car to my regular service garage near my house, all the way on the other side of town. He was pissed but had no choice, since that was one of the benefits of having the gold plus plan.</p><p>After telling Tyson to kiss my black ass, I hopped into the cab of the truck with the driver, cursing under my breath the whole way to the garage.</p><p>I had to make it look good, so I called Jason from my cell phone when we were almost there and told him the car had been vandalized outside the restaurant downtown where I had met a distributor to discuss business. I told him to pick me up at the garage in ten minutes. The tow truck driver, an old countrified hick, was staring at me when I closed out the call. I gave him a glare and told him, \u201cMind your own fucking business!\u201d</p><p>Jason was already there when we pulled up at the garage, talking to our mechanic. The expression on his face when he saw the car, which had to be towed on a flatbed since all four tires were flat, was definitely one for the books. After asking me fifty questions, all to which I answered, \u201cI have no idea. It just happened,\u201d he decided he was just elated I wasn\u2019t harmed in any way.</p><p>That night, we made love more intensely than we ever had. He started out by coming in the bathroom while I was taking a bath, rolling up his sleeves, and washing my back. I almost fainted from that show of affection alone. Then he dried me off, carried me to bed, and gave memore time and attention than he ever had before. It still wasn\u2019t great sex, but it was a sign that maybe there was hope for us yet. I didn\u2019t ask him for oral sex and heaven knows anal sex was out the freakin\u2019 question. I was just glad that, for once, he made me feel like he desired me as much as I did him.</p><p>chapternineteen</p><p>In light of the way Jason made love to me the night of my brush-with-death experience (according to him), I decided to throw myself headfirst into my marriage. I had messed up big-time, but the bottom line was, I still loved my husband more than life itself, and he was the only man I ever truly wanted.</p><p>I planned the ultimate romantic evening for that Friday. I asked my mother, who had already gone far and beyond her duties as a grandmother, to stay with the kids overnight so I could kidnap Jason and attempt to turn his ass out. She agreed to stay over, and I picked up Jason at his office. We were sharing the Land Rover, since the Mercedes was still in the shop.</p><p>He thought I was picking him up just to go home and do the regular dinner with the kids, followed by watching a couple of sitcoms and the news-before-bed routine. When he saw I was headed in the opposite direction from our house, he demanded to know, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have a surprise for you, Boo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, I\u2019m kind of tired. I was looking forward to just chillin\u2019 out tonight.\u201d He started rubbing his temple like he had a headache.</p><p>\u201cJason, I spent all day planning out tonight and asked Mom to stay overnight with the kids. Please don\u2019t ruin this for me. If nothing else, do it to make me happy.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the backseat and noticed I had a small suitcase. \u201cOvernight, huh?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him, reached over, and rubbed his thigh. \u201cYes, Boo, overnight.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a devilish grin. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go along with this. Sounds promising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is. Believe me, it is.\u201d I moved my hand farther up his thigh and then started caressing his dick through his trousers. He didn\u2019t stop me, and I was in shock. Not shocked enough to stop, though. I held fast to that bad boy, which grew rock-hard, until we got where we were going.</p><p>We pulled up at a little Greek restaurant at the end of town about six, and Jason was thrown for a loop when I led him by the hand straight through the entry-level dining area and up the back stairs. When we got upstairs, all the patrons were seated on fancy floor cushions, drinking cocktails and socializing in the dim, smoke-filled room.</p><p>\u201cZoe, what the hell is this place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d I giggled, leaning over and giving him a kiss. He didn\u2019t just peck me back for a change. He tongued my ass down just like in high school, and I savored it for as long as I could.</p><p>The music started, and the first belly dancer made her way to the center of the room and began her dance. Jason started laughing like I knew he would. It was theoldJason I was trying to resurrect\u2014the one who used to talk mad shit all the time, the one who was the romantic target of every girl at school even though he was unavailable, the one who stole my heart somewhere between giving me the finger and a game of Twister.</p><p>The dancer was buck wild, and all the old, beer-bellied men were clapping and sticking money in the waistline of her sheer-leg pants. Jason and I both enjoyed the show and ordered some drinks. After the third dancer came out, I excused myself, telling him I was going to the ladies\u2019 room. I was lying, but it was a good lie this time.</p><p>When the announcer called out the name of the next act, Jason almost hurled his drink when the man said, \u201cZoe!\u201d</p><p>I came out in a white sheer costume, laced with gold, and did a special belly dance just for Jason. I had been there earlier that afternoon, taking lessons from one of the real dancers, which is why I knew my way around the place so well. I danced seductively while all the other patrons watched, and Jason was blushing.</p><p>What tripped him out the most was when I shook my belly in his face and he noticed my freshly pierced belly with a silver charm stuck in it with the nameJasonengraved on it. I finished my dance, got mad applause, and fell gracefully into his lap. He removed the veil that was covering the bottom half of my face and planted a big, wet juicy one on me. \u201cI love you, Zoe!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you too, baby!\u201d I kissed him again and started to get up. \u201cBe right back. I\u2019m going to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He slapped me on my ass while I was walking away. \u201cDo that, you crazy fool!\u201d</p><p>When I came back, dressed, he assumed we would be eating there. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go downstairs and grab a bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, excuse me, Mr. Reynard, but this isMrs.Reynard\u2019s night andMrs.Reynard has other plans for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, excuse the hell out of me!\u201d We both laughed and held hands all the way back to the parking lot.</p><p>Our next stop was a Japanese restaurant, the kind with private dining rooms concealed behind silk-screened, sliding doors. We ordered a pot of green tea after being escorted to our little private haven. Our shoes had to be taken off upon entry to the restaurant, and once again, we got to sit on pillows. Jason commented, \u201cYou know my back is going to be screwed up after all this, right, Boo?\u201d</p><p>I leaned over and whispered in his ear, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a nice back rub then.\u201d He kissed me again, and I was thinking he hadn\u2019t kissed me so many times in one day sincewayback. As an afterthought, I added, \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll let me rub something else too.\u201d</p><p>I slid the tip of my tongue in his ear and then blew in it. \u201cBe right back, baby. I have to tinkle.\u201d</p> <p>Was I lying again? Hell, yeah! Instead of the Japanese woman who had originally waited on us bringing the pot of tea in, I did it myself, dressed as a geisha with an oriental silk robe on and a big-ass black wig. \u201cZoe, you\u2019re too damn much! Why are you buggin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love to see you smile, and</p><p>tonight you\u2019re smiling a lot.\u201d He laughed. I knelt down on the floor beside him because I couldn\u2019t sit Indian-style with the long robe on. I looked him in his eyes and meant every word as I spoke them. \u201cJason, I would do anything to make you happy. I love you, and this is forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways has been! Always will be!\u201d</p><p>We started tonguing the hell out of each other bigtime. When the regular waitress came in with our appetizer, Jason had my robe halfway open and was about topop a tit out to suck on. I stayed in the robe and wig for the rest of the dinner and fed him with chopsticks, wiping his mouth and chin off every time a morsel of food accidentally missed its target.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zoe, I\u2019m almost scared to ask what\u2019s next. Crazy ass!\u201d</p><p>We were standing outside the restaurant, waiting on the valet to retrieve the Rover. I walked up close to him, stood on my tippy-toes, and kissed him briefly. \u201cWhat do you want to be next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmm, well, if I recall right I tried to take the lead earlier this evening and was informed that this wasMrs.Reynard\u2019s evening andMrs.Reynard makes all the decisions.\u201d</p><p>I pinched him gently on his arm. \u201cDamn right, Mrs. Reynard makes all the decisions.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed me and started tickling me. The other people waiting on their vehicles were looking at us and laughing. As we drove off to our next destination, I was so happy. For the first time in ages, Jason and I were having a genuinely romantic time together, just like when we were younger.</p><p>It was a warm, clear night, and I was glad, because the next stop on my agenda wouldn\u2019t have worked out right if it hadn\u2019t been. We took a long drive out to an observatory about an hour away from Atlanta. We had never been there, but it was one place I had always wanted to go. We got there just in time to catch a slide show in the planetarium, and then we went to the observation deck to look through the gigantic telescopes at the stars. I think I loved that part of the evening more than Jason did. Even though he listened to me rant and rave about the heavens all the time and had kept his promise by building me a home full of skylights so I could see thestars whenever I wanted, his appreciation of them wasn\u2019t nearly as profound as mine.</p><p>Before we left, I did what I really came there to do and adopted a star. I adoptedourstar, the star Jason and I selected together the first night we kissed on my front stoop. The donated money went to help with the upkeep of the observatory. They gave us a framed certificate with the name of our star, \u201cAmbrose,\u201d which is Greek for immortal and undying just like our love, imprinted on it. Our names were also put on the certificate along with the words,Always has been! Always will be!</p><p>It was time to head to our final destination, which was a cozy bed-and-breakfast inn in the countryside. When we got to the Waterside Inn, we were shown to our room, which had a balcony overlooking the small lake on the property.</p><p>I had some chilled champagne delivered to our room and then asked Jason to take a hot bubble bath with me. I practically had a heart attack when he agreed. We took a long bath together in the old-fashioned bathtub. I sat behind him with my legs straddled around his waist. We had one of the most intimate, provocative talks of our marriage, and I was overwhelmed at how open he was being.</p><p>We made love on crisp, white sheets underneath a handmade quilt and it was beautiful. We engaged in much more foreplay than we had in a long time. Back when we were still virgins, we would make out for hours, but when the sex between us started, it seemed like the intimacy went away. In one night, I was getting both the intimacy and the sex, and I was loving every minute of it. Everything was great until . . .</p><p>. . . I tried to perform oral sex on him. He went ballistic.\u201cZoe, stop that shit! DAMN!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, what the hell is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not into that.\u201d He jumped up from the bed and put on one of the heavy terrycloth robes provided by the hotel.</p><p>\u201cHow can you not be into something you\u2019ve never tried? I don\u2019t get it.\u201d I wanted to tell him how good the shit really was and how I was a pro at deep-throating a dick, but having him file for a divorce wasn\u2019t part of my seduction plan, so I left that one alone. \u201cJason, come back to bed. We don\u2019t have to do that if you don\u2019t want to, baby.\u201d</p><p>He came back to bed, and we fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms. I just didn\u2019t want the whole night to be ruined. I had put too much heart into it for it to end with an argument. I was just happy we were making some sort of improvement in our sex life, even if it was a far cry from what I really needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Way over in the morning, something happened to me. It was as if something snapped. I woke up, started crying, and ended up in the bathroom with the door shut, crouched down on the floor between the toilet and the bathtub. I didn\u2019t want Jason to hear me wailing like a three-year-old, but I couldn\u2019t hold it in. All I ever wanted was for one man to love me, and he does love me. He has loved me all my life. Whenever Jason and I make love, it is like winning the lottery to me, but at the same time, it almost feels like he is just doing me a fuckin\u2019 favor.</p><p>chaptertwenty</p><p>\u201cMarcella, I\u2019m totally exhausted!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t so much exhaustion as it was stress. I\u2019d been discussing my sex life with her for hours and still hadn\u2019t gotten to thereallydeep part. Not that I was looking forward to revealing that situation at all.</p><p>\u201cZoe, that\u2019s fine. I understand.\u201d I glanced up from the chaise longue at her. She was sitting in the leather wing chair beside it, scribbling away on her notepad. \u201cWe\u2019ve covered quite a bit of ground today. We made a lot of progress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid we?\u201d I asked, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cDid we what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake a lot of progress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! The mere fact that you were able to discuss your problems is a significant breakthrough.\u201d She smiled at me timidly, probably wondering if I was buying into her bullshit. \u201cLike I said, we covered a lot of ground.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and rubbed my eyes. They were sore fromshedding so many tears. Half of the time I was talking, I kept my eyes shut so I wouldn\u2019t even have to look at her. I didn\u2019t want to see the disgust on her face. As I readjusted my eyes to the dim lighting in her office, Dr. Marcella Spencer didn\u2019t appear disgusted at all. I knew she had to be hiding it below the surface. She didn\u2019t want me to pick up on her loathing. How could anyone not hate a despicable, cheating, lying, manipulative tramp like me? Even those getting paid to pretend otherwise?</p> <p>\u201cYes, we covered a lot of ground, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can help me? Honestly? How do I stop this madness when it has taken total control of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first thing I should ask is, How do you feel about Quinton and Tyson? Are you in love with either one of them?\u201d</p><p>I pondered her question. \u201cI can\u2019t be in love with Quinton or Tyson because I\u2019m in love with Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t feel it\u2019s possible to love more than one man at a time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI care about them both\u2014Quinton more so than Tyson\u2014but it\u2019s not love. They give me things I need. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve become accustomed to being with both of them. I never intended to be with Tyson more than a couple of times, but at this point, I\u2019m with all of them every week. This shit has got to stop. That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Damn, not that \u201cI see\u201d again! \u201cMarcella, can you just answer my previous question? Do you feel as though you can help me get out of this mess?\u201d</p><p>She sat up on the edge of her chair, moving in closer to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to be perfectly honest with you. Sexual addiction isn\u2019t exactly my area of expertise.\u201d I wonderedhow far not exactly. \u201cHowever, there are certain things that apply to all types of addictions.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. The last thing I needed was to be held in suspense. \u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are you aware that both alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation programs work on a multi-step matrix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I inquired, realizing all hope for a speedy recovery was fading fast. \u201cAre you telling me I need to stop on a gradual basis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething of that nature, but listen!\u201d She raised her voice an octave, sensing my irritation. She was damn right too. I was mad irritated. \u201cJust like any addiction, it\u2019s extremely hard to go cold turkey on\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUmm, hold up a second! Are you telling me I should keep fucking these other people and lying to my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, calm down.\u201d She headed to her desk to get a cigarette. \u201cYou just have to relax and hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, my ass!\u201d I jumped up and started putting on my overcoat. \u201cI can\u2019t freakin\u2019 believe this shit! I finally get the nerve to tell someone about all the fuckedup, backass, conniving shit I\u2019ve been doing! I finally spill my guts about everything, and not to mention pay your ass to let me do it, and this is what I get for my trouble?</p><p>You telling me to keep doing it? What do you suggest? To maybe cut back to two sexual trysts a week instead of four? Let Quinton hit it on Mondays and Tyson on Wednesdays, and everybody\u2019s happy?\u201d</p><p>Her hand started trembling while she attempted to light the cigarette with her silver-plated lighter. Her ass was just as nervous as I was, and she was supposed to be the expert.\u201cNo, not at all Zoe! Iamgoing to help you! Just hear me out!\u201d</p><p>I calmed down a little, plopped back down on the chaise, and stared at her.</p><p>She retook her seat across from me, inhaling like a mofo. \u201cI have a friend who specializes in sexual addiction. He has a practice down in Florida, and I think he might be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?Oh, hell no, this shit just gets thicker and thicker. I can\u2019t discuss this with a man. Men are the cause of all my fuckin\u2019 problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut her ass off. \u201cThe main reason I came to you is because you\u2019re a female, and I thought, at the very least, you would be able to relate to my situation a little better. But a man can\u2019t begin to relate to the confusion going on in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand what you are saying, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides, what am I supposed to do? Tell Jason I\u2019m going down to Florida on a business trip while I go check into some clinic for nymphomaniacs? That shit is out of the damn question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you a nymphomaniac?\u201d She asked the question as if she didn\u2019t already know the answer.</p><p>I got up and headed toward the door. \u201cWhat the hell do you think?\u201d</p><p>I was halfway to the elevator when she started tugging gently on my coat sleeve. \u201cZoe, come on back in the office so we can talk some more. Off the clock. We need to settle this. I don\u2019t want you leaving here so distraught. I really want to help you. Why can\u2019t you believe that?\u201d</p><p>I tried to get my bearings and prevent my heart from pumping so fast. I sensed true sincerity in her voice as I pressed the call button for the elevator. The next words came out in a normal tone. \u201cLook, Dr. Spencer\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcella,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cMarcella, I really appreciate you listening to me and fitting me into your busy schedule. I\u2019m truly sorry for snapping at you just now, but all the pressure and stress I\u2019ve been under lately is destroying me.\u201d I started pressing the call button again.</p><p>\u201cI can see that it\u2019s destroying you,\u201d she agreed, rubbing my arm. \u201cThat\u2019s why you have to let me help.\u201d</p><p>I gazed in her eyes, looking for some omen that she was my savior. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t help me. No one can. I got myself into this predicament, and I have to get myself out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re dead wrong.\u201d I noticed there were beads of sweat gathering on her brow. She was really stressing over my ass. \u201cIf you could get yourself out of this alone, you would have already. In fact, you never would have put yourself in this position in the first place if you had an option.\u201d</p><p>She had a point, but I still didn\u2019t believe she could improve anything. \u201cThe bottom line is this. After all the shit I\u2019ve gone through with Quinton, I\u2019m still fucking him. After all the shit with Tyson and that bitch of his vandalizing my car, I\u2019m still fucking him. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to make me stop, short of Jason finding out and wringing my neck. That\u2019s the truly pathetic part of all this.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors parted. I got on and pressed the button for the lobby level. She prevented the door from shutting by leaning on it. \u201cSo what are you going to do now, Zoe? Just continue on your path of destruction?\u201d</p><p>I threw my hands up in the air and then started grasping the chrome bar surrounding the inside of the elevator. \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now!\u201d I fought back the tears, determined not to shed another tear in front of Marcella. \u201cI love my husband to death,but maybe, instead of heading home, I\u2019ll go let one of my lovers have their way with me. Who knows?\u201d</p><p>She sensed my sarcasm. \u201cActually, I do know what I\u2019m going to do after I leave here,\u201d I continued. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit my best friend and make sure her ass is all right. I haven\u2019t seen Brina since I insisted on taking her to the emergency room last Saturday. And maybe, just maybe, if she\u2019s not in the middle of another crisis of her own, I\u2019ll ask her to let me cry on her shoulder for a change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marcella smiled at me. It was a weak, forced smile, but welcome just the same. She dropped her voice to almost a whisper. \u201cSounds like a good plan to me, Zoe. But listen\u2014\u201d She reached in the elevator and rubbed me on the shoulder. \u201cIf you ever want to talk again, I\u2019ll be right here. You can call me anytime, day or night. I can\u2019t make you continue therapy with me. I just want you to know I\u2019m always willing. Always!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks!\u201d The smile I returned was genuine.</p><p>The elevator doors were halfway closed when she stuck her foot in. \u201cZoe, we never got a chance to discuss your third affair. You sure you don\u2019t want to stay for another hour so we can continue the conversation?\u201d</p><p>I smirked, wondering how sick she would think I was if I told her the truth. Just threw the entire load of shit on her like I was tossing a penny in a wishing well. \u201cTrust me, Doc. That\u2019s the last thing I need to talk about right now. In fact, that\u2019s probably something better off left alone, period.\u201d</p> <p>She removed her foot. The last thing I saw as the elevator doors slammed was the perplexed expression on her face.</p><p>chaptertwenty-one</p><p>It was drizzling when I arrived at Brina\u2019s building. I didn\u2019t go in for a few minutes. I was still shook up over the unexpected altercation with Marcella. The last thing I was prepared for was her admitting she didn\u2019t have a clue what the fuck she was doing. She could\u2019ve told me that from jump street.</p><p>I should\u2019ve told Brina all of the drama from the get-go and saved all the dead presidents I was going to have to kick out on therapy. Not to mention the aggravation and humiliation I endured by telling a complete stranger all of my business. Still, I liked Marcella. I sensed something real about her. I only wished she could have helped.</p><p>I decided the heart-to-heart between Brina and I was long overdo. So what if she always viewed me as perfect? She understood the Zoe-Jason soap opera better than anyone. After all, she had a front-row seat to the whole thing. Gurlfriend was just going to have to get over the fact that her idol wasn\u2019t a lady, but a tramp. Brina and Iwent way back, and out of everyone, she wouldn\u2019t judge me. That much I knew for sure.</p> <p>After making a mad dash to get in the carpeted hallway of her building, I folded the newspaper I had over my head to protect my hairdo and jiggled the dampness off my coat. I knocked on her door and didn\u2019t get an answer. Her car was parked out front, so I was surprised when she didn\u2019t come to the door. After all, she was the one who went on and on about how she just went to work and came straight home every day. I couldn\u2019t imagine her hanging out, and since it was raining, I knew she wasn\u2019t out walking anywhere.</p><p>I heard some music playing loudly and realized it was coming from her place. I figured she was probably in the shower or something and didn\u2019t hear the door. I contemplated waiting out in the hall for a few minutes and knocking again. I was used to just barging in with the hidden key but for some strange reason, I felt it would be obtrusive that day.</p><p>I decided to wait a few moments. I had no desire to go home and face Jason right then and running to one of my other lovers was out of the damn question. Besides, I wanted to check on Brina\u2019s bruises and see if she planned to take me up on my job offer. Most of all, I needed to confide in her in the worst way. Enough of the lies!</p><p>I swung around when I heard the door across the hall open abruptly. There was an old white woman standing there in a housecoat. She had a baseball bat in one hand and a demonic expression on her pale face. I immediately jumped back against the wall. An eighty-year-old white woman holding a bat and glaring didn\u2019t sit well with me.</p><p>She looked me up and down and lowered the bat, deciding I didn\u2019t look like a criminal.</p><p>\u201cSomething bad happened in there last night.\u201d She whispered the words, like she was afraid of being overheard even though I was the only person in the hallway.</p> <p>I pointed at Brina\u2019s door, feeling my heart pounding in my chest. \u201cIn here? This apartment?\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head. \u201cSomethingrealbad!\u201d</p><p>With that, she slammed the door in my face. I stood there, paralyzed with fear. What the hell did she mean by that? I started banging on the old woman\u2019s door, but she didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhat do you mean, something bad? Ma\u2019am? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>My first instinct was to call Jason. I rummaged through my purse for my cell phone. After dialing the first five digits of our home number, I started laughing and turned the power off. This was ridiculous! That old woman was probably senile. For all I knew, she was making the whole thing up. Brina was just fine. She had to be. I\u2019d just seen her ass the other day, after</p><p>all.</p><p>I retrieved the extra key and stormed inside her apartment. Her living room was dark, but everything seemed intact. There was a light emitting from the cracked door of her bedroom. The music was coming from in there also. I\u2019ll never forget the song that was playing. It was Billie Holiday\u2019s version of \u201cGod Bless the Child.\u201d</p><p>I went into Brina\u2019s bedroom. I couldn\u2019t breathe. At first, my eyes refused to register what they were seeing. Ten seconds later, my screams began.</p><p>To this day, I\u2019m still confused about the chain of events that happened next. It didn\u2019t really matter who ran in there, who called the police, who picked me up off the floor, who called Jason to tell him to come and get me, who did this and who did that. We were all too late. Brina was gone, and my life would never be the same.</p> <p>I remember Jason rushing into the super\u2019s apartment, drenched with rain. At some point, the drizzling had turned into a full-fledged thunderstorm. The homicide detectives set up the super\u2019s place as their base of operations so the coroner\u2019s office and forensics team could do whatever it is they do when someone is brutally murdered in Brina\u2019s apartment without other people traipsing in and out. Jason joined me on the couch and almost had to slap me silly to get a response. I could only manage to wail, sink into his warm, muscular arms and pray for the whole nightmare to go away.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t go away. It seemed like we were there for hours while I answered all fifty million of their questions. Some of them I knew the answers to, and some I didn\u2019t. I told them they needed to go talk to that old heifer down the hall who didn\u2019t bother to call the police the night before when she heard something bad going on.</p><p>I described to them how I walked in the apartment and found Brina laid out in a funereal position on her bed, with her hands draped limply across her chest. All the bedding had been stripped away except the floral-patterned fitted sheet and mattress cover. I cringed at the thought of all the blood. There was blood everywhere. On the bed, on the carpet, even on the walls.</p><p>A forensics technician barged into the room to inform the detectives he\u2019d counted eighty-seven stab wounds, as if he was proud to be able to count so high. Jason spoke the words I was thinking: \u201cWhy does Zoe have to hear this? Don\u2019t you guys have any compassion?\u201d</p><p>One of the detectives obviously agreed. He took the insensitive bastard out in the hallway so he could finish relating his findings. I resumed giving my statement, what there was of it, telling them everything I knew\u2014what Dempsey looked like, where Brina had met him, what Iknew about the beatings, how I\u2019d pulled my switchblade on him once to make him leave, and how I\u2019d taken Brina to the hospital a few days before her death to get medical treatment.</p><p>After they were reasonably sure they\u2019d gotten everything useful out of me, they told Jason he could take me home and assured me they would track that rabid dog down at all costs.</p><p>My mother was there with the kids when we got home. They were already snug in their beds. Thank goodness it was one of the regular nights she kept them. Jason was able to come to my rescue right away, and I was grateful for that. If I had to face all of that alone while he waited for someone to come over to baby-sit, I would\u2019ve really been a basket case. Having my husband by my side during the ordeal was the only thing that kept me from slipping over the edge. Jason is my love, my life, my everything.</p><p>The next few days were pure hell. My mother practically moved in so she could treat me like a baby, bringing me mugs of warm milk, running my bathwater, and combing my hair like I was a complete invalid. Jason was a sweetheart. He took some time off from the office and handled Brina\u2019s funeral arrangements. Brina\u2019s mother was just as devastated as I was. She even sobered up for a few days to wallow in her grief. She couldn\u2019t deal with picking out caskets and a dress any more than I could. My baby did it all. He even arranged to pay for everything, since Brina had no insurance and her mother was barely making ends meet.The weather was beautiful the day of the funeral. I was very thankful. Brina had very few friends and neverstayed at a job long enough to make lifelong attachments with coworkers. For that reason, Jason arranged to have the funeral graveside. He\u2019d selected a beautiful white coffin and a huge bed of pink roses to be laid over it. He held my hand and comforted me throughout the entire ordeal.</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew it was over. That\u2019s when I knew I could beat my sexual addiction. Jason was all I ever needed. If I had to live the rest of my life curbing my sexual desires in order to be with him, then so be it. That was one sacrifice I was more than willing to make. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While we were walking back to the black limousine provided by the funeral parlor, I stopped him in his tracks just to give him a hug and a passionate kiss. \u201cI love you, Jason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Zoe, and this is forever!\u201d</p><p>I managed a smile for the first time since Brina\u2019s death. \u201cAlways has been! Always will be!\u201d</p><p>chaptertwenty-two</p> <p>I didn\u2019t go back to work for another week after Brina\u2019s funeral. I just couldn\u2019t deal with making decisions. I delegated different tasks to several senior members of my staff and spent quality time with my husband and my kids instead. How foolish it had been of me to risk everything I had to sate my sexual urges. I\u2019d lost so much valuable time screwing around, time I could\u2019ve had with the love of my life and the beautiful little people we made together.</p><p>When I did finally return to the office, most of the business issues were cleared off of my desk, but I still had a huge pile of phone messages. I wasn\u2019t all that surprised. I knew the majority of them were from my lovers before I even read them. My secretary had been suspicious of my extramarital activities for a long time. I\u2019m sure the three of them ringing the office phone off the hook during my absence had only cleared up any lingering doubts she may have been hanging on to. I didn\u2019t really care whatshe thought or knew. I already had enough people woven up in my web of deception.</p><p>I fingered through the messages and ended up ditching-them all in the wastebasket beside my desk. It was time for all the bullshit, lies, and stress to be over, and there was no time like the present. I told my secretary I would be back later that day, after having spent only ten minutes in my office. I had been away from the office for over a week already. A few more hours wasn\u2019t going to make a drastic difference.</p><p>I got out on the sidewalk, took in a deep breath, and exhaled. I was ready to get the drama over with and my life back in order. I was going to end all three affairs in one damn day, go home, and make love to the one man who held the key to my heart. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy, but never in a million years did I expect the shit to hit the fan as hard as it did.</p><p>I decided to go discuss matters with Tyson first because he was the most temperamental. I figured if I dealt with the worst of it and worked my way from there, I might end up with one hell of a migraine but with everything else intact. It was only about ten in the morning, so I had to go to the garage where he worked in order to talk. That was fine by me. Safety in numbers and all that jazz.</p> <p>When I pulled up, I spotted his motorcycle parked on the side of the building. I found him inside one of the service bays working on an import. His head was up underneath the hood. He was surprised when he heard my voice. \u201cTyson, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, almost bumping his head on the underside of the hood. \u201cDamn, you scared the shit out of me!\u201d He grabbed a rag so he could wipe some of the oil and grease off his hands.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to take you off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, where have you been? I\u2019ve been leaving messages for you at your office for almost two weeks.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the concrete floor to avoid eye contact. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Something came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwwwwwww, so in other words, you pushed my ass to the curb?\u201d He walked over to a little cooler that was sitting beside one of the toolboxes on a workbench and got out an ice-cold soda. He held the can out toward me. \u201cYou want one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d I walked over toward him and leaned on the workbench. I needed some strength to come from somewhere and was hoping the bench would have some mystical powers and help a sistah out.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up, Zoe? Must be mighty important for you to show up here out of the blue,at my job,after not even bothering to call for so long.\u201d</p><p>He was all eyes and ears. I was all nervous. Sex with Tyson had always been rough, and I had often wondered if that signified a violent streak in his nature. He had never hit me or anything, but there was a first time for everything. I was hoping I was dead wrong.</p><p>I cleared my throat and prayed he wouldn\u2019t haul off and punch me dead in the face. \u201cTyson, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He looked stunned at first, but the look was quickly replaced with one of anger. \u201cWhat\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>He knew what the hell I meant. \u201cYou and I are over.\u201d I announced it like I was calling out the winning raffle ticket number at a bazaar. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Tyson was silent for a good two, three minutes and so was I. He didn\u2019t hit me, so things were looking up. \u201cZoe, I think</p><p>you\u2019re just feeling stressed. Obviously something bad happened. You weren\u2019t even going to work oranything,so it must\u2019ve been serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, something very bad did happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, and if you don\u2019t want to talk about it, that\u2019s cool too. But don\u2019t let this affect us, baby. We can get past this.\u201d</p><p>He was so sincere. I was seeing a side of Tyson I never even knew existed\u2014a sensitive side. It almost made me want to keep him, but that was out of the question. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t get past this. I made a mistake, a terrible one, and this is all my fault. I take full responsibility for it. I played with other people\u2019s emotions to benefit myself, and I can\u2019t do it any longer. I have to burn the bridges with all of you and move on. My place is at home with my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up, what do you mean by burn the bridges with all of you?All of who?\u201d</p><p>Shit! I slipped! \u201cIt was just a figure of speech,\u201d I mumbled, trying to play it off. \u201cI meant burn the bridges with you.\u201d</p><p>He looked puzzled. \u201cOh, I thought you meant something else.\u201d</p><p>I opted to play dumb. \u201cSomething like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmmm, never mind. Let\u2019s get back to the matter at hand.\u201d He took me by the hand and started playing with my fingers, one by one. \u201cI can understand if you need some time to yourself, but I don\u2019t want to lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyson\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hear me out. Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I agreed, even though I knew nothing he could possibly say would make a difference.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been putting too much pressure on you, I\u2019ll back off. We can do this on your terms. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I was about to tell him that the situation was useless when all hell broke loose. I saw it and heard it at the sametime. A rock hit my car, shattering the back window.\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d</p><p>Tyson tried to prevent me from leaving the service bay. \u201cLet me handle this, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandle it? Fuck that!\u201dI pulled loose from him and went out into the sunlight to confront the bitch.</p><p>She was leaning on my car, smiling like she had just been crowned Miss America. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the tramp that\u2019s been fucking my man? Keep coming around him, trick! I just love fucking up your car!\u201d</p><p>She was a big hoochie momma. Much bigger than me. She had to be at least five-nine and 185 pounds but I didn\u2019t give a shit. I caught her with a right hook as soon as I covered the ground between us.</p><p>After that, she and I started scrapping. She pulled a small clump of my hair out, and I scratched her jaw with my wedding ring. It went on from there. She ripped one of the buttons off my shirt. I retaliated and kicked her in the pussy. About that time was when Tyson pulled her off me.</p><p>\u201cDusty, get the fuck off her!\u201d He grabbed her from behind and pulled her hands behind her back, holding them there.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t through with the amazon bitch though and kicked her again, in the stomach. \u201cDusty? You look like a dusty-ass bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, you trick!\u201d</p><p>By this time, Tyson was becoming unglued. \u201cZoe, get in the car and leave! We\u2019ll talk later! I\u2019ll come by your office!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyson, my damn window is broke! This is the second time this bitch has fucked with my car!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, trick, and I will fuck with your car again if you ever come sniffin\u2019 around my man again!\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe she was still talking trash. Obviously,Tyson had heard enough of her ass too, because he pushed her down on the ground and kicked her. That\u2019s when I jumped on him because hitting a woman, even a bitch whose pussy is so dry the crabs have to carry canteens, isn\u2019t acceptable in my book. I pulled Tyson\u2019s arm and tried to get him away from her. \u201cTyson, leave her alone! She\u2019s a female!\u201d</p><p>She looked up from the concrete with bloodshot eyes. \u201cTrick, he don\u2019t give a shit about hittin\u2019 a woman! That\u2019s what got his ass locked up before!\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, confused. \u201cLocked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, do us all a favor, get in the car, and go back to your office! I will come for you!\u201d He and I were staring at each other when Dusty took us both off guard by jumping up off the ground with the dexterity of a ninja and yanking Tyson\u2019s ear, pulling out the gold cross earring he wore in his one pierced ear. Blood started gushing everywhere, and she hauled ass. I would\u2019ve too; from the look on his face he was ready to beat her to a pulp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wasn\u2019t waiting around to see whatever went down next. By the time he turned around again to check on me, all he caught was a glimpse of the exhaust from my muffler. I had accomplished what I went there to do, and that\u2019s all that mattered. I just prayed his ass wasn\u2019t serious about coming to my office, because I wanted the situation over and done with. The comment Dusty made about him being locked up threw me for a loop. I never thought I needed to run a criminal background check before I took on a lover. I began to wonder if he was a woman beater like Dempsey. The police had yet to track down Dempsey and they asked the Alabama State Police to keep a look out for him as well. I would\u2019ve wished he was dead, but even death was too good for him after what he did to Brina. I wanted him to suffer in the worst way.</p><p>Driving back downtown, all sorts of confusion was going through my mind like a slideshow. I missed Brina, my head hurt, Tyson was a convicted criminal and I had no idea what crime he had committed, my window was busted out, my blouse was torn, my lip was bleeding, and I had one hell of a migraine. What worried me most was how I was going to explain any of it to Jason. He was all that mattered. Coming up with yet another lie about the car wasn\u2019t going to be that effortless. Not to mention the fact I looked like I had been in a street brawl, which I had. I would just have to come up with something to cover my ass. I always did.</p><p>The truly messed-up part was, the ordeal with Tyson only meant one down. I still had two more to go, and my sanity was slipping fast as I gripped the steering wheel with both hands on my way to my next and final destination.</p><p>chaptertwenty-three</p> <p>I got to Quinton\u2019s building about thirty minutes later and tried to make myself look presentable before I went up to the loft. I didn\u2019t care about the car window or any of that. I put some lipstick on, fingered my hair, and tucked my blouse into my skirt, trying to hide the fact it was missing a button. Why I was even going through that much trouble was beyond me. It wasn\u2019t like I was going on a date. I was going to end a mistake. Two of them.</p><p>When I got off the elevator, I hesitated before deciding which way to go first. I knocked on Quinton\u2019s door. He answered right away. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>He stood in the doorway, blocking my entrance into his place. \u201cCan I come in, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I was wondering why he was being so foul toward me until it hit me that maybe he had already found out something I should\u2019ve told him months before. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019ll say what I have to say right here and then leave.\u201d My legs started trembling, and for a brief second, I thought my knees were going to buckle underneath me. \u201cWhy are you being so nasty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo reason!\u201d He was snapping at me like a box turtle, and things were just not adding up.</p><p>\u201cQuinton, I get back to work, and I have fifty messages from you asking me to get in touch with you. Then I come over here, and you won\u2019t even let me in the door. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, Zoe? Things change.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I knew somethingdefinitelyhad happened I wasn\u2019t privy to. I was about to ask what it was when I heard the door to the stairwell creak. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re imagining things, Zoe.\u201d I looked back at</p><p>Quinton. I had never seen him leer at me that way. He had a look of hatred in his eyes. \u201cI guess you would have reason to be paranoid, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuinton, I\u2019m going to get straight to the point, since you seem to have a rock up your ass anyway.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t see you anymore.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at me!Just stood there and laughed all up in my face. The same man that had begged me to leave my husband and move in with him a thousand times. \u201cOh, so now I\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 joke, Quinton?\u201d</p><p>His voice returned to normal, and his smile disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a joke, Zoe. I just never realized it until the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other day? What in the hell are you talking about?\u201d I was becoming irritated, and my head was still killing me.</p><p>\u201cGuess what, Zoe?\u201d He crossed his arms and relaxed on the doorframe like a man about to get some revenge on an archenemy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I got the feeling it was going to be something I really didn\u2019t want to know but I asked anyway.</p><p>\u201cI had a luncheon meeting the other day about a new project I\u2019ve been commissioned for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? You lost me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the project is painting a mural for</p><p>the new civic center currently under construction.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and sucked on his teeth, and I wanted to die. \u201cPlease, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Now you\u2019re catching on. I always knew you were smart. The same civic center your husband,Jason,is the chief architect for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuinton, if you said something to him, I swear I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, I didn\u2019t say anything to Mr. Jason Reynard of Smith, Watson and Reynard over on Spring Street. You want to see his business card so you know I\u2019m not frontin\u2019 about meeting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, fuck you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already did that, Missy. Several times, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>I was in shock and couldn\u2019t utter a word. I just stood there with my mouth hanging open, wishing all of it would go away.</p><p>\u201cZoe, that man worships the ground you walk on. All this time, you had me believing he was some punk ass who doesn\u2019t pay you any attention and doesn\u2019t act like you\u2019re alive. You\u2019re such a lying bitch!\u201d</p><p>TheBword brought me out of my trance. \u201cI never said that. I never said Jason was like that. All I ever said about him was that he didn\u2019t want the same things sexually as I do. Jason loves me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. He does love you. Imagine how stupid and shitty I felt sitting there at lunch, listening tohim tell everyone about his beautiful, perfect wife. How much he loves you, how the two of you first met and fell in love, how proud he is of you for starting your own business and standing by his side for always, how he built you a house so you could always see the stars, how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said all that?\u201d I was overwhelmed because I never pictured Jason talking to business associates, or anyone else for that matter, about me like that.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did say all that!\u201dQuinton was about to slam the door in my face, but I pressed my hand up against it to hold it open.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me one thing. Give me your word you\u2019ll never tell him what happened between us. Please!\u201d I was at his mercy, and I damn well knew it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry your little lying ass over it, Zoe. I would never tell that man about us for two reasons. First of all, I feel sorry for the poor bastard, and secondly because, as ridiculous as it is, I still love your scandalous ass. You need help, you really do, and not the kind of help you thought you could find in me. You need professional help.\u201d</p><p>I started crying. He was right. \u201cQuinton, I tried to get professional help,\u201d I admitted. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t help me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I suggest you try harder.\u201d My cries went from sobs to straight-up wails. I could tell he wanted to hold me, but his common sense prevented him from doing so. I had hurt him enough. \u201cZoe, I\u2019m not trying to be mean to you. That\u2019s the last thing I want to do, but if you\u2019re not strong enough to put a stop to this for once and for all, then I have to be man enough to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Quinton was reading me like a book. Even though I came over there with the intention of breaking it off with him, more than likely we would\u2019veended up in bed if he had let me in. Just like the many times before I declared I was never coming back but succumbed to my addiction in the long run. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Quinton! I\u2019m so sorry this had to happen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, Boo.\u201d He reached out his thumb to wipe away some of the tears that were streaming down my cheek, and I savored the moment, for I knew it was the last and final intimate gesture between us.</p><p>It was then I heard another noise coming from the stairwell, but this time, I wasn\u2019t alone. Quinton yelled out, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>Tyson came barreling through the exit door with fire in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking someone else too? You cheap tramp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, who in the hell is this idiot?\u201d Quinton demanded to know.</p><p>\u201cTyson, how did you find me?\u201d I was freakin\u2019 the hell out. Being confronted by both of them at the same time was the last thing on my agenda.</p><p>\u201cYou wanna know how I found you?\u201d It didn\u2019t really matter to me. Asking the question was a reflex. He was there, and I was in a shitload of trouble. Bottom line. \u201cI was on my way to your office when I spotted your car and followed you here. My dumb ass was tracking you down to beg you to take me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold the damn phone!\u201d Quinton had gotten over his initial shock and rejoined the argument. \u201cYou\u2019re having an affair with his bitch ass too?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I screamed at the top of my lungs, \u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d</p><p>Just then, Diamond, who would\u2019ve had to have been plumb deaf not to hear all the shouting, opened her door and came out in the hall. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Quinton was the first to respond. \u201cZoe\u2019s just out here trying to clear up all her loose ends with her lovers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Diamond, lovers with ans! It seems Miss Zoe has been cheating on me while cheating on her husband, and lawd knows how many other poor bastards are caught up in this game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I wastooooooothrough then and just wanted to leave. \u201cI\u2019m sick of this shit, and all I want is for everyone to leave me the fuck alone.\u201d I looked at each one of them individually and then repeated the request.\u201cAll of you, leave me the fuck alone!\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Tyson called me a bitch and started strangling me. He was on top of me, his hands clasped around my neck like a vise. His anger was making his lips and cheeks shake. My airway was cut off, I was fading fast, and he would\u2019ve killed me if Quinton hadn\u2019t pried his hands off my neck.</p><p>\u201cMan, you can\u2019t hit a woman!\u201d They struggled for a few moments while Diamond helped me get up off the floor. Quinton got a hold of Tyson long enough for him to calm down and realize he had almost committed homicide.</p><p>Tyson stormed off toward the exit door and paused just long enough to glare at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not fuckin\u2019 worth it! Not even a bitch like you is worth going back to jail for!\u201d</p> <p>He kicked the exit door open and disappeared. Diamond asked me, \u201cDo you want to go in my apartment so we can talk?\u201d</p><p>I broke away from her hold and screamed, \u201cHell no!\u201d</p><p>She backed off, went back in her place, and shut the door while I pressed the call button for the elevator. When it arrived, I was still struggling to regain complete control over my breathing and didn\u2019t notice Quinton was still standing behind me until I got on and pulled the gatedown. As I pressed the button for the garage, Quinton spoke his final words to me. \u201cZoe, get some help. If not for you or your husband, do it for your kids.\u201d</p><p>He went back into his loft and slammed the door. I went back to my office sick, hurt, and disgusted. At the same time, I was relieved it was all over. Facing off with all three of my lovers in the same hallway at the same time was pure hell, but it was over, and my life could finally get back to normal.</p><p>chaptertwenty-four</p><p>I sat in my office, looking at the hordes of people on their way to this place or that place on the city streets below. My eyes were bloodshot, my bottom lip was puffy, my shirt was torn, my nylons were ripped to shreds, and I had fingerprints on my neck, but all in all, it had been a good day. My secretary, as well as everyone else, gave me the what-the-hell-happened-to-you look as I made my way to my secluded office. I clicked on the intercom and asked her to come into my office. Shane came running in with a pen and steno pad, ready to take dictation, and was surprised when she found out all I really wanted was to bum a pack of cigarettes. She started trying to get into my business, and I told her to take the rest of the day off with pay. I suggested she go take in a movie or get her nails done\u2014 anything, as long as she got the fuck out of my face.</p> <p>It had been ages since I took a drag off the legally manufactured cancer, but I was so stressed I neededsomething to get me through the rest of the day. It was only a little after noon, and all my walls had come tumbling down in the space of a morning. I called the auto club and told them to tow the car to the garage near the house. They asked a bunch of questions, since this was the second vandalism in such a short time. I tried to explain at first, and then I simply cussed the old battle-ax on the other end of the phone out. According to the contract, there was no limit to the number of times we could use their services, so I told her to send the damn tow truck and then slammed down the phone.</p><p>Getting the car taken care of was a start. However, that wasn\u2019t going to help me explain the rest to Jason. Specifically, why I looked like a female version of Rocky after a championship belt fight. I had to make up the lie of all mutha-fuckin\u2019 lies, and I had about five hours to come up with it.</p><p>I thought about saying I was mugged in the parking lot and blaming the broken car window on the assailant, stating it all happened during the struggle. I quickly decided against that one since, it meant calling the police and filing a false police report. It never could\u2019ve worked. There wouldn\u2019t be any broken glass on the ground around the car in the</p><p>parking garage of my office building, because all of it was in the parking lot at Tyson\u2019s job. Besides, I was already involved with the police because of Brina\u2019s death, and I knew they would assume I had been attacked by Dempsey if I professed I didn\u2019t get a good look at my assailant. Horrible idea, so I scratched it.</p><p>I thought about saying I got into a fight over a parking-space on one of the downtown streets on my way to a business meeting with a client. That wouldn\u2019t have worked either; Jason would\u2019ve insisted on knowing whereand with which client and then probably insist on asking them a bunch of questions. So that shit was out too.</p><p>There was always the truth of course, but my momma didn\u2019t raise no fool. I started chain smoking and choking, trying to get used to the nicotine in my system after all of those years. I spent a good hour trying to make up a lie and came to the conclusion I was basically ass out.</p><p>I stayed locked in my office for the next couple of hours and never did five seconds of actual work. Every time someone knocked on my door after realizing my secretary was gone from her desk, I told them I was in a meeting and to come back later. They bought into it, although I was alone. Even if they didn\u2019t buy it, their asses still weren\u2019t getting through the door.</p><p>By the time two o\u2019clock rolled around, I was so overcome with worry about what I was going to tell Jason and stressed out about all the confrontations of the day, I felt like my world had come to an end. I got out the compact mirror from my purse and took a good look at myself. I looked like death warmed over. My cheeks were thinning, and I realized I had allowed my addiction to sex to take priority over every other aspect of my life, including my health.</p> <p>Even though I couldn\u2019t imagine her ever forgiving me for the way I acted the last time we saw each other, I called Dr. Marcella Spencer\u2019s office and pleaded for an immediate appointment. Her secretary told me, in no uncertain terms, that the doctor was booked for the rest of the day and there was no way an exception could be made. I hung up and started sobbing. I had no clue what to do, and I felt so alone.</p><p>Less than fifteen minutes later, Dr. Spencer called me back and told me she had rearranged her schedule so she could see my pathetic ass right away. She sensed mynervousness over the phone and even offered to come to me. I told her I wouldn\u2019t be driving myself there and would prefer coming to her. We hung up, and I rushed past everyone in the outer offices before they could get a good look at me. I waved down a cab, and this man tried to playa hate me and jump in before I could. I told him to get the fuck out of my way and pushed him so I could get in. He had picked the wrong day to mess with me.</p><p>Dr. Spencer and I ran into each other as I was getting off the elevator on her floor. She was on her way back to her office from the ladies lounge. \u201cZoe, you got here quickly!\u201dShe seemed more anxious to talk to me than I was to talk to her. The smile on her face changed to horror when she got a good look at me in the hallway lighting. \u201cOh, my goodness! What happened to you, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t say a word. I couldn\u2019t breathe. I just fell into her arms and started wailing. She put her arms around me and helped me make it into the confines and safety of her inner office. For once, she didn\u2019t have to suggest the chaise longue. I crawled up on it into a ball and let it all go.</p><p>For a good five minutes, we were both speechless. Marcella just kept handing me tissue after tissue until I had used up the remainder of the box. She broke the silence. \u201cYou want something to drink, Zoe? Some coffee? Hot tea? Water? Soft drink?\u201d</p><p>I was beginning to wonder whether she was a therapist-or a flight attendant and hoped she didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted some salted peanuts next. I just shook my head, letting her know all I wanted to do was lie there and drown in my own misery.</p><p>\u201cZoe, we have to talk about this. You\u2019re very upset, and you look like you may need medical attention. Do you need me to call an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed my back, and I could tell her concern for my welfare was genuine. \u201cNo, no ambulance. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I turned over and lay on my back while she examined the marks on my neck with her hand. \u201cAre those fingerprints on your neck? Did someone try to choke you, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>I laughed\u2014a man blind in one eye could tell that. \u201cMore like murder me. Tyson tried to kill me this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201dShe had been sitting on the edge of the chaise next to me but jumped up, headed for her desk, and picked up the phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMarcella, what are you doing?\u201d I sat all the way up. The way she jumped into action scared the living daylights out of me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling the police, Zoe. You need protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201dI sprang to my feet, and a sharp pain struck me in my side. \u201cPut the phone down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, you\u2019ve got to go to the police. He tried to kill you. What makes you think he won\u2019t come after you again?\u201d</p> <p>I wrestled the phone from her hand and replaced it on the cradle. The irony of it all hit me. Less than three weeks before, Brina and I had the same argument, but she had been the one begging me not to call the police. Was I setting up my own untimely demise, just like she did?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Marcella. I really need to talk. After I\u2019ve told you everything, if you still think I should call the police, I won\u2019t argue with you. Right now, I just really need a friend.\u201d I gazed into her eyes, hoping she would go along.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Zoe.\u201d She got out her pad, pen, and tape recorder while I went and lay back down on the chaise. She sat down in the wing chair beside it. \u201cLet\u2019s talk!\u201d</p><p>I ended up doing all the talking. I spent the next hour telling her everything that had happened since I stormed out of her office. I told her about how I left with the intention of going to talk to Brina but found nothing except her body full of stab wounds and her blood splattered everywhere. I told her about Dempsey, how I pulled a switchblade on him that one time, and how the police had had no luck in tracking him down since the murder.</p><p>I told her how I had decided to go against her advice and try to end all the affairs at one time instead of gradually. I told her about all the shit I had endured since the sun came up that morning, and all the things I feared might happen before the sun went down that night. I told her about the confrontation with Tyson and Dusty and how a fight ensued between the two of us. I told her about my confrontation with Quinton and how he had shocked me by kicking me to the curb after he had a luncheon meeting with my husband. I told her about the confrontation between Quinton and Tyson after Tyson followed me there and tried to strangle me to death in the hallway.</p> <p>I told her about the ultimate and last confrontation with all three of my lovers in the hallway. I told her about the sexual experiences I had with Diamond after her continual insistence that I try bumping coochies. I told her how I didn\u2019t like it at all and never even touched Diamond but just let her touch me. I told her how my need for affection had gone over the edge and that I regretted that situation most of all, because I was not and had never been attracted to women.</p><p>I told her that I would keep my eyes closed the majority of the time I was with any of them, imagining thattheir hands and tongues and dicks and other body parts really belonged to Jason, the only true love I had ever known.</p><p>Marcella listened intently and never interrupted me once. I felt much more relaxed after I let it all out and realized the explanation of what had been going on was more for my benefit than hers. As I listened to myself speak the words, it became all to clear to me what had to be done. So when she asked the question, I was quick with my reply.</p><p>She put her pad down, cut the recorder off, and then reached out to caress my hand. \u201cZoe, you do realize that if there is ever to be any happiness or hope for your marriage, you\u2019ve got to tell your husband everything? You\u2019ve got to tell Jason!\u201d</p><p>I looked over at her and whispered, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Marcella lent me some clothes she kept in a duffel bag for working out at her gym three nights a week. The sweatpants were a size too big for me, and the T-shirt swallowed me up, but I didn\u2019t care. I simply couldn\u2019t face Jason with torn and battered clothing. I needed to maintain a slight air of dignity. Her tennis shoes were a perfect fit, though, so I didn\u2019t have to wear my heels with the sports clothing.</p> <p>She was such a sweetheart, even trying to insist she go with me to hold my hand while I told him. I refused; it was something I had to do alone. We went to the ladies\u2019 lounge, where she helped me fix my hair and touch up my makeup, which was smeared all over my face. The marks on my neck were horrendous. She used some cake makeup to try to make them less startling.</p><p>I called Jason\u2019s office to tell him I was going to catch a cab over. I wanted to make sure I caught him before he headed home, so we could drive somewhere and talkwithout the kids being present. His secretary said he had someone in his office and was adamant about not being disturbed by anyone. I started to tell her I was the exception, which she should have already known, but elected to have her inform Jason not to leave until I got there.</p><p>The next call was to my mother, who was already at the house with the kids, having picked them up from school shortly after three.</p><p>I asked her if she could stay late, because Jason and I had decided to have dinner in the city and possibly take in a movie, and she agreed. After I hung up the phone, I felt guilty about all of the lies I had told my mother. She was one of my many victims, along with my husband, my kids, and my lovers. I had no idea how I was going to admit all my appalling deeds to her\u2014I would cross that bridge when I got to it.</p><p>Jason was the matter at hand, and one of two things would be the result of confessing all my sins. He would either believe I never meant to hurt him, realize I had an illness, and stick by my side throughout the recovery process, or he would leave, which was a fate worse than death to me.</p><p>Marcella called me a cab. While I was waiting, I asked if she was a religious woman. She smiled and told me how she had grown up in the church and was a true Christian. I told her I didn\u2019t have much experience with religion but did believe in God and asked if she would teach me how to pray. We both got on our knees, leaned our elbows on the chaise, clasped our fingers, and prayed for my salvation.</p><p>chaptertwenty-five</p><p>On the way to Jason\u2019s architectural-firm, I stared out the window of the cab at all the people in a hurry to get the hell away from work. It was just after five, and the rush-hour pandemonium had begun. I asked the cabdriver if he could speed it up, because I was in a hurry. He cursed under his breath at me in some foreign language but did get a bit more aggressive with his driving.</p> <p>After all the years of hiding things from him, going way back to our childhood, I was anxious to clear the air. Jason was the one person I should\u2019ve revealed everything to from jump. If I had, none of the other events would have happened in the first place. There would\u2019ve never been an affair, rather less affairs, and my marriage would never have been in jeopardy.</p><p>I was hoping Jason would understand. I believed in my heart he would, if I could only get him alone somewhere and explain it to him in my own way. Maybe I would takehim back out to the observatory or the inn at the lake, since those were the sites of our most recent pleasant memories. No matter where I did it, it had to be done. I was prepared to face the consequences of my actions.</p><p>When we got about four blocks from Jason\u2019s office, I noticed the flashing police lights ahead and wondered what had happened. The cab driver was stuck in heavy traffic, so I decided to pay him and trek the rest of the way on foot. I walked toward the office, slowly at first, but broke into a run when I saw Jason being handcuffed. By the time I covered the three remaining blocks, they had already put Jason in a squad car and driven off. I was out of breath and in a state of panic.</p><p>I spotted Jason\u2019s secretary, Allison, standing on the steps and rushed up to her. \u201cWhat happened? Where are they taking Jason?\u201d She glared at me, gritting her teeth, and crossed her arms in front on her. \u201cWhy are you ignoring me? Where the hell are they taking my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you have a good man and don\u2019t know how to treat him.\u201d She rolled her eyes at me before continuing. \u201cThe rest of us spend our entire lives trying to find a good man. It\u2019s women like you that ruin it for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to slap the shit out of her but just got up in her face instead. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, nor do I give a shit. I asked you a question, and I would like a fuckin\u2019 answer. Now, what the hell happened here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you what happened. When you called earlier, and I told you Jason had someone in his office, that someone was your lover.\u201d My mouth fell open. She sucked her teeth and added, \u201cYou\u2019re such a tramp!\u201d</p><p>I went ballistic, grabbed her by the shoulders, and started shaking her. \u201cWhat lover? What the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>My immediate thought was that Quinton had changed his mind and broken his word to me about not telling Jason. I figured he told him out of anger or to protect him from my evil ways. It was apparent at the loft he felt more sorry for Jason than for me. I realized my mistake when Allison pointed to the other squad car that was still parked out front with the lights on. Tyson was seated in the back with handcuffs on.</p><p>I left Allison standing there along with other members of the staff, including one of Jason\u2019s partners, who was shaking his head in disgust at me, and walked slowly over to the police car, wondering how the hell Tyson knew where to find Jason in the first place. Then I recalled the creaking exit door at the beginning of my confrontation with Quinton and realized he must\u2019ve heard Quinton talking about Jason, including the location of his office. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyson confronting my husband was the last thing I ever expected. I shuddered to think what he must\u2019ve told him and the crass manner in which he did it. How embarrassing it must\u2019ve been to Jason to be accosted in his own place of business and told what a sex fiend his wife really was.</p><p>Before I could get all the way to the car, a police officer grabbed me by the arm, instructing me to stand back. I informed him my husband had been taken away in the other car and asked where he was taken and why.</p><p>The officer informed me that Jason and Tyson had gotten into a physical altercation, and while no charges would probably be filed against Jason, since he was provoked into fighting at his own office, they had to take them both down to the station to get the mess sorted out.</p><p>\u201cOfficer, I can explain this whole thing. It\u2019s all my fault. My husband had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, you definitely need to come down to the precinct and give a statement. Here\u2019s the address to thestation. I\u2019ll put my name on the card as well.\u201d He scribbled his name on the little white generic card, on the blank line provided, and handed it to me. \u201cDo you need a lift?\u201d</p><p>I considered his offer, but only for a second. There was no way I was getting in the same car with Tyson, even if I was in the front and he was behind a barrier and handcuffed in the backseat. He had already tried to kill me and had apparently tried to kill my husband too.Getting in the car with him could only mean another ugly situation. \u201cNo thanks, officer. I have another way to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, ma\u2019am.\u201d He got into the driver\u2019s seat, and while he was pulling off, I stared at Tyson, who had a look in his eyes that could melt ice. His lips were trembling, and while not a professional lip reader, I recognized the all-too-familiar nickname for me when he mouthed, \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>I kept a key to Jason\u2019s Land Rover on my ring, so I ran to the garage and found it parked in his assigned space. When I got to the precinct, it was pure madness. Those citizens who chose to cross the blue line of the law\u2014from pimps and prostitutes to drunk drivers and drug dealers\u2014and the ones paid to represent them were everywhere. They were all there. It was the one place Jason didn\u2019t belong.The officer that gave me the card wasn\u2019t even there, having been sent back out on his beat. The female officer behind the booking desk told me to have a seat and wait for a senior officer to come and get me. I complied, even though I didn\u2019t want to. I wanted Jason out of jail right that second, but causing a scene and bumrushing thewoman behind the desk would\u2019ve only landed my ass in jail too. Then again, I was the one who really belonged there. I was the seedy element.</p><p>After about fifty minutes of pure hell, not knowing where my baby was, a man in a pair of gray slacks, white shirt, and paisley tie approached me with a shield hanging out of his shirt pocket. \u201cMrs. Reynard, I\u2019m Detective Rinaldi. Please follow me.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t shake my hand or anything. He just stood there while I gathered my belongings so I could follow him to a small, cramped room at the end of one of the several cluttered hallways. He was a big man; the floor seemed to shake underneath his feet as he walked. He was having trouble breathing, and it wouldn\u2019t have taken more than an educated guess to realize a heart attack was lurking in his near future.</p><p>Once we were in the room with the door closed, he asked, \u201cMrs. Reynard, I understand you think you can clear up the whole situation with your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can!\u201d Twenty times a day, various people asked me would I like something to drink, and I always replied no. The one time I really was suffering from an extremely dry mouth, no one asked. I suppose making drink runs wasn\u2019t in the detective\u2019s job description. He was obviously a man on a mission, all about getting to the bottom of whatever dilemma faced him in the quickest manner possible. I decided not to waste his time.</p><p>I quickly related the whole sordid story\u2014at least the part of it involving my extramarital affair with Tyson and the ultimate breakup. I told him Tyson couldn\u2019t deal with being dismissed from my life and decided to seek revenge by telling my husband. I conveniently omitted the attempted murder by strangulation and my other affairs. Things were complicated enough without bringing all ofthat into it. I knew that would only escalate matters and possibly hold up Jason\u2019s release.</p><p>Detective Rinaldi turned out to be a very nice man after all. He won brownie points for being one of the few people not to call me a bitch, ho, or tramp that day. He just calmly listened to what I had to say and informed me, \u201cThese types of situations happen every day.\u201d</p><p>That shouldn\u2019t have surprised me, considering all of the</p> <p>people who appear on talk shows fighting over their lovers, but his nonchalant approach took me off guard just the same. Scandalous affairs, dishonesty, violence, and things like that are supposed to happen to other people. Not to Jason and me.</p><p>\u201cWait here, Mrs. Reynard.\u201d With that, he left me in the room all alone for about ten minutes. It felt more like ten hours to me.</p><p>He came back in with a grin on his face. \u201cYour husband will be released without any charges. His story matches yours, and in this country, self-defense isn\u2019t a crime.\u201d</p><p>I jumped up from the table and took his stubby hand, shaking it viciously whether he wanted to shake hands with me or not. \u201cThanks so much, Detective Rinaldi. I really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>On my way out of the room, I hesitated. It shouldn\u2019t have mattered to me, but I had to find out. \u201cDetective, what about Tyson? Will he be released too?\u201d</p><p>He smirked, probably wondering why I gave a damn, since I claimed the affair was over. \u201cNow that\u2019s a different matter. Mr. Chase violated his parole so the PO assigned to his jacket will have to deal with him.\u201d</p><p>In all that time, I never knew Tyson\u2019s last name. That made me feel even more like a whore. Jeopardizing my marriage for a man I knew on a first-name basis only. WhatDusty blurted out earlier ran through my mind. Gurlfriend had been telling the truth. \u201cOn parole for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to divulge that information. Sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no can do.\u201d He was ready to get rid of me and move on to the next case awaiting his attention. \u201cYou can have a seat out in the waiting area. He\u2019ll be coming out that way from the holding cell in a few moments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks again, detective!\u201d He didn\u2019t respond, so I closed the door and made my way back out near the booking area. The worst challenge of the horrid day was still in front of me. I only hoped I could make Jason see the light.</p><p>My optimism quickly faded the moment I saw Jason\u2019s face. I had known and loved the man all my life and had never seen him look so hurt, angry, and disappointed. He glanced at me, and when I headed toward him, he rapidly brushed past me, almost knocking me on my ass right there in the middle of the station. I followed him outside and caught up to him at the bottom of the station steps.</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d He just kept walking, headed in the opposite direction from the Rover, since he didn\u2019t know where it was parked anyway. He didn\u2019t care where he was headed. He just wanted to get the hell away from me. I was right on his heels. \u201cJason, you\u2019ve got to talk to me!\u201d</p><p>He stopped dead in his tracks, turned around, and glared at me. \u201cZoe, I don\u2019t have to do shit but stay black, pay taxes, and die! I don\u2019t have shit to say to you right now!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, but he didn\u2019t walk away from me either. I took that as my cue to try to explain. Even though he claimed he didn\u2019t want to talk, I knewhim like a book. He wanted me to make sense out of it to him, or at the very least make a sincere attempt. \u201cI was going to tell you, Jason. I tried to tell you a thousand times, and after talking to Dr. Spencer today, I was on my way to tell you. I swear!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and started walking around me like he was examining a piece of furniture. \u201cDo you honestly expect me to believe you were going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He was right! There was no reason on earth he should believe me. I tried to touch his arm, but he pulled away from me. \u201cBaby, can we please just go someplace quiet and talk? I asked Momma to stay late with the kids. I told her we were going to dinner and a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to your mother?\u201d Then as an afterthought, he added, \u201cI guess you\u2019re an expert at lying though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I could\u2019ve denied it, but the lies were going to stop. Lying had done enough damage. \u201cYes, I\u2019m an expert. Jason, I\u2019m very sick, Boo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that right! That\u2019s the one thing we can agree on, and who the fuck is Dr. Spencer?\u201d</p><p>We were making some headway. We were having a conversation without raising our voices and I felt maybe there was a chance for us yet. \u201cDr. Marcella Spencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? What kind of doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA therapist. The one I was telling you about. The one I met a while back.\u201d I diverted my eyes to the ground because I couldn\u2019t look him in the eyes and continue. \u201cShe\u2019s been counseling me about my addiction to sex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201dSo much for not yelling.\u201cSexual addiction? What the fuck?\u201d</p><p>The poor baby was trying so hard to have some faith in me. He had loved me just as long as I had loved him, and I could tell he was trying to grasp on to whatever might beleft. \u201cThe whole thing with Tyson was nothing. He means nothing to me. You\u2019re the only man I have ever loved, and you\u2019re the only man I will ever love. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that what?\u201d I stood there trying to figure out a way to tell him I sought things from others he would never give to me sexually. \u201cJust that what, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t do it! I would have given anything for Marcella Spencer to be there. I would have given anything for my mother to be there. I would have given anything for Brina to be there. Anybody willing to hold me and tell me it would be all right.</p> <p>\u201cJason, I love you, and you love me, and we\u2019ll work this out. I promise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, are you even hearing the shit you\u2019re saying? That man barged into my office and told me you\u2019ve been fucking him for months. What am I supposed to say now? Oh gee, it\u2019s no big deal?\u201d</p><p>Jason sounded so sarcastic, his words cut through my heart like a knife. \u201cNot at all. It\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s a very big deal, and I understand that. All I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t make a final decision to throw away everything we\u2019ve built together until you hear me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYOU THREW IT AWAY!!!!!!!\u201dFor a second, I thought he was going to hit me. \u201cYou threw our marriage and our life away for a piece of dick! Not me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way it happened, Jason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve loved you all my life, Zoe. I\u2019ve tried to give you everything you ever wanted, everything you ever asked for. I have never,evercheated on you. I\u2019ve never even thought about it. Not once! Then you turn around and do this shit to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how many women have tried to sleep with me? I have women trying to throw pussy atme every damn day, and I never cheated on you, because you were my life!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still your life, and you\u2019re mine! Don\u2019t you see that? I just need to fix what\u2019s wrong with me, and we can go back to the way things were!\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even realize what you\u2019ve done. You don\u2019t realize the damage you\u2019ve caused. We have three kids, Zoe. Three beautiful kids. Did they ever once cross your mind when you were out in the streets acting like a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the time, baby. I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to hurt them. I never meant to hurt anyone, but I couldn\u2019t control it.\u201d</p> <p>People were walking past us in both directions the entire-time but we were lost in our own little world. \u201cJason, please. Let\u2019s go someplace where we can be alone and talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to be alone with you! I\u2019m not sure I want to be anywhere near you period!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, Jason! Please don\u2019t do this to me!\u201d I tried to touch him again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 touch me!\u201d I started crying after managing to keep my tears under control up until that point. \u201cI never loved them, Jason! Never! They meant nothing to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey? They?\u201dI started backing away from him. I\u2019d messed up big-time and I knew it. \u201cWhat the fuck do you mean bythey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can explain, Jason. Dr. Spencer will help me explain it to you. Let\u2019s go see her, and she can help us get over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a tramp, a bitch, and a whore just like that mutha fucka said! Pure evil!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that, Jason!\u201d</p> <p>He looked at me with pure disgust. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s alltrue, Zoe! It\u2019s all true! You\u2019re nothing but a manipulative, cheatin\u2019, bitch-ass whore! That\u2019s what you are, and that\u2019s all you\u2019re ever going to be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home, Boo. Let\u2019s go home and play with our kids and get a good night\u2019s sleep. We\u2019ll talk about this in the morning when we both calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019m not going home with you! I\u2019m not lying down with you! In fact, I\u2019m going home alone, and if you try to show up there, I\u2019ll make sure you regret it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being rational. We have to go home at some point. What will my mother think if you go home without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to think the truth, because I\u2019m going to</p><p>fuckin\u2019 tell her! I\u2019m going to tell her all about her baby girl, and how she\u2019s nothing but a lyin\u2019 whore!\u201d</p><p>He started walking away from me, and when I tried to grab his shirt, he swung around and hit me in the face. I fell on the ground but was determined to hang onto him. I grabbed hold of his pants leg but he kept walking, dragging me along the concrete until I couldn\u2019t hang on anymore.</p><p>\u201cJASON, NOOO!!!!! I can\u2019t live in a world without you!\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me, and I will never forget his words. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate, because as of this very moment, you\u2019re dead to me! Fuckin\u2019 dead! In fact, why don\u2019t you do everyone involved a favor and just fuckin\u2019 die!\u201d</p><p>I got up from the concrete. He walked farther and farther away from me, and I realized he was right. I did deserve to die for what I did to him. \u201cYou want me to die, Jason?\u201d</p><p>It was dark out, and the rush hour was over, so the speed of traffic had gotten back to normal. I repeatedmyself because I wanted him to see what I was about to do. I wanted him to see how much I truly loved him, how much he meant to me, and how my life meant nothing without him. \u201cYou want me to die, Jason?\u201d He turned around and stared at me. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you, Boo!\u201d</p><p>With that, I walked out into the middle of traffic and waited. Cars starting slamming on their brakes. All I could see were blinding headlights. I heard Jason scream,\u201cNOOOOO!\u201dand saw him running toward me as fast as he could.He did love me! He did care!I was about to run into his arms when I saw the lights fast approaching out of the corner of my eye. The guy in the floral delivery van tried to stop and turned the wheel, but the truck skidded toward me sideways. I took one last look at Jason, who was less than five yards away and closing. I felt the impact, and then there was darkness.</p><p>chaptertwenty-six</p><p>The dripping sound from my IV was the first thing I heard when I woke up. My eyes adjusted to the fluorescent lighting in the ceiling of my hospital room. At first I thought I was paralyzed, because I couldn\u2019t move my neck, but it moved a bit during my second attempt. I realized that it was just really stiff.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to move, Zoe. I\u2019ll go get the doctor on call.\u201d I recognized Marcella Spencer\u2019s voice right off the bat, even though I couldn\u2019t adjust my neck to see her. I heard her heels clicking against the floor when she rushed out into the hallway to find someone to check me out.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was getting poked and prodded all over my body. The nurse took my temperature and blood pressure while the doctor, who had to be the resident on call because he looked like a teenager, examined me with his stethoscope and checked my ears, nose, and eyes. When he got to my mouth, it was so dry and brittle I could barely open it. \u201cMrs. Reynard, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019llcheck your throat later. We\u2019ve been feeding you intravenously for the past week, so a dry mouth is perfectly normal.\u201d</p><p>As much as it hurt, I had to speak. \u201cWeek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve been here in the University Hospital since last Friday. The night of your accident. Do you remember anything that happened?\u201d</p><p>I blinked my eyes because they were watery and glanced over at Marcella, who was sitting in a pleather chair designated for visitors. \u201cI remember everything.\u201d</p><p>The nurse returned with a small pitcher of water and a paper cup. I gulped the water down gratefully. The needle of the IV hurt my arm a little when I held the cup up to my mouth. The doctor was about to drill me with a bunch of questions. I immediately told him I was too tired and insisted on getting some rest. He agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. It\u2019s the middle of the night, and it would probably be better if Dr. Ferguson, your regular physician, talked to you anyway. He\u2019ll be here first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Everyone cleared out of the room except Marcella. \u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband called me the night of the accident and told me.\u201d</p><p>I was extremely hoarse. \u201cJason called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. He told me about what happened and how you discussed the fact you had been seeing me with him.\u201d She moved the chair closer to the bed. \u201cI must admit I was surprised you told him about the therapy. You seemed so ashamed about having to seek help for your addiction. I was even more shocked you would walk out in the middle of traffic and try to kill yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A single tear flowed down my right cheek. \u201cAt the time, Marcella, I didn\u2019t think I had one reason to live.\u201dShe held my hand tightly. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m still not sure I have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of reasons to live. A lot has happened we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyson told Jason about us, and now he hates me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jason doesn\u2019t hate you. He loves you very much. He and I have talked quite a bit this past week, and I can see why you adore him so. He\u2019s a very special man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, he is.\u201d It suddenly hit me that Jason was nowhere in sight. I wondered why he wasn\u2019t by my side if he really loved me. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here the entire time, Zoe. Your mother has been watching the kids most of the time, but Jason also hired a live-in sitter so she can come spend time with you at the hospital as well. I met your mother. She\u2019s a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>I was so ashamed. \u201cDoes my mother know? About everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she does, and she loves you more now than ever.\u201d Marcella continued to grasp my hand and used her other hand to rub my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about a thing, Zoe. Everything is going to be fine. Jason wants to work out your marriage problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does? Are you serious?\u201d Could it be my prayers had been answered?</p> <p>\u201cYes, he does. I convinced him to go home for a little while and spend some time with the kids, since you were comatose anyway. I told him I would stay overnight with you. The hospital allows me visiting rights around the clock since I\u2019m a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Thanks so much for everything, Marcella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for thanks, Zoe. You\u2019ve become much more than a patient to me. I would like to think of us as friends.\u201d</p><p>I managed a weak smile. \u201cI would like for us to become friends. I would like that very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already friends, and friends we shall remain. Now get some sleep, and I\u2019ll be right here if you need anything. Jason will be back early in the morning. I\u2019m sure seeing you with your eyes open will be a blessing to him.\u201d</p><p>I drifted back off to sleep, and for the first time in a long, long time, I fell asleep not dreading what would happen when the sun came up. Marcella said Jason still loved me and wanted to save our marriage. Thank goodness my accident wasn\u2019t fatal. Thank goodness I had a second chance with the love of my life.I slept like a baby for the remainder of the night. Just like Marcella promised, Jason was there when I opened my eyes the next morning. I was so relieved to see him. I was on my side, and he was behind me on the bed, also asleep, with his arm draped over my waist.</p> <p>I wanted to let him sleep, but I was anxious to talk to him. Having his arm around me was extremely comforting. At least I knew he didn\u2019t find the thought of touching me repulsive. \u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>I tried to turn over to face him but had a hard time maneuvering with the IV in my arm. My movements jolted him awake. He opened his eyes. I had made it as far as getting on my back so I could look at him. \u201cHey, Jason,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Boo.\u201d I took a survey of my hospital room and noticed the drastic yet pleasant change from the night before. There were helium balloons, cards, and flowers everywhere, and a huge red balloon with the wordsI LOVE YOU ALWAYSwas tied to one of the safety handles of the bed.</p><p>I started blushing. \u201cJason, did you do all of this since I went to sleep last night?\u201d</p><p>He brushed his hand across my cheek. \u201cYes\u2014 Marcella called me to tell me you came out of your coma, and I rushed over here. She told me to wait until this morning, but I couldn\u2019t, so while you were sleeping, I raided the allnight drugstore down the street. It was after hours for the gift shop here in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet! Thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you for being alive and coming back to me. I was so afraid you were going to die when I saw that van hit you. I didn\u2019t get there in time to stop it. It was all my fault you were out there in the middle of the traffic in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, none of this is your fault. I\u2019m the one who fucked up, just like you said. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even here with me after all the things I did. I deserve to lose everything, and I\u2019ll understand if you want to end the marriage. I don\u2019t want you to stay just because of the kids.\u201d</p> <p>He took my hand, spread my fingers open, and kissed them one at a time. \u201cZoe, I want you to listen to me very carefully, okay, and don\u2019t interrupt, because I might lose my nerve and never get all the words out.\u201d</p><p>I turned a little bit more toward him so I could</p><p>rest my hand on his thigh. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore there were any kids, before there was any house or any business, there was me and you. As much as we hated each other the first time we met\u2014and by the way, I still swear up and down you are exaggerating about kicking my ass.\u201d We both giggled. \u201cAnyway, as much as we despised each other at first, what eventually grew out of that was love,real love, and it\u2019s the kind of love that never dies.\u201d</p><p>I bit my bottom lip to make sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming. I knew that if I felt the pain, then I wasn\u2019t imagining Jason\u2019s words. My lipdidbegin to ache, and I was grateful for the pain. \u201cI love you, Zoe. That\u2019s why it hurt so bad when Tyson came storming into my office telling me not only things about you that I never knew, but also things I could never imagine you doing.\u201d</p><p>Tears starting running down my cheeks, and I wanted to tell him I never meant to hurt him. I wanted to tell him so many things, but he had asked me not to say a word, so I just listened. \u201cLooking back on it now, all the signs were there. You did try to talk to me on countless occasions, and I always snapped at you. I can see that now. Dr. Spencer told me how you related everything to her about how we met, how we fell in love, and how things got complicated. She even told me you thought I looked sexy riding my dad\u2019s old lawn mower with no shirt on. I never knew that.\u201d</p><p>He made me laugh again, and hearing the old version of Jason again was heartwarming, to say the least. \u201cYou see, the only side of this whole story I\u2019ve ever been able to relate to is my own. I never knew your side of the story. I never knew the things that went on in your mind. Not until now.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere along the way, we lost something, and I think that something is communication. I promise you that you\u2019ll never have to look for love and attention from anywhere else. Not ever again. You can talk to me about anything, and I won\u2019t snap at you. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s immoral or disgusting. I promise!\u201d</p><p>He took his hand and gently started caressing my stomach. \u201cAs far as the affairs you had, I was very upset and disappointed. I have to be honest and tell you it may take a while for me to truly get over it, but I will. We can get past this because I realize you didn\u2019t do it to hurt me,you didn\u2019t do it because you didn\u2019t love me, and Iknowyou never loved any of them. When you told me you were sick that night, I didn\u2019t believe you. Now, after talking to the doctor, I do think you did all of those things for reasons beyond your control.\u201d</p><p>Jason kissed me gently on my lips. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get through this, and we\u2019re going to save our marriage\u2014no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes. Dr. Spencer\u2019s going to help us, and she has a friend down in Florida who\u2019s willing to come up here and help us overcome our sexual issues. I love you, Zoe, and this is forever.\u201d</p><p>He got quiet so I added, \u201cAlways has been! Always will be!\u201d</p><p>We lay there, holding each other in silence, and something Jason had mentioned began to worry me. \u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean when you said Dr. Spencer and her friend are going to help us deal with our sexual issues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d He had a perplexed look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou said our sexual issues, not just mine.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, and his eyes got watery. \u201cYes, I did say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d My heart started thumping loudly in my chest.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things I need to tell you also, Zoe. There are reasons why it\u2019s always been difficult for me to make love to you completely. Just know that it was never anything about you. It was never anything about your appearance, like you apparently thought. You\u2019ve always been and will always be the most beautiful and amazing woman in the entire world to me.\u201d</p><p>I tried to prop myself up on a pillow using my elbows, but I was too weak. \u201cAre you saying you cheated on me too, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I told you I never cheated on you, and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve never even thought about it. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it, Jason?\u201d I wanted him to explain what he meant, because he was scaring the hell out of me.</p><p>\u201cZoe, let\u2019s just get some rest. I\u2019m so tired. Running back and forth from the hospital and trying to keep up with everything else has drained me this past week. I\u2019m just glad you didn\u2019t fool around and die on me. After we get some rest and the doctors get here, we\u2019ll get this all cleared up for once and for all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t say anything else, and I didn\u2019t bother him. I let him fall asleep with his head on my chest. I wanted to know what he meant, but decided to wait until the doctors got there, as he requested. All that time, I thought I was the only one with the sexual issues. While I knew Jason was not willing to experiment in bed, I never thought he had anyrealproblems except for lack of creativity. Obviously I was wrong, and the road to recovery was going to have more twists and turns than I had ever imagined. We loved each other though, and our love was strong. If it could survive all the shit I had dealt it, then it could survive anything about Jason that might surface. As I drifted off to sleep, I whispered aloud to no one in particular, \u201cI\u2019ve survived my cheating. I\u2019ve survived getting hit by a freakin\u2019 van, and Iwillsurvive this too, so bring it on!\u201d</p><p>chaptertwenty-seven</p><p>Dr. Leonard Graham was a very handsome older man. He was full of energy, even after his flight in from Florida and fighting his way through the crowds and congestion at the airport. He looked to be about six feet even, with a bit of a tummy, nothing fifteen minutes on a Stairmaster for a couple of weeks couldn\u2019t cure. He was caramel, with droopy yet sincere dark brown eyes, and his perfectly capped teeth gave him character. All in all, I liked him right off the bat. I got the feeling Jason did too. It would make it a lot easier for us to talk to him, since we thought he was cool. If some uppity, thinking-he-knew-it-all nucca had shown up instead, I would\u2019ve had to tell Marcella all bets were off, friend of hers or not.</p><p>A couple of days had passed since I first woke up from my coma. I spent them trying to recover from my injuries, which thankfully didn\u2019t amount to much more than a few bruised ribs and a big-ass lump on the head. There\u2019s a lot to be said for being knocked out for a wholeweek. Because I didn\u2019t know what was going on, I missed out on the worst of the pain and had been so drugged up by the IV when I woke up, I didn\u2019t have to deal with all of that. Whatever pain I missed, I\u2019m quite sure it was nothing like labor. Jason had the nerve to suggest another baby. I told him his ass had better be joking\u2014if I went through labor one more time, both of us were coming out of the delivery room on a stretcher.</p> <p>Jason was there around the clock, except for going home to shower and change. Dr. Ferguson, my physician, wouldn\u2019t let the kids come visit, but Jason took instant photos of them every day so I could see their smiling faces. How foolish of me to try to kill myself and leave them behind! Jason\u2019s partners were handling the firm, and as for my business, the same executives who covered for my ass after Brina\u2019s death willingly stepped up to bat once again. I made a mental note to make sure to give them all a raise and extra vacation time with pay, once everything was back to normal. They more than deserved it.</p><p>Jason and I never talked about whatever was lurking in his past again. We decided the best thing would be to wait on the actual therapy sessions. I was just glad he loved me, and I was beginning to understand the reasons why he didn\u2019t just haul off and hit my ass or leave me. Somehow, Jason was able to relate to my illness, and it would all come out in the wash. The chickens always come home to roost.</p><p>Well, the time had finally arrived. Dr. Leonard Graham, our savior dressed in a leisure suit and sporting a toupee, had arrived to mend the situation. Marcella was there in my room, along with Jason and my mother. Dr. Graham could only stay one day, so it was agreed that no matter how many hours it took, everything, and I do meaneverything, was coming out.</p><p>I knew I could handle it. After dealing with all my lovers, Marcella, Jason, and getting hit by a van all in one day, lying in one position on a bed all day was going to be a breeze. I was concerned about Jason, though. He seemed extremely uncomfortable, and I can\u2019t say I blamed him. Most of the conversation would be about my sexual escapades with other people and the reasons behind them. My mother, I didn\u2019t want there at all, but she insisted, and even though I\u2019m an adult, disrespecting her wishes was not an option.</p><p>So there we were, packed into my hospital room. Dr. Ferguson came in and gave me a once-over to make sure I could physically handle whatever stress might arise and one of the nurses brought in some extra chairs, a couple of pots of coffee, and a pitcher of ice water. I felt like a prisoner in the infirmary of a penitentiary about to give a deposition for a Mafia murder case. All we needed was a court stenographer and someone wearing a black jurist robe. The doctors had several memo pads with them, and tape recorders. When I saw the stack of notepads, I wondered who in the hell was going to be saying enough shit to fill them all up.</p> <p>Dr. Graham took the lead. \u201cNow that we\u2019re all gathered together here today, shall we</p><p>begin?\u201d</p><p>I was expecting him to say, \u201cShall we pray?\u201d He reminded me of an evangelist I used to trip off of on a local cable channel who claimed he could heal people. Once the one who was healed had thrown his crutches away or announced he could see again, the minister would quickly pass the collection plates.</p><p>I had Jason sitting on the bed right next to me for moral support. It was more than likely we were both going to need each other to lean on throughout the ordeal. He held my hand, kissed me on the cheek, and attemptedto reassure me. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be okay, Boo. I promise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe!\u201d Dr. Graham blurted out my name, and all of a sudden I felt all eyes on me. \u201cMarcella has filled me in on the majority of your case. I\u2019ve also listened to the audiotapes and read her notes. She and I have had several phone conversations as well. She sent copies of everything to my office in Florida overnight express so I would be all caught up when I arrived.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over at my mother, who looked like she might need a straitjacket before the end of the day. Her hands were trembling and she had terrible bags underneath her eyes, which probably could\u2019ve been attributed to spending many sleepless nights worrying about me. She noticed my stares and managed a slight grin, which I returned.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, there are some things only you can clear up for me, Zoe. As Marcella has probably mentioned, I\u2019m quite experienced in the area of sexual addiction, and if you let me, I can more than likely help you tremendously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate that very much, Dr. Graham.\u201d</p><p>Jason seconded the motion. \u201cWe would both appreciate-it, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re extremely lucky for a lot of different reasons, Zoe. Your suicide attempt failed, your mother loves you, your kids love you, and your husband loves you. I hope you\u2019ll think about them if thoughts of suicide should ever arise again.\u201d</p><p>I cut him off because I wanted them all to know. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen. No matter what, I\u2019m in this for the long run. No more trying to take the cowardly way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, Zoe. That\u2019s real good.\u201d</p><p>Marcella was sitting in the chair beside him, lookinglike a college student trying to keep up with a professor. She was taking notes. I guess she was attempting to gain some worthwhile knowledge about an area she knew nothing about\u2014sexual addiction. That made two of us.</p><p>Dr. Graham took a sip of his black coffee and cleared his throat. \u201cThere\u2019s something that\u2019s been bothering me about this whole thing, Zoe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, even though the whole damn situation was bothering me.</p><p>\u201cYou talked to Dr. Spencer about a lot of things dating-back to childhood, such as sexual feelings and masturbation at a considerably young age.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the blanket covering my legs. I was totally embarrassed. \u201cI realize now that it wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t, but what bothers me iswhyit happened. Do you have any thoughts on that subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, none. Maybe I was just born that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible, Zoe, but I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s the case. I think something occurred in your childhood that started the whole chain of cause and effect.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing; he couldn\u2019t have been further off base. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Something like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething traumatic maybe? Possible something that was sexually related? Something . . .\u201d</p><p>I preempted the rest of his commentary. \u201cUmmm, Dr. Graham, far be it from me to criticize you, but nothing like that ever happened to me. I had a very normal childhood, a childhood I remember extremely well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that, Zoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am positive!The most traumatic thing that ever happened to me when I was young was the death of my father. I was in junior high, and I remember it like it was yesterday.\u201d Jason grasped my hand tighter; he knew talking about my father\u2019s death was very painful for me.</p><p>\u201cHmm, I see. Well, maybe something occurred that you don\u2019t even remember, Zoe. That does happen, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to me, Doc. Nothing happened, and I would most definitely remember if it did!\u201d I was getting mad offended. He was insinuating I was too dumb to recall my own childhood. Plus, I didn\u2019t like what he was implying. I wondered if he was trying to say I was abused by my parents or something of that nature and hoped he wasn\u2019t. I would\u2019ve hated to get up off the hospital bed and give him a beatdown. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Marcella jumped into it. \u201cZoe, are you really sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019mverysure! What the hell is this? What are you two trying to insinuate?\u201d</p><p>Marcella replied, \u201cZoe, to be honest, I was thinking the same thing before Leonard even brought it up. Why do you think you were so obsessed with sex at such a young age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know!\u201d</p> <p>Jason sensed I was about to go off the deep end. \u201cZoe, calm down, Boo. It\u2019s all good, and everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d I clenched my teeth and listened to my husband.</p><p>Dr. Graham took the conversation back over. \u201cZoe, have you ever considered being hypnotized?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I broke out in hysterical laughter. I stopped when I realized no one else found it funny. \u201cNo, never thought about it and would never do something so silly. There\u2019s no point to it, becausenothing happened!\u201d</p><p>My mother started squirming in her seat and then raised her hand as if she needed permission to speak. \u201cMomma, you don\u2019t have to raise your hand. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Everyone\u2019s attention turned toward her. \u201cAre youdoctors saying that everything my baby has done might be attributed to something horrible from her childhood?\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t even let them answer. \u201cMomma, that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying, but it\u2019s all bull. You and I both know nothing ever happened to me as a child that could even halfway be considered sexually traumatic.\u201d</p><p>Marcella got up, went over to my mother, and sat on the wooden armrest of her chair. \u201cWell, is Zoe right? Was her childhood free of such incidents?\u201d</p><p>My mother stared at me and whispered, \u201cNot exactly.\u201d Then her tears began to flow.</p><p>chaptertwenty-eight</p><p>Never in my life had I cursed my mother, but there\u2019s a first time for everything. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about, Momma?\u201d</p><p>She just kept crying, and Marcella was rubbing her back, so I turned toward Jason. \u201cWhat the fuck is she talking about, Jason?\u201d</p> <p>He looked as dumbfounded as I did. \u201cI have no idea, Boo!\u201d</p><p>I wanted somebody,anybody,to make sense out of what I just heard. Confusion turned to terror as all kinds of shit starting running through my mind. Was I molested by my father as a baby? Another relative? \u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Dr. Graham swung into action, realizing he was about to lose control of the situation before anything could be resolved. He came over to the opposite side of the bed from where Jason was lying and patted me on my shoulder.\u201cCalm down, Zoe. Just calm down, take a few deep breaths, and relax. It\u2019s all going to be all right.\u201d</p><p>I took my free hand and knocked his hand off my shoulder. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to be all right, because I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on! This shit isn\u2019t making any sense! How the hell could something have happened to me, and I don\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 remember it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, maybe if you let me hypnotize you, we can all find out the answers.\u201d</p><p>I turned back to Jason, who looked more lost than I was. \u201cJason, I\u2019m scared.\u201d He released my hand, put his arm around me, and held me tight.</p><p>Marcella was bent over my mother\u2019s chair, whispering in her ear, and I didn\u2019t appreciate the hush-hush going on over there at all. Enough of the secrets and lies! \u201cMomma?\u201d</p><p>Silence befell the room, and I could hear Marcella whisper the words, \u201cTell her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Momma, tell me!\u201d Half of me wanted to know, and the other half wanted to crawl up in a hole somewhere with a pair of earplugs so I wouldn\u2019t find out a damn thing. Whatever it was had my mother crying, and it was obvious I wasn\u2019t going to like it.</p><p>She got up from her chair and came over to the bed. I reached out for her hand. She sat down on the edge of the bed so her hips were touching mine.</p><p>\u201cZoe, something did happen when you were younger. I don\u2019t know all of the details because you never really told me. Not me or your daddy. All I know is it happened.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed my hand rapidly like a mother trying to warm her toddler up outside in the dead cold of winter. \u201cAll what details, Momma? I\u2019m so lost! So completely lost!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, darling. Something happened, and somehow you managed to bury it deep inside you. It was the reason we really moved to Atlanta from Dallas in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMomma, you aren\u2019t making any sense.\u201d I kept looking-from her to Jason and back, wishing someone would throw me a</p><p>life jacket because I was sinking fast.</p><p>\u201cYou remember how we moved in the middle of the year and you were a transfer student and all of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course I remember. Daddy got a job in Atlanta, and we had to move right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, your father accepted the job because weneededto move right away. Weneededto get out of Dallas.\u201d She broke out into wails, but I couldn\u2019t cry. I was petrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to me in Dallas, Momma?\u201d I sat up further on the bed, let go of her hand, and started shaking her. Not because I was angry with her, but because I wanted her to tell me the freakin\u2019 truth. \u201cMomma, look at me. What happened to me in Dallas?\u201d</p><p>Jason and the two doctors weren\u2019t saying a word. Then again, I guess there wasn\u2019t anything for them to say. They were just as confused as I was. \u201cZoe, baby, I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I let go of her shoulders and clasped her hand. I started rubbing her hand like she was the toddler. \u201cGo on, Momma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, about a month into your fifth-grade year, you came running in the house crying, and your clothes were torn.\u201d My eyes bulged out of my head, and Jason put his arms around my waist to try to brace me for whatever was about to come. \u201cYou were late coming home from school, and I was worried. I called your father at work, but he told me to calm down. He figured sinceyou walked home from school everyday, you probably just stopped over a friend\u2019s house for a little while, lost track of time, and forgot to call.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t remember any of the things she was talking about, and that made me ten times more scared than I was before. \u201cWhat happened to me on my way home from school, Momma?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed both of my cheeks in her frail hands and pulled my face all the way up to hers until our noses were touching. Her tears were rolling down both of our cheeks, not just her own. \u201cI don\u2019t know, baby! You would never tell me. You would never tell your daddy or anyone else. All I know is I felt so bad that I didn\u2019t call the police or try to look for you, even if you were only an hour late. I should\u2019ve realized you wouldn\u2019t go someplace and not call. I should\u2019ve realized something was wrong, and I\u2019ve lived with this guilt ever since.\u201d</p><p>I threw my arms around her, almost yanking the IV needle clear out of my arm to do it. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Momma. It\u2019s not your fault!\u201d</p><p>Jason gathered both of us in his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>My tears started flowing, and I wasn\u2019t sure they would ever stop. Never had I been so utterly confused. I thought the whole situation with Quinton, Tyson, and Diamond was fucked up. Now, I come to find out something happened to me when I was just a child that was the underlying cause of it all. \u201cI had to have told you something. What did I say?\u201d</p><p>She started shaking her head, and Marcella came over with a tissue for her to blow her nose out. Once she completed the task and wiped some of the tears from her face, she replied to my question. \u201cZoe, the only thing you ever said to us was, \u2018Why did they hurt me?\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did who hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI DON\u2019T KNOW!\u201dShe was screaming, and Dr. Ferguson bumrushed into the room to make sure everything was under control. Dr. Graham politely showed him to the door and assured him things were fine. He reluctantly departed.</p><p>\u201cYou came home crying with your clothes ripped, and I called your father back immediately, telling him to get off work and come home. You kept saying, \u2018Why did they hurt me?\u2019 over and over again, but you wouldn\u2019t say anything else. It was like you were in a trance or something. My immediate thought was that you\u2019d been raped, but you wouldn\u2019t even let me touch you down there. Every time I tried, you pushed my hands away violently, so we took you to the emergency room. They had to strap you down to examine you. You put up one hell of a fight, kicking and screaming and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? Was I raped?\u201d I clamped my eyes shut and waited for her to reply, hoping the answer would be one I could live with. Jason was crying too by that point, but they were silent tears. No noise was coming out with them.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the doctors, you werenotraped. They did say you were bruised down there and red. No penetration though. They were very definite about that point.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Graham jumped in and asked, \u201cSo Zoe was the victim of some type of sexual trauma other than rape?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, Doctor, she was.\u201d For the next few minutes, my mother and I were tightly intertwined in a bear hug, consumed in wails. All of those years, she\u2019d blamed herself for something beyond her control. \u201cDoctor, I wish I could be of more help, but after a couple of weeks, Zoe started acting real strange. She acted like nothing even happened,and when my husband and I broached the subject, she gave us the impression she didn\u2019t remember. He and I decided the best thing was to just move away and leave it all behind\u2014especially since we never discovered who harmed her. In our eyes, that meant they could do it again. We didn\u2019t trust anyone after that. Everyone was suspect.\u201d</p><p>Jason, who loves my mother almost as much as he loves me and wanted to comfort her, told her, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Zoe\u2019s going to get through this. We\u2019re all going to get through this together.\u201d</p><p>My mother glanced up at Jason. \u201cShe almost lost you because of this. She almost lost everything. My baby even tried to kill herself, and all these years I thought she was faking about not remembering. I thought she pretended not to know just so she wouldn\u2019t have to talk about it. When she fell in love with you, I was so happy, because I was scared she would never lead a normal life and find someone who truly loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do love Zoe. You know that more than anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do know that, and I\u2019m so very grateful that she has you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>I was totally unnerved. \u201cFor the life of me, I don\u2019t remember any of this.\u201d</p><p>Marcella walked closer to the bed, looking wearier than I had ever seen her. I guess we were all emotionally drained. \u201cThere is a way you can bring it all back, Zoe. There is a way to find out what really happened to you that day. Let Leonard hypnotize you. We\u2019ll all be here for you, and when you wake up, this entire nightmare will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be over, or will it be worse?\u201d I pondered out loud.</p><p>\u201cLet him do it, Zoe.\u201d My mother made her request. \u201cIwish I could fill in all the missing pieces, but I can\u2019t. You have to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, I looked at Jason to get his opinion. He kissed me on the forehead and then whispered in my ear, \u201cI love you, and this is forever.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Graham was standing at the end of the bed, waiting for my decision. \u201cWell, Doc, I guess if I ever want this to end, I have no choice. So, bring it on.\u201d</p><p>It all happened so quickly. I remember his pocket watch swinging back and forth in his hand like a pendulum, and I remember him softly speaking some words to me. He didn\u2019t say the comical shit I was expecting like, \u201cYou\u2019re getting very, very sleepy!\u201d</p><p>Whatever he did say worked like a charm, because the next thing I knew, I was ass out.</p><p>chaptertwenty-nine</p><p>I have no idea how long I was in a hypnotic trance, but after I woke up and took a quick survey of everyone\u2019s face, I wanted to be put the hell back out. Dr. Graham looked as if he had just been on the receiving end of an enema. Marcella looked as if she\u2019d just found out she had fibroids the size of grapefruits. My mother looked like hell froze the fuck over, and poor Jason looked like someone had just chopped his dick clear off. All of them had their mouths hanging wide open, and if a bumblebee had been in the room, it could\u2019ve stung each and every one of them on the tongue before they even saw it coming.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t decide which one of them to ask, so I directed it to the love of my life. \u201cJason, is it that bad?\u201d</p><p>He broke out of his own hypnotic trance, pressed his thumb under my chin, and gave me a kiss on the lips. \u201cIt\u2019s bad, Zoe, but nothing we can\u2019t fix together.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t say another word. You could have heard a pindrop until Dr. Graham broke the silence in the room. \u201cUmm, Zoe, the reason we\u2019re all shocked is, as it turns out, there wasn\u2019t just one incident in your past that came out during hypnosis. There were two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo? What the hell?\u201dI looked at my mother, but she could be of absolutely no help to me. She was too busy fighting demons of her own, thinking I was perpetrating a fraud all of those years by pretending nothing happened when the entire time to me it never did happen. All of it had been suppressed somewhere in the deep, dark crevices of my mind.</p><p>Marcella finally spoke up. \u201cZoe, the best way to clear all this up is by letting you hear it in your own words.\u201d She pressed the rewind button on her mini cassette recorder and asked, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Jason still had his arm around me, and I laid my head on his chest, hoping I would still have an ounce of sanity left</p><p>after I listened to the tape. \u201cReady!\u201d</p><p>When the tape first began playing, it was about what I expected. Dr. Graham was asking me a bunch of questions about my life, gradually working his way back to my childhood. We got back to when I first moved to Atlanta, across the street from Jason, and of course I mentioned the ass-whupping I gave him, since it was one of my most shining moments.Then he asked me about Dallas, and with the mere mention of the city\u2019s name, my voice on the tape changed to one even I would\u2019ve been hard pressed to recognize if I didn\u2019t already know it was me. As an adult, if you were to tape record yourself and then play it back, you would probably wonder to yourself, \u201cIs that me?\u201d</p> <p>That was the case. It was me\u2014the younger version ofZoe, who had disappeared once puberty set in. I hadn\u2019t heard the voice in almost two decades. My mother and Jason recognized the voice of my youth. I heard my mother on the tape, sounding frantic. \u201cZoe? Doctor, what\u2019s happening? That\u2019s what she sounded like when she was a little girl!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Graham responded, \u201cI\u2019m sure it is, but please calm down. That\u2019s the Zoe we need to talk to.\u201d</p><p>I heard Jason jump in, yelling at the top of his lungs, \u201cDr. Graham, if this is something that\u2019s going to damage my wife in any way, I want this shit to stop right now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, it won\u2019t harm her. It\u2019ll make her better. She has to get the secrets out, or they\u2019ll destroy her, like they almost did this past year.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s voice lowered, but I could hear him breathing heavily, and I could sense the fear. \u201cOkay, Doctor. As long as you understand I don\u2019t want my wife harmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, Jason, and I promise you that won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Everyone fell silent, allowing Dr. Graham to continue. He asked me several questions about my early childhood. I was amazed, listening to the tape, that I even knew the answers to half of them. We all sat there while the little Zoe described her first day at kindergarten and how she won the biggest smile contest in the schoolyard, how most of the other kids had cried when their mothers left them there but not her, and that\u2019s why she won the lollipop. Then, little Zoe talked about how much she liked finger-painting and playing ring-around-the-rosy, she talked about the various dolls she had as a child, including the black Barbie I still have stowed in the attic to give Kayla Michelle once she\u2019s old enough to appreciate it. She talked about how she used to make new dresses for it from old pieces of clothing around thehouse and how she always wanted to be an official member of the Mickey Mouse Club. She talked about the piggyback rides her daddy used to give to her and how he used to sit her on his lap in his recliner and read Dr. Seuss books to her. Little Zoe talked about how much she used to hate carrots and how she would sneakily feed them to her dog, Spot, underneath the dining room table, and how he got ran over by a car when she was in the third grade.</p><p>Then, the first incident came to light. Since the incidents seemed to be running in chronological order from kindergarten on up, it appeared to have happened sometime during my third-grade year\u2014an incident my parents obviously never knew about, one that preceded the incident in the fifth grade that ultimately made my parents relocate to another state.</p><p>I still had my head resting on Jason\u2019s chest. I tried to let his heartbeat comfort me while I listened to the little Zoe on the tape begin to recall the story. \u201cIt was a holiday. I\u2019m not sure which one, but it was one where everyone has cookouts and get-togethers at someone\u2019s house so all the kids can play. Momma and Daddy took me to one of Momma\u2019s friends\u2019 houses from college. Her name was Lisa or Laura or something else with anL.\u201d</p><p>I heard my mother call out, \u201cIt was Laura! Oh my goodness, did Laura do something to her?\u201d</p><p>Marcella said, \u201cShhhhhhh!\u201d</p><p>Little Zoe continued. \u201cAll of the kids were out in the street playing when Momma\u2019s friend came out and told her daughter to walk down the street to get her son from his girlfriend\u2019s house because it was time to eat. She told her daughter to take me with her so I could go for a walk too, since we were about the same age.\u201d</p><p>My mother interrupted again. \u201cLaura did have twokids. A daughter, Monique, who was about a year older than Zoe, and a son who was in his teens.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Graham told my mother to calm down. \u201cThat\u2019s great, but let her finish, and then you can fill in the blank spots, okay? We\u2019ve got to let her tell it in her own way!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen we got down to the other house, there were a bunch of teenagers hanging around outside. When we went indoors to get him, there were people everywhere, and music was playing. I don\u2019t think any adults were home, and they were having a party. The girl I went down there with asked where her brother was, and some boy told her he was upstairs in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe led me by the hand up the stairs. There were a bunch of teenagers in the hallway up there too. One of the doors was open, and everyone was standing around laughing and saying things I knew they shouldn\u2019t be saying because they were allvery badthings. We went into the bedroom, and her brother was on the bed doing all sorts of things with this girl. His girlfriend, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I heard my mother scream out on the tape,\u201cOh, God no!\u201dMarcella asked her if she wanted to leave the room and wait out in the hall, but she refused and got quiet again so I could move on.</p><p>\u201cThey were both naked, and he had his mouth on one of her breastesses.\u201d I sat there, shaking my head at the words I was hearing, but it couldn\u2019t be more realistic. When I was little, I mispronounced several words, andbreastswas one of them. I distinctly remember calling thembreastessesinstead. \u201cHe was on top of her and he had his dang-a-lang inside her coochie-coo. When his sister told him to stop, he wouldn\u2019t. He yelled at us to go away. Everyone started laughing and knocking us around.\u201d</p> <p>I took a deep, restorative breath on the tape. It wasalmost as if I feared what I was about to say next. \u201cI ran out the room and left the little girl there I had come with, but when I got to the bottom of the stairs, there was this boy there, an older boy, and he smelled like liquor. He wouldn\u2019t let me get past him, and he pushed me down on the steps and starting putting his hands all over me. I was so scared.\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s sobs were easily recognizable on the tape, but she didn\u2019t say anything else. \u201cHe put his hand underneath my T-shirt and started squeezing me, and it hurt. He tried to pull my shorts off, but I started kicking and screaming just like Daddy told me to do if someone ever tried to hurt me. All of the other kids were standing there laughing, but then one boy helped me. He pulled the bad boy off me, and then he hit him.</p><p>\u201cThey started fighting right there in the living room, and everyone was yelling and screaming at them. I ran out of the front door and down the street to find Momma and Daddy. I got back down to the house, and when Momma asked me why I was crying, I made up a lie because I didn\u2019t want to tell her the bad thing I had done. I told her the little girl had been mean to me and told me to go back to her house because she didn\u2019t want to play with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>My mother spoke up then, happy she could actually finally be of some help. \u201cIt was Memorial Day! Laura and her husband had a cookout, and she did send them to go get her son because the food was ready. When Zoe came back alone, she was crying, but she didn\u2019t tell me what really happened. I just thought she and the little girl had gotten into a petty spat because neither of them had taken a nap and it was late in the afternoon. The other kids returned to the house about fifteen minutes after Zoe, but no one said anything. They were all acting normalby then, and Zoe and the little girl started playing together again.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Graham reassured Momma that she was tremendously helpful and then told her we were going to move on. \u201cZoe, let\u2019s jump ahead a bit. Do you remember your fifth-grade year? The beginning of the year, when you were still in school in Dallas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do remember it!\u201d My voice instantly changed on the tape. It was still one of my youth, but it was somehow more mature than the previous one. It also seemed more tense and uneasy than its predecessor. \u201cI remember everything, including the day they hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Jason yelled out, \u201cWho hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d Marcella jumped in. \u201cCalm down. I know this is hard on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, this is hard on me! My wife was molested, and you all are sitting around here acting like she\u2019s talking about a ballerina recital or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, we\u2019re all just trying to get to the bottom of this, but we can\u2019t do that if you\u2019re going to overreact throughout the whole process.\u201d As an afterthought, she asked, \u201cDo you want to go out in the hallway? I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019m not going out in the hallway! I\u2019m sitting right here on this bed with my arms around my wife!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Jason, that\u2019s your prerogative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right, it is!\u201d</p><p>My mother asked him to please calm down. Dr. Graham then asked me, \u201cWhat</p><p>happened the day they hurt you, Zoe? What happened on your way home from school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to walk home from school with Dena and Kelly, but I had to stay behind for a few minutes to complete a science worksheet I forgot to do for homework the night before. When Mrs. Thompson finally let meleave, Dena and Kelly were both gone, and so was everybody else. The schoolyard was completely deserted, so I started to walk home alone. I was angry they didn\u2019t wait for me, but I knew they were trying to rush home to seeFat Albert and the Kids,our favorite cartoon. Besides, it wasn\u2019t their fault I forgot about my homework.</p><p>\u201cI got to the walkway at the edge of the playground that led out to the street and noticed there was a group of boys standing at the end of it. The walkway was surrounded by woods, and I was scared to walk down it because one of the boys, Chucky, had teased me earlier that day at school. He said I had big breastesses for a girl my age and asked could he feel them. I told him no.</p><p>\u201cThe only other way for me to get home was to take the long way around, and I knew Momma would be worried if I did that because I was already late. I walked down the wooded path, and when I got closer to them, they all started whispering and laughing. It was Chucky and his younger brother, Steven, and some other boys I\u2019d seen around school, but I didn\u2019t know their names.</p><p>\u201cThey started pushing me back and forth between them and calling me bad names. Suddenly, Chucky and Steven dragged me into the woods. I dropped my bookbag on the walkway and tried to yell out, but one of them, I can\u2019t remember which one, put his hand over my mouth so I couldn\u2019t. They told me they would kill my momma and daddy if I didn\u2019t do what they said.</p> <p>\u201cThey did some really bad things to me. They pulled my panties off from under my skirt and yanked my shirt up over my head so I couldn\u2019t see. Then Chucky pulled his pants down and was rubbing his private part up against mine. It hurt me, and the rocks and branches underneath me hurt. I felt his tongue on my chest, and he bit me on my breastesses, and it was very painful!</p><p>\u201cChucky got angry at me about something. He kept yelling, \u2018I can\u2019t get it in!\u2019 He picked up a stick and started hitting me all over, like it was all my fault. He hit me in my privates, and I started screaming. That\u2019s when I heard a woman\u2019s voice call out, \u2018Who\u2019s over there?\u2019</p><p>\u201cChucky and Steven jumped up off the ground and ran away. So did the other boys. Somehow, I managed to stand up. I was crying and covered with their sweat and spit. I pulled my shirt down and put my panties back on. I had cuts and bruises all over my body. Then, this lady came running into the woods. I\u2019d never seen her before. She asked me was I all right. I just cried and ran away. I found my bookbag and ran home to Momma, but I couldn\u2019t tell her what happened. I thought it was my fault. After all, I had done a bad thing by not doing my homework.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence and then I started screaming, \u201cWhy did they hurt me? Why did they hurt me, Momma? Why did they hurt me?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Dr. Graham clapped and woke me up out of the trance, only to see them all sitting around with their mouths hung open. After I heard the tape, my mouth was the one hanging open and waiting for the imaginary bee to strike.</p><p>\u201cDr. Graham, I don\u2019t remember any of that! None of it whatsoever! Was it real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Zoe, it was very real. That was you\u2014well, the younger version of you\u2014relating the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was right, but I still didn\u2019t want to face the facts. I just laid my head back on Jason\u2019s chest and wished none of it was happening. Marcella was full of energy and appeared to have gotten a second wind from somewhere. \u201cThis is a great start, Zoe! At least now we know what the underlying reasons are for your behavior and attitude toward sex!\u201d</p><p>I looked at her in amazement. \u201cHave you lost your fuckin\u2019 mind? What does any of that have to do with me cheating on Jason?\u201d</p><p>I felt bad as soon as the words left my lips. It was bad enough everyone in the room knew I cheated on him without me making public announcements. \u201cIt has everything to do with it. Dr. Graham and I will explain it all to you a little later. But first\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst what?\u201d I noticed her eyes were not on me. They were directed toward Jason.</p><p>\u201cJason, listening to Zoe throughout our therapy sessions and hearing about your apparent fear of sexual openness has caused me a great deal of concern. Dr.Graham and I discussed it, and he tends to agree with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dr. Graham was standing there, nodding his assent. Marcella continued, \u201cDo you think if we hypnotized you, we might be able to figure out why that is?\u201d</p><p>Jason gasped, and I sat up to stare him in the eyes. He looked back at me with his beautiful hazel eyes before he whispered, \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary, Marcella. I already know why.\u201d</p><p>chapterthirty</p><p>\u201cCould you all please leave Zoe and me alone for a few minutes?\u201d Jason was on the edge, and I was falling over the cliff with him. I wasn\u2019t sure I could handle everything in one day after all. I would\u2019ve preferred another day of everyone kicking my ass and getting hit by a delivery van.</p> <p>\u201cJason\u2014\u201d Marcella looked almost as worried as I did. \u201cIt would really be better if this all came out with Dr. Graham and I present.\u201d</p><p>Jason snapped back,\u201cNO!I need to talk to Zoe alone. At least at first, and then you can all come back in here. Once she knows everything, I don\u2019t give a damn who finds out!\u201d</p><p>I convinced them to go get something to eat, since lunchtime had rolled around. If Jason didn\u2019t want them there, that\u2019s the way it was going to be. They all filed out of the room, headed to see what nasty yet nutritional food the hospital cafeteria was dishing up that day. My mother,being her typical indulgent self, asked Jason and I if we wanted her to bring us something to eat, but we refused. The last thing either one of us needed was heartburn or a gas attack on top of everything else.</p><p>Jason and I were left in the room alone. I wasn\u2019t about to pressure him or rush him to tell me, so I ran my fingers through his hair and waited. \u201cZoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me say straight up this has nothing to do with cheating. I already told you I would never do that to you, and I haven\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t, baby. I believe you.\u201d I gave him a kiss on his forehead and then raised his hand up to my lips so I could kiss it too. Then I asked him what I\u2019m sure was on everyone\u2019s mind. \u201cWere you sexually abused when we were kids, Jason?\u201d</p><p>He jumped up off the hospital bad. \u201cNo, hell no! I was never sexually abused or molested!\u201d</p><p>I turned on my side to face him while he stood by the window, looking out. \u201cThen what is it, baby? You know you can tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, I don\u2019t know how to say this, so I\u2019m just going to come on out with it full force. Willard and Lorraine Reynard are not my real parents.\u201d</p><p>He kept looking at the window, at nothing in particular.-I started feenin\u2019 for some Prozac or something. \u201cUmmm, Jason, what do you mean, they\u2019re not your real parents?\u201d</p> <p>He glanced at me and then walked back over to the bed. He didn\u2019t lie back down beside me, but pulled up one of the chairs and sat down in it. \u201cI should\u2019ve told you all this a long time ago. You had a right to know. After all, you\u2019re my wife, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a right to know?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a long story short. I was adopted when I was six. Before then, I lived in an orphanage and was a ward of the state.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t talk, so I just reached for his hand and held it tight. \u201cMy mother, the real one, was a prostitute. I remember her clearly. She left me on the stoop of the orphanage when I was only four, telling me she couldn\u2019t take care of me anymore and had to go away.\u201d</p><p>He started crying. I reached over on the metal table beside the bed and retrieved one of the rough, generic-brand tissues the hospital provided. I dried his tears for him. \u201cDid something happen to you in the orphanage, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Zoe! Actually, the nuns at the orphanage were very nice. That\u2019s why I believe in Catholicism, even though we don\u2019t attend church that often.\u201d I made a mental note to myself to start taking my kids to church\u2014 we all needed some religion. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert on orphanages, but I\u2019ve heard horrible stories about some of them. The one I lived in was nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I believe you. Did the Reynards do something to you?\u201d I was sitting there calling my in-laws the Reynards like they were strangers instead of my husband\u2019s parents. Every thing was getting weirder by the minute. \u201cDid they hurt you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Of course, there were times when they would get angry at me and throw it up in my face. Telling me I should be thankful they even took me in when they could\u2019ve just left me there. They didn\u2019t really mean any of those things, though. It was all said out of anger and frustration.\u201d</p> <p>v style=\"text-align:center; padding: 15px 0;\"&gt; </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason sat up, acting offended I would even make such a suggestion. \u201cZoe, I\u2019m not leaving. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. You\u2019re going to go home, kiss our kids goodnight for me, and take instant photos of them for me to add to my collection tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your mother can handle the kids. Plus, the sitter is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the point.\u201d Jason was tired and stressed, and I didn\u2019t want him spending the night in the hospital with me. I knew the kids stood a better chance of cheering him up, and I really needed some time alone to sort through all the secrets revealed from my own past, as well as his.</p> <p>\u201cDo it for me, Boo. Please!\u201d</p><p>After throwing a bit of a temper tantrum, he finally agreed to leave with my mother, making me promise to take my ass straight to sleep. I assured him that wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.</p><p>Sure enough, I fell into a deep sleep and would\u2019ve slept most of the evening if I didn\u2019t sense someone standing over me. I woke up, and when I opened my eyes, Diamond was hovering over me, gripping a pillow in both hands.I was taken completely aback. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She sat the pillow down on the end of the bed by my feet. \u201cYou were sleeping so peacefully. I was just going to put another pillow underneath your head because you looked like your neck was twisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I rubbed my eyes. I still wasn\u2019t fully awake, and they were sore from all of the crying. \u201cDiamond, what are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>She plopped down in one of the chairs. \u201cI called your office and told your secretary I was an old college buddy of yours. After a little prodding, she told me about the accident and where I could find you.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes; I couldn\u2019t believe Shane would be stupid enough to give out information like that. Not to mention that I never went to college. Her doofus behind should\u2019ve known better. \u201cWell, what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check on you and make sure you\u2019re all right. What else? By the way, I didn\u2019t tell Quinton you were in the hospital. He would\u2019ve asked me a bunch of questions about how I knew so much. I figured you wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d She sucked her teeth, taking advantage of the fact she had something to throw up in my face at will. Even though Jason knew I had experimented witha female, I would\u2019ve been totally ashamed if Quinton ever found out about Diamond. She damn well knew it too.</p><p>\u201cYou figured right!\u201d She was irritating me, and it was beginning to show in my voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being so nasty with me?\u201d She was about to go into a bitch mode. It was a scene I wasn\u2019t even trying to have.</p><p>\u201cNo reason. Sorry if I snapped at you.\u201d I wasn\u2019t sorry. I just wanted her to hurry up and leave.</p> <p>\u201cI came here to see you, out of the goodness of my heart, and this is the shit I get?\u201d</p><p>She went there! \u201cLook, I never asked you to come see me. I never asked you for jack shit, and I would appreciate it if you would get the hell out so I can get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t saying that shit when I was sucking on your pussy!\u201d She smirked, realizing that statement would piss me off.</p><p>\u201cI never asked you to do that either! You insisted, and it\u2019s not like I returned the favor!\u201d</p><p>She got up from the chair, fired up. \u201cYou\u2019re right! I did insist, as you put it, but the bottom line is you let me do it, and you would probably let me do it again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, trick! I let you do it because, at the time, I didn\u2019t give a shit who was sucking on this pussy as long as it was getting sucked! I don\u2019t want you! I\u2019m not attracted to you! I don\u2019t even fuckin\u2019 like you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooooh, that really hurts,\u201d I chided. \u201cBitch is my middle name. Haven\u2019t you heard? I\u2019ve been called that so many times lately, having your little scrawny ass call me that doesn\u2019t even faze me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, everyone can\u2019t be wrong! Maybe you should try to figure out why you\u2019re getting called out of your name, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should drop dead! You\u2019re a waste of fuckin\u2019 oxygen anyway!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve\u2014\u201d Diamond looked away from me and started eyeing the pillow at the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve what?\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything, and I was looking around the room for something to clock her with. I picked up the hard metal telephone and flung it at her. She managed to duck, but not before it caught her in the shoulder</p><p>blade. She yelped out in pain.</p><p>The nurse came flying into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in here? Mrs. Reynard, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, but could you call hospital security and tell them to get this skank ho out of my room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, bitch! I\u2019m leaving!\u201d She headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cGood! Don\u2019t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out!\u201d</p><p>Diamond left, and the nurse was standing there, looking-silly. \u201cUmm, could you hand the phone back over here, please?\u201d</p><p>She picked it up, handed it to me, and uttered, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She was still standing there and didn\u2019t look like she had any immediate plans to vacate. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to get some rest now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just let us know if you need anything.\u201d She forced a smile and then made a quick exit, probably hoping the crazed bitch in Room 301 would hurry up and get her release papers.</p><p>Before I drifted back to sleep, I looked at the crumpled pillow at the foot of the bed and wondered if Diamond was really demented enough to try to smother me. In my mind echoed the word, \u201cNaw!\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As promised, Dr. Graham and Marcella got down to business. For the next few days they counseled Jason and I together and apart. They made us read several books. I thought I was back in high school for a minute\u2014 homework assignments and shit\u2014but it was all worth it.Jason and I spent hours on end talking about everything that had happened throughout our years together\u2014 what went right and what went wrong, where we wanted our marriage to go in the future.</p><p>Jason learned to deal with his mother\u2019s prostitution and the things he witnessed and was subjected to at such a young, vulnerable age. Marcella made us do touching experiments, which made Jason understand that there was nothing nasty or vulgar about having oral sex with his own wife. He confessed that he had always wanted to try it but could never bring himself to let me. As it turns out, while I was hiding sex toys all over the house, Jason was hiding porn flicks that he watched on a regular basis when no one was around. He said he mostly watched them on the TV/VCR combination in his drawing room, and a lot of times when I thought he was down there sweating over blueprints, he was watching the movies and jacking off. I was stunned\u2014I couldn\u2019t even picture Jason jacking off. I wondered was he better at masturbating than me because lawd knows, I thought I was a pro.</p><p>His main fear about letting go sexually was allowing me to take control of the situation. We talked it over, and I promised him I would never do anything to make him feel uncomfortable. We could do it at his own pace, gradually adding new things and positions as time went on.</p><p>As for me, that was another story altogether. Dr. Graham requested I make arrangements to come down to his clinic in Florida for a couple of weeks. I told him I would, but not right away. I had been away from my home andmy kids for too long. Being back there was the best therapy for me at the time. Marcella agreed to work with me three times a week. I told them that just knowing what happened to me when I was younger had helped me tremendously. All along, I never understood why I became so obsessed with sex at a young age. I felt I could put those incidents behind me and move on. As long as I had Jason, I could move mountains.</p><p>Jason and I wouldn\u2019t be able to recover from everything overnight, because it didn\u2019t happen overnight. We made a pact that whatever it took and no matter how long it took, we were both in it to win. Everyone seemed satisfied with the results of the first three days of therapy, and Dr. Graham headed back to Florida, making sure Jason and I had both his home and office telephone numbers.</p><p>That night, I called Dr. Ferguson at home. I looked his digits up in the phone book and told him if he didn\u2019t let my ass out the hospital the next day, I would become the patient from hell, screaming all day and all night disrupting the other patients. He laughed, even though I don\u2019t think he found my intrusion into his quality time at home humorous, and agreed to release me the next day.</p><p>chapterthirty-two</p><p>The next afternoon Dr. Ferguson finally released me with a clean bill of health. I was so excited about going back home, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do first when I got there. Well, second, because kissing and hugging the hell out of my kids was definitely the first thing on my agenda. Taking a long, hot bubble bath and raiding the fridge for some decent food were tied for second place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason arrived at exactly two to pick me up. While they wheeled me down to the nurses\u2019 station to get my release papers, I got suspicious about why Jason was smiling so damn much, so I asked him why.</p><p>He laughed and told me, \u201cNo reason! Just happy my Boo is coming home. Things haven\u2019t been the same without you.\u201d</p><p>I lifted one of my feet up off the slat on the wheelchair and kicked him lightly in the shin. \u201cThings better not be the same. I\u2019m not easily replaceable, you know?\u201d</p><p>He knelt down and kissed me. \u201cYou could never be replaced.\u201d</p> <p>Once we were in the car headed home, we talked about what the children did and did not know about the recent turn of events. The twins were too young to understand anything more than the mere fact I had been away for a couple of weeks. Peter, on the other hand, was another matter altogether. Jason comforted me and assured me Peter didn\u2019t know anything except I had been involved in some sort of automobile accident and had to stay in the hospital until I got better.</p><p>I was relieved. Jason held my hand the rest of the way home, telling me all the wonderful things he had planned out for our future, including buying some land up in the mountains, designing and building us a summer home. That brought a smile to my face; a summer home had always been a big dream of mine. It wasn\u2019t that we couldn\u2019t afford it. It was just the lack of free time that had held us back. Jason told me he was willing to talk to his partners and make the time to do it if I was willing to do the same. I quickly replied, \u201cNot a problem, Boo. Now\u2019s the time to do everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of. Life is too short not to.\u201d</p><p>When we walked in the front door, I was taken aback when I saw the Welcome Home banner, flowers, and balloons everywhere. Momma was standing there in the middle of the great room and had all three kids dressed alike in stonewashed jeans and red T-shirts. Kayla had an abundance of red ribbons in her hair. She reminded me of a picture of me when I was a little girl in a similar outfit.</p><p>Peter was kneeling on the floor, and he had his arms around a Dalmatian puppy with a huge red ribbon attached to his flea collar. \u201cMommy, this is Spot! Daddy bought him for you!\u201d</p><p>I rushed over and hugged all my kids and even thedog. Jason had gone out and found me a dog just like the one that I used to feed my vegetables to under the dining room table as a child, who had been hit by a car. He obviously had a little help from my mother: the puppy was the spitting image of the original Spot and could\u2019ve passed for his grandchild.</p> <p>Peter helped Jason fire up the gas grill on the patio while I played some board games with the twins. They showed me some of the new toys their grandmother had gotten them while I was away. My mother loved to spoil her grandkids and went overboard in my absence, knowing I couldn\u2019t object.</p><p>The phone rang. I yelled out to Jason, \u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d I picked up the cordless and said, \u201cHello.\u201d There was no answer, but I could hear someone breathing heavily on the other end. \u201cHello? Who\u2019s there?\u201d Still nothing but the breathing, and then the line went dead.</p><p>Jason came into the house to retrieve the steaks and chicken breasts for the grill. \u201cWho was it, baby?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders and whispered, \u201cWrong number, I guess.\u201d</p><p>We had a lovely picnic on the screened-in porch. Afterward, my mother went home to spend some time with her husband, who I\u2019m sure felt mad neglected by that time. Jason decided to keep the live-in sitter a while longer. He had given her two weeks\u2019 notice, figuring that would be enough time for me to get readjusted to family life.</p><p>The sitter\u2019s name was Angelique, and she was a college student, working on her undergraduate degree in business administration. She lived in a dorm on campus but took on the live-in position eagerly when she saw the ad on the bulletin board in the student union. She was a sweet girl and talked me half to death when she showedup at the house after her afternoon classes. She told me all about growing up in Maryland and how she chose to go to college in Atlanta because she wanted a change of pace and a break from her overbearing parents.</p> <p>At about seven, I asked Angelique to start getting the kids ready for bed. I went up to the master bathroom to drown myself in a hot bath, since that was the only thing left to do after hugging my kids and feeding my face with some real food.</p><p>Jason joined me a few minutes later, locking the bedroom door and putting on some jazz before stripping down and getting in the tub. Something about the way he held me confirmed what I had hoped. The therapy sessions were working, and things would be way different.</p><p>He got behind me in the tub and kissed my ears and neck while he took a loofah sponge and</p><p>squeezed warm water all over my shoulders and breasts. He put the sponge down and grabbed them, one in each hand, rubbing his thumbs over my erect nipples.</p><p>I turned to the side so that I was sitting on his thigh in the tub, instead of between his legs, and we started tongue-kissing. He grabbed me by the back of the neck and pulled my mouth closer into his so that his tongue could go deeper into my mouth. I broke the kiss just long enough to turn completely around and straddle my legs over his thighs. I locked my arms around his neck, and our kissing continued for several moments.</p><p>Jason caressed my ass cheeks, one in each hand, and I started to grind my pussy onto his dick in the warm water, letting the shaft of it rub between my thighs. He let go of one of my ass cheeks and cupped one of my breasts in his hand, bringing it up to his mouth and sucking on my nipple. I reached into the water and held his dick steady so I could climb on top of it. I sat down on itslowly. My ribs were still a bit sore from the accident, but there was no way I was missing out on the opportunity toreallymake love to Jason. I had wanted to for so long, he was finally receptive to my advances, and I was in heaven.</p><p>Jason let me ride his dick. For the first time, he let me be in the position of control\u2014the one thing he had feared all those years\u2014and from what I could tell and the sweet things he whispered to me, he loved every minute of it. We stayed in the tub until the water was almost freezing, and then he got out to get some towels. We dried each other off, and he carried me to our bed, where we made love again\u2014another first. In all our years together, Jason had never been with me intimately more than once a night. He was no longer a two-minute brother either. In fact, he made love to me longer and harder than anyone. He surprised the hell out of me when he told me to turn over and then entered me from behind. I came all over the place, and he came all up in me.</p><p>I chided him, \u201cDamn, Jason! I hope you didn\u2019t get me pregnant!\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about it if I did. I still have the umpire mask in the garage.\u201d</p><p>We were about to drift off to sleep, with smiles on both of our faces, when the phone rang. I glanced over at the clock and realized it was well after midnight. I reached for the phone, since it was on my side of the bed. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. \u201cHello!\u201d</p><p>All I got back in reply was a single word. The caller\u2019s voice was being distorted by a rag or something held over the phone. The single word was \u201cBitch!\u201d</p><p>They hung up, and so did I. Jason sat up in the bed, \u201cWho was that calling here so late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, baby. Let\u2019s just get some sleep.\u201d He lay back down, and I sought comfort by laying my head on his chest and listening to his heartbeat like I always did when I was scared. I had trouble falling asleep, wondering who the hell it could\u2019ve been and if it was the same person who\u2019d called earlier, breathing heavily on the phone. I came to the conclusion it could have only been one of two people; Dempsey or Tyson. Both of their whereabouts were still a mystery. I made a mental note to myself to make a stop on my way home from work the next day. I would go buy me a freakin\u2019 gun.</p><p>As planned, I returned to work the very next day after my release from the hospital. It was very important for me to try to pick up all of the pieces of my life and move on. The last thing Marcella told me before my release was, \u201cAlways remember the past is a guiding post and not a hitching post. You must learn from your mistakes and keep on going.\u201dShe was right, and that was exactly what I intended to do. Everyone was very pleasant to me upon my return to the office, and most had the common sense and decency not to pry into my personal life. A couple of the water-cooler gossipmongers tried to get in my business, but I set them straight fast. I brazenly reminded them I was the head of the company; they were employees and needed to remember where their bread and butter came from. After that, they didn\u2019t have a damn thing to say and expeditiously returned to work.</p><p>I called Jason at his office to see if he wanted to have lunch with me. His secretary, Allison, got bitchy with me on the phone. She had been cool with me until she called me a tramp that day, and I wasn\u2019t about to forget that. I wanted her ass gone, and after a few conversations withJason, I was sure she would be, if for no other reason than to make me happy. She was probably one of the women that had been throwing pussy at him all along. The hoochie had to go\u2014no if, ands, or buts. I wasn\u2019t about to be subjected to her attitude every time I called or went by my husband\u2019s firm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was disappointed when Jason told me he couldn\u2019t make lunch due to a business appointment, but I fully understood. He had missed a lot of time at work and needed to play catch-up too. I bought a sub, some chips, and a bottled soda and ended up having lunch on a bench in front of the mural Quinton painted at the MARTA station. I missed Quinton, but not in a sexual way. He had always been kind to me, and I missed his friendship\u2014a friendship we could never have because of the sexual nature of our relationship. His loft was directly across the street. I glanced up at it a few times while I picked at my food. I ended up feeding most of it to the birds that gathered around once they picked up on the scent of the turkey breast and cheese on the freshly baked sub roll.</p><p>When I got up to head back to the office, I almost strayed over to his building, but I caught myself. I didn\u2019t want to run the risk of bumping into Diamond, the anorexic beanpole bitch who had the audacity to come up in my hospital room with all her drama. Besides, even with Diamond out of the mix, I still couldn\u2019t see Quinton. Not then. Not ever again. Quinton had lived through too many people walking out of his life already. Since I knew I couldn\u2019t walk back into it for good, I decided to leave well enough alone. I already realized I would have to make up one last lie once the Civic Center had its grand opening. I couldn\u2019t possibly attend, even though Jason was the head architect. While Jason knew about the affairs, he didn\u2019t know Quinton was one of them, and Iwanted to keep it that way. There was no way I would disrespect Jason like that, letting him find out he had actually had lunch with my lover, and there was no way I could handle it. It was bad enough he had to confront Tyson. He didn\u2019t need an altercation with Quinton. In another lifetime, Quinton and I could have been the best of friends, but not in this one.</p><p>Ironically, I now understood why Quinton\u2019s mother killed herself. It took me trying to do the same thing to comprehend it. When I thought I had lost Jason, my life was over, and I didn\u2019t want to go on. I guess she felt the same way when her husband left her and the kids for a white woman. Luckily, my attempt had failed and I had been given a second chance. I wasn\u2019t about to mess it up. I had a renewed desire and appreciation of life. I also had a new Jason.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, everyone! Have a good evening and see you tomorrow!\u201d I rushed through the outer offices and pressed the button for the elevator to go down to the garage. I was in a hurry, since I was trying to make it to the gun shop about ten blocks away before they closed up for the day.I didn\u2019t tell Jason about being called a bitch on the phone the night before. I was determined not to let anything upset our happy home. I didn\u2019t want to get the police involved either. They were already looking for both Tyson and Dempsey, so there was really nothing more for them to do. On the flip side of the coin, I wasn\u2019t a fucking fool either. I realized getting a gun was not a bad idea, just in case. I would have to take special precautions to make sure it was never left anywhere one of the children could get hold of it.</p> <p>When I got off the elevator, I spotted my Mercedes,twice vandalized but still hanging in there with me, parked in my assigned space at the far end of the row. There was a security guard stationed in the garage twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. I didn\u2019t see him anywhere, but that was no big surprise, since they only had one guard to patrol all three levels.</p><p>I got about halfway to my car when I heard some footsteps echoing from somewhere in the garage; I couldn\u2019t pin down the exact location. I don\u2019t know what made me call out\u2014it was almost rush hour, and it could easily have been another building occupant on their way to their car or the guard. I had a very uneasy feeling, though, so I called out, \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>There was no response, and I suddenly realized I had stopped walking and was just standing there, frozen like a sitting duck. If there was indeed a maniac lurking in the garage, the last thing I needed to be doing was waiting for him to attack. I made a mad rush for my car, searching through my purse for my keys along the way. I had seen fifty million tapes on safety and yet didn\u2019t have my keys out before I entered the garage. I guess it\u2019s true what they say about leading a horse to water but not being able to make it drink.</p><p>I got to my car and still couldn\u2019t find my damn keys underneath all the other junk in my bag. I sat my briefcase down on the ground and put my purse up on the roof of the car so I could go through it at eye level. I finally found them and unlocked the door, flinging my purse onto the leather passenger seat. I turned around to get my briefcase, which was behind me on the ground, and came face to face with Dempsey.</p><p>\u201cYou looking for this, bitch?\u201d He had my</p> <p>briefcase in his hands. Before my reflexes could spring into action, he hit me square in the face with it, knocking me backagainst the open driver\u2019s-side door. The door caught me in the ribs, and I bent over in pain. He threw the briefcase on the ground. \u201cNow, what you got to say, bitch? Where\u2019s your fucking switchblade this time?\u201d</p><p>He hit me across the face with his fist, and I could see my blood splatter on my light gray business suit. The left side of my face went numb. I wanted to scream, but no sounds would come out. \u201cYou told the fucking police about me, and now your ass is going to pay!\u201d</p><p>Dempsey grabbed me around the neck, and that\u2019s when I decided to fight back. I remembered how Tyson had choked me and knew if I didn\u2019t do something fast, he would cut off my airway and I wouldn\u2019t have a prayer. I pulled every ounce of strength left in me together and kneed him in the groin. He squealed out in pain and let go of my neck so he could hold onto his privates.</p><p>My first instinct was to get in the car and drive off, run over his crazed ass if need be, but then I realized he had knocked the keys out my hand at some point during the struggle. I did a quick search and couldn\u2019t find them; they must have landed somewhere underneath my car or the one parked beside it. Before Dempsey could fully regain his composure, I took his head in both my hands and kneed him in the face while he was still bent over. I had seen that move in dozens of karate flicks, and I must have administered it right because he started yelping like a dog.</p><p>I hauled ass, and my vocal cords finally kicked back in as the polluted city air pumped in and out of my lungs. I had lost one shoe already and paused long enough to pull the other leather pump off. I ran uphill, to the next level of the garage, which was also the entry level, hoping to locate the guard in his booth. I could hear Dempsey yelling out behind me, but if he was running, he didn\u2019tseem to be closing in on me and I was sure as shit happy about that. I reached the guard booth, screaming, \u201cHelp me!\u201d</p><p>To my dismay, it was empty. I turned around, getting ready to keep hauling ass out onto the busy street to seek help from one of the many strangers on the sidewalk. Instead, I ran straight into the guard, who was coming out the small, and probably filthy, bathroom hidden behind a steel door marked for employees only. He was zipping up his fly when I started screaming at him to call the police. He radioed for help right away, but by the time the police arrived and cornered off the building and garage, Dempsey was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>chapterthirty-three</p><p>By the time Jason arrived, my nerves were completely shot. I couldn\u2019t believe, after all the other shit I had been through, I now had to deal with Dempsey stalking my ass. I began to wonder if the madness would ever end. The homicide detectives assigned to Brina\u2019s murder case were called to the scene, and I finally learned their names\u2014Wilson and Reed. They told me their names and gave me their cards the night of the murder, of course, but I was too out of it and upset to even care.</p><p>I told them about the two phone calls from the previous day. Jason looked at me with stunned disbelief that I had yet again not been completely truthful. I explained to him that I didn\u2019t want to ruin my first day back from the hospital and my first night with him since we started therapy, and told him I was on the way to the gun shop when the attack happened. He didn\u2019t appear satisfied with my explanation but didn\u2019t sweat the issue. He was just glad I was alive.</p><p>They already had an all-points bulletin out on Dempsey, so there wasn\u2019t much more they could do except offer me around-the-clock protection. After two near-death experiences from strangulation, once by Tyson and now by Dempsey, I gratefully accepted. My lips were swollen, and so was one of my eyes from the hits I took from the briefcase and Dempsey\u2019s fist. I absolutely refused to go to the hospital\u2014I had just got out of that bitch, and there was no way I was going back. They handed me some pain medication, gave my ribs the onceover, and told Jason he could take me home as long as I promised to get plenty of rest and not overexert myself.</p><p>That night I told Jason about Tyson\u2019s attempt on my life. He said the doctors at the hospital asked him about some marks on my neck, but he assumed they were somehow from the accident. We mutually decided to stop talking about negative things. Two police officers were stationed out front in a patrol car, and the alarm system was on, so I felt perfectly safe.</p><p>I wanted to make love again more than anything in the world, but Jason was quick to inform me, \u201cThat would be considered overexerting yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was hoping he wasn\u2019t retreating back into his shell after the hellified night of sex we had the night before. I wasn\u2019t about to let that shit happen, beaten up and bruised or not. He didn\u2019t keep me guessing long. \u201cMaking love woulddefinitelybe too physically straining. However, there is something I can do to you that wouldn\u2019t fall into that category. Yet it would bring about the same end result.\u201d</p><p>I started laughing, and it made my ribs hurt for a moment. \u201cJason, what the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmm, I can show you better than I can tell you.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what he did. My previously shy, sexually repressed husband got up from the bed to lock thedoor, even though the kids had been asleep for hours, and then wasted no time getting my black lace panties off.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said we can\u2019t have sex, Boo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to have sex. At least, not sexual intercourse.\u201d He started grinning, and I was still lost as a virgin in a whorehouse.</p><p>That is, until he spread my legs open and started sucking on my pussy. I was likely to faint. Jason was eating my pussy, and I couldn\u2019t hold in my surprise. \u201cJason, you\u2019re eating my pussy!\u201d</p><p>He paused long enough to say, \u201cUh-huh, yes I am eating-your pussy, and it\u2019s good too!\u201d</p><p>He started eating me with more and more intensity. I think the mere thought of him going down on me made me cum the first two or three times, but it didn\u2019t stop there. My baby ate me like I was an all-you-caneatbuffet, and I had orgasm on top of orgasm. He must have been trying to make up for lost time. At one point, I had to grab a hold of the headboard just to be able to hang in there with his tongue action.</p><p>I wanted to suck his dick so bad, and he told me it wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if my lips weren\u2019t so damn swollen and sore. I was madder at Dempsey for keeping me from sucking Jason\u2019s dick than trying to kill me. We fell asleep about 1A.M.but a couple of hours later, a noise startled me awake. At first, I thought it might have been Angelique up late studying for some exams or something like that. I decided to play things safe and walked to the window facing the street to make sure the police were still out front. They were.</p> <p>Since I was already up and about, I decided to go downstairs and make a pot of blackberry tea, another one of my favorites I missed while I was in the hospital. I loved to make a pot of tea, take it out on the screened-inporch on the back of the house, and listen to the birds and other animals rustling about. I made my tea and headed outside onto the porch. As soon as I opened the patio door, I smelled something cooking and wondered who the hell would be crazy enough to be grilling at that time of the morning.</p><p>That\u2019s when I noticed the smoke escaping from the air holes of our gas grill.Something was cooking in my own backyard!It was pure stupidity not to go get the cops or call for Jason, but I had to see for myself. Once I unlocked the porch door leading out into the yard itself, I noticed Spot was not on his chain, and his dog house was empty. I ran barefoot over the cobblestone patio and threw the hood of the grill up. Two seconds later, my screams woke up the whole damn neighborhood.</p><p>That shit did it! I told my mother to come get the kids and take them back to her house. I also asked Angelique to stay over at my mother\u2019s to help Momma and Aubrey out. She was a sweetheart and quickly agreed. Besides, I don\u2019t think she was too thrilled about staying at a house where people trespass in the backyard and grill the family pet anyway.Jason and I refused to leave our home, especially not for the likes of Dempsey\u2019s bitch ass. I had one of the police officers escort me to a gun shop, where I purchased a .45-caliber handgun. They couldn\u2019t really take issue with it in light of the fact that the officers positioned out front had done absolutely nothing to prevent what happened to Spot.</p><p>We stayed in the house most of the time for the next few days. Since Jason had a drawing room, keeping up with his work was not that big of a deal. Allison cameover with some papers he needed to sign, and the bitch had the nerve to come up in my house with an attitude. While she was waiting for Jason to come downstairs to the great room, I made it perfectly clear all of the commotion had nothing to do with an affair but with the murder of my best friend. She looked at me, rolled her eyes, and muttered, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>I went the hell off. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t owe you an explanation in the first damn place, so just do your job, let Jason sign the papers, and then get the hell out my house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then! I\u2019ll do that!\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to say another word, but she went there. \u201cOne of these days, he\u2019s going to wise up and get him arealwoman!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBitch, please!\u201d I got loud with her ass. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight! I\u2019ve been with Jason since eighth grade and have known him even longer than that!</p><p>His ass is not going anywhere! Don\u2019t believe me? Just ask him!\u201d</p><p>She never got the opportunity, because he caught the tail end of our conversation and confirmed it. \u201cDefinitely not going anywhere!\u201d</p><p>He got to the bottom of the steps, put his arm around my waist, and gave me a big, juicy kiss. Even with all the things stressing us, we were acting like newlyweds again. \u201cAllison, where are the papers I need to sign?\u201d</p><p>She handed him a manila folder. \u201cRight here.\u201d He took them, signed them, and handed them back to her. About to leave, she muttered, \u201cGood-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more thing, Allison.\u201d She was almost to the door when she turned around to face Jason.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Reynard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever talk to my wife like that again, or you will have to find employment someplace else.\u201d He paused and then decided to drive the knife in deeper. \u201cWithout a recommendationfrom me, at that. Addressing Zoe in such a fashion is not professional, and it won\u2019t be tolerated. You understand?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d She looked like she was about to cry when she went out of the door. I giggled with delight; that\u2019s what the bitch deserved.</p><p>I had my secretary bring all the important papers that couldn\u2019t wait over to the house for me as well. Fortunately, Shane and I had no beef, so her visits were pleasant. If anything, she was too concerned about my health and welfare. I appreciated it and gave her a bonus for working overtime and making the runs back and forth to the house.</p><p>The sex between Jason and I was nothing short of the bomb! The kids were gone, we were there in the house together around the clock, and we made good use of the time alone. Once the swelling went down around my mouth, I wasted no time putting my lips to his dick and going to work. In fact, you might say I got a bit obsessed. Jason had to almost put my ass on a dick-feeding schedule just so he could get any work done.</p><p>However, he loved performing oral sex just as much as I did. He became a littleoverattentive to exploring my pussy with his mouth. It was all good though! We took advantage of every possible moment. We fucked all over the house, like teenagers. We did all the freaky shit we didn\u2019t have the nerve to do when we were younger. We utilized everything from his drafting table and the kitchen countertop to the hearth of the fireplace and the top of the washing machine during the rinse cycle.</p><p>I was lying between Jason\u2019s legs on the couch and sucking his dick while he was watching the late, late news about a week after Dempsey\u2019s attack on my life when the top news report caught my attention. I heard the newscastermention a shoot-out at a nightclub called the Zoo and stopped sucking Jason\u2019s dick so I could pay attention to the rest of the story. Apparently a scuffle had broken out over a woman, and a gun battle had ensued. \u201cJason, that\u2019s the club where Brina met Dempsey!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>He whispered, \u201cReally?\u201d and tried to maneuver my head back down toward his dick so I could finish what I started. Shootings were so common that one at a club didn\u2019t impress him much.</p><p>I went back to sucking his dick and caught a rhythm, but I was still listening to the news. The reporter that was covering the scene live informed us that the police had confirmed three dead and seven injured. I thought to myself that one of the dead might be Dempsey, but decided I couldn\u2019t be that lucky; he wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to go back there after I specifically told the police he hung out there.</p><p>Jason had just cum in my mouth when the phone rang. He answered and kept saying, \u201cYes!\u201d over and over again. I looked up at him, with his juices still trickling down my chin and tried to judge what the call might be about from the expression on his face.</p><p>He replaced the phone back on the cradle. \u201cThat was Detective Wilson.\u201d I closed my eyes and prayed Jason was about to say what he ultimately did. \u201cIt\u2019s all over, Zoe! Dempsey\u2019s dead!\u201d</p><p>chapterthirty-four</p><p>It was such a relief to have it all behind us. I\u2019m not the type to wish death on anyone, but I have to admit I wasn\u2019t the least bit upset when Dempsey was shot and killed at the Zoo. Personally, I felt a quick death, albeit a violent one, was too good for him after what he did to Brina. My only regret was that two other people died along with him, and one girl who was too young to be in the club in the first place, an innocent bystander who was shot in the spine, would never be able to walk again. I found out her name from Detective Wilson and which hospital she had been taken to. I went to visit her, since I could move about freely again. The police protection had been pulled, and it was great to be out and about, even if it meant getting thrown a bit off my dick-feeding schedule. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took the girl, who was named Octavia, a dozen roses and a card. Her sister was there with her, and we all sat and talked like old friends for about an hour before Ibrought up the reason I was really there. I was hoping she wouldn\u2019t take it the wrong way. \u201cOctavia, I know your health insurance covers all of your medical expenses, but I thought you might want someone to talk to about coping with your handicap.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was very weak, and her skin was flaccid and pale. \u201cSomeone like who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a friend. Her name is Dr. Marcella Spencer, and she\u2019s a wonderful psychiatrist. I think she might be able to help you tremendously.\u201d</p><p>Her sister put her two cents in. I noticed she had quite a southern drawl. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford no head doctor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would be willing to cover the costs.\u201d Both of them were shocked, and their mouths were hanging wide open. I guess good Samaritans went out with bell bottoms and the Afro.</p><p>Octavia cleared her throat. \u201cWhy would you be willing to do something like that for me? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who hurt you . . . well, one of them at least, also hurt me as well as my best friend. In fact, he killed her and ultimately tried to kill me.\u201d</p><p>They were utterly speechless. \u201cHelping you would make me feel like I have undone some of the things he did wrong. Does that make any sense? Probably not.\u201d</p><p>I was on the brink of tears. So much had happened over the past few months that crying had become almost second nature to me. \u201cYes, it makes sense to me, and thanks, lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe name is Zoe. Zoe Reynard, and thank you for accepting the help. Dr. Spencer helped me overcome something once, and she\u2019s still helping me. I\u2019m sure she will help you too.\u201d I held the door open briefly as I was leaving, taking one last look at the young girl who wouldnever walk, run, dance, drive a car, or make love again. \u201cI\u2019ll have Dr. Spencer stop by tomorrow to set up a schedule with you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at me, and I headed for my office to play catch-up.</p><p>For the next two months everything ran smoothly with my marriage, my business, and my relationship with my kids and my mother. Things had never been better. My business picked up considerably, probably because the CEO of the company was finally content with her own life and able to run everything in a more pleasant and efficient manner.Angelique was back in her dorm, but still watched the kids for us when Jason and I went out on dates twice a week. We made that promise to one another and held to it faithfully. We spent two romantic evenings a week alone together away from the kids and household. It was during one of those romantic evenings that Jason surprised me with his master plan.</p><p>We were having dinner at a soul food restaurant when he told me he had rented a log cabin up in the mountains for us to have a weekend getaway. He suggested we drive up that Friday, which was three days away, and spend all day Saturday looking at land for sale to build our summer home. I told him it was on and then got up from my chair, sat on his lap and starting tonguing the hell out of him. The woman that owned the place came over and asked us to stop because there were children present. I replied, \u201cOops, my bad!\u201d She had no idea what the hell that meant but was clearly relieved when I returned to my seat.</p><p>I dropped the kids off at Momma\u2019s house that Fridayafternoon. Jason had the Land Rover packed and ready to roll when I pulled up at home. We had a great drive up. It took us about two hours to get to the cabin, and I fell in love with it at first sight. It was nestled deep in the woods, a split-level with three bedrooms and two full baths. What I loved most was the huge fireplace. Jason headed right outside to get some wood so a fire would be up and going for dinnertime.</p><p>We had plenty of groceries. I went shopping the night before and purchased everything we would need for our romantic weekend getaway. I made baked chicken breasts with rice, green beans, and rolls for dinner. We ate on the bearskin rug by the fireplace. After we washed the dishes, we returned to the rug and made love for the remainder of the night.</p> <p>Jason got up before me the next morning and prepared a huge breakfast. I didn\u2019t even know his ass could cook like that. My baby was just full of surprises! First, eating the pussy day in and day out and then, cooking me an actual meal.</p><p>We spent most of the daylight hours riding around in a Jeep Wrangler with Roscoe Carter, the one and only local real estate agent. He showed us every section of land up for sale in the county. Jason and I were both worn out by the time he dropped us back off at the cabin. I tried to call my mother to check on the kids but got the machine and left the number where we were, just in case she had misplaced it. I figured</p><p>she and Aubrey had decided to take the kids to a late matinee or out for pizza.</p><p>\u201cBoo!\u201d Jason crept up behind me and grabbed me around the waist.</p><p>I pretended I was mad but loved his touches any way I could get them. \u201cJason, you scared the hell out of me! My nerves are wracked enough as it is!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Zoe. We\u2019re here all alone. Who else would be grabbing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point!\u201d I started to walk away, but he grabbed me and plopped down on the couch, pulling me down with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still jumpy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He started kissing and sucking on my neck.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m still a little perturbed by all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t be.\u201d He started unbuttoning my flannel shirt. \u201cWe\u2019re safe now, and the kids are safe. It\u2019s all over, baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIdosay so! Now, give me my tatas!\u201d</p><p>I started giggling while he unfastened my bra and popped a breast in his mouth. After a few more moments of foreplay, all my fears disappeared and my sexual desires took their place.</p><p>We were in the bed, even though it was only about ten o\u2019clock, when we heard a loud rapping at the door. Jason threw on a robe and went down stairs to see what the ruckus was about. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the county sheriff! Mr. Reynard?\u201d</p><p>Jason opened the door. By that time, I was at the top of the steps wearing one of Jason\u2019s undershirts and a pair of panties. The sheriff came into the living room with one of his deputies right on his heels. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sheriff? What\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Reynard, we tried to call, but your phone seems to be off the hook.\u201d I looked around and saw that the phone on the end table beside the couch had been knocked over. I probably hit it with my foot accidentally when Jason picked me up and carried me off to bed.\u201cThere\u2019s been some trouble back in Atlanta, and a detective\u2014\u201d He pulled out a small notepad and flipped the cover open. \u201cDetective Wilson asked me to drive up here and inform you about what happened.\u201d</p><p>I came down the steps in a state of panic. \u201cWhat happened? Did something happen to the kids? My mother? Were they in an accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Nothing like that. In fact, he wanted me to tell you that your mother, stepfather, and the kids are all in protective custody and have been transported to a safe house. Your mother is the one who told us how to find you.\u201d</p><p>Jason yelled it out before I could.\u201cA safe house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. Do you know an Allison Morton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know Allison. She\u2019s my personal secretary at my architectural firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He took off his hat, scratched his head, and then replaced it. \u201cNot anymore, she isn\u2019t.\u201d The deputy walked around the couch, sat the phone back upright, and made sure it was operational.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was found murdered a couple of hours ago in her apartment in southwest Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdered?\u201d I went running up to him. I had called Allison a bitch, told her to get the hell out my house, threatened to have Jason fire her, and now she was dead. One thing I knew for sure, and that was her death was somehow attributed to me, or the sheriff wouldn\u2019t have been there, and my kids wouldn\u2019t have been in protective custody. \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, she was severely mutilated, ma\u2019am. Look here, here\u2019s the number to the station house back in Atlanta.\u201d He ripped the piece of paper out of his pad and handed it to me. \u201cThe best thing would be foryou to call Detective Wilson. He\u2019s waiting to hear from either you or me anyway. He can clear this whole thing up a whole lot better than I can.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff was obviously a man who didn\u2019t want such evil in his county. A couple of good ole boys driving drunk or getting in a bar brawl seemed more his speed. Eventalkingabout murder made the hairs on his neck stand up.</p><p>I called Detective Wilson. He yanked the phone up on the first ring after I was connected to his desk. \u201cMrs. Reynard, I have some extremely disturbing news for you.\u201d</p><p>Jason was sitting beside me on the couch and holding my hand while the sheriff and his deputy paced back and forth, seemingly more nervous than anyone else. \u201cSo I heard, Detective. What exactly happened to Allison, and what does this have to do with me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMs. Morton was discovered by her boyfriend a few hours ago. He went over there and used his key to gain entry when she failed to show up for a date. He found her hanging from the piping in her basement apartment.\u201d He paused before adding, \u201cShe\u2019d been gutted like a pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT?\u201dI started trembling, and Jason kept asking me what the detective was saying. I told him I would fill him in when I got off the phone. \u201cDetective, that\u2019s horrible, but her death might not have anything to do with me at all! Dempsey\u2019s dead, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember. I identified that bastard\u2019s body at the crime scene myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what makes you think this involves me?\u201d I was on the edge of my seat, nervously awaiting his answer.</p> <p>\u201cHmm, I guess you could say the writing on the wall was a dead giveaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat writing on the wall?\u201d There was a silence on the other end of the phone. \u201cDetective?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was written in Ms. Morton\u2019s blood on her bedroom wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe is one dead bitch!\u201d</p> <p>chapterthirty-five</p><p>I dropped the phone into Jason\u2019s lap and froze in place. \u201cZoe, what\u2019s wrong with you? You look as pale as a ghost!\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t answer him! I couldn\u2019t answer! I was in the middle of having a fucking heart attack! \u201cDetective Wilson, this is Jason Reynard. What happened to my secretary?\u201d</p><p>Jason listened intently while the detective repeated everything he had just told me, adding he thought the most likely motive for the murder was gaining information about our whereabouts. Apparently, whoever killed Allison tortured her first and didn\u2019t put her out of her misery until she told them what they wanted to know. That explained a hell of a lot and made my guilt grow ten times over. Someone was after me, and poor Allison had died because of it. She was tortured because she tried to protect Jason and me. Her death on my hands was something I would have to deal with for years to come\u2014if I lived that long.</p><p>I was in a trance until I heard Jason, still on the phone, blurt out, \u201cA gold earring? What about it?\u201d</p><p>I yanked the phone out of his hand. \u201cDetective, what about a gold earring?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt just seemed out of place. It was found on top of the comforter on her bed, but she wasn\u2019t wearing the match. We couldn\u2019t find the other one in her jewelry box or anywhere else in the apartment. It may show up after forensics goes through the place more carefully, but the way it was positioned, I figured the assailant may have lost it during a struggle.\u201d He paused and then added, \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing. Just a hunch.\u201d</p><p>I could have just asked him what type of gold earring it was, but I decided to play a hunch of my own. \u201cDetective, was the earring a gold cross?\u201d</p><p>I could hear his breathing become exasperated over the phone. \u201cHow did you know it was a gold cross?\u201d I didn\u2019t answer him. My mind was playing back memories in my mind. \u201cMrs. Reynard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyson wears a gold cross earring in his left ear!\u201d</p><p>Unfuckenbelievable! How could everyone I ever ran across in my entire life turn out to be a loony? Dempsey, Diamond, Tyson\u2014all fucking crazy. I began to wonder if the old saying, \u201cYou are what you attract,\u201d was written specifically for me. Maybe I was the maniac, and all the others were just following my lead.All that time the police had assumed Tyson had fled jurisdiction to another state to avoid doing time for his parole violation, and I figured the same. When he tried to strangle me that day in Quinton\u2019s hallway, I figured it to be a one-shot deal, caused by a fleeting moment of anger.I had chalked the incident with him and Jason up to the same. Never in a million years would I have thought Tyson was capable of such madness.</p><p>The sheriff informed us we had two choices. There was really no place for us to go stay that side of the county line at that time of night, so we could either stay where we were and have him and his deputy keep watch outside or we could bunker down for the night at the Sheriff\u2019s Department. I opted for the first choice, and so did Jason. No way was I trying to spend the night sleeping on a hard cot in a cell.</p><p>The two officers, who I affectionately nicknamed Andy and Barney, took up a post out in their car in front of the cabin about midnight. I refilled both of their thermoses with hot coffee, and they took turns relieving themselves in the downstairs bathroom before heading out into the cool March night air.</p><p>Jason and I took our asses to bed, and for the first</p> <p>time since my release from the hospital, nothing sexual happened before we drifted off to sleep. We were both stressed the hell out and worried about our kids being in a safe house that sounded like something for people in the witness protection program. I didn\u2019t like it, any of it, and I desperately wanted it to all end. So many times I thought the shit was over, but each problem resolved seemed to bring about an even bigger one. Now Tyson was after my ass. Shame on it all!</p><p>I fell asleep thinking about the fight between Dusty and me that day in the parking lot of the garage where Tyson worked, and how she ripped the gold cross earring out of his ear, causing it to bleed, when he pulled her off me. The same earring I used to take into my mouth and suck on, along with his earlobe, while he was fucking theshit out of me in his apartment, and the same earring they had found in Allison\u2019s apartment after he \u201cgutted her like a pig,\u201d to quote Detective Wilson.</p><p>Jason and I were both in a deep sleep when glass shattered somewhere downstairs. We both jumped up. I picked up the phone beside the bed, but the line was dead. Jason covered my mouth, muffling my screams, and whispered in my ear, \u201cZoe, don\u2019t say a word. Just listen to me and do exactly what I say.\u201dI nodded and listened while he instructed me on what to do. Jason helped me climb out the top-floor window, and I jumped down onto the ground below. My ribs, still damaged from the accident and Dempsey slamming them up against the car door, hurt like all hell when I landed, but at that point, I really didn\u2019t give a damn about the pain. I had to make it to the police car to let them know Tyson was in the house.</p><p>I was about five yards from the sheriff\u2019s car when I realized something was terribly wrong\u2014deadly wrong. The sheriff\u2019s arm was hanging limply out of the driver\u2019s-side window. When I got closer, I saw his eyes in the moonlight, and I knew right off the bat they were the eyes of a dead man. There was a small bullet hole in his forehead, and his deputy had his head on the senior officer\u2019s shoulder. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I would have thought he was napping. Andy and Barney were both dead, and Jason was alone in the house with Tyson\u2014Tyson, who had a gun and was blowing people away with it.</p><p>I opened the driver\u2019s-side door, and the sheriff fell halfway out the car. I reached over him and yanked on the part of the police radio you speak into. It came to me too easily, and once I had it in my hand, I discovered why.The cord had been cut. Calling for help on the radio was out of the question. I felt all over for the guns they both wore on their hips earlier that evening. They were nowhere in sight. They could have been anywhere\u2014 tossed in the bushes, or taken by Tyson. I didn\u2019t have time to search, and my stupid ass had left my gun at my office, figuring the whole ordeal was over and done with. I had to get to Jason! I had to save my baby! Too many people had paid the ultimate price, and my husband wasn\u2019t going to be one of them. Even if it meant laying down my own life to save his.</p><p>I snuck around to the back so I could look in through the rear windows of the cabin. I couldn\u2019t see anything at first, but then I spotted Jason sprawled on the kitchen floor, unconscious. There was no blood, so I didn\u2019t think he had been shot. I had to find out.The patio door was ajar and missing a pane. That was obviously the glass we heard breaking. For once in my life, I wasn\u2019t afraid. I was sick of all the bullshit; if Tyson wanted to kill me, he was going to have a hell of a time doing it, because I had no intention of going out without a struggle. I went in and looked around the downstairs living area. It was dark in the living room. I didn\u2019t sense or hear any movement. I made my way over to Jason and tried to wake him up to no avail. He had a nasty knot on the back of his head, and I figured Tyson must have coldcocked him with the butt of the gun. For the life of me, I couldn\u2019t figure out why he hadn\u2019t killed Jason like the cops, but I was happy as all hell he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Suddenly I heard some footsteps coming down the stairs. I let Jason\u2019s head down gently before sneaking off to conceal myself in the darkness of the living room.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that bitch wife of yours?\u201d Jason started to regain consciousness. A swift kick to the chest cavity made him wake all the way up. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t answer. He just looked up off the floor with fear and pain in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCome on out, Zoe, my love! Snookums! I have something I want to give to you, a present!\u201d</p><p>Jason started to blurt out a question. \u201cAren\u2019t you\u2014?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I am. I\u2019m also the man who\u2019s been fucking the shit out of your wife. Well, at least one of the men she\u2019s been fucking.\u201d</p><p>Jason muttered the word, \u201cBastard.\u201d All he got in return was another violent kick, but this time to the leg. I wanted to rush over to him, but I needed to think things through clearly. I simply couldn\u2019t believe my eyes.</p><p>\u201cZoe\u2019s such a whore, Jason. Don\u2019t you realize that?\u201d</p><p>Jason spit on his assailant\u2019s shoes, and I noticed blood coming out along with his saliva.</p> <p>\u201cI thought for sure you would leave her. Kick her ass out of the house. That way she could have been with me. We could have been together forever, Jason.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s temper started to flare up. \u201cIf Zoe\u2019s such a whore, as you put it, why would you even want to be with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me, Jason!\u201d Another kick to his chest. \u201cDon\u2019tevertake that tone with me! The only reason you\u2019re still breathing is because I need you to get to her! I know the skank bitch won\u2019t show her face unless it\u2019s to save your pathetic ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe loves me and only me!\u201d Jason exclaimed. \u201cShe always has!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sweet! Not that it\u2019s going to matter much a few minutes from now.\u201d</p> <p>I saw Jason about to get kicked again, and I couldn\u2019tmaintain my composure one more second. I screamed out, \u201cQuinton!\u201d</p><p>Quinton swung around to face the living room. I could see him squinting to make out my shadow. \u201cZoe, my love!\u201d He reached out his arms. \u201cCome to Poppa, baby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Quinton?\u201d I asked as I walked into their view. Jason was frantically trying to wave me away, silently telling me to run. There wasn\u2019t a chance in hell of me doing that. I looked back at Quinton. \u201cYou killed Allison, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Quinton grinned at me like he thought the question was humorous. \u201cA man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do!\u201d</p><p>I was dazed and confused. Part of me still didn\u2019t want to deal with what was going on. I was prepared to face off with Tyson, but not Quinton.</p><p>\u201cBut, but, but why?\u201d I stuttered. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d</p> <p>Quinton held up his gun and scratched his temple. \u201cGee, I dunno, Zoe. Maybe something just snapped.\u201d</p><p>I noticed the gun had a silencer on it. No wonder Jason and I didn\u2019t hear the gunshots when Andy and Barney were killed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d he continued. \u201cTemporary insanity brought on by falling in love with a trifling-ass bitch!\u201d</p><p>I struggled to find some words. \u201cBut, but we thought Tyson\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted me before I could finish. \u201cIngenious, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he boasted, waving the gun around in the air. \u201cPlanting the earring and everything? I knew the police would pick up on that, and if they didn\u2019t, you would.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a devilish grin. \u201cSetting up Tyson as the fall guy was perfect. Not that he gives a shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d I hesitated and thought back tothe confrontation in Quinton\u2019s hallway. I clearly remembered that Tyson wasn\u2019t wearing the earring because Dusty had ripped it out in the parking lot. \u201cThe day Tyson came to your place, he wasn\u2019t wearing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh-uh-uh-uh,\u201d Quinton chuckled, shaking the index finger of his free hand like he was scolding a toddler. \u201cCorrection! Thefirsttime he came to my place he wasn\u2019t wearing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>Quinton ignored my question. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve had a couple of months to reflect back on it, Zoe, I really should have let him kill your bitch ass then. The stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done was prying his fingers off your neck.\u201d</p><p>Now I was starting to get pissed. How dare he come off at me like that? I realized I needed to stay calm because Quinton was there for one reason and one reason only\u2014to kill me. However, when he made his last statement, I threw tact out the damn window. I walked within two feet of him and slapped him in the face. \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you, you bastard? You fuckin\u2019 piece of shit!\u201d</p><p>Quinton rubbed his cheek. I started to try to grab the gun, but I didn\u2019t want to risk Jason getting shot. I didn\u2019t care what happened to me at that point. I probably deserved it anyway.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Zoe,\u201d Quinton chided. \u201cNo need to be rude. Let\u2019s not make this situation any uglier than it already is.\u201d He pushed me down on the floor next to Jason. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just have a seat down there with your man?</p><p>Cool your heels off.\u201d</p><p>Quinton was really sick! I thought back to all the passionate afternoons and evenings we spent together. He was so romantic, so giving of himself. To think, all along he was a psychopath.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying before you so rudely interrupted me,Zoe. Tyson didn\u2019t have on the cross earring the first time, but he did the second.\u201d</p><p>I glared up at him, trying to make some sense out of what he was saying. \u201cThe second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you believe that piece of shit came banging on my door, demanding I leave you alone?\u201d Quinton asked, enraged.</p><p>I was beginning to get a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. If Quinton was crazy enough to kill Allison and two police officers, what would keep him from killing Tyson? \u201cAnd what did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, nothing much,\u201d Quinton quickly replied. \u201cI sat there for a few minutes, listening to him profess his undying love for you. I told him he really needed to be telling all of his bullshit to Jason. He said he already had and told me about their punk-ass fight.\u201d</p><p>Jason yelled out, \u201cYou\u2019re the punk, mutha fucka!\u201d</p><p>Before I could stop him, Quinton kicked Jason in the head. \u201cI beg to differ with you, Jason! You\u2019re the biggest punk of all! You married the queen bitch and bred babies with her!\u201d</p><p>I cradled Jason\u2019s head in my lap and looked around for a weapon, anything I could use to defend us. I was willing to die, and I would have begged Quinton to get it over with if Jason was safe and in the clear. I couldn\u2019t let Jason pay the ultimate price for my sins. I just couldn\u2019t. Our kids needed at least one of us to survive.</p><p>Quinton was pointing the gun at Jason\u2019s head. I desperately needed to change the subject, so I asked him, \u201cWhat did you do to Tyson?\u201d</p><p>Quinton started laughing, guffawing even. He went over and leaned on the counter in hysterics. I was just glad he stopped pointing the gun. \u201cYou want to know what I did to him? I\u2019ll be glad to tell you. I killed his ass!\u201d</p><p>I prayed the whole nightmare would go away.</p><p>\u201cI killed his ass and buried him in the train yard right along with my brother, my sister, and Diamond!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrain yard? Diamond?\u201d I just knew I had to be hearing things.</p><p>\u201cYes, Zoe.\u201d Quinton came back over and knelt down in front of us. \u201cYou remember the first time I fucked you, Zoe? In the train yard? Guess what? We did it right on top of the graves I dug for my brother and sister fifteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>I was in shock. \u201cYou killed your brother and sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other people,\u201d he answered calmly. \u201cAs for Diamond, I know what you did with her, Zoe.\u201d I looked away in shame. \u201cI know what you did, and she paid the ultimate price for your pussy too. Just like Tyson.\u201d</p><p>He ran his fingers through my hair, grabbed my face, and tried to force his tongue in my mouth. I refused it.</p><p>He stood back up. \u201cI hate to borrow that old clich\u00c8, but if I can\u2019t have you, nobody will.\u201d</p><p>Jason tried to push his way up off the floor, using his hand to no avail. His eyelids were fluttering and he was barely conscious.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this!\u201d Quinton exclaimed. \u201cCome to me, Zoe!\u201d</p><p>I hated to let go of Jason but I had to try something, and there was nothing on the floor that would help out my cause. I placed Jason\u2019s head on the floor and slowly got up. \u201cQuinton, I have an idea. If you really want us to be together, why don\u2019t we just leave? I\u2019ll go anywhere you want to go. Just don\u2019t hurt Jason, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow admirable, Zoe.\u201d He looked me up and down like he was pondering my offer. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t believe shit you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth?\u201d He started laughing again. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the meaning of the damn word.\u201d</p><p>Quinton suddenly grabbed my arm and flung me against the kitchen counter, making me hit my ribs against the overhang. I screamed out in pain. He walked up behind me and pressed himself up against my back. \u201cOh, did I hurt you?\u201d he asked, pulling back the hair out of my face so he could see my profile. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, baby.\u201d</p><p>I asked a logical question. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hurt me, why are you here?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep sigh. \u201cBecause I\u2019m confused, Zoe. Part of me wants to wring your little neck, but the other part of me wants to carry you away someplace andmakeyou love me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t reply. I just stood frozen in place while he started licking all over the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if I fuck you right here, right now, in front of Jason, I might be able to figure out the solution to my bitch problem. You think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d I blurted out, searching the countertop for something to hit him with. Since the cabin was a rental, most of the countertop was cleared off.</p><p>He swung me around to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sick? What about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019re both sick,\u201d I readily admitted. \u201cBut Jason has nothing to do with this. Let him go,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cFor the sake of my kids.\u201d</p><p>For a brief second, I thought I saw a tear forming in Quinton\u2019s left eye.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Quinton! You remember what it was like to grow up in a home without parents! Look at what it did to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Zoe!\u201d Quinton punched me in the face. \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d</p><p>Before I could react to the punch, he started ripping off my clothes. He lifted me up on the counter and hit me again in the face until I had no choice but to succumb to his advances.</p> <p>I shut my eyes because I didn\u2019t want to see what I knew would be next. I heard him unzipping his pants, and then he entered me roughly. I laid there in fear while he had his way with me. The mere fact that he was fucking me with Jason in the room made me want to crawl up in a hole and die. I just wanted the whole thing to be over with. I began to think about all the things I would never get to do, including watching my kids grow up.</p><p>I opened my eyes when Quinton dropped the gun on the counter so he could grab my hips and push himself deeper into me. I tried to gauge whether it was</p><p>within my reach and stretched my fingers out in a useless effort.</p><p>Quinton noticed what I was doing and chuckled, \u201cForget it! Not a chance! Just fuck me, Zoe! Fuck me hard!\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t move my hips, and that made him even more irate. \u201cFuck me, dammit!\u201d</p><p>I clamped my eyes shut again and prayed for it to end. That\u2019s when I heard the crack, like a walnut being opened with a nutcracker.</p> <p>Before I could see what was happening, Quinton was suddenly no longer inside me.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the punk now? Who\u2019s the punk now, you fuckin\u2019 bastard?\u201d Jason exclaimed, beating Quinton on the head ferociously with the butt of the gun.</p><p>By the time I managed to get down off the counter, Jason was on top of Quinton on the floor, still beating the shit out of him. A handful of Quinton\u2019s teeth were scattered on the floor, and his face was so bloody it was almost unrecognizable.</p><p>I tried to pull Jason off him. \u201cJason, that\u2019s enough!\u201d He kept beating him, and I was afraid he would kill him. \u201cThat\u2019s enough, Jason!\u201d I reiterated, pleading with him not to take a life. \u201cDeath is too good for him! Let the police handle him!\u201d</p><p>Jason finally stopped hitting him and tossed the gun aside. I got down on my knees and hugged him tightly. He started crying and he wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>I kissed him all over the face. \u201cI love you, Jason!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Zoe,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThis is forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways has been!
