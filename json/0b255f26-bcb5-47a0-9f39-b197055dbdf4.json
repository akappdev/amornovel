He wouldn\u2019t spend agonizing months trying to ease her into a relationship she had stated she would never tolerate. So he tried to seduce her into it instead.</p><p>After Jesse\u2019s brother, Thomas, died he had made himself indispensable to her. He was at the house often, fixing this or that, just talking or watching movies late into the night. Despite appearances, Terrie was a wary person, well aware of how easily she could be hurt, how weak she was physically. From what he had gathered, his brother had been more of a bastard than he had ever imagined.</p><p>Thomas had hurt her in the worst possible way. Terrie could have overcome physical abuse. She would have just left. But the systematic psychological and verbal abuse had damned near destroyed her.</p><p>\u201cNow that was a beautiful wedding.\u201d Terrie stumbled against him a bit as he helped her into the house.</p><p>James and Ella\u2019s wedding ceremony had made her teary-eyed, reflective. She had sat in the limo on the way home, quiet, a bit sad, staring out the window as her fingers stroked over the upper swell of one breast her cream-colored dress had revealed. The action had caused his cock to swell\u2014to harden in agonizing need.</p><p>Jesse\u2019s brother, James, had married her best friend after nearly tens years of waiting impatiently on Ella to come around and be tempted by the sexuality he offered her.</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t a long one, anyway.\u201d Jesse pulled her to him, leading her to the living room, enjoying her soft weight against his side.</p><p>The smooth silk of her dress slid against his hands, and when he sat her on the couch, the hem rode just below the crotch of her panties. Cream-colored silk as well. He was betting it was a thong.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed the bride.\u201d Her surprising comment had his brows lifting in surprise.</p><p>He had kissed the bride. Long and deep, to her complete surprise and shocked arousal.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d He knelt before her, removing the high-heeled shoes from her small feet.</p><p>\u201cThat was so decadent,\u201d she sighed then. \u201cKissing her that way, with your tongue. You made her horny.\u201d</p><p>He smothered his laughter. \u201cThat was the point,\u201d he whispered up at her as he caressed the slight welts on the side of her foot.</p><p>She pouted. She had such an intriguing pout, and used it on him often.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to kiss Ella again.\u201d His hand stroked her calf as he felt a small tremor work over her body.</p><p>\u201cSax fucked her. He was at the wedding, of course.\u201d She shot him a narrow eyed, disgruntled look. \u201cI knew she couldn\u2019t hold out. She gave in too easily.\u201d</p><p>She sounded angry with Ella, though Jesse knew she was more than pleased that her friend had finally found some happiness.</p><p>\u201cYou, of course, would be much harder to convince?\u201d he asked her, careful to keep his voice even, his hand on her calf comforting rather than arousing.</p><p>She leveled a hard look at him. \u201cI am not so easy.\u201d</p><p>That was sure as hell the truth. He murmured consoling words while massaging her foot, well aware of how the heels made her feet ache.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sister.\u201d She jerked her foot from his grasp, staring down at him angrily. \u201cStop treating me like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up and I\u2019ll turn you over my knee and paddle your ass.\u201d He jerked her foot back. \u201cNow what has you so upset? I thought you were happy for Ella.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am.\u201d She was pouting again, watching him darkly.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your problem?\u201d he asked her again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never kissed me like that,\u201d she finally said, her cheeks blooming with a flush. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her hazel eyes, more green than brown, watched him with narrow frustration and arousal. Her soft red hair cascaded around her face, the fiery waves tempting his hands to smooth them back from her flushed cheeks.</p><p>He pursed his lips. Her breasts were moving quickly beneath her dress, her nipples hard, poking impatiently at the light fabric. He allowed his hand to stroke higher along the inside of her leg.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can never decide where to put my tongue first.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, confusion filling her expression. \u201cWhat?\u201d Her question was almost a gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d His hand stroked to her thigh. \u201cDo I take your lips and plunge my tongue into your mouth, Terrie, or do I push it as deep and as hard up your pussy as I can, and suck all that sweet cream into my mouth? Deciding is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened, her thighs tensed. He watched as she fought to breathe, to draw in air to counter the arousal he saw surging in her gaze. He parted her thighs then, his cock jerking at the sight of the damp spot on the silk of her panties. His gaze rose back to hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you want that, Terrie? My mouth buried in your cunt, my tongue fucking you to orgasm?\u201d Her thighs opened farther as a strangled moan whispered past her throat.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, and his cock surged in joy then throbbed in disappointment as he gently closed her thighs.</p><p>\u201cRemind me when you\u2019re sober, Terrie.\u201d He stood to his feet, staring down at her shocked expression. \u201cI won\u2019t fuck you drunk. Sober up, then call me. But don\u2019t be surprised if you find out exactly why Sax was at that wedding, and what he\u2019s most likely doing right now to your friend\u2019s climaxing body. You won\u2019t play with me, Terrie,\u201d he warned her softly.</p><p>He turned and left the room, then the house. If he didn\u2019t, he knew he would fuck her, knew he would drive his cock so deep and hard inside her she would scream for her orgasm. And he couldn\u2019t. Not yet. She hadn\u2019t seduced him; she didn\u2019t want it enough. When she did, well then\u2014he grinned\u2014then he would give her everything he had ever dreamed she could take.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Remind me when you\u2019re sober, Terrie. The words echoed through her head. You won\u2019t play with me, Terrie.</p><p>She pushed her fingers restlessly through her red hair as she paced the house. He had left hours before, and she was sober, but she couldn\u2019t find the nerve to pick up that damned phone. She was terrified.</p><p>You think I\u2019m bad, her dead husband\u2019s sneering voice echoed around her. I should give you a taste of Jesse, Terrie. Let him share you a time or two with his buddies. Maybe then you would appreciate me more. She shuddered. She appreciated Thomas more dead.</p><p>She shook her head as she moved into the small kitchen. She was free of one Wyman and now looking at another. Was she insane? And what was worse, she was looking at Jesse. The same Jesse who had fucked her best friend\u2019s daughter. The same Jesse who had been her friend for the last three years. She shuddered as the thought repeated itself. She had to be crazy.</p><p>Jesse was part of a very select group of men. Tess, Ella\u2019s daughter was married to one of them: Cole, Jesse\u2019s best friend. Ella had walked into her ex-husband\u2019s home to find her daughter held between Jesse and Cole in the final throes of an intense m\u00e9nage.</p><p>Terrie had known for years that Jesse was part of this group. There were eight of them. Intensely dominate, charismatic men whose lusts knew few bounds. One of their greater demands was the m\u00e9nage. The complete surrender and submission of their lovers to the pleasures they could bring them.</p><p>Ella, it seemed, had finally given in as well. Tess\u2019s mother had been outraged, furious when she thought Jesse was actually his twin, James, fucking her daughter. She had nearly driven herself crazy with the pain. Loving one of those men was hell. Terrie knew this well.</p><p>Thankfully, James had grown tired of the wait and went after Ella in a way that left her little desire to fight him. Sax had been James\u2019s choice for the final sexual obstacle in his path with Ella.</p><p>Terrie sighed bleakly. First Tess and now Ella. The two people who meant the most to her had stepped into a relationship that inhabited only Terrie\u2019s darkest, most lust-filled dreams. The very thing that had driven her from accepting Jesse\u2019s attentions years before in favor of what she saw as the safer brother.</p><p>Terrie moved from the kitchen to the back deck, sitting in the chair swing as she stared out into the slowly darkening evening. Her body was on fire. She knew what Jesse was. Knew his desires and what he liked. She couldn\u2019t help but know. Thomas had been quite explicit in his description of them.</p><p>She curled her legs beneath her as the chair swayed softly with her weight. The soothing rhythm normally eased her stress, but tonight it seemed to only provoke it. The soft back and forth sway made her cunt clench with the thought of Jesse moving between her thighs, his cock thrusting into her hungry pussy with the same slow, steady movement.</p><p>She had sworn she would never allow herself to be shared, to be used by the man she loved. She remembered when Thomas first gleefully announced his brother\u2019s preferences as Jesse sat at their dinner table. Not that Terrie hadn\u2019t already been aware of them.</p><p>Terrie had been mortified by his drunken announcement, and more than shocked as Jesse sat back in his chair with that sardonic twist to his mouth and asked Thomas if he was trying to scare Terrie, or convince her to join in. It was then she learned that Thomas, too, had been part of the lifestyle Jesse enjoyed. Until he had married her.</p><p>She sighed wearily. Reliving the mistake her marriage had been wasn\u2019t going to help her. Jesse was her problem now, not Thomas. And Jesse and his brother were like night and day. Of course, she had known that when she married Thomas. It was her fault. She had married what she considered a safer alternative. And had learned better, nearly at the expense of her sanity.</p><p>But none of that solved her present problem. That problem being Jesse Wyman and his incredible stubbornness. Call him when she sobered up. She snorted. She hadn\u2019t been that drunk. She wasn\u2019t so stupid she didn\u2019t know Sax was joining Ella and James on their wedding night, either. Ella had confided that piece of news to her already.</p><p>God. Could she do it? Her pussy pulsed at the thought but all her previous beliefs screamed out in rejection of the idea. She knew Jesse would never go to another woman. Terrie had been with Ella when Tess imparted that information. The men wanted no one else. What they wanted was to see the women experience the pleasure of two men worshipping their bodies, glorying in their arousal.</p><p>Tess was more than happy with her marriage to Cole. Terrie\u2019s hands clenched in jealousy as she thought of the other woman. How many times had Jesse been in Tess\u2019s bed in the past year? How many times had he fucked her as Terrie lay aroused, dreaming of his touch. Touching herself because Jesse hadn\u2019t been there to touch her.</p><p>God, she was demented. She had lost any claim to sanity. Or had she?</p><p>She groaned at the futility of her own argument. It didn\u2019t matter, because fact was fact. There was no way in hell she could ask Jesse to fuck her with another man. There was no way she could seduce him...</p><p>So you\u2019re Jesse\u2019s lady. One of the men at the wedding had said as he had approached her. I can see why he\u2019s dropped out of circulation now.</p><p>Jesse had moved in then, steering her away from the grinning blonde who watched her with wicked green eyes. What had his name been? She frowned as she tried to remember. Lucian. Wasn\u2019t it Lucian? He didn\u2019t work at Delacourte\u2019s, she knew. Jesse had mentioned something about computers.</p><p>She snapped her fingers. Lucian Conover. He designed some kind of weird computer programs for the government, if she remembered correctly. Surely Jesse hadn\u2019t already approached someone? What did they do, sit around with their beers and discuss who would fuck their women?</p><p>Her face flushed. Good God, what the hell was she getting herself into? Couldn\u2019t he just fuck her? Would she settle for just being fucked?</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She jumped from the chair and moved quickly to the phone just inside the house. Jerking it off the base she quickly punched in Jesse\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cYes, Terrie.\u201d His voice was dark, smooth, like rich chocolate. She had an addiction for chocolate.</p><p>\u201cDid you ask Lucian Conover to help you fuck me?\u201d she asked him point blank. Beating around the bush had never been her strong suit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence met her abrupt question. A long, drawn out silence that made her begin to wonder if he had hung the phone up on her.</p><p>\u201cJesse?\u201d Her voice was sharp, but her knees weakened.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he finally answered abruptly. \u201cNot exactly. Are you sober now?\u201d</p> <p>There was a shade of worry in his tone now.</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d she snarled, thinking he was lucky she couldn\u2019t throw something at him. \u201cHow would you like it, Jesse, if I approached one of my girlfriends to help me fuck you?\u201d</p><p>Another silence. \u201cWhich one?\u201d Was that curiosity in his voice? She almost rapped the phone against the table in irritation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a menace,\u201d she accused him heatedly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve changed my mind. I don\u2019t want to fuck you at all, Jesse. Actually, Mr. Conover seemed rather interested.\u201d She checked her nails carefully as she considered the possibilities. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not into the sharing deal after all?\u201d</p><p>Jesse cleared his throat. \u201cTerrie, I wouldn\u2019t continue this way, if I were you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet he\u2019s hung, too,\u201d she said with apparent interest. \u201cI hear he\u2019s quite good in bed. Maybe I\u2019ll find out. Good night, Jesse, and kiss my ass.\u201d</p><p>She disconnected abruptly. Damn him. She knew he had talked to Conover. He must have. She gritted her teeth furiously. Trojans. They were Trojans, all right. Trojan headaches.</p><p>The phone rang with a harsh, shrill note. Terrie jerked at the sound before picking it up and glanced at the caller display knowingly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jesse?\u201d she greeted him sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do more than kiss your ass, Terrie,\u201d he promised, his voice dark, arousing. \u201cYou should know better than to dare me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She felt a nervous shiver of anticipation work over her body. Her thighs clenched, the liquid heat of her vagina spilling from the lips of her cunt at the sound of his dark, deep voice. It rasped over the line, stroking her senses with erotic purpose.</p> <p>\u201cGet a life,\u201d she snorted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t daring you, Jesse, I was merely making a statement of intent.\u201d</p><p>Silence sizzled over the line.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so brave,\u201d he said, his voice gentle. So gentle, so filled with obvious affection, that she felt her throat tighten with emotion.</p><p>He could do that to her so easily. Have her furious, ready to flay him alive, then turn so soft, so incredibly tender she wanted to melt into a puddle of arousal at his feet.</p><p>\u201cI am brave,\u201d she reminded him, determined she wouldn\u2019t be swayed this time.</p><p>She heard his disbelieving snort, as though he were trying to hide his disbelief.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he laughed gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I won\u2019t press you on this. I want you, but I won\u2019t take something from you that you don\u2019t want to give. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, biting her lips as she heard the regret in his voice. It was so like Jesse. The thought speared through her mind. Her heart. He was always so careful to be certain no one was hurt; that he gave rather than took from anyone. Would he pretend to want her to keep from hurting her? Or had he pretended he didn\u2019t want her to save her from something he felt she couldn\u2019t handle? With Jesse, it could have been either.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me.\u201d She fought the bitterness that closed her throat. She was terrified that was her answer.</p><p>\u201cTerrie, I\u2019m dying to fuck you,\u201d he finally sighed. \u201cI want you so damned bad my cock is hard enough to hammer nails. But I don\u2019t want you hurt. Not ever again, baby. And I\u2019m afraid what I need would hurt you. Go to bed, baby. Don\u2019t worry about this. I promise, I still love you.\u201d</p><p>His abrupt about face had tears stinging her eyes. He wanted her. She knew he did. But she would be damned if she would beg.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jesse, there are times you aren\u2019t fit to kill,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat makes you think I need your protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go to bed, Jesse. See if you can sleep with that hard-on driving you crazy. And while you do, just remember. I offered. I won\u2019t do so again. And I still love you, too.\u201d And she realized in that moment just how much she did love Jesse.</p><p>She hung the phone up quickly. When it rang moments later, she watched it with narrow-eyed intent. She was a woman, not a child, and Jesse\u2019s insistence on treating her with kid gloves was getting on her nerves. It was time to show him...</p><p>She smiled slowly. Oh yes, it was definitely time to show him that he wasn\u2019t the only one who knew how to seduce. She could play the game just as well, and he was about to learn that lesson quite quickly.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Terrie refused to let nerves or fear sway her. The time she had spent married to Thomas had curbed her natural responsiveness, her love of living, and she knew it. After the first month, he had refused to touch her. He had caustically broken down her confidence in herself and her sexuality. Nothing she did could please him. Each touch was dissected for faults and found wanting.</p><p>And he hadn\u2019t been gentle in his lack of desire for her. He had raged often, and with cruel emphasis on the fact that it was her fault. Hadn\u2019t he enjoyed sex before her, he would scream? She was destroying his manhood, destroying their lives with her inept responses. What man could want her? What man could desire her with the faults her body held? Her breasts were too large. Her legs were too short. Her hair was too thin. The list went on and on.</p><p>Of course, she had known, intellectually, that he was insane. Men had found her desirable before Thomas. But being unable to satisfy her husband, hearing daily his list of her shortcomings had damaged something inside her. If she couldn\u2019t please her husband, how could she ever hope to please anyone else?</p><p>The cycle had nearly destroyed her. Having him invite Jesse to the house often, throwing his sexual preferences in her face, then later, after his brother left, cruelly going into detail about how little she could please a man of Jesse\u2019s tastes, had almost broken her.</p><p>She had paid the ultimate price for her fear of Jesse\u2019s sexuality. It had been that fear that had driven her into the arms of his brother. A man she had believed was gentler, less inclined to dominate and demand her submission sexually. Sexually, Thomas had demanded the ultimate price. He hadn\u2019t wanted submission; he had wanted something far less gentle. Sexual slavery.</p><p>She shuddered as she smoothed the silk stockings up her legs and adjusted the elastic tops before standing to observe the effect in the full-length mirror. The black silk bra and thong contrasted softly with her creamy skin. She narrowed her eyes, smoothing her hand over her flat abdomen, then up to her full breasts.</p><p>Beneath the silk of her bra, her nipples peaked, making the small gold ring that pierced her left one weigh erotically on the sensitive tip. Between her thighs, a matching ring pierced the hood of her clit, and the weight there was driving her insane with the added sensation of pleasure.</p><p>She was wet, so slick and hot she could barely stand it. The silk of her thong was damp with need, the roughened texture against her bare cunt lips stroking her arousal higher.</p><p>Damn, the waxing Tally had talked her into had hurt like hell the first time. But as her friend had predicted, each session was less painful. The rewards had been amazing. She loved being bare. Loved the lift it gave to her sexual confidence, the amazing sense of freedom and added sensitivity had helped heal a part of her wounded pride after Thomas\u2019s death.</p><p>Not that another man had touched her there. Until now, she hadn\u2019t found the courage to break free of her own fears and try. If Jesse found her wanting, it would destroy her. But she needed to know. Needed to find out if she was woman enough to hold the arrogant, charismatic sexuality of the man who had fascinated her for years.</p><p>She knew what he would eventually want. Knew from her own dreams, her own fantasies that she was nearing the point of no control where they were concerned. She stared herself in the eye through the glass of the mirror. Was she perverted? Depraved? She had felt she was, years before, when she first learned of the Trojans and their sexual practices. When she had first learned she was so in lust and in love with one of the group\u2019s major players that she had known she could and would, if he asked, join in his games.</p><p>She bit her lip, fighting her own fears and the morals she had been taught in her youth. Hell, she had broken every rule her mother had tried to drum into her head concerning sex and her body. Why should this one be any different? If he loved her...</p><p>\u201cOh God. I\u2019ve lost my mind.\u201d She threw herself on the bed.</p><p>She knew Jesse cared for her. He had to. He had taken care of her for almost three years. Had listened to her rage and cry during those first days when the guilt of Thomas\u2019s death had weighed on her soul. He had held her, holding back his desire for her, and she knew he had wanted her. There was no hiding the erection that had filled his pants those nights.</p><p>He had never given so much time to any other woman. Hell, other than Tess, she knew he hadn\u2019t been with another woman in ages. When she asked him about it, he had shrugged and claimed his workload was getting in the way. But he was spending plenty of time with her. Time that he could have used playing. If he had wanted to.</p><p>She loved him. She always had. Knew she did. But could she do this? Could she seduce him?</p><p>She turned her head, looking at the dress she had laid out on her bed earlier. It was sexy without being crude. The black silk would cling to her curves, without being overtly blatant. The scalloped neckline skimmed the tops of her breasts. The skirt stopped just above her knees. The matching black heels were high, and utterly feminine.</p><p>A \u201cdress for success, knock \u2018em dead\u201d outfit just right for stepping into the offices of Delacourte Electronics and seducing one of the vice presidents in charge. And she had the perfect reason for going in. The letter that had arrived that morning in the mail. Yet another of Thomas\u2019s hidden debts.</p><p>She drew in a hard, courage-gathering breath before moving from the bed and picking up the dress. She finished dressing quickly, knowing her bravery was waning. Thomas\u2019s taunts drifted through her mind as she pulled the material over her head.</p><p>Her breasts were too large, he had said. She smoothed her hands over the full mounds. The size C cups of her bra held the flesh securely. Not that she sagged. At least not yet. They were firm and full, but Jesse had large hands. She closed her eyes in pleasure at the thought. And he liked looking at her breasts...hell, he did it often. And his looks were always heated and filled with lust.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t very tall. Another of Thomas\u2019s complaints. She never got wet enough, never acted sexual enough. God, she was so wet now she felt as though she was going to drown in her own desire.</p><p>He was wrong. She brushed her hair quickly, watching the silken strands as they curled around her shoulders in a fall of red gold. Not much makeup. She didn\u2019t need a lot, and rarely wore it. She didn\u2019t want to come off as seductive, but she wanted to seduce.</p><p>She was lotioned, waxed and scented from head to toe. Dressed and ready and shaking with nerves two hours later when she walked into Jesse\u2019s outer office. Tally\u2019s head raised, her brown eyes widening just a bit as a smirk crossed her lips. Terrie prayed she wasn\u2019t blushing.</p><p>\u201cShould I take my lunch break now?\u201d the secretary drawled in amusement as she sat back in her chair and watched Terrie walk across the room.</p><p>Terrie swallowed tightly. \u201cQuick, tell me again what Thomas was?\u201d</p><p>Tally frowned. \u201cA walking dick?\u201d she asked as she watched Terrie closely. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going after big brother now? Come on, Terrie.\u201d She rolled her eyes mockingly. \u201cHe\u2019s a walking time bomb. When he gets hold of you he won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Terrie blew out a relieved breath. \u201cWell, at least you didn\u2019t call him a walking dick.\u201d</p><p>Tally laughed, though the sound was quiet, and filled with amusement. \u201cA walking hard-on, but that can at least be useful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he alone?\u201d She nodded to the closed door.</p><p>Tally looked at the door as she rose to her feet. \u201cAlone and pouting, I think.\u201d She grinned as she picked up the pretty purse sitting on her desktop. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready for lunch now. Go on in. Tell him I\u2019ll see him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Terrie winced. \u201cLong lunch, Tally. He\u2019s going to fire you.\u201d</p> <p>The other woman snorted. \u201cI can only get so lucky. Keep him occupied and he\u2019ll never miss me.\u201d She winked suggestively as she breezed out of the room.</p><p>Terrie was left standing, more or less deserted, in the middle of the room. Damn Tally. The least she could have done was stick around to save her if things got too hot.</p><p>\u201cTally, where the hell is that cost estimate...\u201d Jesse threw open his door and stared at Terrie in surprise. \u201cWhere the hell did she go this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d Terrie wasn\u2019t about to mention the fact that his secretary wouldn\u2019t return until the next morning.</p><p>He bit off a curse then his eyes narrowed on her. He took in the black dress, the heels, and Terrie watched in fascination as sensuality filled his expression. He went from handsome, darkly dangerous, to sexual pirate within seconds. She fought to still the trembling in her legs as she lifted her hand, flashing the envelope she carried.</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>Terrie shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as the others, but I\u2019ll need your lawyers to set up the payments...\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cCome in here. I\u2019m not going to discuss this standing up.\u201d</p><p>He turned and disappeared back into his office. Terrie followed slowly.</p><p>When she entered the large room, she glanced at the seating arrangement in the corner. He was sitting on one end of the leather couch there, closing out whatever he had been working on in the laptop before pushing it back.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d He motioned beside him as he watched her walk to him.</p> <p>The dark intensity in his green eyes hadn\u2019t changed. He looked ready to fuck, and Terrie was suddenly more nervous than she could ever remember being in her life.</p><p>She sat perched at the edge of the couch, handing him the envelope carefully.</p><p>\u201cIf you could just get the payment schedule set up...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you have enough to cover it.\u201d He took the envelope from her and pulled the legal paper from inside. \u201cThomas was stupid but I wasn\u2019t. His shares in the company are safe, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>Those shares had kept her solvent despite Thomas\u2019s death and how quickly he had emptied out both their accounts during their marriage. Jesse had never traced the money, but at least she hadn\u2019t suffered in the theft.</p><p>Silence filled the room for long moments as he read the letter.</p><p>\u201cStupid bastard,\u201d he muttered as he threw the paper to the table. \u201cHe\u2019s lucky he died. I would have killed him myself by now. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll have the accountant take care of it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I watch my spending for a while?\u201d she asked him carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cause any added problems, Jesse.\u201d</p> <p>His mouth tilted with a small grin. \u201cI\u2019ve invested your money wisely, Terrie. You\u2019re fine. Stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if he ever got tired of taking care of her. From the moment news had come that Thomas had died in the car wreck, Jesse had been there. He had taken care of the burial, the horrendous news of the mounting debts. Everything. And he had been taking care of her ever since.</p><p>She smiled back nervously, wondering what the hell she was supposed to do now? How did you seduce a man like Jesse? He would give her anything, she knew, but at what cost to himself? How could she be certain she was what he wanted? That he could love her?</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d He flicked a look at her dress-covered breasts. It was a heated, brooding look, a stroke of carnal interest.</p><p>She shrugged nervously. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go to the club today for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from Conover, Terrie,\u201d he warned her softly as he turned to her, his eyes blazing with irritation. God, was it jealousy? \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t want to push me on this.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise a second before she frowned back at him. His gaze had narrowed, sensuality vying with a dominant glitter that made her stomach tighten with nerves.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mention his name, Jesse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I both know he\u2019s likely to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire. I let you run from me once, Terrie. I won\u2019t let you do it again.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to gape at him. Once again he was making very little sense. \u201cJesse, I had no intentions of seeing Conover today or ever. It\u2019s not my fault you gave him the impression he could help you screw me. And for that matter, what gave you that impression?\u201d</p><p>She was angry now. She could feel her veins throbbing with the pulse of blood, the heat that filled her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing me again, Terrie,\u201d he growled. \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to bait hungry men, baby. Keep it up and you may get more than you bargained for, and we both know you\u2019re not ready for that.\u201d</p><p>She was ready for him. She was ready to take her life back and find the happiness she had denied herself for so long.</p><p>\u201cReady for what?\u201d she snapped back, her fists clenching now. \u201cReady to be touched? To be a woman for a change? Sorry, Jesse, you\u2019re way off base there. I\u2019m more than ready for that. Too bad you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She moved to jump from the couch, to leave the office, to stomp home and scream and curse him as she had more times than she could count already. Unfortunately, Jesse didn\u2019t seem ready to let her leave.</p><p>Before she could do more than gasp his arm hooked around her, turning her before he pressed her into the cushions of the couch. The dress rode up her thighs as she stared up at him in surprise and he wasn\u2019t helping much as he pressed one hard thigh between hers.</p><p>\u201cOh, Terrie,\u201d he said, his voice soft, filled with dark longing. \u201cI\u2019m more than ready for you to be a woman. But are you really ready to be my woman?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her a chance to answer. His lips came down on hers in a kiss that sizzled Terrie from her head to her toes. Her hands clenched his shoulders as she fought to keep her senses from reeling, but there was no escaping the firestorm he ignited inside her.</p><p>His big hands framed her face, pushing into her hair, holding her still as his tongue invaded her mouth with decadent hunger. It swirled around her own, tempting her, teasing her as it stroked in and out, mimicking a much more earthy, sexual act.</p><p>She arched in his arms, helpless now, gorging herself on the pleasure his lips and tongue bestowed as he dominated the kiss. His head tilted, his lips slanting against hers as he groaned deeply into her mouth and one hand moved to cup the fullness of her breast.</p><p>Terrie stilled. Was she too large, as Thomas had sworn?</p><p>Before the thought was finished Jesse had lowered the zipper in the back of the dress, drawing it slowly down her shoulders as his lips moved to her neck, his breathing rough, heavy, as he began to blaze a path to her right breast.</p><p>\u201cJesse,\u201d she whispered his name as she fought to breathe. The sensations rocking through her body were intense, mind destroying, and he hadn\u2019t even truly done anything yet.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d He paused at the cup of her bra, breathing hard and heavy as he so obviously fought for a control she didn\u2019t want him to hold onto. \u201cTerrie. Not like this,\u201d he whispered, but his fingers stroked over her nipple, causing her to arch in exquisite need.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Fear beat at her with razor-sharp talons. \u201cWhat did I do wrong, Jesse?\u201d</p><p>His head rose slowly. The look on his face had her thighs clenching, her vagina spilling more of its liquid heat in a primal demand. His cheeks were sensually flushed, his eyes a brilliant dark green and as hot as lust itself.</p><p>\u201cYou do too many things right.\u201d He tried to laugh, but it sounded more like a strained groan, Terrie thought.</p><p>His gaze went to the flesh of her upper breast, his fingers stroking over it almost regretfully as he looked back up at her.</p><p>\u201cYou know what will happen,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, Terrie. I care too much for you to ever want to hurt you. But you know what I\u2019ll want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd only your wants matter?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shook his head as he moved away from her quickly, as though if he didn\u2019t do it then, he never would. She sat up more slowly, watching as he stared down at her, breathing hard, heavy.</p><p>\u201cNo, Terrie, that\u2019s not all that matters,\u201d he informed her impatiently. \u201cIf it were, then I\u2019d be in your bed now instead of fighting an erection that never seems to go away.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flickered to his hips. She fought to breathe. Nope, there was no hiding that. It was thick and long, pressing demandingly against his slacks.</p><p>\u201cDammit, you should at least act scared,\u201d he growled as he sat down carefully in the large chair across from the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not frightened of you, Jesse.\u201d She allowed a smile to tilt her lips as she straightened her dress then reached back to pull the zipper back into place.</p><p>She was very much aware of Jesse watching every move she made as she arched to grip the small tab and draw it up slowly.</p><p>\u201cCould you handle it?\u201d he asked, and she knew he wasn\u2019t talking about the zipper.</p><p>She stood to her feet, smoothed her dress down, then looked at him coolly.</p><p>\u201cCould you?\u201d She arched a brow in question.</p><p>He smiled slowly. \u201cDon\u2019t dare me, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulder in unconcern. \u201cDon\u2019t push me, Jesse. I want you, not a pack of hound dogs. Take that however you want to. And decide which one you want the most. You can let me know when you figure it out.\u201d</p><p>So much for seduction, she thought sarcastically.</p><p>He stood slowly to his feet. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean by that?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI mean, Jesse, when you decide you want me without all the dire warnings and predictions, then you can let me know. I care about you, as you well know. If I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d be damned if I would put up with your arrogance, or your habit of showing up at my home before sunrise for coffee. The question is, can you do without your buddies long enough to take it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him time to answer. She swept out of the office quickly, fighting the shuddering need racing through her body, and the sudden tightening of Jesse\u2019s muscles as though preparing to move for her. If he wanted her, then he knew where he could find her. Alone.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>He found her asleep on the couch. This was where Terrie slept most of her nights away, curled beneath a light blanket, staring up at the skylight above her. As far as Jesse knew, she hadn\u2019t slept in a bed since she had moved from Thomas\u2019s years before. Before his death. Before the truth of his abuse had come to light. And Jesse wouldn\u2019t have known if he hadn\u2019t spent that first week after his brother\u2019s death with her.</p><p>Her nightmares had humiliated her, he remembered. They had shocked him to the very core of his being. He had known Thomas was different. Had known his brother possessed a cold, cruel side, but he had never suspected the habitual threats he had nearly destroyed Terrie with. So much so that she had been in the process of a divorce when he died. It amazed Jesse that she hadn\u2019t killed Thomas herself.</p><p>He knelt by the couch, watching her sleep. The blanket covered only her breasts and hips, leaving her long legs bare. She was as naked as sin, lying on her back, breathing deeply as she dreamed. A large man\u2019s shirt was pooled on the floor beside the couch as though she had dropped it, unheeded, before lying down. The fragile light of the first rays of morning touched her delicate, honey gold skin, giving it a soft, luminescent color.</p><p>She was more beautiful now than she had been dressed in silk and lace at Ella\u2019s wedding. And more tempting. Did she, he wondered, know how much she tempted him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head. He wasn\u2019t a stupid man. He had watched Terrie at that wedding. Watched her expressions, the curiosity in her eyes. She was willing, but uncertain. Needy, but frightened. She was a woman searching for an end to the needs that tormented her, a woman almost willing to reach out.</p><p>Almost. His lips quirked into a smile. Terrie couldn\u2019t be ordered. She couldn\u2019t be persuaded. It had to be her choice. How could he convince her to choose?</p><p>Damn. As he stared at her he was amazed once again at what the very sight of her did to him. How it clenched his chest, engorged his cock, had emotions springing to life that he knew he would be much more comfortable without. He didn\u2019t need to love this woman. He didn\u2019t need to be tormented with her fiery will, her insatiable curiosity and her smart mouth. But there he was. Where he had been since before his brother\u2019s death. In love with the one woman he knew he shouldn\u2019t want.</p><p>He could very well be a fool. He could be making the biggest mistake of his life. He watched her sleep, entranced by her shifting expressions, wondering what dreams filled her head. Was it nightmare or sensual pleasure that had her sighing roughly as she shifted beneath the blanket?</p><p>His throat tightened at the thought that nightmares could be visiting her again. That the past could be haunting her with decisions and mistakes not her own. She was too willing to take fault onto her fragile shoulders. Too willing to accept blame when it lay with others.</p><p>He lifted his hand, his fingers pushing back a silken strand of red gold hair from her sleep flushed cheek. Her lips parted. Pouty pink curves that he could too well imagine moving beneath his, or enveloping the head of his cock. He grimaced, fighting a groan at the thought of that.</p><p>\u201cTerrie?\u201d he whispered her name gently. A soft intimate whisper that he wished he had the right to use. He was taking that right. He was tired of waiting.</p><p>The soft moue of her lips at the disturbance had him watching her in amusement. She must have been up late the night before. She shifted again, causing the light blanket to slip further along the full curves of her breasts. Her nipples were peaked, pressing hard against the cloth. On one, the outline of a small gold loop could be seen. The presence of the nipple ring never failed to make his cock jerk in a hungry response. He stared down at it, watching the peaks hardening slowly, becoming engorged as she shivered within whatever dream held her. Sensual pleasure.</p><p>\u201cTerrie. Wake up.\u201d He spoke louder this time, touching her cheek as her eyes flew open.</p><p>She blinked for a second, her gaze drowsy at first as she focused on him. Sensual heat lit her gaze as her lips parted in surprise, her eyes darkening with drowsy sexuality.</p><p>\u201cJesse?\u201d she whispered, her voice husky and dark as she watched him.</p><p>She shifted lazily, unaware of the blanket slipping as she did so, the edge catching then falling away from the loop that pierced her nipple. God help him. His whole body tightened. Beaten gold lay against the dark rose areola, looping into the nipple, providing a decadent temptation to his hungry senses. He wondered if she would whimper when he gripped the little loop in his teeth and tugged at it sensually.</p><p>\u201cWake up.\u201d He tucked the blanket over the swell of her breasts. Out of sight was not out of mind, though. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>She blinked again. \u201cTalk?\u201d</p><p>Her awakening senses were lazy as hell, he knew. Terrie didn\u2019t just jump out of the bed. She was like a kitten, drowsy, stretching, accustoming herself to reality before stepping into it.</p><p>\u201cCome on, lazy bones. Coffee should be ready, and we can talk.\u201d He patted her thigh. He wanted to pat something else instead.</p><p>She frowned slowly. \u201cI thought I was angry with you?\u201d</p><p>Yep, that was his Terrie. Bright-eyed and raring to go.</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d He kept his tone deliberately casual. \u201cWell, you might be madder before the morning\u2019s out. Come on, darlin\u2019, rise and shine.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet as she thought about that for a minute. She rubbed her eyes then yawned softly behind her hand as she struggled to sit up. He gave her another minute then turned and headed quickly to the kitchen for the coffee.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d her voice echoed through the house just seconds before she stomped into the kitchen.</p><p>He was waiting. He met her at the table, pressed her back into a chair then placed the mug before her. The scent of rich, addicting coffee steamed in temptation beneath the cute little twitch of her nose.</p> <p>She was still buttoning the overlarge man\u2019s shirt that had lain by the couch as she slept. His shirt. His body clenched in reaction at the thought of her lounging around in the shirts he had forgotten here. This one he had used while helping her paint one of the rooms. The paint still stained it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in trouble,\u201d she muttered as she wrapped her fingers around the mug. \u201cWhy the hell are you here anyway?\u201d</p><p>Disgruntled, drowsy and clearly remembering exactly why she was angry with him, Jesse thought as he hid his smile. He didn\u2019t care much for the welling tenderness that tightened his chest, though. Damn if she couldn\u2019t disarm him as quickly as she could arouse him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re so cheerful in the morning.\u201d He grinned as he carried his own cup to the table and sat down across from her. \u201cMy little ray of sunshine.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look that was anything but light and uplifting. He hid his smile behind his cup, watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Jesse.\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair, sending strands of silk flowing behind her shoulders. \u201cTell me what the hell you want so I can go back to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Yep, that was his Terrie. So sweet and gracious she could melt the hardest heart. She had his. Years ago. But it wasn\u2019t his heart that needed relief at the moment; it was his cock. Through the long, sleepless night he had come to several decisions where Terrie was concerned. First and foremost being he was tired of waiting. He wanted her with an intensity that bordered on obsession and, by God, he was about to do something about it.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Silence descended between them as Terrie slowly fought her way past the drowsiness that often made it difficult for her to wake up. She was not a morning person. And if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, it wasn\u2019t much past daylight right now. She could have sworn she had stated her dislike of early mornings.</p><p>She finished the first cup of coffee and rose from the table to get another. As she did, she was aware of Jesse coming to his feet as well. He paced to the doorway, sighed, turned back and watched her. She fought to ignore what his look did to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to fuck the hell out of you, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>The smooth, cultured voice broke through the silence of the early morning light and her drowsiness.</p><p>Terrie placed the coffee pot back on the counter and fought to still her trembling hands, certain that she couldn\u2019t have heard him correctly.</p><p>She blinked, staring at Jesse in shock. Despite the confrontation in his office the day before, despite her knowledge that he did want her, she hadn\u2019t expected this. Not this soon.</p><p>\u201cHow very romantic,\u201d she snorted, her temper sizzling at his attitude. \u201cLet me just bend over for you now.\u201d</p><p>Jesse merely watched her coolly, though, with those deep green eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf you wanted romance, you picked the wrong way to bait me for it,\u201d he said as he leaned against the doorway, watching her carefully. \u201cIt would be a beneficial arrangement for both of us. And it would sure as hell take care of this frustration we\u2019re both fighting tooth and nail. It\u2019s stupid to fight something we both want.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, aware that her expression must be comical with disbelief. After their confrontation the day before, this was the last thing she had expected.</p><p>\u201cJesse, are you drunk?\u201d she finally asked, narrowing her eyes at him. He had shown up a few times, more than a little relaxed after some party or another he had gone to, but he had never said anything so shocking before and certainly not so early in the morning.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not drunk.\u201d He frowned fiercely, his bright green eyes too hot, too dangerously sexy for her peace of mind. \u201cCome on, Terrie. You knew I\u2019d show up after that little dare of yours.\u201d</p><p>Terrie felt her face flushing. She had expected him, but not this early or this demanding.</p><p>She licked her suddenly dry lips nervously, all too aware of how she was dressed now. The large man\u2019s shirt covered her okay, but she was completely naked beneath.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk about this later.\u201d She took a deep breath, fighting for composure. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re sane again. And I\u2019m awake.\u201d</p><p>His frown grew heavier now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly sane, just as I\u2019m perfectly aware of how naked you are under that damned shirt, and that fucking nipple ring is driving me crazy. Just as I\u2019m aware of a lot of other things, Terrie. What the hell are you so afraid of anyway? You said you wanted it, now here I am.\u201d</p><p>Her face flushed. She wondered what he would think of the small ring that pierced the hood of her clit as well. Or the tattoo that stretched across her back. She wasn\u2019t nearly as unadventurous as he thought she was. He thought she was too timid, too frightened to accept the things he wanted from her. He had proven that before she met Thomas. And to be honest, she hadn\u2019t been certain herself. Hell, she had been terrified at the time. But never once had he had given her the opportunity to try.</p><p>Nerves turned to anger at that thought. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d she said furiously. \u201cBut who says I want to have sex with you now? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re the only man around, Jesse.\u201d</p><p>Bad question. A sensual smile tipped his lips as his expression took on a brooding carnality that made her cunt clench in arousal. She really wished he wouldn\u2019t watch her like that.</p><p>\u201cYour nipples are hard,\u201d he said softly, his gaze flickering to her breasts.</p><p>Her breath caught in her chest. They were hard and aching, just like they always were around him.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she told him desperately. \u201cThe house is chilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pussy is wet.\u201d His frank, graphic words had her eyes widening in shock.</p><p>\u201cIt is not,\u201d she lied through her teeth. \u201cGo home, Jesse. I\u2019ve had enough of this conversation.\u201d</p><p>But her pussy was wet. Wet and hot and pleading with her to spread her legs and beg him to fuck her. Fuck her hard and deep to relieve the blistering torment of arousal she suffered through. She had to get away from him before she did just that.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d He blocked her as she attempted to leave the room.</p><p>His tall, leanly muscled body moved in front of her at the last minute, stopping her from reaching the doorway. Terrie stopped; trembling in what she hoped was anger.</p><p>\u201cI decided something about this whole situation last night, baby. You\u2019re right; you don\u2019t need to be warned. You know the facts of my life, and evidently you\u2019re willing to chance what\u2019s coming. And I\u2019ve decided something else,\u201d he told her softly, maneuvering her until her back came against the wall and his body could press against hers heatedly.</p><p>His hands gripped her hips then, his thick, hot erection pressing against her stomach as he moved in closer.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d she gasped, her system rioting with heat and arousal.</p><p>\u201cLike, maybe you need to be fucked as badly as I need to fuck you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m abstaining,\u201d she snapped. \u201cAnd I\u2019m changing your mind.\u201d He pressed his hips against her, and her legs nearly turned to jelly. Oh Lord, his cock was so hard, so hot, even through his slacks.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Jesse, there\u2019s something to be said for seduction. Romance. You remember the concepts. Right?\u201d she reminded him breathlessly. Surely he did. She\u2019d watched him practice it on plenty of other women.</p><p>\u201cYou want seduction, Terrie? Romance? Show me how it\u2019s done, baby. Because right now, all I can think about are the years I\u2019ve waited to touch you. And I\u2019m damned tired of being patient and waiting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As was she. But she\u2019d be damned if she would willingly fall at his feet in accordance with his highhanded attitude.</p><p>\u201cGod. Do you have to be so arrogant? And I\u2019ve been doing just fine without you so far, so just forget it.\u201d Her hands pressed against his powerful chest, but he didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cHave you been?\u201d he asked her silkily. \u201cLet me tell you what I want to do to you first, then tell me no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already heard about your little games,\u201d she told him, really angry now. \u201cDo you think Thomas wasn\u2019t more than willing to tell me about them?\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, her husband, bastard that he was, had delighted in telling her all about his older brother\u2019s sexual exploits. He had taken something he thought Jesse wanted. Had lied to her, tricked her, and had damned near destroyed her life with it.</p><p>\u201cI know Thomas told you,\u201d he said, his voice gentling, softening in a way that made her ache for him. \u201cDid he offer to let me fuck you, Terrie? Did he tell you how I wanted to tie you down, slap that perfect ass of yours, then fuck it until you screamed? Did he tell you how many times he offered to allow me the chance?\u201d</p><p>Shock washed through her body. Months after marrying her, Thomas had refused to touch her, refused to take her in any way. He had accomplished what he wanted. He had taken the woman Jesse had desired, and he never let an opportunity slip by that he didn\u2019t remind her of it. Shame coursed over her as she realized he had made Jesse aware of it as well. Had Thomas also told his brother her most betraying secret? The fact that he had overheard her telling Tally how easily she would have given into him? How much she wished she had been given the chance?</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered as she trembled against him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d she finally managed to gasp. \u201cWhat else did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWas he supposed to tell me something, Terrie?\u201d</p><p>She fought to breathe. God, this couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>\u201cLet me go.\u201d She pushed against him harder then, too angry to be surprised when he backed up. Then she gasped in shock as he grabbed her arm and hauled her into the living room.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jesse, stop manhandling me,\u201d she ordered him, furious as he spun her around before releasing her.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off,\u201d he growled, his voice darkly dangerous.</p> <p>Terrie felt her juices begin to coat her cunt lips, her breasts swelling further as his gaze flickered to them once again.</p><p>\u201cJesse, this has gone too far.\u201d She restrained the urge to do exactly what he ordered. Damn it, she shouldn\u2019t be so turned on with this dominant side of him. Her vagina shouldn\u2019t be flaming with arousal, her body desperate to have him touch her.</p><p>His hands went to his shirt. She watched, almost whimpering as he quickly pulled it from his trousers and began to unbutton it.</p><p>\u201cTake it off, or I\u2019ll rip it from you. Which suits me better. When I get you in bed I want you naked, wearing nothing but my touch.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, moisture sliding insidiously from her vagina, thick and hot, preparing her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d she whispered breathlessly as he tore the shirt from his shoulders and dropped it carelessly to the floor.</p><p>His eyes were blazing with heat now as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cTake the shirt off, Terrie,\u201d he rasped out heatedly. \u201cMake me tell you again, and I promise, you won\u2019t like the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRape?\u201d she questioned him, though she knew if he touched her, she would fall beneath him willingly.</p><p>He smiled. A slow sexy turn of his lips that had her breathing escalating.</p><p>\u201cWould it be rape, baby?\u201d he asked her with a slow, knowing drawl. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be. I think your pussy is ready to drip down your leg you\u2019re so turned on. I think you need it hard, fast and rough. And I\u2019m more than ready to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Terrie felt the blood rush through her system. Lust, hot and addictive, was like a spicy scent in the air, steaming between them. Carnal intent filled Jesse\u2019s expression and tightened every line and muscle in his body. Her quick glance to his crotch showed a bulge that made her mouth go dry. Hard, fast and rough. The words had her pussy clenching, drenching her with heated need. He had no idea just how much she did want it, need it, crave it. From him.</p><p>His hands reached out, and before she could stop him, he gripped the shirt, wrenching the material until buttons were flying in all directions and she was left bare before his gaze. Gasping, Terrie jerked back from him. Her eyes widened, her body flared with a heat so deep it terrified her.</p><p>\u201cGood God.\u201d His voice was strangled at he stared at her thighs, the bare folds of her pussy and the gold ring piercing the clit hood. \u201cSon of a bitch, Terrie. Could anything be sexier than that ring? I can\u2019t wait to see what it does for you when I get it in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her clit pulsed, her womb clenching with such force it made her breathless, terrifying her with the strength of her arousal. Before she could change her mind she ran. Dodging around him, she sprinted through the room and up the stairs, aware that he had taken off after her.</p><p>The breath was sawing desperately through her chest as she scrambled up the steps to the dubious safety of her room. She could lock herself in, run a tub of cold water and immerse herself in it. Surely that would cool the naked lust spearing through her body.</p><p>He caught her at the door. One arm manacled her waist as the other slammed the door closed behind them. Jesse held her effortlessly, ignoring her struggles as he tore the shirt from her body, then allowed her to wrench out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d She turned on him, wishing she were as furious as she was trying to be.</p><p>His lips quirked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hearing everything out of your lips but \u2018no\u2019, Terrie,\u201d he growled, his hands going to the clasp of his trousers. \u201cLet me hear you say no. Come on, baby, I dare you.\u201d</p><p>As she stared at him in shock, the rest of his clothes were disposed of. He stood before her gloriously naked, his cock standing out from his body in a hard, thick exclamation of arousal. Terrie\u2019s breath caught. He was hard-packed muscle and thick eager lust.</p><p>\u201cThis is insanity,\u201d she gasped, her breasts heaving as his gaze watched the hard-tipped mounds with sexual intensity.</p><p>She could feel the weight of the ring in her nipple and her clit, rasping against the sensitivity of each area.</p><p>\u201cNo, waiting this long was insanity,\u201d he growled. \u201cWaiting on you to forget Thomas\u2019s stupidity and to see how desperately I\u2019ve craved you was insanity. I\u2019m about to get real damned smart and do something about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want it?\u201d she questioned desperately. Like that was going to happen in this lifetime.</p><p>\u201cOh, you want it,\u201d he told her, stalking closer to her as she backed away from him uneasily. \u201cThat pretty, bare cunt of yours is glistening with how bad you want it. And I\u2019m more than happy to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was right, but damn him, he didn\u2019t have to be so sure of himself.</p><p>\u201cYou should wait until it\u2019s offered,\u201d she said, trying to sneer.</p><p>He laughed. A low, deep vibration of humor that speared through her cunt. Oh hell, she thought, she was a goner. She backed away further as he came too close, only to bump against the bed with a gasp. He stopped, inches from her, staring down at her with naked, carnal intent as he reached around her. Her eyes widened as he glanced down at the silk stockings he held in his hand. Stockings she had left there the day before after removing them.</p><p>Terrie swallowed tightly. She was afraid to know what was going through his mind at that moment.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed,\u201d he ordered her roughly.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him. The blood was rushing through her system from the chase, the arousal, the forbidden potency of his dominance.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d she snarled. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to submit to anything.</p><p>Uh oh. Satisfaction lit his eyes in a blaze of lust so intense it nearly seared her.</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d he assured her, his voice dark, sexy. \u201cBut you can never go back, Terrie. Once you get a taste of the forbidden, you\u2019ll only need more.\u201d</p><p>And he was forbidden. She stared up at him, sensual terror washing over her in waves. Could she handle him? She had always known she couldn\u2019t, so what the hell was she doing here now?</p><p>As she watched him, he turned from her abruptly, striding quickly to her dresser. Terrie\u2019s eyes widened as he started pulling out drawers, one after the other, until he found what he wanted. The breath left her body when he turned back to her, another pair of her silk stockings gripped in his hand.</p><p>She swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cGet on the bed,\u201d he ordered her again.</p><p>\u201cLike I said; make me.\u201d She braced her body for the struggle to come.</p><p>Her cunt was aflame, burning her with need. Sexual intent filled his expression\u2014dark, glittering with purpose as he stared at her, gauging her mood. Then, he smiled again.</p><p>Terrie darted away from the bed. She would be damned if she would make it easy for him. But just as she feared, there was little fight involved. His arms came around her, his heavier, muscular body controlling her easily as she struggled against him. She kicked out at him, gasping as her hands went to the hard arms encircling her waist as he wrestled her to the bed.</p><p>She cursed; Jesse only chuckled. He threw her to the bed, dodging her fists and her half-hearted kicks as he secured first one wrist then the other to the metal bars of her headboard with soft, silken ties. When he had that accomplished, he moved to her feet.</p><p>Terrie kicked at his hands, her body bouncing on the bed as she fought to keep him from securing her feet with the soft stockings before he tied the end to the bed.</p><p>When he finished, they were both breathing fast, rough, filling the room with the overwhelming scent of primitive, sexual needs. He stood back from her then, one hand going to his cock, massaging it as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this,\u201d he growled. \u201cSeeing you spread out before me, unable to fight me, unable to deny me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPervert,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNympho. You love it, Terrie. Your pussy is so hot and wet I swear I think I see steam rising from it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Terrie wouldn\u2019t doubt it. The heavy, intense ache pulsed in her clit, clenched her womb. She was so horny she felt as though she was going to disintegrate with the need.</p><p>He moved to the bed then, lying down beside her, propping his head up with one hand as he watched her. The other smoothed across her abdomen as the muscles there clenched in excitement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of this,\u201d he told her, his voice soft, throbbing with lust. \u201cEven before that stupid brother of mine fucked up, I dreamed of having you like this. Tied down, your eyes big with excitement and apprehension, the sweet scent of your arousal tempting my senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t work, Jesse.\u201d Anticipation warred with hesitancy. She had known Jesse was more man than she could handle, that his needs and his tastes could not be satisfied by her.</p><p>He liked strong, confident women. Women who could fight him, stand up to him sexually. A partner as tempestuous as he was in bed. Terrie wanted his dominance. She wanted to be made to submit to needs that even she couldn\u2019t fantasize of in full detail.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s working out just fine,\u201d he grinned down at her, his hand cupping her breast, his finger tweaking the hard nipple then making her moan helplessly as he tugged at the ring piercing it.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat as the caress speared to her cunt. Intense, fiery, that little pinch of pain nearly had her body exploding in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cUntie me. We\u2019ll call it quits here and just forget this ever happened,\u201d she gasped as his head lowered to her breast.</p><p>He halted, his eyes rising to her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, don\u2019t take me for a fool,\u201d he grinned. \u201cI have you right where I want you. I have no intentions of letting you go now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Terrie struggled against her bonds, frightened by the arousal that rose inside her as she realized she was well and truly helpless before him. As she watched in dazed fascination, his head lowered further, his tongue reaching out to lick a hard, distended nipple carefully.</p><p>\u201cYou taste good,\u201d he whispered, his lips moving against the hard point, driving her crazy with the need to have him take it into his hot mouth and suckle her strong, deep. \u201cYou need clamps for these pretty nipples. Nice and snug. Something that will drive you over the edge with the fire they start.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. Clamps? Then a sharp, surprised moan issued from her throat as his grip tightened on her nipple, his fingers tugging at the small gold ring there and his teeth worried the other. Just enough pressure to burn with an erotic flame that danced down her spine.</p><p>\u201cLike that, baby?\u201d he whispered as his head rose. \u201cA clamp would keep the pressure, make you so crazy that your sweet pussy would gush with your juices. And I\u2019d be there between your thighs, lapping up every delicious drop.\u201d</p><p>Her hips jerked, a convulsive shudder sweeping through her body at the image he induced. Watching her closely, his gaze went to the flaming curves of her cunt. Terrie watched as his eyes darkened, heated when his fingers met the thick juice that pooled between her spread thighs and coated her bare pussy. They slid through her narrow slit, circled the entrance to her vagina, then continued down to the tightly closed anal opening.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her shocked whisper had him halting, the tip of his finger stretching her tight entrance erotically.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked her, going no further, tempting her with the forbidden, sensual bite of pain his finger had produced. \u201cI want to fuck you there, Terrie. Not now, not today, but soon. I want to teach you how to prepare yourself for me, how to prepare your body for my cock tunneling into that tight little hole.\u201d</p><p>She jerked against him, whimpering as the movement of her body forced his finger marginally deeper into her ass.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jesse,\u201d she whispered, consumed by an arousal, a lust she couldn\u2019t hope to control. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t you stand, baby?\u201d he asked her with immeasurable tenderness as his finger retreated. \u201cThe thought of it, or the building need the thought of it produces?\u201d</p><p>She whimpered, shaking her head, unable to answer the question. She didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cDid Thomas tell you everything about me, Terrie? During the time you were married, did he tell you the rumors of what I like, what I want?\u201d</p><p>A woman confident enough to be as dominant as he was sexually. Oh yeah, Thomas had told her often how she could never measure up to what Jesse would need. She almost suspected that he knew how she had lusted for Jesse. The year she had been married to him had been hell.</p><p>As her gaze flickered away from his in indecision, his fingers tightened on her nipple, causing her to gasp, her body to jerk with the hot flare of sexual intensity it induced. Her gaze flew back to him.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He rewarded her with a slow, heated lick to her nipple. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want in this bed, Terrie. Obedience. No matter what I ask, no matter what I need.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up him, surprised by his declaration.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d He smiled that sexy, dangerous smile she loved so well. \u201cOh yeah, baby. I want you submitting to me in every way, in every position imaginable. I want you screaming because you need me so damned bad. I want you needing this, as much as I need to give it.\u201d Before she knew his intent, his open hand delivered a heated slap to her bare, damp cunt.</p><p>Terrie was shocked, frightened by a sharp, lust-born moan of pleasure that escaped her throat as the stinging blow vibrated through her body.</p><p>\u201cJesse...\u201d She couldn\u2019t say no, though she sure as hell didn\u2019t know if she could bear it.</p><p>\u201cLike that, baby?\u201d he asked sensually as his hand raised again.</p><p>Terrie watched now, her eyes wide, dazed as the hand fell.</p><p>\u201cOh God...\u201d She jerked when the heat came, delivered directly over her pulsing clit, throwing it into shocked, dangerous need.</p> <p>Her breath caught at the warning flare of release from the blow. Why was he doing this? Was he taunting her? Mocking her shameful needs in some way?</p><p>\u201cGod, look at you,\u201d he growled, lust thickening his voice as he stared down at her in suspended pleasure. \u201cYou\u2019re flushed and aroused, your expression so confused, so filled with need. You like it don\u2019t you, baby? I knew you would.\u201d</p><p>Another blow landed, burning her, causing her hips to jerk in response, and her juices to slide furiously from her vagina as her clit swelled in response to the sharp pleasure/pain. She was going to orgasm. Oh God, if he smacked her like that just one more time...</p><p>She exploded when the blow fell again. Her cunt flamed from the sensual pain, her vagina pulsing as her clit exploded in a firestorm of destructive heat. It raced up her spine, through her womb, shuddering through her body, flaming through her veins as she cried out in shameful pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d his voice growled from a distance. \u201cOh hell, Terrie, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>He moved over her body then as his lips lowered to hers. She took his kiss and fought for more. Her lips opened for his tongue, hers twining with it, stroking, tasting the heat of his mouth as he moved between her thighs. His hands weren\u2019t still either. They cupped her breasts, tweaked her nipples with heated pressure and had her hanging on an edge of such desperate pleasure she wondered if she would survive it.</p><p>She was bucking against his body, twisting closer, needing more of his heat, his carnal promise. Lust was like a demon that possessed her now, filled her with erotic images, destroying her body with the sensual pleasure washing over it.</p><p>Finally, he tore his lips from hers, staring down at her, his eyes almost black with emotion and lust as she felt the broad head of his erection touch her slick, cream-coated cunt.</p><p>Terrie stilled, her arms straining at her bonds as she watched him in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cSlow and easy first,\u201d he growled.</p><p>He pressed against the soft folds of her pussy, the broad head of his cock parting them, sliding against them as he paused at her vaginal entrance. He was hot and thick, tempting her, teasing her with the invasion to come. His hand reached down, moving his shaft against the sensitive flesh, running it through the thick cream that coated her.</p><p>\u201cJesse.\u201d She couldn\u2019t halt the plea that escaped her lips.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her, but she felt her breath whoosh from her throat as his cock nudged into the entrance. She could feel him parting her, stretching her already. It had been so long since she had known the touch of a man. She hadn\u2019t had sex with Thomas since just a few months after their marriage. She knew she would be tight, and his cock was broad, and more than willing to stretch the sensitive tissue there.</p><p>He pressed in tighter, retreated, then worked the head of his shaft into her again. He repeated the sensual movements, parting her greedy flesh, stretching her as she groaned and arched into the invasion.</p><p>\u201cSo hot and tight,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to enjoy each minute it takes to work my cock into you to the hilt, Terrie.\u201d His words had her cunt clenching on the bulging head of his erection. \u201cOh yeah, baby, clench that sweet cunt on me. Fight it. Make it better, Terrie. So much better.\u201d</p><p>His expression was a tight grimace of pleasure as he worked against the further tightening. She did as he bid, tightening on him, milking his cock as he worked another inch inside her. It was the most erotic act she had ever endured. Fighting the invasion of his hot lance as he forced his way in further.</p><p>Her hips jerked, bucked, her pussy rained its moisture over him, heating them, creating a gliding friction that was making her insane. His hands tightened on her hips, his muscles tightening as she watched through eyes half closed. His control was slipping. She could feel it. She tightened her muscles on him again, straining to force him out when everything inside her wanted him deeper.</p><p>The sensual lash of heated pressure inside her vagina was killing her. A sharp burning bite as he pressed in deeper, not even half his cock had worked its way inside her. Her thighs strained as she fought the entrance, her cries whispering past her throat now as the pleasure rocked her body.</p><p>His hands clenched on her hips, perspiration glistening on his flesh as he gritted his teeth. She rolled her hips against the hard, straining penis that rocked inside her.</p><p>Her scream shattered the thick, sensually charged atmosphere as his control snapped. He thrust hard and heavy inside her, burying his cock to the hilt as her muscles quivered around him, tightened and fought to accept the broad length suddenly filling it.</p><p>Terrie felt the warning tremors of her climax pulsing in her vagina. The hot, hard burn, the pinch of pain. The flaring intensity of the pleasure was too much for her body to fight against. The hard, milking contractions on his cock were too much for Jesse to fight.</p><p>His elbows were braced at her shoulders as his hips began to move. His shaft retreated, only to return in a heavy, invading thrust that had her arching to him, twisting against him. Her body was no longer her own, but was controlled only by the hard, driving thrusts that rocked her, filled her world with a pleasure she knew would destroy her.</p><p>Deep, penetrating, stretching her to her limits, his cock thrust in and out, driving her to a pinnacle of such unbelievable pleasure she was screaming out for her release. Fire assailed her quaking pussy, tightened it, milked his cock until she exploded with such intensity that she couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t fight the mind-boggling sensations as her orgasm raced through her body.</p><p>She was distantly aware of Jesse lunging powerfully inside her again and again, then his cry joined hers. She felt another rippling climax tear through her as she felt the hot, hard blasts of his semen spurting inside her gripping flesh.</p><p>His lips were at her neck, caressing her flesh, hard male growls of pleasure echoing in her ears as he shuddered over her. Pulsing mini-explosions rippled over her body, through her cunt, as she trembled through the last of her powerful climax.</p><p>She was gasping for breath now, her flesh sensitized, covered with an invisible film of ultra-sensitive nerve endings that caused her body to shudder with each ragged breath that pressed her tighter against him. Weak, spent, she collapsed long moments later, dazed and uncertain as she never had been in her life.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>What had he done? Jesse lifted himself from Terrie\u2019s spent, damp body and moved gingerly to her side as he stared down at her. Her eyes were closed, her breathing still hard, heavy. The little gold ring at her nipple trembled as she shuddered again.</p><p>Jesse sighed in self-disgust as he moved to release her from the silken bonds he had tied her with. He had lost his mind and his control, something he had never done before. The minute he had seen her eyes flash with heat, her nipples poking against his shirt, all common sense had fled. He had taken her with few preliminaries. So intent on sinking his cock inside her that nothing else had mattered.</p><p>He had broken one of his own strongest rules. Complete agreement. Complete surrender and submission from her. Complete control from him. He had taken her hard, hot, without control, reveling in her heated struggles and the hot lust in her eyes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move as he released her, but her eyes opened the barest bit as she watched him untie her feet. He kept a careful eye on those feet. They could be lethal when she was pissed. And she had every reason to be pissed.</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d He stared down at her, wondering if, despite the pleasure, he had just made the biggest mistake of his life.</p><p>She arched her brow. The slow, deliberately mocking move had him carefully hiding a wince. He moved back from the end of the bed carefully as her legs shifted lazily.</p><p>\u201cYou have got to be the least romantic man I have ever laid my eyes on,\u201d she sighed. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to go to work or something? I want to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI took the morning off.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She frowned at him. Jesse had a feeling she was well aware of the fact that he was trying to figure out just how pissed she was. She was deliberately keeping her expression only mildly curious, giving him no hint to her feelings.</p><p>His gaze flickered over her nude body. The delicate rings piercing her flesh entranced him. Only then did he notice the one piercing the skin of her belly button as well.</p><p>\u201cWhen in the hell did you get those piercings done?\u201d He fought the need to cover her body and take her again, then and there.</p> <p>His cock was so hard it pulsed in agony.</p><p>\u201cAbout a month after I got the tattoo.\u201d She shrugged carelessly.</p><p>His eyes went over her body again. He didn\u2019t see a tattoo.</p><p>\u201cWhat tattoo?\u201d He was instantly wary of the wicked glint in her eyes.</p><p>She turned over, slowly. His eyes widened. It stretched across her back. A delicate intricate vine and two graceful, open flowers just above the full globes of her buttocks.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like?\u201d She turned her head, flexing the muscles of her ass temptingly.</p><p>Jesse felt perspiration dot his forehead. His cock was screaming for action, his hands itching to clench those tight little globes, to separate them. He shook his head, fighting for control.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he finally asked as he fought to breathe.</p><p>She turned back over, watching him carefully.</p><p>\u201cTally dared me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his gaze now centered on the glistening ring at her clit. He moved closer to the bed, his mouth watering, the need to taste her nearly overwhelming.</p> <p>\u201cTally?\u201d he asked, wondering what the hell his secretary could have to do with this.</p><p>\u201cYes. Tally. Tally Raines.\u201d The name slid through his mind with dawning horror. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends forever.\u201d</p><p>He nearly lost his erection. \u201cShe\u2019s evil,\u201d he burst out, shaking his head as he thought of the wily, sarcastic-tongued little shrew that ruled the offices at Delacourte Electronics.</p><p>\u201cEvil?\u201d She tilted her head, smirking at him. \u201cYou\u2019re just mad because she doesn\u2019t kiss your ass and makes you do your own filing.\u201d</p><p>He was not going to spend the rest of the morning arguing over the sharp-tongued dragon he had made the mistake of hiring last year. As soon as possible, she would be transferring to another office anyway. He\u2019d be damned if he would have someone in his office who could out-yell him. And damned if she couldn\u2019t do it.</p><p>\u201cStay away from Tally,\u201d he growled. \u201cShe\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his clothes, dressing quickly. If he didn\u2019t get out of the bedroom he was going to lose control again. He had to figure out what the hell had happened to his control before he even considered touching her again.</p><p>She lay there on the bed. Calm. Cool. Her hazel eyes quizzical as she watched him pull his clothes on. She didn\u2019t say anything, and he\u2019d be damned if he knew what to say at this point.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you this evening,\u201d he said as he tucked his shirt into his pants, glancing at her, his temper building as she watched him so calmly. She should be furious. Screaming, cursing and threatening him until hell wouldn\u2019t have him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d She finally shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for anything, Jesse. You started this, if you\u2019ll remember. Not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell I did,\u201d he snapped as he strode back to the bed and pulled her from it as she gasped in surprise.</p><p>He had her in his arms, her gaze widening, her perfect lips parting on a gasp.</p><p>\u201cJesse,\u201d she cried out, arousal and surprise vying in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYou started this the other night, Terrie,\u201d he reminded her brutally as he fought the lust pounding through his veins. \u201cI told you not to push me. Not to provoke something you couldn\u2019t handle. Now I would suggest, for the time being, you stop pushing or we may both come to regret it.\u201d</p><p>Before she could let loose with the fury of words he could see building in her expression, his lips slammed down on hers, parting them. Her tongue meeting his halfway as he pushed it past the seam of her lips. He groaned, arching her closer into his body as he ate at her, licking at her, savoring the taste of her.</p><p>They were both breathing hard when he pulled back. He knew he was damned near as dazed as she looked and once again his body shuddered as he fought for control.</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d He was breathing hard as he set her carefully away from him. \u201cI\u2019ll call you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He left the room before he lost all sanity. He was within seconds of throwing her back to the bed and fucking her again with a driving hunger he felt would never be sated. A hunger he had never known for another woman.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cTally, hold all calls. I\u2019m unavailable until after lunch.\u201d Jesse entered the outer office, his eyes narrowing on the sardonic expression his secretary held.</p><p>Tally Raines was an unholy terror as far as he was concerned. The curvy, haughtily aloof Filipino watched him with what he was terribly certain was a knowing expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to do that,\u201d she drawled, her cultured voice filled with amused patience. \u201cWould you like coffee, sir?\u201d</p><p>He paused at his office door and glanced back at her, his eyes narrowing as she watched him with superior female indulgence.</p><p>\u201cCoffee, please,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cThen get me the Conover contract so I can go over it before sending it to James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on your desk.\u201d She rose gracefully from her chair, long black hair rippling down the back of her white silk blouse to touch her shapely hips. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, no more body piercings for Terrie, he thought with a flash of temper that he tamped down. Dammit, the woman was a menace.</p><p>\u201cNothing else,\u201d he finally growled. \u201cBring the coffee as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d She sounded mildly surprised that he would think she would delay.</p><p>Jesse figured he might get the coffee before he left the office that evening. He grunted rudely, jerking the door open, and entered his own office. Now he knew why she drove him crazy. Terrie had to be giving her lessons.</p><p>He grimaced as he took his seat behind his desk and flipped open the file waiting on him. Lucian Conover was an old friend; part of the exclusive group that had begun back in college. Not that any of them had been moronic enough to name the group. He did know he had broken one of the cardinal rules, though. Control. Complete control. Only her pleasure mattered. Only her complete, mindless surrender to the pleasure was the goal. Not his.</p><p>He pushed his fingers wearily through his hair, frowning down at the papers before him as he fought to make sense of what had happened. Fought to try to at least understand how he had managed to land himself in this predicament. Never in his entire adult life, certainly not since admitting to himself the extreme pleasure he gained from his sexual lifestyle, had he lost control like this.</p><p>\u201cOh dear. Did you find a problem with the contracts?\u201d Tally\u2019s smooth voice cut through his musings as she set the steaming cup of coffee at the side of the desk.</p><p>\u201cContracts are fine.\u201d He lifted the edge of the paper he was staring down at. \u201cThank you for the coffee, Tally. I\u2019ll call you if I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have messages.\u201d Her voice was insistent.</p><p>Jesse lifted his head, turning it until he could gaze up at her with level patience. Dealing with Tally demanded patience.</p><p>Her dark brown eyes danced with amusement, her lips tilting into a smirk that had him narrowing his eyes in suspicion.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked her carefully.</p><p>\u201cMessages.\u201d She laid the papers beside the cup of coffee, still watching him, the smirk firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou can go now, Tally.\u201d</p><p>She sighed with exaggerated patience. \u201cVery well. But might I suggest a shower, Mr. Wyman? The smell of sex is lingering. And since some of us are doing without at the present, we don\u2019t like being reminded.\u201d</p><p>She sauntered from the room. Jesse watched her leave, restraining the urge to bare his teeth in temperamental frustration. Dammit. He leaned back in the chair heavily, closing his eyes, fighting his need to stalk from the office and return to the object of his frustration. He knew years ago Terrie would drive him insane. She was now proving his fears as fact. And his cock was proving to be a very willing sacrifice to breakdown. Even now it throbbed in demand, in explicit, mounting excitement at the thought of touching her again.</p><p>Control. His jaw clenched as he fought for it. Control. His fist tightened as he returned to the file. Son of a bitch. He sighed wearily as the words blurred and once again he fought to understand his own weakness.</p><p>\u201cOh Terrie, you are such a bad girl.\u201d Tally stepped into the house as Terrie stood back and welcomed her in.</p><p>Her brown eyes, usually cool and mocking, were filled with warmth and humor as Terrie shook her head wearily.</p><p>\u201cI know he didn\u2019t tell you. By the way, he thinks you\u2019re evil,\u201d Terrie informed her as she closed the door and led the way into the living room. \u201cSo how did you figure it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Tally mused. \u201cIt could have been the lingering smell of sex, and Giorgio\u2019s Red was unmistakable. He should have showered before coming in,\u201d she pouted. \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex in months, Terrie. I don\u2019t like being reminded.\u201d</p><p>Terrie flushed, though she couldn\u2019t help the laughter that welled from her lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to let him know,\u201d she promised her friend lightly.</p><p>Tally shrugged. \u201cNo problem, dear, I already have.\u201d She sat down in the high-backed chair across from the couch and lifted a dark brow curiously. \u201cNow come, give Tally all the dirty details. Was he positively sinful?\u201d</p><p>Terrie collapsed back on the couch.</p><p>\u201cHe was sinful,\u201d she sighed. \u201cAnd very upset for some reason.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get his reaction out of her mind. It was unlike Jesse to appear less than confident. Yet, for some reason, that impression had nagged at her brain. As though something about the act had bothered him more than he let on.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Yes, he was quite out of sorts when he came into the office,\u201d Tally laughed in sheer delight. \u201cYou should have seen him trying to pretend to read that contract he had in front of him. But his expression was just dazed. I loved it.\u201d</p><p>Terrie shook her head at her friend, but couldn\u2019t hold her own laughter back. There was no one as dryly mocking as Tally could be. Her amusement and general outlook on life never failed to keep Terrie laughing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do now, Tally,\u201d she finally sighed as she leaned back on the couch. \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t please him?\u201d It was her biggest fear.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you blew his ever loving mind,\u201d Tally chuckled. \u201cHis nerves are fried, his preconceived notions have flown out the window, and the man is scrambling to figure out what the hell happened. I would say you were the best he\u2019s ever had.\u201d</p><p>Terrie bit her lip. Yeah, he seemed pretty damned confused when he rushed from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cYou know what he\u2019ll do next,\u201d Tally warned her. \u201cIf he brings Lucian with him, at least videotape it so I can watch.\u201d</p><p>Terrie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cVideotape?\u201d she gasped. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d Tally waved her hand negligently. \u201cAt least I\u2019m not asking to participate.\u201d</p><p>Terrie stilled, then blinked. The object was to throw Jesse into overload. To show him she could meet him more than halfway. What if she... It would never work. Would it?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d Tally asked her, laughter heavy in her voice. \u201cOh, I just love it when you plot. You\u2019re almost as good as I am.\u201d</p><p>She watched her friend closely. Was Tally really as adventurous as she swore she was?</p><p>\u201cParticipation,\u201d Terrie whispered. \u201cTurning the tables on Jesse.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tally\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cOh Terrie,\u201d she exclaimed gleefully. \u201cYou\u2019re learning. You\u2019re learning. Tell me what you\u2019re planning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesse likes to share his women.\u201d Terrie fought the racing of her heart. \u201cWhat if I sort of share Jesse? What would he do?\u201d</p><p>Tally was obviously shocked. \u201cShare him?\u201d she said slowly. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d She lifted her brows suggestively, leaning forward. \u201cI\u2019ll tie him down, somehow. Like he did me. Then you can...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Tally questioned with mocking surprise. \u201cHold up here. We never said me, Terrie. Jesse is not my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither is Lucian, but I notice you can\u2019t help but pant around him. Come on, Tally. Who else could I trust?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to fuck him. Just help me torture him. That\u2019s all. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust torture him?\u201d She lifted her eyebrows consideringly. \u201cNothing else. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. Nothing else.\u201d Terrie could never tolerate anything else.</p><p>Tally smirked. Her fingernails tapped out a fierce little rhythm on the arms of the chair as she watched Terrie closely. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>Terrie swallowed nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Soon.\u201d</p><p>Terrie watched the cool, almost feline look that crossed her friend\u2019s face. \u201cThis weekend. I need time to prepare,\u201d Tally sighed. \u201cThese things must be planned, Terrie. Until then, you can drive him insane some more. Keep doing things that throw him off balance. Give him a blowjob under his desk. That drives those executive types crazy. Don\u2019t let him get the best of you. The minute he does, he\u2019ll regain control and it will all be over with. Stay in control, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn control.\u201d Terrie nodded. God, what the hell was she doing?</p><p>Tally rose to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll help, of course.\u201d She smiled with slow pleasure and for just a moment, Terrie wondered at the look of gleeful anticipation in her friend\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cTally, you scare me,\u201d she sighed, not for the first time. \u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged her slender shoulders negligently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, sunshine, Auntie Tally will take care of everything.\u201d Then she narrowed her eyes. \u201cDo you need another piercing?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Keep him off guard. Keep him off guard. Terrie repeated the words as she breezed through Jesse\u2019s outer office the next day. She ignored Tally\u2019s, \u201cGo get \u2018em tiger,\u201d and entered the office as though it were her own.</p><p>Jesse raised his head from a file and his instant response nearly had her pausing. His eyes darkened as he took in the vee cut, button-down, white silk slip dress and strappy sandals she wore.</p><p>\u201cTerrie?\u201d He watched her cautiously as she moved around the desk and stared down at him with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t show up for coffee this morning,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd I was up waiting on you. Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to get up at the crack of dawn, Jesse?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched in amusement. \u201cI did call, baby,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer so I left a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour excuse was flimsy.\u201d She propped her hands on her hips, deliberately allowing her breasts to swell above the top of the dress. \u201cCome on, Jesse. You never get up late.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned back in his chair, his eyes riveted on the swelling mounds. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to sleep until late.\u201d He cleared his throat then swallowed tightly. \u201cI was going to stop by this evening. I know I left the message.\u201d</p><p>Terrie snorted. She got the message. \u201cBe ready, baby. We have plans,\u201d she repeated for him. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jesse. You just knew that one would work for me,\u201d she assured him sarcastically, barely retraining the urge to roll her eyes.</p><p>She moved to prop her hip on his desk as Jesse moved to touch her. Her nerves and his movements, combined, had her jostling the nearby penholder and knocking it over. Pens scattered across the desktop.</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d Some of the pens rolled off the desk and she bent to try to retrieve them. \u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d she promised softly, suggestively as two bounced from his knee to the carpet beneath the desk.</p><p>Jesse jerked in response as her hand braced on his knee and she bent to retrieve the pens. Damn her, no bra. He drew in a deep breath as her head disappeared under the desk.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Jesse.\u201d The office door opened at the same time she worked herself beneath the desk. Lucian Conover walked quickly into the room, the door slamming behind him. \u201cThat viperous little shrew working the desk outside swore you weren\u2019t even here. I knew that was your car outside.\u201d</p><p>Jesse stilled. Terrie moved beneath the desk. A sinuous ripple of her body against his leg nearly had him trembling in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI have to work sometime, Lucian.\u201d He shrugged as he leaned back in his chair. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>He felt Terrie\u2019s hand move up his ankle. God, she wouldn\u2019t. He drew in a deep breath, knowing he had never imagined his delicate little temptress daring something this sensual, this quickly.</p><p>\u201cI need those cost estimates on that new chip your boys are working on. It was supposed to be in my office yesterday,\u201d Lucian sighed as he sat down in one of the plush chairs in front of the desk. \u201cBesides, I wanted to talk to you about that pretty little sister-in-law of yours.\u201d</p><p>Jesse frowned. Beneath the desk Terrie\u2019s hand stilled at his knee for just a second. She shifted silently then and he blinked as he felt her teeth nip the flesh above his knee.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Lucian, I\u2019m busy.\u201d He fought to keep his voice calm, even.</p><p>Her hands were creeping up his thighs, her nails scraping through the silk of his slacks as she neared the engorged length of his cock. Son of a bitch. She was going to do it.</p><p>\u201cOh hell, don\u2019t get possessive on me.\u201d Lucian frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty little thing, Jesse. Don\u2019t tell me you haven\u2019t fucked her yet.\u201d</p><p>His belt came free.</p><p>\u201cLucian, Terrie isn\u2019t up for discussion,\u201d he growled.</p><p>The blood was rushing through his body, throbbing in his cock. The thought of fucking Terrie was killing him.</p><p>\u201cDammit, are you stalking her yourself?\u201d the other man questioned impatiently. \u201cCome on, Jesse, she\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d Jesse growled as he felt his slacks loosen. Terrie had managed to slide the zipper down without a sound.</p><p>He felt perspiration gather on his forehead. This would kill him. Her hands were warm, inquisitive, as they worked the panel at the front of his briefs to free his straining flesh. Damn. He would have a stroke before she ever freed him. The sensation of her fingers moving against his sensitive cock was nearly more than he could bear. Her nails scraped the shaft, sending a firestorm of electrical impulses up his spine as he fought to keep from shuddering in pleasure. Hell, he wished Lucian would just get the hell out of the office.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly what?\u201d Lucian frowned. \u201cNot hardly stalking her, or she\u2019s not hardly family?\u201d</p><p>Her tongue twirled around the head of his erection. He gritted his teeth, his hands clenching on the arms of his chair as the moist caress stole his breath. God, she was killing him.</p><p>\u201cJesse, are you okay?\u201d Lucian frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re acting damned strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong day.\u201d Jesse fought to keep his voice even, his gaze flickering to his lap where Terrie had laid her head against his thigh, her little pink tongue licking the shaft of his cock like it was some kind of living lollipop.</p><p>\u201cLong day?\u201d Lucian\u2019s startled question had Jesse staring back up at him, dazed. \u201cDammit, Jesse, it\u2019s barely afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Jesse moved his hand to Terrie\u2019s soft hair, clenching in the silken strands as her mouth covered the bulging head of his erection. Damn it, he was not going to come while he was fighting so hard to hide what she was doing to him. Not that he cared if the other man knew, but he was afraid she did.</p><p>\u201cLucian, let me call you later,\u201d he growled as the wet heat of her mouth began to move over the head of his cock. \u201cI\u2019ll have the estimates for you then.\u201d</p><p>Terrie decided that was the time to try to swallow his cock. She suckled him deep and slow, her tongue flickering along the sensitive underside like an erotic whip. At the same time, Lucian\u2019s gaze fell to the floor and his eyes widened in surprise at something he obviously glimpsed through the inch-wide crack between the floor and the desk backing.</p><p>Lucian sat back in his chair with a wicked grin as Jesse fought to keep from cursing. Hell, he just hoped Lucian didn\u2019t decide to ruin it for him. This was the most incredibly sensual thing he had ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cSo have you decided if you\u2019re stalking her or not?\u201d Lucian suddenly asked as he watched Jesse carefully. \u201cWould be good to know before I try to fuck her myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Luc,\u201d he cursed roughly. But he felt Terrie shiver. Her mouth tightened on his cock, her tongue stroking him with quick little darts that were driving him crazy.</p><p>\u201cGuess you are.\u201d Lucian came to his feet reluctantly. \u201cHell, let me know if you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d Jesse was almost panting as Terrie sucked his cock slow and easy. It was the sweetest torture he could imagine.</p><p>He ignored Lucian as he left the room, his gaze going to his lap, watching as his cock disappeared in and out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, baby,\u201d he whispered, his voice rough. \u201cJust like that. Suck it slow and easy. Just like I intend to fuck you. Slow and easy, baby.\u201d</p><p>She slurped on his flesh, a soft moan breaking from her throat as his fingers tightened in her hair.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he growled, feeling her shudder as he spoke to her. Did she like the words, he wondered? Was that what made her tremble each time he spoke? \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, baby, your mouth wrapped around my cock, sucking me.\u201d</p><p>She moaned deeply as he spoke, her hand going to her own breast, her fingers plucking at her nipple. God, he wanted to do that for her. Wanted to pull at those pretty hard points. Watch them darken, harden further.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when I come in your mouth, Terrie?\u201d he asked her. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to be over? Do you think you\u2019ll just walk away as though it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d</p><p>She moaned. The bulging head of his cock was caressed, tortured, as his words spurred her on. Her lips stretched around it, her eyes closed, her expression dazed as she gave him the best blowjob he had known in his life.</p><p>\u201cYeah, suck it harder, baby,\u201d he whispered as she began to do just that. \u201cI\u2019ll fill your mouth, then I\u2019ll fill that tight pussy of yours, Terrie. I\u2019m going to fuck you so hard you\u2019ll scream for me.\u201d</p><p>He was fucking her mouth now. Her hands gripped his cock as she moaned around his flesh, licking him, suckling at him as he fucked her, his cock tightening, throbbing. His hands clenched around the strands of hair he held captive, holding her in place, watching her glistening mouth take him with each stroke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come, Terrie.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stand it. His body was alive for a change, his cock so sensitive, so desperate for release he was burning alive. It was one of his greatest fantasies, his greatest needs. Terrie, kneeling before him, moaning for him, her body hot and receptive. God help him, he loved her.</p><p>His hips arched, his cock pressing to her throat as he felt his release wash over him. Lightning shot through his scrotum, up his spine, arching his body as the first pulse of his seed shot into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cTake it all,\u201d he whispered breathlessly as he felt her swallow, felt her tongue dance over the exploding tip as he shot into her mouth again. Then again. And still he was hard. Pulsing. He fucked against her lips, panting for breath before he reached down and dragged her from beneath the desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBad girl,\u201d he accused her softly as she stared at him in surprise. \u201cThat was very bad, Terrie. Let\u2019s see what kind of punishment we can come up with for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes widened as he jerked her over his lap, holding her down on his legs as she struggled weakly against him.</p><p>Jesse jerked her skirt above her buttocks, grimacing at the sight of the bare globes he revealed.</p> <p>\u201cJesse, have you gone crazy? Oh my God!\u201d she sang out as his hand connected sharply with the first rounded curve.</p><p>She stilled, her breathing heavy, hard.</p><p>\u201cCan you still taste my come in your mouth, baby?\u201d He smoothed his hand over the reddened flesh.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice broke when his finger ran down the cleft of her ass.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He paused at the stretched, filled little hole of her rectum. The base of the plug she wore was heated, warm from her body. The ultra-soft, jelly material stretched her ass, filling her, making his cock twitch in jealousy.</p> <p>He smacked her ass again. She flinched, crying out in startled awareness at the bite of pain.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, only I can fill your ass.\u201d He smacked her again to reinforce the order. \u201cSeduction is over, Terrie. Now the fun begins.\u201d</p><p>He watched the cheeks of her ass redden as he delivered several more stinging slaps. She writhed beneath him, crying out in pleasure as he spanked her with erotic heat. She was twisting on his lap, her buttocks lifting imploringly when he stilled.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t resist. He was too weak, he thought. She was supposed to seduce him. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be this easy. He pulled the plug free of her anus, watching the stretching of the little hole, his eyes narrowing as she whimpered at the retreating pleasure. Just as slowly he pushed it back into her, feeling her shudder in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you, Terrie,\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you so hard, so deep, you\u2019ll never forget what it\u2019s like to have me fill you.\u201d</p><p>He ripped the small thong from her, tossing the scraps to the floor as he jerked her up then pushed her back on the desk. He spread her legs, moving between them before he paused, his eyes widening as he caught sight of the little hoop framing her swollen clit.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He lost his breath.</p><p>Her cunt was perfectly bare, smooth and glistening with her juices. The little bright gold hoop piercing the hood of her clit was so sexy, so erotic he nearly came then and there from the sight of it alone.</p><p>He was within seconds of pressing his engorged cock home when a heavy knocking at the office door had them both scrambling away from the desk. Dammit. Why hadn\u2019t he had Lucian lock the fucking door?</p><p>He hurriedly fixed his slacks, glancing at Terrie as she smoothed the dress nervously over her hips. At least she could hide the damned proof of what nearly happened. He sat down heavily in his chair to hide the telltale tenting of his slacks as the door pushed open.</p><p>\u201cMr. Wyman, Mr. Delacourte needs you upstairs.\u201d Tally stepped into the office, her expression perfectly bland as Terrie fidgeted by his side. \u201cHe said to tell you they have the Conover chip ready, but there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>There was a problem all right, and it wasn\u2019t with a chip. He glanced from Terrie, back to Tally, then moved carefully from behind the desk. He had talked to Jase hours ago, though he hadn\u2019t gone through Tally to do so. That damned chip was fine. What were those two up to?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d He turned to Terrie, watching her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAlone, Jesse,\u201d she murmured firmly. \u201cTonight. Alone.\u201d</p> <p>He watched her carefully for long moments. \u201cAlone.\u201d He nodded shortly then moved quickly from the office. Damned women. They were up to something. The question was, what?</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>She could pull this off, Terrie assured herself as she prepared the bedroom for Jesse\u2019s arrival. She knew they would make it to the bedroom. At least, she hoped they did. She drew in a hard breath, checked her appearance for at least the tenth time, and tried to still her nerves. She had never attempted anything this brave without a drink first. There was something to be said for false courage.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying.\u201d Tally moved into the room from the bathroom. \u201cJust get him in here and the rest will work out.\u201d</p><p>Tally was dressed in form-hugging black. She looked like a cat burglar. Terrie couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes before her nerves got the best of her again.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t go along with it?\u201d She pushed her fingers restlessly through her hair. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s furious, Tally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he can\u2019t cry foul when you won\u2019t.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cTurn about and all that, darling. Besides, Jesse isn\u2019t going to be furious. He\u2019ll be intrigued at first. Wondering how far you\u2019ll go. Won\u2019t he be surprised?\u201d</p><p>She could tell Tally was trying her best not to crack up with laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou are finding this much too amusing, Tally,\u201d Terrie sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this is going to work.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the bed and shook her head wearily. Why was she doing this? It wasn\u2019t the first time she had asked herself this question. She knew, when it came right down to it, that anything Jesse wanted she would give him willingly. She had known it years ago. She knew it now.</p><p>She also knew, though, that no one had given to Jesse in the same manner. Through the years she had known him, watched him as he gave unselfishly of himself. Always. To Thomas, it had been money. The only thing Thomas had ever cared about. For his twin, James, it was his support, continually, no matter where or when. It was the same for her, for his friends. Often, no one had to even ask. If Jesse knew there was need, then Jesse gave.</p><p>Just giving herself to him didn\u2019t seem to be enough. She wanted to give to him in the same ways she knew he would give to her. His pleasure alone. A fantasy she knew he had never had. Dominant, alpha Jesse would have never allowed himself to be tied down, giving his control to two women. That was his territory. He bestowed the pleasure; he never selfishly took. And she had been allowing it for as long as she had known him. She had taken all he gave her, never questioning why, never wondering at his needs. Was it really so bad?</p><p>She knew it didn\u2019t happen often. That even in Tess and Cole\u2019s relationship it had only happened a handful of times. Just as she knew Jesse would never go back to Tess now. What happened, she wondered, as each of the group married? Why, when it was so imperative before the marriage, did that need to share their women ease later in the relationship? At first she had been unaware it did, until Jesse had brought up the subject months before.</p><p>I guess that need just isn\u2019t there, he had said, shrugging. Love changes things, Terrie. It changes a lot. But that doesn\u2019t mean I wouldn\u2019t want the woman I love to know that side of me. Or to miss out on that particular pleasure. It\u2019s a part of who I am.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t understood it at the time. Hell, she didn\u2019t know if she understood it now. Why would it change? And why, as she thought about it, did she want to give Jesse that brand of pleasure herself in a small way? A sexual, intensely erotic gift that there was no way in hell she would ever repeat.</p><p>She had thought it was to turn the tables on him. Had convinced herself it was. But it wasn\u2019t really. She wanted Jesse to know she accepted him. To know she knew him. To know she understood. And she wanted to give him a gift that she knew no one else ever had.</p><p>\u201cTerrie,\u201d Tally sighed as she sat down beside her. \u201cJesse isn\u2019t a serious thing for me. But you\u2019re my friend. I promise you, when he gets here and we start this, I will take good care of your man and your friendship.\u201d</p><p>Terrie looked at her friend silently. Tally sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Jesse physically, Terrie. You know this. But I know what you want for him. We\u2019re friends, and I want your happiness above anything. So I want to help you do this.\u201d</p><p>Terrie tilted her head, watching the other woman closely. For once, Tally\u2019s dark gaze held no mockery, no laughter.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder Jesse doesn\u2019t ever know what to make of you,\u201d she whispered softly. \u201cYou\u2019re like him, Tally. Unselfish...\u201d</p><p>Tally snorted as she rose quickly to her feet. \u201cNo way, Terrie. I\u2019m very selfish. When we\u2019re done, you\u2019re helping me get that job at Conover\u2019s. Your man is a lousy boss. Hell, he caught onto his own filing as though he\u2019s supposed to do it himself,\u201d she grunted. \u201cSo never fear, it comes with a price.\u201d</p><p>Terrie hid her smile. She had never known what a true friend she had. But she did now. The nights Tally had forced her out of the house, getting her drunk, tattooed, pierced. Terrie remembered those bleak days clearly. Days when she had fought to make sense of her life, and who she was. Days she had wondered if Thomas had been right. If she was truly less of a woman than she had ever believed. Never enough woman for a man like Jesse.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we can do this,\u201d she announced. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here in less than an hour. I\u2019ll get him in the handcuffs, but he\u2019s going to be pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will.\u201d Tally smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part.\u201d She rubbed her hands together with mocking eagerness. \u201cCan we blindfold him?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Terrie was waiting for Jesse when he stepped slowly into the bedroom. The house was dark, lit only by the candles that showed the way from the front door, up the stairs and into her room. The bedroom was lit by dozens of the small scented candles, casting his expression in shadow. But she caught a glimpse of his somber expression as he stepped into the room.</p><p>Tally was waiting on the screened-in back porch, watching for the bedroom light to flicker. The sign that she could enter. What Terrie had to say to Jesse, she wanted no one else to hear.</p><p>She watched as he pushed his hands into his slacks\u2019 pockets, watching her carefully, his green eyes quiet, reflective as she sat on the bed, dressed only in the short silk gown she had donned.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I have a feeling you want to talk first?\u201d he quipped almost too seriously.</p><p>\u201cBecause you know me that well,\u201d she said softly, watching him a bit sadly. \u201cYou always have. Even when I was too young to know what it meant. And when I was too stupid to accept what it was.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against her dresser, watching her quietly. Terrie felt her chest tighten at the flood of emotion that washed over her. He was so strong, even now, as he watched her uncertainly, his eyes brilliant with all the emotions she had never realized were there before.</p><p>\u201cYou were never stupid, Terrie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cFrightened. Innocent...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd too stupid to know what I was feeling or what I wanted,\u201d she finished for him. \u201cI love you, Jesse. I always have loved you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, his expression brooding, intense. \u201cI know that, Terrie. I always knew that.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. He wasn\u2019t lying. She could see just how very serious he was.</p><p>\u201cAnd you love me,\u201d she whispered, fighting her tears. \u201cYou loved me, before Thomas.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out roughly. \u201cBefore Thomas, during Thomas, now,\u201d he growled. \u201cLove doesn\u2019t just turn off, Terrie. What do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>It was there in his voice. Husky, controlled, endearingly honest. If there was one thing she knew about Jesse, it was that he would never lie to her about his feelings for her. He might not tell her something she needed to know, but he wouldn\u2019t lie to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d she asked him roughly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let me know, Jesse, instead of leaving me in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow, baby?\u201d He shrugged, though she saw his fists clench in his pockets. \u201cYou were so scared of me you ran damned near every time I tried to get close. You\u2019ve been like that ever since you realized I did want you. You ran, because who I was, what I was, frightened you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t him. She stared at him in surprise. It had never been his needs that had her running.</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cI ran because my own feelings, my own needs, terrified me. Not you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou never frightened me, Jesse. Ever. But I scared the hell out of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of who I am. Because of what I wanted,\u201d he said roughly.</p><p>\u201cBecause of who I am.\u201d She shook her head quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t you see, Jesse? It wasn\u2019t you. It was me. I couldn\u2019t make sense of my own needs, my own desires. I couldn\u2019t understand what I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d He looked so alone, so braced for her rejection.</p><p>She rose slowly to her feet, revealing the items she had left on the bed behind her. Handcuffs and leather ankle cuffs attached to chains. She saw his gaze flicker to them.</p><p>\u201cWill you trust me to love you, Jesse?\u201d she asked him softly. \u201cI trust you. With everything I am. Everything you need. Will you trust me as well?\u201d</p><p>Silence built within the room for long, intense seconds as he stared at the bed.</p><p>\u201cI take it those aren\u2019t for you?\u201d He nodded to the items.</p> <p>She looked up at him from the corners of her eyes, a small smile playing at her lips. \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>He tensed, his expression darkening with such latent sensuality she felt her pussy creaming in response.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNo means no, Terrie,\u201d he reminded her firmly. \u201cI can be man enough to give you want you want, within reason.\u201d</p><p>She smiled gently. \u201cYou\u2019ve always given me more than I deserve, Jesse. But now, I want to give to you. My gift to you, because I love you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hands from his slacks, his fingers working slowly at the buttons of his shirt. He looked around the bedroom curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I suddenly nervous?\u201d he asked her with a half smile. A halfhearted attempt to remind her how dearly he loved being in control.</p> <p>She moved to him, her hand lifting to touch his chest, reveling in the feel of the hard, warm muscle beneath his dark skin. She felt his breath quicken as she laid a kiss between the edges of his shirt as it fell open. His hands lifted, running up her back as he drew her closer.</p><p>\u201cGod, Terrie, you make me lose all my control. You know that?\u201d He lowered his head, his lips pressing to her temple, her cheek, then her lips.</p><p>Terrie moaned in rising hunger as his tongue swept over her lips, licking at them, tasting her, savoring her as his arms tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only fair, because you do the same to me,\u201d she panted breathlessly against his tongue, then moaned in pleasure as his lips took control of hers, his tongue forging into her mouth in a stroke of heated pleasure.</p><p>His fingers clenched on the material of her gown. His body tightened. The small signs of his arousal, his need for her, built her own need higher. She moved against him, reveling in his kiss. His lips were hard, rough, yet incredibly gentle on hers. His tongue thrust into her mouth with forceful strokes, making her hungry for more and more of his taste.</p><p>His hands moved to her bare shoulders, smoothing over the flesh, making her tremble from the hot pleasure that streaked through her body. A touch so simple, she thought in awe, just his fingertips, yet her vagina clenched with the sharp darts of lightning-hot sensations they created.</p><p>His lips moved over hers slow and easy. So gentle. His very gentleness was at odds with the tension that made his body tighten, made him harder, stronger than ever before. The tenderness never changed. He groaned with rough hunger. His tongue plundered her mouth, mating erotically with hers, yet each touch was so controlled, so light and adoring it made her soul weep with the need it transmitted to her.</p><p>\u201cWait. Wait.\u201d She pulled back, aware that once again Jesse was giving. Overloading her senses, capturing her with a pleasure so seductively erotic she could do nothing but respond.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t lose control of herself, she thought frantically. This was for Jesse. His pleasure. His need. She had to return to him the bone tightening ecstasy he gave her each time he touched her.</p><p>\u201cTerrie.\u201d He was panting for breath as he laid his forehead against hers, his hands, palms only, smoothing across her shoulders. \u201cI need you so bad I\u2019m shaking with it, baby. I could devour you now, standing here against this fucking wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, moving back from him until his hands caught at her hips, holding her still. \u201cPlease, Jesse.\u201d She stared up at him, knowing he wanted to give to her. Needed to give to her. But first, she needed to give to Jesse. \u201cLet me do this, Jesse. Please. Just this once.\u201d</p><p>He groaned roughly, his head falling back against the wall as he stared up at the ceiling. \u201cTerrie, you torture me all night and I promise I\u2019ll paddle your ass for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she grinned as her fingers went to his belt. \u201cCome on, Jesse, be brave.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her as he toed his shoes from his feet, his abdomen clenching as her fingers stroked across it. \u201cNo piercings.\u201d He frowned fiercely. \u201cYou put a ring in my nipple, Terrie, and all bets are off. I\u2019ll have to retaliate.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers over the hard little pebble of his male nipple and grinned teasingly. \u201cGold would look good on you, Jesse. You should think about it.\u201d</p><p>He snorted roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, baby,\u201d he groaned as she slid the zipper of his slacks down, the backs of her fingers caressing the hard ridge of his cock beneath his silk boxers.</p><p>She removed the pants and boxers slowly, planting kisses down his hard thighs as she went. The muscles there tensed, his cock jerking as her tongue stroked his skin languidly.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, you\u2019re killing me,\u201d he groaned, his hands spearing through her hair as she blew a soft breath across his tightening scrotum.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving you, Jesse. Loving you with everything I can give you.\u201d She leaned closer, her tongue stroking over the tightening sac. His legs spread for her, his cock so hard, the flesh stretched so tightly on it that it glistened in the candlelight.</p><p>His scrotum was bare of hair. She loved it. The sac was so silky, so soft with nothing to hinder her light strokes. His hands tightened in her hair as her teeth raked him gently, his hips pushing the flesh closer to her teasing tongue.</p><p>\u201cGod, Terrie.\u201d His voice was deep, strangled. \u201cYour tongue is killing me, baby.\u201d</p><p>One last loving lick then she moved back, licking her lips as she rose from her kneeling position on the floor.</p><p>\u201cOn the bed,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His gaze flickered to the cuffs. \u201cFuck,\u201d he breathed out roughly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there,\u201d she laughed softly. \u201cIn ways that will leave you screaming in pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat screaming part.\u201d He glanced at her nervously. \u201cNothing too heavy, right?\u201d</p><p>She lifted a brow. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jesse, I promise not to breech any restricted areas.\u201d</p><p>He breathed out in relief. \u201cI knew I loved you for a reason,\u201d he quipped. \u201cOkay.\u201d He squared his shoulders with such a show of courage she had to smother her laughter. \u201cLet\u2019s do this before I chicken out.\u201d</p><p>He plopped down on the bed, spreading his arms and legs with such reluctance she almost laughed out loud. Instead, she moved quickly to his wrists. She restrained them in the metal cuffs then clipped the other end to the chains that ran from the bottom of the bed rail. The leather cuffs were harder to attach, but within minutes she had his ankles restrained as well.</p><p>He watched her with narrowed eyes, the brilliant green heating to an almost dangerous level as she trailed her fingers up the inside of his taut leg. She took a deep breath. Despite Tally\u2019s plan, she had no intention of blindfolding him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when I threatened to share you with one of my friends?\u201d she asked him softly as she rose to her knees and pulled the silk gown quickly from her body.</p><p>His eyes widened. At first in surprise, then in growing heat. \u201cWhat have you done, Terrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to give you a taste of what I know you\u2019ll give me eventually,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPleasure, Jesse. The most erotic pleasure I can think of for you. Would you let me do that? I can\u2019t do it without your permission.\u201d</p><p>He breathing was hard, rough. \u201cFuck. Tally.\u201d The moan wasn\u2019t one of pleasured anticipation. \u201cI know damned well you wouldn\u2019t let anyone else in this room with us.\u201d</p><p>She could hear his nervousness now. \u201cTerrie, honey, I would do anything in this world for you, you know that. But that woman is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>She moved from the bed, controlling her grin. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say no, Jesse,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAre you saying no?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNo piercings, right?\u201d His voice was thicker, almost slurred with his arousal.</p><p>\u201cNo piercings, Jesse,\u201d she promised as she turned on the light, held it a second, then turned it off again. \u201cShould I blindfold you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d he growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch, Terrie, every move you make. And baby, when your turn comes, I\u2019m going to make you scream for mercy just as hard and as loud as you make me scream. You better remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d she murmured as Tally stepped into the room. \u201cYou have no idea, Jesse, how much I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Jesse watched the two women carefully. He\u2019d had a feeling, years ago, that Terrie could more than match his desires, but he\u2019d be damned if he ever expected this.</p><p>Tally. Hell, he had suspected she was a wildcat, but he couldn\u2019t profess any driving desire for her. He had to admit she was damned pretty, though. Just a few inches shorter than Terrie, her skin a dark contrast to Terrie\u2019s creamy flesh. Her long black hair rippled down her back, her dark eyes glinted with amused desire.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, boss,\u201d she murmured as she moved along his side, her lips whispering along his ear as Terrie moved to the other. \u201cBig time.\u201d</p><p>A whiplash of scalding lust seared his body as Terrie\u2019s lips feathered over his neck. The twin sensations were stronger, more powerful than he had expected. He tugged at the restraints, his fingers curling into fists with his need to touch now. Two hands stroked over his chest, his abdomen, raising his blood pressure and his arousal level past heights he would have never dreamed it could.</p><p>Both hands were soft, silky and warm. Yet Terrie\u2019s held a heat, a gentleness he would have known anywhere. She stroked him as though her pleasure came from the touch of his skin alone. Not that Tally didn\u2019t know how to use her hands. Damned if she didn\u2019t. And her nails. Every muscle in his body clenched when she used them across his nipple. Shit, that shouldn\u2019t feel so damned good.</p><p>\u201cTerrie,\u201d he growled her name as his gaze darkened with the spiraling pleasure.</p><p>It felt as though lips, tongues and seductive fingers were everywhere. His nipples, his chest, his abdomen. A wash of silken heat as Terrie\u2019s lips feathered toward his, Tally\u2019s drifting to his chest.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel good, Jesse?\u201d Terrie breathed against his lips, her eyes dark in the candlelight and filled with emotion.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Terrie,\u201d he growled. \u201cBefore I go insane for your taste.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. A slow tilt of her lips that had his cock jerking in response. It was an erotic, captivating smile and had him groaning in sensual frustration. She leaned over him, her breasts brushing against his arm, his chest. The gold nipple ring taunted him as he glanced down, glowing against the rosy peak as she raked it across his chest.</p><p>Her lips touched his, her tongue stroked. His body bucked as Tally\u2019s lips moved to his chest, her tongue lapping at his nipple. Dammit, that wasn\u2019t supposed to feel that good.</p><p>But Terrie\u2019s kiss fried his brain. He struggled against the cuffs, desperate to touch her. He needed to touch her, to run his hands over her body, to show her with his touch, with his kiss, what she meant to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no escaping the bonds. No escaping the hot ecstasy moving over his body. Terrie\u2019s lips were silken fire on his as his head raised to get closer to the teasing kiss. Yet she was always just a breath away, licking at him, taunting him with the need for more.</p><p>Silken hands were like brush strokes of flame on his body when she finally came to him. Her tongue slipped into his mouth, her broken moan whispering around him as she took what she needed from the kiss. Deep, hungry, her tongue thrusting past his lips, tangling with his, stretching his senses on a rack of exquisite lust.</p><p>He groaned at the loss of her touch when she pulled back, his eyes opening, his gaze darkening as her teeth nipped at his jaw, then began to move lower. The scent of heated female need was like an aphrodisiac to his senses. It drifted around him, tightening his body to a flash point of sensitivity that was nearly painful.</p> <p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d she breathed at his ear as her body began to move lower.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d he gasped, feeling Tally\u2019s lips and tongue stroking his abdomen, her hot little hands smoothing over his thighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loving you,\u201d she denied. \u201cAll of you, Jesse. Just let me love you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips stroked down his chest, his abdomen. He groaned in mounting pleasure, his cock throbbing, jerking, as they drew slowly closer to the center of his thighs.</p><p>Terrie was like a sleek little cat moving around him, her tongue licking at his skin, her teeth scraping sensually at his flesh. His body arched as their lips moved to his thighs. Hot, blistering with sensual delight, lips and tongue tortured his flesh, coming close to his desperate erection then moving back.</p> <p>He was certain they were determined to drive him mad. Then he felt soft lips moving up the inside of one thigh, a quick adventurous stroke of a tongue on the smooth flesh of his scrotum.</p><p>\u201cTerrie.\u201d He fought to arch closer as Terrie\u2019s tongue joined the game, licking up the shaft of his cock, swirling around the bulbous head.</p><p>He could feel his release nearing. His scrotum tightened with it, his body becoming electrified. It was so damned close, he knew he was within seconds of coming from the sheer eroticism of the act alone.</p><p>He looked down along his body to see Terrie laying beside him, her breasts brushing his thigh as her mouth moved slowly, adoringly over his cock. The tight, heavily veined flesh glistened from her saliva, jerked from the heated lash of her tongue. Her eyes were closed, her enjoyment in his response clearly written in her expression.</p><p>Below her, stretched between his spread thighs, Tally was busy torturing, tormenting his tightened scrotum. She licked and suckled, her teeth scraping erotically, her tongue laving him with brilliant heat.</p><p>Control was a thing of the past. Jesse existed only in the pleasure, the overriding exquisite torment the two women practiced on his restrained body. He fought the chains, his body bucking, rough, guttural growls sounding from his chest as he fought for his release.</p> <p>Then Terrie\u2019s mouth tightened on him, drawing him deeper into her mouth, suckling the head of his cock with a deep, rhythmic flexing of her mouth and tongue that proved to be too much when combined with Tally\u2019s mouthing of his scrotum below.</p><p>His hoarse shout was torn from his chest as he felt his release explode through his body. His head arched back, grinding into the mattress beneath him as his hips arched higher to Terrie\u2019s tormenting suckling. Destructive quakes of sensation ripped through his body, his testicles, shooting his semen from the tip of his cock as though it were the first release of his life.</p><p>\u201cTerrie. Son of a bitch!\u201d His cry was torn from his very soul as the pleasure rocked him, shuddered through him, left him gasping in an aftermath so intense he wondered if he would ever truly recover.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Terrie dragged herself slowly out of bed the next morning. Her body ached pleasantly, drawing a satisfied smile to her lips. Jesse had been uncontrollable after the cuffs had come off. God only knew when Tally finally left, because from the minute he gained his freedom Jesse had flipped Terrie on her back, his cock thrusting hard and fast inside her, and he hadn\u2019t stopped for hours.</p><p>Dawn had been peeking through the bedroom when he collapsed beside her, swearing she was going to pay for that loss of control. Moving into the shower she stood beneath the steamy water, her eyes closed, reveling in the memory of Jesse\u2019s hoarse shouts of release, his steamy, sexy words as he praised her body, her sexuality. It had been the most amazing night of her life.</p><p>Leaning against the shower wall she soaped her bath sponge, her heart pounding in a hard rhythm as nerves began to take hold of her once again. She knew what was coming and though it didn\u2019t frighten her, she wondered at the changes in herself. Jesse had always been so much a part of her life. For years he had been there, and though she had tried not to lean on him she had known he was there if the need arose.</p><p>Always there. She bit her lip as the thought crossed her mind. Always waiting, always wanting, just as she had. Always wanting the one thing, the one part of herself that frightened her more than anything else did.</p> <p>Was she brave enough to be the woman Jesse needed? She moved the sponge slowly over her breasts, shivering at the sensitivity of her own body. Yeah, she thought with another smile, she could do it. Surely she could.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t nearly finished with Jesse Wyman either. He had whispered the words she needed to hear as sleep overtook her that morning, but he had yet to say them to her while she was fully awake. Terrie wanted to see him, to know he meant it when he shared his love with her. He had said the words hesitantly, as though uncertain of her reaction or her awareness.</p><p>I\u2019ve always loved you. His voice had been incredibly soft, the rough timber hoarse, thick with emotion, unlike anything she had heard from Jesse before. As she dressed, she vowed that once and for all, before this relationship went any further, she and Jesse had to talk. There was too much between them, too many secrets, too many words unspoken. It was time to clear it away. Time to accept the past, not just for her, but for Jesse as well.</p><p>Thomas had left an inheritance of pain and bitter regret with many of his actions and his brutal cruelty. Somehow he had known that Jesse cared about her, just as he had guessed her feelings for Jesse. He had used those emotions and deceived both of them in his drive to hurt as many people as he could. As though only in stripping them bare, in seeing the agony he created, could he find any happiness in his life.</p><p>Terrie shook her head at the thought of that. She needed answers herself. She needed to know once and for all where she and Jesse were headed. She quickly dried her body, moving into the bedroom to dress before heading to Jesse\u2019s office.</p><p>As she entered the room the phone rang demandingly.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She grabbed the receiver as she began to search her dresser drawer for just the right undergarments.</p><p>\u201cHow about lunch?\u201d His dark voice had her shivering, her cunt pulsing with demanding need as she closed her eyes to savor the sound.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Her voice was husky. She refused to attempt to hide her need now. He knew her, knew she could no longer resist the pleasure he could give her.</p><p>\u201cMy office, whenever you show up,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have to take care of a few things first, then I\u2019ll be free the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the day to play. She fought to keep from panting like an inexperienced teenager at the thought of it. She managed it, but only barely.</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d She pulled a midnight blue thong from her dresser and a matching silk push-up bra as she fought to try to breathe properly.</p><p>\u201cTerrie.\u201d His voice was smooth, low, a sexual stroke of pleasure across her senses.</p><p>She swallowed tightly. \u201cYes, Jesse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse the butt plug again, and that pretty little violet slip dress hanging in your closet. And no bra, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>The dominant, ruthless sound of his voice had her trembling in nervous anticipation.</p><p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrie.\u201d There was an edge to his voice now that had her pussy quaking in reaction. \u201cBe wearing it or I promise you, you\u2019ll wish you had.\u201d</p><p>The line disconnected.</p><p>Terrie stared down at the receiver for a shocked second before she laughed softly. Oh, now there was a man fighting for control. Desperately. He was a dominant alpha male scrambling to reassert his authority. She loved it. She wondered how quickly she could throw him off balance once again? Drawing in a deep breath, smiling in anticipation, she vowed to find out.</p><p>\u201cMen are so predictable.\u201d Tally closed the door behind her as Jesse hung up the phone and drew in a deep, hard breath.</p><p>He arched a brow sarcastically. \u201cDid I ring you, Tally?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes expressively. The woman was a menace. He had known she was a menace when he hired her the year before; he was even more convinced of it now.</p><p>\u201cYou know Jesse, we\u2019ve known each other a long time.\u201d She sat down regally in the chair across from him, smoothing out her skirt rather absently before glancing up at him again. Cool as a cucumber, that was Tally.</p><p>\u201cWe have,\u201d he admitted carefully, wondering where she was going with this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Terrie even longer,\u201d she sighed patiently. \u201cShe\u2019s such a brave little thing when she wants to be. But that bravery is not going to extend to a scheduled m\u00e9nage, such as you and your buddies like to set up. If you want her, you\u2019re going to have to surprise her. Dare her.\u201d Tally\u2019s voice was a dare itself. \u201cBut once she does it, I\u2019m certain she\u2019ll settle right into your little domination games.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in her chair, her attitude one of mocking acceptance of an eccentricity she found little amusement in.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Tally.\u201d He leaned forward in his chair, controlling his grin. \u201cAs you stated, we\u2019ve known each other for quite a while. And don\u2019t think you\u2019re the only one of us who can read easily between the lines.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in false surprise. \u201cSweetie, I never imagined such a thing.\u201d She shook her head tolerantly. \u201cYou do get the strangest ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTally, I\u2019m not nearly as simple as you are giving me credit for,\u201d he warned her carefully, allowing her to see the core of steady purpose he kept carefully below the surface. \u201cI know many of your little secrets, sweetheart, and don\u2019t think for a minute you\u2019ll get away with baiting the group forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh them.\u201d She waved her hand carelessly. \u201cI\u2019d worry less about your play mates and more about your lover if I were you.\u201d She grinned. \u201cTerrie will keep stealing your control, Jesse, if you don\u2019t do something quickly. She can be a dominant little thing, can\u2019t she?\u201d She chuckled wickedly.</p><p>Jesse remained quiet, calm, though his amusement was growing. Tally was supremely confident, mocking, more than a little dominant herself. He couldn\u2019t wait to see her fall.</p><p>\u201cTally, you have the rest of the day off,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cLong lunch, early dinner. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, and he was intrigued to see the impression of a pout forming along her lips before she carefully controlled it.</p><p>\u201cSo who is the playmate going to be?\u201d She tried to come off as casual, curious, but he caught the hint of something more.</p><p>He leaned closer to his desk, tilting his head with amused inquiry. \u201cWho would you suggest, Tally?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged negligently. \u201cI was merely curious, Jesse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there someone who shouldn\u2019t be considered, Tally?\u201d He leaned back in his chair, watching her carefully.</p><p>She came gracefully to her feet. \u201cYou and your little playmates are really none of my concern. By the way, Lucian Conover called. He\u2019s coming in after lunch to discuss something about that contract he had problems with,\u201d she sniffed disdainfully. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to hear that you might be busy. I\u2019ll go to lunch now, dear. Watch out for hidden handcuffs and the like.\u201d Her amused laughter was soft, lilting in its confidence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTally.\u201d He stopped her as she neared the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, Jesse.\u201d She turned back, her body poised gracefully to sweep from the room.</p><p>\u201cLucian likes handcuffs, sweetheart, and a whole lot more. You might want to watch how much you taunt him.\u201d</p><p>Her grin turned wicked, decidedly sexual. \u201cOh Jesse, darling, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt him too badly.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled as she swept from the room. He knew Lucian would eventually make his move on the temperamental little beauty, he just wondered if the other man would survive it.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The outer office was deserted. Terrie drew in a deep breath, fighting the trembling ache in her rear from the plug inserted inside it. The silk of the dress rasped against her sensitive nipples. Her pussy creamed heatedly. To some extent she suspected what was coming. The added rush of nervous fear and anticipation had her nearly panting in arousal.</p><p>She turned the lock in the door as she closed it behind her. The main offices were quiet this afternoon but she wanted to take no chances that she and Jesse would be disturbed.</p><p>She had given to Jesse the night before in the only way she knew how, to show him she understood the needs and the desires that were so much a part of him. She even understood, to some extent, that need as well. Watching Tally touch him, seeing his arousal, his pleasure, hearing his breathing hitch as he let the pleasure suffuse him, had been incredibly arousing.</p><p>In setting up the experience she was more than aware she had given Jesse implicit permission to turn the tables on her. She had given him her acceptance without words and now she fought to stem her nervousness over the choice. She had never been taken in such a way. Had never been shared between two men. Until Jesse, she had never known such rough loving, that such incredible, spiraling pleasure could be attained from the darker edge of lust.</p><p>She bit her lip as she approached his door. It was barely open, with no sound coming from the room beyond. Somehow he had managed to find his control once again. She could sense it, knew it. His voice on the phone earlier had assured her of it.</p><p>She pushed the door open slowly, stepping into the room as her gaze sought out Jesse.</p><p>He stood in front of the large, drapery-shrouded windows. The room was dim; his form was tall, graceful, commanding.</p><p>\u201cLock the door.\u201d His voice was a hard rumble of lust.</p><p>Terrie felt her womb clench, her pussy flood. With shaking hands she closed the door, turning the lock and nearly flinching at the sharp sound it made. She stood silently, watching him, trying not to pant with her own rising sexual demands. She could feel her nipples hardening further, her cunt clenching in excruciating need.</p><p>Her eyes were drawn to the low table in front of the leather couch. Terrie drew in a deep breath to keep from whimpering. Lying on the table was a tube of lubrication, two small nipple clamps and a jelly dildo perhaps half the width of his cock, but just as long. Her gaze returned to him.</p><p>She started as he moved. A ripple of motion as he walked to the low table, glancing down at the articles then back to her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve known me for a long time, Terrie,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI\u2019ve never made an effort to hide who I am or what I enjoy from you.\u201d</p><p>He paused for long moments as though waiting to see if she would deny his words. She couldn\u2019t. She had known all along.</p><p>\u201cOthers would call me perverted...depraved,\u201d he continued. \u201cI won\u2019t deny that, either. It\u2019s definitely not conventional, but it\u2019s who I am. And it\u2019s a desire you can\u2019t deny in yourself, Terrie. Not any longer.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t attempting to deny it, but she would be damned if she knew now what to do. She licked her lips nervously, aware that his eyes narrowed on the movement.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t denied it, Jesse,\u201d she finally said softly.</p> <p>A small smile quirked his lips. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t.\u201d He lifted his arm, extending his hand out to her. \u201cCome here, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>She walked to him slowly, trembling, achingly aware of her body and the sexual fire coursing through it. She felt as though flames were leaping in her cunt, burning clear to her soul. As she stepped close to him the heat seared her body, her breasts, her anus. She nearly shuddered from the hunger to feel him thrusting hard and heavy inside her. Dominating her. Giving the gift of her own surrender, her complete submission to her own needs.</p><p>His hands slid up her arms. Terrie drew in a hard breath, her hunger for him nearly overcoming any semblance of control she could have possessed. Her flesh prickled, small goose bumps rising at the calloused touch of his palms, the warmth of his body.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how beautiful you are to me?\u201d he asked her as his fingers moved to the small buttons of her dress, slipping the first one free. \u201cHow long I\u2019ve waited to touch you, how many nights I laid in a fever of rage while Thomas lived? Praying to God he wouldn\u2019t touch you, wouldn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, fighting those memories.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have no more lies between us, Terrie. No more secrets.\u201d He leaned close, his lips feathering her ear as he whispered, \u201cDo you know how hard it was to walk away the nights I came to dinner while he lived, his permission to fuck you ringing in my ears? My need to hear you scream my name pounding in my cock?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in shock at the near violence in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She trembled in his grip. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I was so frightened of...this.\u201d She shuddered as he nipped at her ear lobe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he growled. \u201cYour pleasure, your cries, your sweet pussy, your tight ass. It\u2019s mine, Terrie. All of it. To pleasure how I see fit. To tempt, to tease, to watch as you experience every sexual fantasy you could have ever dreamed.\u201d</p><p>Before she could have guessed his intentions, his hand hooked in the front of her dress and with a quick motion jerked the fabric apart. Buttons scattered as she gasped in surprise, only to moan in pleasure as his lips covered hers, his tongue sinking past her parted lips into the moist interior of her mouth.</p><p>He jerked the tattered remains of silk from her body a second before his arms crushed her to his chest. The Egyptian cotton of his shirt rasped her nipples, burning her with sensation as his lips moved on hers hungrily, his tongue thrusting between her lips, licking at hers, twining with it as she moaned in rising need.</p><p>Between her thighs her pussy spasmed, creaming furiously as the weight of the nipple ring tugged at the sensitive peak of one breast. One hand moved to the heavy weight of her hair as he pulled her head farther back, his lips moving down her neck, stroking tingling electric arcs of sensation over her flesh before he raised his head and stared down at her with dark arousal.</p><p>She stood panting, swaying as he moved back from her. Reaching down he picked up the two nipple clamps as she swallowed tightly. Her gaze met his as he watched her closely, the little jeweled clamps held in his hand.</p><p>His head lowered to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cJesse.\u201d Her whimper was part fear, part incredible need as his tongue began to lick, his lips to suckle until her nipples stood out hard and aching from the mounds of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cJust a little hurt,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut you like a little hurt, don\u2019t you, Terrie?\u201d</p><p>He attached the first clamp; its firm, nipping pressure had her nearly climaxing from the pleasure/pain alone. She couldn\u2019t hold back her cry as he applied the mate to her other nipple. She was swaying, her pussy gushing its thick juice as the sensations threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>His finger pushed at the little jewels dangling from the clamp and she bit her lip at the tug on her furiously aroused flesh.</p><p>\u201cJesse, I don\u2019t know if I can stand it.\u201d The pleasure and the pain were swamping her.</p><p>His fingers reached up to her cheek, touching her gently, lovingly. \u201cWhen it\u2019s too much, Terrie, just say so. I won\u2019t take from you, baby. I want to give to you.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip at the emotion in his voice. It throbbed with his need to show her all he was, echoed with his own deep, dark desires.</p><p>\u201cLie down on the couch. On your stomach.\u201d His voice was harsh with his fight for control. \u201cRaise your hips. Let me see how well your ass is filled with that plug.\u201d</p><p>She nearly sank to the carpet with the burst of weakening lust that surged through her body. She did as he commanded, stretching out on the cool, fitted coverlet that fit over the leather couch. She positioned her body as he had demanded, shivering at the thought of his gaze going to the base of the thick plug stretching her.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he muttered, a second before she heard him undressing.</p><p>Agonized desire rushed through her body. The clamps on her nipples weren\u2019t overly tight; the pressure was killing her with her need for more. A second later more came.</p><p>There was no warning. Not a sound to indicate his intentions. His hand landed firmly, heatedly on one rounded cheek of her rear. Terrie cried out, but rather than pain, pleasure tore a destructive path through her body as her pussy raged in furious demand. A second later, another blow landed on the other cheek. She flinched, crying out, though her hips arched back for more.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stand it. Searing lust swept through her, overtaking her in ways she would have never imagined. Within minutes her ass was burning, her cunt dripping, weeping in greedy need.</p><p>\u201cYou have the most beautiful ass I have ever seen on a woman,\u201d he said as his hand then smoothed over the aching flesh. \u201cDo you know how many nights I\u2019ve jacked off thinking about fucking your sweet ass, Terrie?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Terrie whimpered. Her muscles clenched around the plug that stretched her, anticipating the harder, hotter invasion of his thick cock inside her. Her buttocks were hot from the fiery sting of his hand, her cunt an inferno of unslaked arousal.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered again as his mouth feathered over the heated curve of one buttock, causing her to jerk at the pleasure ricocheting through her system. \u201cBut first, I want you ready for me.\u201d</p><p>He moved between her thighs, his hand at her hip, urging her to raise herself further. Terrie clenched her fists into the coverlet over the couch, bending her knees to raise herself to him. His hard, tight moan of approval had her juices spilling copiously from her hot pussy.</p><p>Terrie shuddered as she felt his fingers grip the base of the plug before moving it slowly from her body. The wide anchor stretched her heatedly, causing her to whimper in growing arousal then in loss as it slid completely from her. But Jesse had no intentions of leaving her wanting.</p><p>She heard him moving. Heard the cap on the tube of lubrication gel snap, then felt the thick application of it at her back entrance as his fingers pushed inside her briefly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to start easy,\u201d he whispered as his arm hooked around her waist to draw her back with him as he half reclined against the couch behind her. \u201cFirst the dildo and me, then we\u2019ll advance, but I don\u2019t think I can wait, Terrie.\u201d</p><p>She struggled for a sense of balance as his hands moved her, bringing her over his hips, placing her legs on each side of him, her back to him as his cock nudged at her anal opening.</p><p>She shuddered, her hands gripping his wrists where they held her waist, her rear entrance fluttering open as he pressed his cock into it.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jesse!\u201d She could feel the thick flesh of her anus opening to the flared head of his cock as he pressed her closer.</p><p>Heat shot through her pussy, her rectum and up her spine as she felt her muscles part slowly for him. The hard bite of pain, the fiery wash of arousal, all combining to push her past her preconceived notions of lust. The need was like a demon inside her, fighting to be free as Jesse slowly slid into the well-greased channel.</p><p>She chanted his name as she felt each inch slip into her ass. Deliberately, slowly.</p><p>\u201cTerrie, you\u2019re so tight,\u201d he whispered as the bulging head finally pressed home. \u201cSo hot and sweet, baby.\u201d</p><p>She screamed. She couldn\u2019t help it. His cock slid to the hilt inside her in one smooth stroke, forging into her hot ass as pleasure/pain whipped violently through her body. She could feel the juices dripping from her cunt, her clamped nipples throbbing in response as he drew her back against his chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEasy, baby.\u201d He pressed kisses to her shoulder, his tongue stroking her flesh. \u201cJust a minute, baby. Just get used to it. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She was gasping, but not just in pain, though the pressure was biting. In pleasure. In an agony of need. She could feel her orgasm building in her very womb.</p><p>\u201cJesse, help me,\u201d she whispered desperately, the fingers of one hand going to her pussy, circling her swollen clit as she undulated against him.</p><p>Oh God. That was good. She moved again, one foot slipping to the floor to anchor her as her body arched in reflex, driving his cock deeper inside her as she changed position.</p><p>She was sobbing with the pleasure now, her fingers moving frantically to the entrance of her aching pussy only to have Jesse catch them, hold them back as his hips flexed, pulling his cock back mere inches and then driving it forward again.</p><p>She writhed on the impalement, fighting to free her hands as harsh cries fell from her lips. She was so hot, so aroused she felt as though she would burst into flames at any minute.</p><p>\u201cJesse, I can\u2019t take this,\u201d she cried out as one of his hands held hers while the other helped lift her hips enough to allow him to begin a series of those easy thrusts into her ass.</p><p>She was breaking apart. She could feel her cunt tightening, spasming, begging to be filled. She was within seconds of screaming out that need when the lock to the office door clicked and the door slowly opened.</p><p>Lucian Conover stepped into the room, pocketing the key as he moved to the couch. His fingers began working quickly at the buttons of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cTerrie?\u201d Jesse whispered her name as his cock throbbed inside her tight ass.</p><p>She stared up at Lucian, knowing her cunt caught his gaze, the glistening juices that covered the bare folds as Jesse raided her anus. He undressed quickly, his cock springing free as he dropped his pants, the thickly veined shaft engorged and more than ready to fill her.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want, Terrie?\u201d Lucian asked her as one hand went to his thick erection. \u201cI\u2019ll leave if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>But did she want him to? Her eyes strayed to his cock as her mind filled with the erotic thoughts of him filling her, easing the blistering need that tormented her pussy.</p><p>He bent to his knees, spreading her legs further, his head lowering to her swollen clit as Jesse began to thrust slowly in and out of her ass once again. Their half reclining position allowed him to pull his cock free by several inches before powering it home again, rocking her body with the streaking pleasure/pain as Lucian\u2019s suckling mouth locked onto her clit. It didn\u2019t take long before the beginnings of the first explosive orgasm ripped through Terrie\u2019s body. She tightened, crying out, fighting for balance when Jesse lifted his hands, gripped the nipple clamps and released her tormented flesh as the first explosion tore through her.</p><p>She had no more than screamed his name when Lucian came to his feet, bending his knees and began to work his cock into the convulsing muscles of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. There, sweetheart. Feel how good it can be. Feel, Terrie, just how fucking good it can be.\u201d He stilled beneath her as Lucian began to fuck inside her with slow, short strokes, pushing his bulging cock deeper inside the fist-tight confines of her pussy.</p><p>Her eyes widened, her gaze darkening as Jesse continued to croon at her ear, his cock throbbing in her ass as Lucian worked his impressive erection deep inside the tightened channel of her cunt.</p><p>She was gasping, begging, distantly amazed that the cries and pleas were coming from her own throat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her head fell back on Jesse\u2019s shoulder as his lips pressed to her cheek. \u201cYes. God. Fuck me. Jesse, make him fuck me hard, before I die.\u201d</p><p>Her hoarse words acted as a catalyst on the two men. She didn\u2019t know whose hands supported her above Jesse\u2019s body; she didn\u2019t care. In perfect synchronization she felt Jesse\u2019s cock slide nearly free of the grip of her ass while Lucian\u2019s thrusted, strong and sure, deep into her gripping pussy. Lucian pulled back, only to have Jesse surge inside the clasping heat of her ass.</p><p>The dual penetrations were more than her heightened emotions and overly sensitive body could process at once. As they began to fuck her hard and fast, their groans blending with her feminine cries, she tumbled headlong into an orgasm so explosive, so violent she lost her breath, lost her control and surrendered herself to the cyclonic whiplash of emotion and pleasure/pain that ripped through her body. Lucian and Jesse groaned her name and began spurting their own releases deep inside her spasming channels.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>\u201cThere, baby...\u201d It wasn\u2019t over. Hours later Terrie trembled, her body soaked with perspiration as yet another orgasm tore through her.</p><p>Jesse\u2019s cock was spurting heavily up into her swollen pussy, as Lucian once again gained his release in the tight recess of her ass. There had been little respite in the hours they had pleasured her. Jesse had held her once, watching, whispering explicit directions to her as they both watched Lucian part the lips of her cunt, his cock stroking slowly inside her, driving her insane as Jesse told her how beautiful it was, whispered to her how beautiful she was in her pleasure.</p><p>And the pleasure was never ending.</p><p>There was little resistance in her when they finally pulled free of her body and Jesse helped her collapse weakly to the couch. Night had fallen, the offices she knew were empty and she was too replete, too satisfied to even consider moving now.</p><p>She felt the soft sheet drape her body as her eyes closed in weariness, only dimly aware of Jesse and Lucian dressing.</p><p>Jesse watched her. Weariness dragging at his limbs as he zipped his slacks and watched Lucian re-button his own shirt. The other man was quiet, reflective, as he glanced at Terrie. Her hair flowed over her shoulders, clinging damply to the moist flesh as she drifted into sleep.</p><p>\u201cThomas didn\u2019t deserve her,\u201d Lucian sighed as her breathing deepened.</p><p>\u201cI do, Lucian.\u201d Jesse was very well aware of the fact that there were several of the members of their group who had had their eye on Terrie even before Thomas\u2019s death. \u201cShe\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Lucian nodded sharply. He more than the others, Jesse knew, had been interested. Just as he knew that any woman who accepted Conover would likely be biting off more than she could chew.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a one-man woman,\u201d Lucian sighed, grinning rakishly. \u201cI doubt she would appreciate the plans I had for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong woman,\u201d Jesse agreed.</p><p>Lucian nodded again. \u201cTake care of her, Jesse. She loves you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he knew that, Jesse thought. She had proved that the night before in ways he would have never imagined.</p><p>\u201cAs I love her, Lucian,\u201d he sighed. He always had. For as long as he had known her.</p><p>Lucian nodded abruptly then left the office with a quick, purposeful stride. Jesse shook his head as he collapsed in the chair across from Terrie and watched her sleep.</p><p>She was the most beautiful thing in the world to him. For years he had feared he would have to eventually restrain his sexuality to have her. Tamp down the need to see her surrendering to the ultimate pleasure. That of allowing her body to be completely, overwhelmingly submissive to her own desires. To take the greatest gift he had to offer her. The gift of her complete, uninhibited sexuality.</p><p>Some women had that hidden core, the darker desires, the search for the ultimate pleasure. Just as Jesse and those like him held the male half of that core. The need to see and to feel the surrender of their women to that hidden sexuality. To watch someone they trusted, someone they knew, tapping into the dark desires and sensuality of their women. It was an ultimate high, a release unlike any other.</p><p>Not that it would happen often. But sometimes. Sighing, he moved to the office closet and removed the dress he had brought for her that evening. He laid it across the chair as he moved to her once again.</p><p>\u201cWake up, baby,\u201d he whispered as he lifted her into his arms and headed for the shower on the other side of his office. \u201cCome on. Time to plan the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes, drowsy, seductive and her lips quirking into a temptress\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cRest of our lives, huh?\u201d She looped her arms lazily around his shoulders, staring up at him, loving him. He could feel her love, the warmth that spread over him when he watched her.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of our lives.\u201d He put her down in the bathroom, staring down at her. \u201cI love you, Terrie. You have to know that by now.\u201d</p><p>Her smile lit up his soul. \u201cI love you, Jesse. But this sharing thing.\u201d She rubbed hesitantly at her ear. \u201cLet\u2019s keep this to a minimum,\u201d she suggested softly. \u201cI really prefer you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, wrapping his arms around her, wishing he had the energy to throw her to the floor and fuck her again. Just for the sheer pleasure of it.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely a minimum,\u201d he promised as he drew back from her, staring down at her, adoring her. \u201cJust when you need it, baby. I promise, just when you need it.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cHi Jaded, how\u2019s tricks?\u201d The words popped up on the computer screen, drawing an amused smile to Tally\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cSlow, Wicked. Very slow,\u201d she typed back, snorting at the understatement.</p><p>The online life she led was the complete opposite of the real life she escaped each evening that she had the chance. The same men, the same parties, the same crap. She had grown bored with the endless round months ago. Why she had grown bored she had yet to figure out.</p><p>\u201cYour boss still doing his own files?\u201d It was a running joke in the online chat rooms she inhabited. She had told the story the first day it had occurred. Everyone had seemed awed by her accomplishment. She had personally hoped for at least a good argument out of Jesse Wyman at the time. She hadn\u2019t expected him to actually do his own fucking files.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d she finally typed in. \u201cI think he fired me today.\u201d</p><p>Repositioning, firing, it was the same thing. She liked working with Wyman. It wasn\u2019t exactly challenging but it left her plenty of time for shopping.</p><p>\u201cFired?\u201d The words popped back. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t dare fire you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed to herself. There were days Wyman had wanted to kill her, but he had resisted the urge with more self-control than she had given him credit for. Of course, the wedding Terrie was planning was keeping him pretty tired. That or her afternoon visits to his office.</p><p>\u201cHe says it\u2019s repositioning. He sent me to hell, Wicked.\u201d She sighed at the thought.</p><p>The merger between Conover\u2019s and Delacourte\u2019s had been more than a surprise last month. Even bigger was the surprise that she would now be the personal assistant for Lucian Conover.</p><p>\u201cRepositioning?\u201d The short question was so typical of Wicked. She could almost feel his impatience. \u201cIn Hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Hell,\u201d she sighed. \u201cMy new boss is Lucifer. This is not going to be fun. There goes all my playtime. (pout)\u201d She typed in the expression even as she did so huffily. Lucian Conover was not her idea of the perfect boss. \u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s at least hiding a sense of humor under that scowl he wears. I bet he doesn\u2019t even know the difference between a m\u00e9nage and margarita. Who will I tell all my dirty jokes to?\u201d</p><p>Lucian scowled. Son of a bitch. Lucifer, was he? Didn\u2019t know a m\u00e9nage from a margarita? He bit off a series of volatile curses as he jumped up from the computer and paced the den furiously. Smart-mouthed, viperous little termagant. He could show her a fucking m\u00e9nage she would still remember into her next life if she kept this shit up. She had no sense of decorum and had shown him zero respect each time he showed up at Jesse\u2019s office.</p><p>She stung him with that viperous tongue of hers, smirked every chance she had and showed in a hundred different ways that she expected him to grovel at the perfection of her tiny feet. Son of a bitch. For a taste of that sweet little body he just might do it, too, and that was what really rankled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou still breathing?\u201d Her tart question came over the instant message with a soft ring.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just wondering what the connection was between the m\u00e9nage and the margarita,\u201d he typed in, damning himself a thousand different ways. He was insane to have demanded her as his personal assistant. He had lost his ever lovin\u2019 mind.</p><p>\u201cNo connection.\u201d He paused at her answer, frowning. Jaded always had a reason for damned near everything she said. Unless she was unhappy. Unless she was lonely. He had learned that over the past year. Had made it his business to learn everything he could about her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Jaded?\u201d He really shouldn\u2019t care, but he did.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Her words rang hollow, even through the impersonal communication box. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go shopping tomorrow. I hear there\u2019s a sale on shoes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh oh. Poor cows, sacrificing their lives to support your addiction.\u201d He shook his head, yet still he worried. She wasn\u2019t acting normal.</p><p>\u201cCows, alligators, whatever.\u201d Nope, that wasn\u2019t his Jaded.</p><p>\u201cHey babe, you can talk to me, you know.\u201d He needed her to.</p><p>There was a long silence.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend.\u201d The words finally came through with a sense of sadness. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she has such horrid taste in men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He didn\u2019t even pretend to understand that one.</p><p>\u201cI love her like a sister.\u201d She had to be talking about Terrie.</p><p>He waited to see what else she said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she actually fucked Lucifer! Was she insane? Has she lost her mind? The man is an outcast. He has no style. No class, and I doubt he has a cock over five inches long. He probably only needs a finger or two to jack off with.\u201d</p><p>He sat back slowly in his chair. His cock, all five inches and several more, pulsed in outrage. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThe man scowls. He sneers. Stomps around like a bull in a china shop. He is such a bore. Geez. I need a new job.\u201d</p><p>His fists clenched, his teeth ground together as he saw red. The viperous little witch. A bull in a china shop? Five-inch cock? Five-inch cock?? Ohh, he would show her a hell of a lot fucking more than five inches. Damn her. The woman had a bite that would do a rabid dog proud.</p><p>\u201cIf you quit, just think of all the shoes that would cry.\u201d It was lame. Real lame, but he\u2019d be damned if he could type his outrage to her over the Internet. She would probably save the fucking message to show all her chat room buddies. He sneered. Oh, was she in for a surprise.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is true. But I\u2019m definitely looking.\u201d</p><p>He stilled. Looking, was she? He\u2019d see about that one.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck darlin\u2019. Now I\u2019m off. Hot date tonight.\u201d</p><p>Nothing came back for long moments.</p> <p>\u201cAll right. Goodnight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, darlin\u2019. Cheer up, maybe you\u2019ll get lucky and he\u2019ll at least have more than five inches.\u201d He growled.</p><p>\u201cAs though that can help him.\u201d He could almost hear the haughty vibration of the words. \u201cWhere oh where have all the alphas gone? Your mothers must have breast-fed you overly long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr yours fed you venom and spice rather than sweet milk,\u201d he typed back furiously. And he meant it.</p><p>\u201cLOL. Good one, Wicked. Have fun for me while you\u2019re out. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>He clicked the box away. He shut down the program, damn near shaking with rage and arousal. He came to his feet, pushing his fingers ruthlessly through his hair as he clenched his teeth against his anger. Damn her. Lucifer, was he? Five inches, was he? He snarled as he stomped through the house, jerking the leather jacket from the staircase post as he headed for the door.</p><p>Miss Jaded Tally was in for one hell of a surprise. </p> </body></html>"]
