Or at least more sensible shoes. As it was she\u2019d dressed in black strappy sandals that weren\u2019t all that comfortable for walking, let alone being dragged across a parking lot and thrown into the back of a van.</p><p>She did her best to resist. Screaming was out of the question because they\u2019d already gagged her. And the resisting part went badly, what with her hands tied behind her back, although she did nail one guy with a decent head butt.</p><p>Even as she landed hard on the metal floor of the van, she wondered how it all had happened. She\u2019d been in Ann Taylor checking out the new clothes for fall. She\u2019d told Drew she needed to use the restroom.</p> <p>Traveling with two Secret Service agents meant rarely using a public restroom. Drew had consulted with the manager of the store, who was all too happy to have the president of the United States\u2019 daughter peeing in her private bathroom. Darcy had done her business, washed her hands\u2014not only because she always did, but also because people checked on things like that when one was in the public eye\u2014and had started back through the stockroom toward the dressing rooms, where she had a pile of clothes waiting for her.</p><p>That\u2019s when the men attacked. Four guys in Halloween-type demon masks grabbed her. Before she knew what was happening, they\u2019d slapped tape on her mouth. The hand tying came next, then the dragging.</p><p>One of them even remembered to pick up her purse, she thought grimly as she stared at her now-scratched Maxx bag bought on QVC lying next to her on the floor of the van.</p><p>The rear doors slammed shut, and the vehicle sped out of the parking lot.</p><p>Darcy braced herself as best she could on the ribbed floor as the van bounced, swerved, then turned onto what felt like a main road. Two of her abductors had taken the front seats\u2014she could see them through the small grille\u2014while the other two must have had their own transportation. She was alone in the back of the van.</p> <p>Alone with her purse.</p><p>There were no windows, no way to get anyone\u2019s attention. And no one to watch her retrieve the panic button that would signal the Secret Service and send them rushing to rescue her.</p><p>She inched her way toward the purse, only to have the van take another corner, causing the bag to go sliding out of reach. Two more slip-slides across the dirty metal floor and she was within reaching distance of her purse...except for the small problem of her hands tied behind her back. Could she open the zipper with her teeth? Probably not with the gag in place.</p><p>Darcy had done her best to stay focused in the moment. If she anchored herself in the now, the terror wasn\u2019t so bad. She could function. But if she allowed herself to think about what they could do to her, how it was national policy to never negotiate with terrorists, then fear would explode inside of her, making her want to scream and beg, despite the tape across her mouth.</p><p>No! She wouldn\u2019t go there. She wouldn\u2019t give in. She was strong and determined, and by God, she would get her panic button and push it until dozens of armed agents came storming through the walls of the van.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have much choice. Drew had been assigned to her long enough to know that the \u201ctrying on\u201d part of a shopping trip could take at least an hour, which meant he wouldn\u2019t notice she was missing until the van had enough time to cross a couple of state lines.</p> <p>If only it wasn\u2019t so hot, she thought as she went to work on the zipper. August in D.C. maintained the average temperature of a blast furnace with plenty of humidity thrown in for good measure. The front of the van might have AC, but here in the prison part of the vehicle, no such luck.</p><p>She ignored the heat, the sweat, the scrapes and bruises, and bent over her purse. Several more turns, some speeding and three failed attempts later, Darcy had discovered she could not open the damn zipper with her teeth. Which left her to scoot the purse into a corner, turn her back, and try to open it that way.</p><p>Easier said than done, she thought as she discovered she couldn\u2019t even hold on to the purse, although she did a lovely job of scraping her arm and banging her head. Why did this stuff always look so easy in the movies?</p><p>She tried again, carefully lodging the purse against the wheel well, then rolling onto her back and grabbing for the bag with her fingers. This time she got it and turned it slowly until she felt the zipper.</p><p>Don\u2019t make a turn, don\u2019t make a turn, she chanted silently, knowing if they did, she would slide across the van and have to start all over again.</p><p>The vehicle stayed mercifully straight.</p><p>Inch by inch she pulled the zipper down. Sweat poured down her back and made her fingers damp. Her bare legs stuck to the floor of the van and to whatever crumbs and icky things were scattered there. At last the purse was open. She plunged both hands inside and felt around for the familiar plastic case. Lipstick, wallet, cell phone, pen\u2014</p><p>Cell phone? Nearly as good as the panic button. She would have to dial, of course, but she could call the operator and asked to be put through to her father. She could\u2014</p> <p>Darcy swore. Right. The tape across her mouth would make it difficult to hold a conversation. Back to digging for the panic button.</p><p>At that exact moment, the van suddenly came to a stop. Both she and her purse went sliding, although not at the same rate of speed. She had no way to get back to it before the bad guys opened the rear door to find her sprawled in a corner, her skirt up to her waist and the contents of her purse spread all over the floor of the van.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take her handbag?\u201d one of the guys asked the other. \u201cGoddamn it, Bill, I thought you were smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>The recipient of the scolding, a smallish man in a vampire mask, stiffened. \u201cYou used my name. Now she knows my name.\u201d</p><p>The other one, demon-guy, snorted. \u201cYeah, because there\u2019s only one guy named Bill in the whole country. Come on, Einstein, let\u2019s get her inside.\u201d</p><p>Darcy tried to scramble away from her kidnappers, but as she was already in a back corner of the van, there was nowhere else to go. They half carried, half dragged her into what looked like a large warehouse.</p><p>She did her best to fight, lashing out at them with her feet. The action caused them to hold on tighter to her upper arms and made her break a heel on her new sandals.</p><p>Now she was mad, she thought as they put her into a straight-back chair and began tying her down. They\u2019d screwed with her day, bruised her, thrown her around the inside of a disgusting van, scratched her new leather bag, and ruined the black sandals she\u2019d just bought after waiting four weeks for them to go on sale. There was going to be hell to pay.</p><p>She told them so, although the tape on her mouth interfered with the intensity of her message.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she likes us,\u201d Bill said, stepping back as she tried to kick his shin.</p><p>\u201cGee, I wonder why. Most people love a good kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>With that, the two men walked off. Darcy tried to hold on to her anger by reminding herself how much the sandals had cost, even on clearance, and how little money she had coming in these days. It worked for nearly a minute, then the fear set in. What were they going to do to her?</p><p>She told herself that torture was unlikely. Either they wanted money or something they thought they could only get from the president of the United States. Unfortunately that was a big pool of possibilities, everything from sovereignty to nuclear weapons.</p><p>Then there was the matter of the no-negotiation policy. The one that told her she could be stuck here for a very long time, and then she could be killed.</p><p>Darcy might not love everything about her life at this moment in time, but she wasn\u2019t ready for it to be over. Terror tightened her throat and made it impossible to breathe. She had the sudden thought that she was going to throw up.</p><p>Stay calm, she told herself. If she vomited, she could drown in a really gross way. She had to find her Zen center. Not that she\u2019d ever studied Zen, but she could imagine what it was like. A tranquil place. A place where reality was an illusion and all that mattered was the slow, steady beating of her heart.</p><p>Deep breaths, she told herself. In and out. No hurry in the air department. Just nice slow\u2014</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt her?\u201d</p><p>The question came from somewhere behind her as she heard several people approaching. Panic joined fear as she tried to figure out if, in this man\u2019s opinion, hurting her would be a plus or not.</p><p>\u201cShe got banged up in the back of the van,\u201d Bill said. \u201cBut that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>She looked around for some kind of escape. But the huge, empty warehouse didn\u2019t offer any places to hide, and being tied to a large, heavy chair limited her options. She tried to scoot and only succeeded in wrenching her back.</p><p>\u201cGood. We don\u2019t want any unnecessary bloodshed.\u201d</p><p>Darcy exhaled in relief. Speaking as the kidnappee, she was delighted to know that bloodshed was to be avoided until necessary. Not that she wanted to know what would be considered necessary.</p><p>Their footsteps got closer, then three men were standing in front of her. She recognized her two kidnappers, who stood with a new guy, also in a demon mask. He was taller than the other two, and stronger. Something he proved when he turned on the non-Bill one and grabbed him by the throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d he demanded, shaking the smaller man like a dog shakes something tasty just before he kills it.</p><p>Bill danced from foot to foot, although he didn\u2019t rush in to help his friend. \u201cWe got her, boss. Just like you said. The president\u2019s daughter. This is her.\u201d</p><p>The leader released non-Bill and curled his hands into fists. He stared at Darcy through the slits of the mask and growled.</p><p>\u201cNot this one, you idiot. The other one. Lauren. No one cares about this one.\u201d</p><p>Less than thirty minutes later the van came to a stop. Darcy was still too stunned to react, even as the rear doors opened and the two men reached in to pull her out. One of them cut the bindings on her wrists while the other collected her purse and tossed it on the ground next to her. The broken sandal followed. Then they ran back to the front of the van, jumped inside, and sped away.</p><p>She had enough functioning brain left to look for a license plate\u2014there wasn\u2019t one\u2014and to note the color and make of the van. Then she sank down on the curb of the deserted loading area at the rear of the mall and rested her filthy arms on her scraped and bloodied knees and her head on her arms.</p><p>This hadn\u2019t happened, she told herself, even as the truth of it settled around her like a hot, sticky fog. She\u2019d been rejected by kidnappers, which made the event a new high in a lifetime of lows.</p><p>Talk about a photo opportunity, she thought grimly. Here she was, battered, bruised, cut up, scraped. Her clothes were dirty and torn, her shoes broken, and she\u2019d just been tossed aside like a used tissue.</p><p>Darcy straightened, pulled the tape off her mouth, then gasped as skin tore with the adhesive. That wasn\u2019t going to be pretty as it healed. She felt around on the cement until she found her purse and pulled out the panic button. Better late than never, she thought as she pressed down on the bright red button and waited for the cavalry.</p><p>Lieutenant Commander Joe Larson had always considered the admiral a reasonable, if distant, commanding officer. All that had changed at 9:18 the previous evening. The admiral wanted someone\u2019s head on a stick, and he was gunning for Joe\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of half-assed, goddamn asshole...\u201d</p><p>The tirade continued, but Joe didn\u2019t bother listening as his captain got reamed. He could figure out the highlights without hearing them. Besides, the captain would be passing them along personally to Joe soon enough.</p><p>Such was the chain of command. The admiral chewed out the captain, the captain chewed out him, and he, well, Joe hadn\u2019t decided what he was going to do. Like they said\u2014shit rolled downhill.</p><p>He crossed to the window of the office foyer and stared at the activity below. There was plenty of it at the Naval Amphibious Base. And just beyond the building, the Pacific Ocean sparkled in the bright summer morning. Other careers might offer better pay, but none could beat the location on Coronado Island. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Given the admiral\u2019s temper, there was every chance Joe could soon be exploring those other careers. Or stationed on a naval base in Greenland. Screwups came in all shapes and sizes. This one had all the potential firepower of an aircraft carrier. Explaining to the captain that it hadn\u2019t been his fault wasn\u2019t going to change a damn thing.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the door to the captain\u2019s office opened and the admiral stormed out. Joe stood at attention as the angry man stalked by, then he looked at his commanding officer.</p><p>\u201cCome on in, Joe,\u201d the other man said in a weary voice.</p> <p>Joe entered then closed the door behind him. \u201cSir.\u201d</p><p>Captain Phillips waved to the empty chair in front of his desk. \u201cYou hear all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Phillips, a tall man in his early forties, sighed. \u201cHe loved that boat.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t respond. The information wasn\u2019t news. The admiral had been restoring his nearly eighty-year-old boat for the past five years. The engine was new, and the electronics state-of-the-art, but the rest of it was original, lovingly sanded and varnished by the admiral\u2019s own hand.</p> <p>The man\u2019s wife had left him, claiming she refused to come in second to a floating hunk of wood, and his children rarely visited, knowing they would be put to work on the boat. Six months ago the admiral had decided to live aboard.</p><p>Then, last night, at 9:18, the admiral\u2019s pride and joy had been accidentally blown up by men under Joe\u2019s command. They were lucky the admiral hadn\u2019t been on board at the time.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what happened?\u201d the captain asked.</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cThe team was celebrating being back,\u201d he said. The Navy SEAL team in question had just returned from six months of hazardous duty out of the country. \u201cThey\u2019d all made it out alive. Even Grayson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing?\u201d the captain asked.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Grayson is still in the hospital, sir. He\u2019s recovering from his injuries.\u201d</p> <p>Grayson had been shot on their last op. His men had brought him back and kept him alive until he\u2019d been evacuated to the hospital ship, then brought back home.</p><p>Joe remained perfectly still as he continued. \u201cI spoke with the men on the team yesterday afternoon. They\u2019d had six missions back to back, with minimal downtime in between. I suggested they burn off some steam.\u201d</p><p>Phillips nodded. \u201cThey decided on boat races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Made sense. To a SEAL, the water was a second home. \u201cThey used small boats and kept within the marina speed limit.\u201d Sort of. \u201cUnfortunately their racing course took them over a BUDS training exercise.\u201d</p><p>The future SEALs had been in their second round of training, learning to dive and work with explosives underwater.</p><p>\u201cLast night the explosives were live. Apparently the movement of the boats racing overhead confused a few of the trainees. They\u2019re not allowed to surface to get their bearings. Instead of putting their explosives on the target, they placed them on the admiral\u2019s boat.\u201d</p><p>Talk about plain bad luck, Joe thought grimly. \u201cThe explosives were small and shouldn\u2019t have caused much damage. Unfortunately the admiral had recently refueled his craft. There was a small leak in the engine. When the explosive went off, it triggered a chain reaction that turned the admiral\u2019s pride and joy into kindling. At least that\u2019s the preliminary report.\u201d</p><p>Captain Phillips didn\u2019t speak for several seconds. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me that the admiral tied up in a restricted area? That he shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d What was the point? Joe had been in the navy long enough to know excuses only made the situation worse. Besides, who would have told an admiral to move his boat?</p><p>\u201cYou have a great career,\u201d his captain told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard, moved up the ranks. I was confident you\u2019d make it to admiral yourself, before you retired.\u201d</p><p>Joe had walked into some of the most dangerous situations in the world and lived to tell the tale, but nothing he\u2019d experienced prepared him for the sense of fury that gripped him as he sat there and heard his career talked about in the past tense. The navy was all he knew, all he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>He\u2019d told the men to go have fun. It was his responsibility. Technically, he could pass the punishment on down, but next in line was Lieutenant Grayson, currently missing most of his right leg and facing a long road to recovery.</p><p>No. This time the chain of command stopped here. With Joe.</p><p>Phillips flipped open a file. \u201cYou\u2019ve been with the SEALs nearly ten years, Joe. You\u2019re a fine officer and one of the best men I\u2019ve ever worked with. The admiral wants you punished, and I want to save your career if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Joe said, feeling the first hint of relief.</p><p>The captain smiled. \u201cYou might want to hold off on your thanks. The best way I know to punish you is to temporarily reassign you to a special project that has nothing to do with the SEALs. The best way I know to save your ass is to get you the hell out of here for a few weeks and let the admiral cool down. As an interesting point of fact, my brother-in-law is fairly high up the chain of command in the Secret Service. I don\u2019t think you knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Joe said, not sure what the information had to do with anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned you have family here in California,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe Marcellis. They own a winery just north of Santa Barbara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Joe had no idea what was going on, but he didn\u2019t like it. Technically he was related to the Marcelli clan, but they weren\u2019t his family.</p><p>\u201cWhat you don\u2019t know,\u201d the captain said, \u201cis that the president\u2019s daughter was kidnapped yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Joe stiffened as he pictured the attractive, curvy blonde who frequently served as the president\u2019s hostess. \u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The other one. Darcy. Apparently they grabbed her by mistake\u2014Lauren was their actual target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could they screw that up?\u201d Joe asked. Darcy was nothing like her sister in looks or temperament.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows. The point is, both women are being taken out of Washington and sent to different locations. Safe houses, if you will. They\u2019ll have their usual Secret Service protection, but until the kidnappers are caught, they need to lay low. This is all confidential, Joe. You aren\u2019t to discuss this information with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, sir.\u201d Joe had no problem keeping quiet. What he didn\u2019t understand was what any of it had to do with him.</p><p>Captain Phillips leaned forward. \u201cThere is some concern about Darcy. She\u2019s not generally cooperative, and frankly no one wants to be locked up in a safe house with her. The thought is if she can be kept safe but still have a semblance of a life, it will be easier for all concerned. Basically a place that is isolated but not solitary. I thought of what you\u2019ve told me about your family\u2019s winery. There\u2019s a large house, plenty of room for the team and Darcy. I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to convince you to take this assignment. After last night, I don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Joe put the rest of the pieces together and didn\u2019t like the finished picture. That was to be his punishment. To babysit the president\u2019s daughter and spend time with the Marcellis.</p><p>\u201cI have a SEAL team heading out in two months,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s important work to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else can take care of that, Joe. Right now the president\u2019s daughter is your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, sending her to the hacienda is an interesting solution,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the winery is not easily guarded. There are hundreds of acres, employees, staff. Plus my relatives would have to be cleared for security purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done. You\u2019re right about the winery being an open space, but who would think to look for her there? The navy is cooperating with the president at his request,\u201d Phillips told him. \u201cUnless you want to call the president and explain why you\u2019re unwilling to protect his daughter?\u201d</p><p>Joe felt the doors of the prison swing closed. \u201cWhat is my assignment, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoordinate with the Secret Service. Their job is to protect Darcy, but you are to facilitate what they need. Be another pair of eyes. Use your tactical skills to their advantage. When the kidnappers are caught, you\u2019ll return here and we\u2019ll see if the admiral has cooled off enough for you to resume your duties. In the meantime, do what you can to keep Darcy Jensen happy.\u201d</p><p>Joe rose and saluted. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said and left.</p><p>He was completely and totally screwed, sent away in disgrace, his career in jeopardy. He would be lucky to come back as an ensign.</p><p>As for keeping Darcy Jensen happy\u2014from what he\u2019d heard, that was a task even a SEAL couldn\u2019t pull off.</p><p>2</p><p>D arcy heard the murmurings of her temporary Secret Service team before she heard the knock on the door. The whispered \u201cSwan is here\u201d warned her of her sister\u2019s approach.</p><p>She stayed in her apartment bedroom, one of the guys in suits would get the door, and continued her packing. In less than four hours she would be whisked away to an undisclosed location for however long it took to find the crazies after her sister. Based on the Secret Service\u2019s current level of competency, she could be gone for months.</p><p>Not knowing where she was headed made packing a problem. All she knew was she was staying in the continental United States and that she was expected to stay very low-key when she arrived.</p><p>News flash\u2014she didn\u2019t want to walk around flaunting herself. One kidnapping in a lifetime was more than enough.</p><p>She grabbed a handful of shorts, some T-shirts and jeans, and tossed them on the bed.</p><p>The bedroom door opened and Lauren entered. The two Secret Service agents with her hovered in the hall then nodded at the single agent standing in the corner of Darcy\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Lauren crossed to Darcy, grabbed her upper arms, and stared into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, sounding near tears. \u201cDid they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Darcy had a few bruises from her ride in the back of the van, some sore muscles, and several raw spots around her wrists from the ropes. She hadn\u2019t slept at all the previous night and couldn\u2019t imagine ever not feeling afraid again. But the agent in the room kept her from saying all that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lauren didn\u2019t release her. \u201cAre you sure? I was so worried.\u201d</p><p>A change, Darcy thought. In the past year, she\u2019d been the one worried about Lauren.</p><p>\u201cIf anything had happened to you...,\u201d Lauren said, those threatening tears finally making an appearance. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to lose one more person I love.\u201d</p><p>Darcy appreciated the sentiment, knew it was true, and told herself neither of them had time for a breakdown. Lauren had finally surfaced from the emotional devastation of the shocking death of her young husband, and Darcy refused to let her sink back into despair over a botched kidnapping. Darcy might be hearing things go bump in the night, but she refused to let her sister be afraid.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath as she took in Lauren\u2019s outfit. The aqua and pink sundress just grazed generous curves in unwrinkled perfection. Delicate pearls graced her sister\u2019s tiny ears. Her sling backs matched her purse, and a narrow woven silver and pearl bracelet completed the ensemble. She wore her long, wavy blond hair pulled back in an elegant clasp. She would fit in equally well having lunch at the club or hosting an afternoon charity event.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always have to dress like an Easter egg?\u201d Darcy asked. \u201cDo you own anything in a primary color? I know you could never wear black. How scandalous. The heavens would open and weep.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s intense gaze never wavered. \u201cAt least I don\u2019t dress like a former rock groupie in mourning. Does every single outfit have to be tone-on-tone black? It\u2019s summer, for heaven\u2019s sake. Lighten up and wear a color.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darcy felt the corners of her mouth turn up slightly. Lauren began to giggle. Laughter escaped, and then they were hugging each other tight. Darcy hung on tighter than usual.</p><p>\u201cWhen they told me what happened, I nearly died,\u201d Lauren whispered in her ear. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I wish it had been me.\u201d</p><p>Darcy straightened. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Trust me on that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they wanted me instead of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they all. That\u2019s the world in which we live. I\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, don\u2019t.\u201d Lauren sighed. \u201cI feel horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Do you know where they\u2019re taking you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. You?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to be safe. Something I\u2019m not sure the moron brigade can do.\u201d</p><p>Lauren shot the agent in the room an apologetic glance then turned on her sister. \u201cDarcy, no. You can\u2019t be mad at your team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? If they\u2019d been doing their job, I wouldn\u2019t have been taken.\u201d From the corner of her eye she saw the agent flinch. Well, too bad. If they\u2019d been doing their job, she would never have realized that she was at risk.</p><p>She\u2019d had Secret Service protection for years and had never considered it more than an annoyance. She\u2019d always known that she and Lauren were technically possible targets, but she\u2019d felt safe surrounded by the grim-faced agents. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not completely their fault,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cNo one was expecting you to be kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>Darcy snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to expect the unexpected. They\u2019re professionals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but they didn\u2019t mean for anything bad to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. They didn\u2019t mean it. Then that makes it all right.\u201d</p><p>Lauren might technically be the firstborn, but she had the personality of a middle child\u2014always seeing the other person\u2019s side of things. It was a trait Darcy found annoying on occasion, even as she admired it.</p><p>\u201cDarcy...,\u201d her sister began.</p><p>Darcy waved her off. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. They\u2019ll be on their toes now. That\u2019s what matters. So we\u2019ll head off to our separate but equal locations and wait for the crazies to be caught.\u201d</p><p>And then what? She\u2019d tried to live a normal life, but it was impossible while her father was in office.</p><p>\u201cThere was so much to cancel,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI had two benefits, and I was going to be at a state dinner.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWeren\u2019t you flying to New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Darcy didn\u2019t want to think about that either.</p> <p>Lauren groaned. \u201cYour interview. When is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday.\u201d</p><p>Being the president\u2019s daughter put her in the unique position of being unemployable in her chosen field. She was a graphic artist with a master\u2019s in marketing. But, as the dozens of companies she\u2019d applied to over the past couple of years had told her, no client wanted to turn down a presentation by someone so close to the president. It could be very bad for business. Rather than put their clients in such an awkward position, she\u2019d been passed over time and again.</p><p>A small firm in New York had been willing to take a chance on her. Now she was unlikely to make her second interview, and telling them why wasn\u2019t going to make them want to hire her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you explained,\u201d Lauren said, looking so earnest Darcy actually laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I was recently kidnapped and have to lay low until the culprits are found? I don\u2019t think that will win me employee of the month.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cI know this life is hard for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know you love it,\u201d Darcy said without rancor. It was true\u2014public life suited her sister. Lauren was never happier than when she was cutting a ribbon at some hospital wing opening, or serving as their father\u2019s hostess for a formal dinner for three hundred. Darcy would rather be staked naked in the desert on top of a nest of fire ants.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said before tender-hearted Lauren started to cry again. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Have you met your new security team?\u201d she asked, to change the subject to something more neutral.</p><p>\u201cNo. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of them. Alex Vanmeter. He\u2019s downstairs. He looks competent, but I\u2019ll be grilling him later to make sure he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>Lauren stared at her. \u201cThe incredibly hunky guy who looks like a street fighter? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I was sure.\u201d Darcy shook her head. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m actually not interested in his looks right now. He could be a troll, as long as he\u2019s a troll who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>She crossed to her dresser and pulled out bras and panties, then tucked them into the suitcase. She\u2019d already packed up her art supplies and her laptop.</p><p>Lauren walked to the window and stared down at the Secret Service team below. \u201cWhat happened to the two guys assigned to you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d Darcy didn\u2019t think they were in a good place for having lost her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I doubt they were taken out back and shot.\u201d Although in her mind, they more than deserved a good beating. Or maybe a kidnapping. Let them feel what she\u2019d experienced. Toss them in the back of a filthy van driven by demon-headed guys named Bill and force them to open a purse with their teeth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI feel bad for them. And you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Doesn\u2019t seeing both sides ever make you tired?\u201d</p><p>Lauren rolled her eyes. \u201cDesperately. I mostly do it to make you crazy.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grinned. \u201cYou usually succeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Lauren turned serious. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Darcy figured that in time she would be able to sleep and the flashes of terror would recede. Until then, she would simply fake her way through it. That had always worked for her before. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll be able to talk by phone on secure lines. I want to hear about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Lauren moved close, and they hugged again. \u201cI love you,\u201d her sister whispered.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too. Be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my line,\u201d Lauren said as she stepped back and waved.</p><p>Darcy watched her go then turned back to her packing. For the moment, the fear was gone, but in its place was a dark and lonely space.</p><p>Joe arrived at the Marcelli winery shortly after four in the afternoon. He\u2019d put off leaving as long as he could, which had meant all of the morning, but he\u2019d known better than to linger much past noon. He might be entering hell on earth, but he was still a naval officer. His job was to follow orders.</p><p>As he turned onto the road that led to the three-story hacienda, he studied the pale yellow stucco structure as he might an enemy target, or a place he would have to defend.</p><p>Too many windows and exits, he thought grimly as he took in the French doors leading to balconies and the decorative wrought iron that would allow someone in reasonable shape to climb from flower beds to the tile roof. Trees that others would think provided comfortable shade in the August heat showed him places snipers could hide.</p><p>Beyond the house was a multicar garage that could conceal at least fifty armed men, and less than a quarter mile beyond that were the various buildings of the winery.</p><p>Perfect, he thought grimly as he pulled his truck up behind the house and turned off the engine. Maybe someone could call in one of those entertainment networks to announce Darcy Jensen\u2019s location to add to the challenge.</p><p>The rear door of the house opened, and a man stepped onto the porch. Joe recognized Marco Marcelli, his biological father.</p><p>\u201cJoe! You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Marco hurried to the truck and met Joe as he closed the driver\u2019s door behind him.</p><p>Marco studied him for a second before wrapping both arms around Joe in a welcoming hug. Joe accepted the embrace\u2014to do otherwise would invite conversations he didn\u2019t want to have, then when he was free, he stepped back and glanced around.</p><p>\u201cA lot of grapes,\u201d he said, motioning to the vines heavy with fruit.</p><p>\u201cA good year,\u201d Marco said. \u201cBrenna and Grandpa Lorenzo are excited about the harvest. More wine means more excuses for Colleen and me to travel as we sell the wine. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded, as if the information had meaning. The Marcellis were wine. Marco\u2019s children were the fourth generation to grow grapes on this stretch of land. He and his wife, Colleen, were responsible for sales.</p><p>Marco patted the side of the truck. \u201cYou usually travel light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to be here,\u201d Joe said, wishing that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fit everything on my motorcycle, so I rented the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t told us much,\u201d Marco told him. \u201cBut several people from the government have been all over the property and have spoken with everyone in the family. They picked you to help.\u201d</p><p>Joe heard the pride in Marco\u2019s voice and thought about telling him that the only reason any of this was happening was because Joe\u2019s men had screwed up.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d brief everyone at once,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI guess we should do that first, before I unpack.\u201d</p><p>Marco patted his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re staying here for a while, Joe. We want...\u201d The older man hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019re helping because of you.\u201d</p><p>Joe knew what he was trying to do\u2014show that the family would be there for him. Marco, like every other Marcelli, had spent the past three years doing his best to convince Joe he was one of them.</p><p>Joe knew different. He might share bloodlines, but they had nothing else in common, and they would never be his family.</p><p>\u201cTessa made up your room,\u201d Marco said.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d He looked at the man who thought of himself as Joe\u2019s father. \u201cYou know this is temporary. I\u2019m only staying until the job is done.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re still a navy man.\u201d</p><p>The back door opened again. A small, elderly woman with gray hair piled on her head walked onto the porch. \u201cJoseph? Is that you? So that\u2019s what they\u2019re teaching officers these days? That it\u2019s polite to keep an old woman waiting?\u201d</p><p>Despite his dislike of the assignment and the pressure he felt being back at the winery, Joe couldn\u2019t help smiling as he crossed to the house and climbed the three back stairs.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tessa, that\u2019s not what they teach me,\u201d he said as he bent down to gather her close. Too late he remembered her need to pinch every cheek in range. Her forefinger and thumb closed over his skin with enough strength to snap steel. He might have survived a gunshot wound and a couple of knife fights, but man, could she make him wince.</p><p>\u201cLet me look at you,\u201d she said, grabbing him by the hand and dragging him into the kitchen. \u201cThe government has sent people here. They talk to us and ask questions. They say we need clearance, but they won\u2019t say for what.\u201d She humphed. \u201cAs if we would be a danger to anyone. Now.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in the center of the kitchen and studied him from head to toe. Her dark eyes missed nothing as she frowned and poked him in the stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating enough. You look skinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI weigh exactly the same as I did the last time I was here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou were too skinny then, too. All that exercise. It\u2019s not good for you. I\u2019m going to feed you while you\u2019re here. You\u2019ll eat good food. What do you have at the place you live? Junk food? A man your age on his own. It\u2019s not a good thing.\u201d Her expression softened as she took his hand in hers and rubbed his fingers. \u201cJoseph, you need to be married, eh? A wife would know how to take care of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a familiar conversation, one he refused to participate in. \u201cWho else is at the hacienda?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grandma Tessa narrowed her gaze. \u201cYour mother and Lorenzo. They\u2019ll be here in a few minutes. So what is this all about?\u201d</p><p>Just then Colleen Marcelli walked into the kitchen. She was a well-dressed, petite woman a year or so shy of fifty. Her stylish clothes and unlined face made her look much younger, but Joe could do the math. He\u2019d just turned thirty-three, which meant Colleen had had him when she was still in high school.</p> <p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she breathed when she saw him. Her expression blended hope and longing in a painful combination. He could deal with the rest of them, but seeing Colleen always made him feel guilty. He couldn\u2019t shake the sense of being a real bastard every time he held her at arm\u2019s length. He knew what she wanted\u2014what they all wanted.</p><p>Rather than deal with the guilt, he stepped forward and hugged her. Before he straightened, Lorenzo Marcelli, the aging patriarch, strolled into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re back,\u201d the elder Marcelli growled. \u201cThey\u2019re snooping around here like we\u2019re a bunch of terrorists. Send them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my job description,\u201d Joe said as he released his mother and shook hands with Marco\u2019s father. \u201cYou\u2019re looking well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m old,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cThis is all a bunch of nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPop, it\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Marco said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Lorenzo complained. \u201cNone of us do. If those agents trample even one grape, there will be hell to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo!\u201d Tessa reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a rosary. \u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Lorenzo thumped the cane he\u2019d started using about a year ago and made his way to the large kitchen table in the center of the room. \u201cWell, get on with it. Tell us why we\u2019ve been taken over like an enemy country.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded at Marco, who led Colleen and Tessa to chairs by Lorenzo\u2019s. When they were seated, he began.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you is classified information. You are not to discuss it with anyone outside of the immediate family.\u201d</p> <p>Tessa reached for Lorenzo\u2019s hand, and Colleen shivered. \u201cThat sounds so serious,\u201d she said nervously.</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d he told her. \u201cTwo days ago the president\u2019s daughter was kidnapped. She got away, but the kidnappers are still out there.\u201d</p><p>Tessa gasped and clutched her beads tighter. \u201cWho would do that? She\u2019s a lovely girl. So pretty and always helping with those little children.\u201d</p><p>Colleen nodded. \u201cIt was so sad when she lost her husband. Their wedding was so beautiful. They\u2019d barely been married a year when he was killed in that car accident. She got so sad afterward.\u201d She reached for Marco. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what she must have gone through, missing him so much.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo frowned. \u201cWhat does this have to do with us? What do we care about his daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo!\u201d Tessa glared at him. \u201cWe care. Lauren Jensen-Smith is a lovely girl.\u201d She turned her attention to Joe. \u201cHow can we help?\u201d Even as she asked the question, her breath caught. \u201cOh! Is she coming here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Joe said, wondering why they\u2019d done the same thing he had\u2014jumped to the conclusion that it was Lauren who was in trouble and not Darcy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have the president\u2019s daughter here, but it won\u2019t be Lauren,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be the other one. Darcy.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment of silence. Colleen released her husband\u2019s arm and smoothed down her skirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s very nice, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat other one?\u201d Lorenzo asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about her. Except she never bothered to get married and have babies to make her family proud.\u201d</p><p>With that he pushed to his feet and used his cane to help him turn. \u201cThis is all a waste of time if you ask me,\u201d he grumbled as he slowly limped out of the room.</p><p>Tessa rose as well. \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re not sending Lauren? A nice, pretty girl like that needs to be married.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cMaybe to an officer.\u201d</p><p>Joe held in a groan. Right. Because his life wasn\u2019t hellish enough already. Fortunately a knock on the back door prevented him from responding. He crossed the kitchen and opened it.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander Joseph Larson?\u201d the woman on the other side asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Special Agent Paige Newberry. I saw you arrive and thought I would introduce myself to you and meet the family.\u201d</p><p>She stepped inside and shook his hand. Paige was tall, only a couple of inches shorter than his own six feet. She wore a dark pants suit and a concealed sidearm. Short hair framed attractive features.</p><p>He was used to judging people in a matter of seconds. Joe\u2019s first impression of Special Agent Newberry was that she was intelligent, competent, and ready to play on a team. Thank God he wasn\u2019t in this alone.</p><p>Joe had been briefed early that morning. While the Secret Service was in charge of Darcy and her protection, Joe was there to act as liaison with the family and to offer any expertise the Secret Service might require. As he doubted they wanted or needed his help, he was little more than a glorified babysitter. None of which was the agent\u2019s fault.</p><p>Joe led her into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cThis is Special Agent Paige Newberry,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s in charge of Darcy Jensen\u2019s personal security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually Special Agent Alex Vanmeter is in charge of this operation,\u201d Paige said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s with Darcy right now. They\u2019ll be arriving in the morning. I am, however, one of the agents who will be in close contact with Darcy at all times.\u201d</p><p>Tessa nodded. \u201cYou call her by her first name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. At her request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Tessa Marcelli,\u201d Joe said by way of introduction. \u201cMarco Marcelli and his wife, Colleen.\u201d</p><p>Paige shook hands with all of them. Colleen moved to the ever-present coffeepot and began to pour. \u201cThis is really difficult to take in. The president\u2019s daughter. Here. What are we supposed to do? How do we act? What do we call her?\u201d</p><p>Paige smiled. \u201cI think she\u2019d like Darcy best. In fact I would prefer that you use first names with all of us. That way we don\u2019t call attention to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Colleen looked at her dark suit. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude, but you\u2019re not exactly fitting in with the locals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I brought more casual clothes with me. I thought I\u2019d wait until Special Agent Vanmeter arrives before changing.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at Paige. There was something about the way she said \u201cSpecial Agent Vanmeter.\u201d He couldn\u2019t put his finger on the inflection, but he would bet it meant something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked with him before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Paige nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s excellent. Very thorough. Darcy will be safe, as will your family, Lieutenant Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agreed on first names,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Tessa began pulling food out of the refrigerator. \u201cSit. Sit. You need to eat. Marco, bring Paige some wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no thanks. I can\u2019t drink on duty.\u201d</p><p>Tessa waved away her words. \u201cYou said Darcy won\u2019t arrive until the morning. Be on duty then.\u201d</p><p>Joe led her to the table and sat across from her. In a matter of seconds, seemingly from nowhere, food appeared. Salads, fixings for sandwiches, three kinds of cookies, bread, cheese, and of course pasta. He was used to the quantity of the spread, but Paige looked stunned.</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cYou\u2019d better eat, or they\u2019ll get surly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019ll eat,\u201d Tessa said as she set wineglasses in front of them. \u201cSo, Paige, are you married?\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Paige and Joe escaped the clutches of Grandma Tessa, as she\u2019d insisted on being called, and stepped out in the sunset. Paige had enjoyed the home-cooked food, even if it came with a pretty big side of matchmaking.</p><p>\u201cInteresting family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s determined to get me married,\u201d Joe said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019ve stood strong against her all these years. Impressive.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged then glanced around at the vineyards, which stretched for miles.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think you can protect Darcy Jensen here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Paige wasn\u2019t sure if his question was simple conversation or a genuine concern. \u201cThe location is a compromise, but I think it\u2019s a good one. Who knows how long it will take to track down the kidnappers? I understand Darcy\u2019s need to be in a place where she won\u2019t get claustrophobic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter claustrophobic than dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but we\u2019re going to keep her alive.\u201d She walked toward the guesthouse, which would serve as both her sleeping quarters and temporary headquarters. \u201cDarcy will be kept close to the house for the first few days. We\u2019ll have agents in the tasting rooms and other tourist areas to keep them from getting anywhere near the hacienda. I\u2019ve already spoken with Brenna Marcelli about that. She was more than cooperative.\u201d She glanced at the naval officer at her side. \u201cYour sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of four,\u201d Joe said. \u201cShe runs this winery, along with a smaller one. Her husband owns Wild Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Paige remembered her briefing notes and the interview she\u2019d had the previous day. \u201cNic Giovanni. He\u2019s cooperating as well. In fact everyone has been more than helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky us.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Joe. He was tall, good-looking, and had a service record that would make anyone proud. But she would bet her next three paychecks he didn\u2019t want to be here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting as our liaison with the family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to serve.\u201d</p><p>The fine hairs on the back of her neck rose. She felt like an angry cat trying to puff up to look more intimidating. She might be a hell of an agent, but Joe Marcelli had been a SEAL. In a one-on-one situation, she didn\u2019t stand a chance. Still, that wouldn\u2019t stop her from taking him on.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander Larson,\u201d she said, keeping her voice steady and firm, \u201cI cannot stress the importance of this assignment enough. We are protecting the life of the daughter of the president of the United States. Two days ago someone got close enough to abduct her. She was forcibly taken, tied up, and threatened. Do you think there was even one moment in her life that prepared her for that kind of terror?\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t look much more than bored with the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m a naval officer, Special Agent Newberry. I\u2019ll do my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. I\u2019m willing to take a bullet for her. If you can\u2019t offer that same level of commitment, I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the authority to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned in slightly. \u201cWant to test that theory? Nothing is going to happen to Darcy Jensen on my watch. I don\u2019t care what I have to do or who I have to offend to keep her safe. If you\u2019re not fully on this team, then you\u2019re in my way. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>His expression didn\u2019t change, but she saw something flash in his eyes. Respect, maybe. However grudgingly given, she would accept it.</p><p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d he said, sounding surprised.</p><p>\u201cI do. I\u2019ve worked with Darcy before. She\u2019s funny, smart, and not interested in being the center of attention. That makes my job easier, and I appreciate that. So are you on board?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA hundred percent.\u201d</p><p>Paige accepted his word because she had to, but she vowed to keep an eye on him. SEAL or not\u2014if he got in her way, she was taking him down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darcy had spent the previous night in a small house on the edge of Baltimore. This morning, after a short flight to Florida, she\u2019d been delivered to another nondescript location on the edge of what looked like a massive swamp. She\u2019d been warned not to leave the house, not to make phone calls, and not to answer the door under any circumstances.</p><p>Oh, right. Because she wanted to make a general statement, announcing her location to the world.</p><p>Someone knocked on the bedroom door. Darcy refused to be seen as a coward, so she uncurled on the bed and sat up.</p> <p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, expecting Alex Vanmeter, the special agent in charge of her security and Drew\u2019s replacement.</p><p>Alex stepped in and nodded at her. \u201cYour father will be here in fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>Darcy blinked at him. \u201cMy father? He\u2019s in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s flying back to D.C. tonight and is stopping by to see you.\u201d</p><p>Before Darcy could say anything, Alex touched the ever-present earpiece and then nodded. \u201cFalcon is on the ground.\u201d</p> <p>Meaning her father had landed and was being driven to the safe house.</p><p>She stood. As Alex excused himself, she entered the bathroom attached to the bedroom and ran a brush through her short, dark hair. She looked tired and either sick or shell-shocked. Makeup could help, but there wasn\u2019t much time.</p><p>Exactly fourteen minutes later, President Ryan Jensen walked into her temporary bedroom.</p><p>\u201cDarcy,\u201d he said when his assigned agent had swept the room then left them alone. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the doctors faxed you a medical report. You tell me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan Jensen had served as vice president for four years before running for the head job. He was eighteen months into his first term. The stresses of the office aged some men, but not her father. Oh, there were a few more gray hairs at his temples, but that only made him more attractive. Last year he\u2019d had to deal with the embarrassing reality of being named the country\u2019s most eligible bachelor.</p> <p>Right now, though, the leader of the free world looked annoyed and frustrated. \u201cDarcy, I\u2019m on a very tight schedule. I changed my flight plan to come by and see you. That has to mean something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, Dad. Really. I hope you\u2019re not keeping anyone important waiting. I mean it\u2019s been nearly forty-eight hours since the kidnapping. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted you to rush to my side or anything.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cI phoned when I was informed about the kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did, and it was a very touching call. Did I thank you for it? I meant to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d he muttered. \u201cFine. Be angry with me or whomever you\u2019d like. Regardless, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re all right and I want you to stay safe. For once, listen to what the agents tell you to do, will you?\u201d</p><p>The unfairness of the request took her breath away. She\u2019d always listened. They were the ones who had let her down.</p><p>But what was the point in trying to explain anything? Ryan Jensen had stopped hearing her years ago.</p><p>\u201cBe grateful you got away without getting hurt,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Darcy thought about the still-healing scratches on her legs, the rope burns on her wrists, and the pain in her heart. There had been plenty of wounding, but it wasn\u2019t the kind he meant.</p><p>Someone knocked on the closed door. Ryan Jensen glanced toward it, then back at her. \u201cI need to get to Washington. You\u2019ll have a secure line up and running at your safe house in a day or so. Check in and let me know how you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I live for,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Darcy.\u201d He looked at her, started to speak, then caught himself. He turned away and was gone.</p><p>When she was alone again, Darcy crawled back onto the bed and pulled her knees to her chest. He was a busy man. She should be grateful he\u2019d diverted to Florida to see her. It could almost mean something.</p><p>But instead of convincing herself, she remembered a dark night ten years before. When he\u2019d glared at her and yelled that she wasn\u2019t his daughter. She never had been.</p><p>Later, he\u2019d apologized. He\u2019d spoken in anger and grief. He hadn\u2019t meant it.</p><p>Regardless of his contrition, he\u2019d spoken the truth. Ryan Jensen wasn\u2019t her father. That long-ago night the lies fell away, and his words had changed her forever.</p><p>3</p><p>T he plane left Florida shortly after daybreak, which, with the time difference, meant an early arrival in California. Darcy hadn\u2019t known their destination until an hour into the flight, when Alex Vanmeter had informed her they would be landing at a naval base north of Los Angeles.</p><p>As she stepped off the plane usually used to transport the vice president, she saw three black SUVs parked on the tarmac. Secret Service agents flanked her, making it difficult to get down the steep flight of stairs. The second her feet touched the ground, Alex moved in, took her arm, and hustled her to the middle SUV. He opened the door and slid in beside her.</p><p>\u201cPigeon is safe,\u201d he said into the microphone at the inside of his left wrist. \u201cMove out.\u201d</p><p>Seconds later, all three vehicles drove away from the plane.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re taking my security seriously,\u201d she said as she gazed out the window.</p><p>\u201cWe always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I have a kidnapping that says, not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other team screwed up. That won\u2019t happen on my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really want to believe you, but you\u2019re going to have to earn my trust. If that sort of thing matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. A comfortable subject is more likely to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at the man sitting next to her. Late thirties, she would guess. About five ten and strong. She could see the ripple of muscles through the suit jacket he wore. There was something about him. Something not quite civilized. As if he hadn\u2019t grown up in the company of polite society.</p><p>Bad boy turned good guy? She wouldn\u2019t want to bet against him in a street fight, a thought she found comforting.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think after what happened I\u2019m going to be difficult?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou have a reputation for being a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Darcy knew all about that. The press wasn\u2019t fond of her because when her father had been running for vice president, she\u2019d traveled in the press bus as part of an internship project for one of her college classes. Instead of reporting on the campaign, she\u2019d written an expos\u00e9 on several members of the press corps, detailing who had substance-abuse problems, who was having an affair, and who had a thing for underaged campaign workers.</p><p>She also didn\u2019t play the political game very well. But she\u2019d never screwed with her Secret Service team.</p><p>\u201cGet back to me with exactly one time when I ducked out or escaped them,\u201d she said, holding her temper in check. \u201cOr when I did something they told me not to do. I might have a reputation for being difficult, Alex, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>Darcy turned to look at the SUV in front of theirs. To the casual observer, their little convoy was nothing more than three vehicles on the same road. No one else would know there were a total of seven agents and one relative of the president leaving the navy base that morning.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lauren going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alex glanced at her. His dark blue eyes never wavered. \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a security risk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the fewer people who know, the better. You don\u2019t want anything happening to your sister.\u201d</p><p>He made it a statement rather than a question, but it was still true.</p><p>Darcy leaned back in the leather seat and wondered what would happen now. How long would she be kept isolated for her own good, and when could she get back to her regular life, such as it was? She\u2019d already called and canceled her interview in New York. There was no way she could make it, and she wasn\u2019t allowed to explain the reason why. Normal was something the rest of the world took for granted. What she wouldn\u2019t give to be one of them, even for a little while.</p><p>Alex glanced at her. \u201cHave you slept since the kidnapping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she lied, not wanting to talk to him about it. Alex Vanmeter might be exactly the right person to keep her safe, but he wasn\u2019t the warm and friendly type. Besides, she didn\u2019t generally confide in people she\u2019d just met. With enough concealer and the right light, she could keep her lack of sleep a secret until she was able to close her eyes without feeling the fear.</p><p>The lead SUV signaled a turn. Darcy glanced out the window and realized they were leaving the freeway and heading into what looked like a very picturesque part of Tuscany.</p><p>\u201cThey grow grapes here?\u201d she asked as she stared at acres and acres of vineyards.</p><p>\u201cYes. The Marcelli family has owned this land over eighty years. Four generations of winemakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarcelli.\u201d The name was vaguely familiar. \u201cAs in Marcelli Wines?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is where I\u2019ll be staying?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. The family was pleased to cooperate. You should be safe here.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked at the heavy, lush grapevines, the tall trees lining the road, and the vineyard sparkling in the distance.</p><p>\u201cNot bad duty,\u201d she said, picturing an old-style bed-and-breakfast with a view of the ocean. No doubt she and her Secret Service team would take over a wing of the building. There wouldn\u2019t be much to do, but she could catch up on her reading. Lying low had never looked so good.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later they turned off the road and onto a long driveway. Darcy didn\u2019t see any signs for a hotel or a bed-and-breakfast. Instead she saw what looked like a large, pale yellow, three-story house decorated with wrought iron balconies. There were several outbuildings, plenty of trees, and a colorful garden complete with a path and small benches.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with the house?\u201d she asked as the SUV pulled to a stop.</p><p>\u201cThe Marcelli family has lived here since it was built in the late twenties,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>They must own the B and B, too. Made sense.</p><p>Alex stepped out of the SUV and waited for her to do the same. Darcy climbed out and looked around. The air was still and warm, scented with fruit. Make that grapes, she thought as the back door opened and several people hurried down the stairs to the driveway.</p><p>There was an older couple, a not so old couple, an amazingly good-looking guy, some Secret Service agents\u2014easily recognizable by the sunglasses and the dark suits\u2014and Special Agent Paige Newberry.</p><p>\u201cPaige,\u201d Darcy said, grateful to see at least one familiar face. \u201cAt least one person here knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Darcy.\u201d Paige stepped forward and smiled. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Long.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was conscious of everyone watching her. She smoothed the front of her casual black and white sundress. Aware that first impressions mattered, she\u2019d dressed carefully, using makeup, putting on sandals, and digging out another of her bargain handbags that matched.</p><p>She knew her sister would have had something disarming to say, and that in a matter of minutes the entire cast of the Make Room for Lauren ensemble would have been delighted to be a part of her life. Darcy hadn\u2019t received the gift of small talk. Still, she would play the professional political family member, even if she wasn\u2019t that good at it.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said, telling herself to smile to cover her nervousness as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m Darcy Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d the older man said as he thumped his cane on the ground. \u201cThis is all a bunch of nonsense if you ask me. She\u2019s here. We\u2019re here. Now let\u2019s get inside before someone gets sunstroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo!\u201d The elderly woman at his side scolded him. \u201cShe\u2019s the president\u2019s daughter. Show a little respect.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paige stepped between them. \u201cDarcy, allow me to present Mr. and Mrs. Lorenzo Marcelli. They own the winery and all the property here.\u201d Paige pointed to the slightly younger couple. \u201cThis is their son, Marco, and his wife, Colleen. And Lieutenant Commander Joe Larson.\u201d Paige hesitated. \u201cHe\u2019s a former SEAL and our naval liaison with the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m in danger of being kidnapped and taken out to sea?\u201d Darcy asked. \u201cThat\u2019s comforting. Be sure someone stocks me up with Dramamine. Any other surprises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here\u2014\u201d the lieutenant commander said, but he was interrupted when Mrs. Marcelli senior stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Tessa,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cYou should call me Grandma Tessa. Everyone does.\u201d She grabbed Darcy\u2019s upper arms as she studied her. \u201cYou\u2019re much prettier in person than in the pictures. You should smile more. Welcome. It\u2019s good to have you here.\u201d</p><p>Then, before Darcy could react to the comment or the advice, the small, elderly woman reached up and pinched her cheek. The squeeze sent pain shooting through her entire face and made her eyes water.</p><p>\u201cMama, not so hard,\u201d Marco said, putting his arm around his mother and pulling her back. \u201cDon\u2019t scare our guest off.\u201d He smiled. \u201cPaige said we were to call you by your first name. Are you comfortable with that?\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded, still caught up in the pain in her cheek. That little old lady could twist wood with that grip.</p><p>Darcy shook hands with Marco, his wife, and most of the Secret Service team. Last up was Joe Larson.</p> <p>He was tall\u2014maybe six feet\u2014and muscled. Not as big, pound for pound, as Alex, but still a lot of man. He might be navy, but she would bet he could give any member of her team a run for his, or her, money.</p><p>A former SEAL was good, she thought. He\u2019d probably killed bad guys before. She would have to remember to stick close to him.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Commander,\u201d she said as she stared into eyes as dark as a storm. They shook hands.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably get inside,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>The elder Marcelli led the way, followed by his wife. Darcy motioned for Marco and Colleen to follow.</p><p>Darcy paused at the bottom of the steps. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Are we staying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Paige told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in the main house with the family. Alex and I are in the guesthouse.\u201d</p><p>Darcy couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cHere? Have you looked around? Open fields. How are you going to keep me safe? There have to be a thousand places for people to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not open fields, they\u2019re vineyards,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cThanks for the clarification. I\u2019ll be doing a crossword puzzle later. You can stop by and help.\u201d</p><p>Paige touched her arm. \u201cDarcy, this is a good location for you. There\u2019s plenty of protection, but you won\u2019t feel trapped or isolated. Plus the family is pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t interested in the family or anything but not feeling afraid.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTough. Until I hear otherwise from the president, this is where you\u2019re staying,\u201d Alex said sharply.</p> <p>\u201cAlex, no.\u201d Paige turned to Darcy. \u201cLet\u2019s give it a couple of days. I think you\u2019ll like it here.\u201d</p><p>Darcy ignored her. \u201cYou\u2019re the agent in charge?\u201d she asked Alex.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you better do your job. Because I will take this up with my father.\u201d</p><p>A bluff, but Alex didn\u2019t know that.</p><p>Alex shook his head. \u201cTake care of her,\u201d he told Paige, then stalked away.</p><p>Paige looked at Darcy. \u201cYou\u2019re in a mood. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Darcy grimaced. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m scared. My team let me be kidnapped. I\u2019m a little wary of that happening again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex is the best,\u201d Paige told her. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe words sound good, but I\u2019m not much of a believer.\u201d</p><p>The back door opened, and Joe Larson stuck out his head. \u201cYou two coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away,\u201d Paige said easily. \u201cI was explaining to Darcy that there are even more Marcellis in her future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many more?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cDozens,\u201d Joe said as he stepped out onto the porch. \u201cFour sisters, three spouses, three and a half kids. More grandparents, too. Or at least one more. Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea, better known as Grammy M.\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t know what to do with all that information. There was no way she could keep that many people straight.</p><p>\u201cHave they all been checked out?\u201d she asked Paige.</p><p>The Secret Service agent smiled. \u201cYes, and they\u2019re all cleared. I\u2019ve met most of them, but not Grammy M a.k.a. Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea.\u201d She pulled a small notebook out of her jacket pocket and flipped through the pages. \u201cShe\u2019s living just south of Santa Barbara with Gabriel Reese. He\u2019s the grandfather of one of the Marcelli granddaughters\u2019 husbands.\u201d</p><p>Darcy blinked. \u201cI\u2019ll never keep this straight.\u201d</p><p>Paige grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ll have time to study before the quiz.\u201d</p><p>Joe held open the back door. \u201cFood\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>Darcy hesitated, then stepped past him and entered a massive kitchen and was confronted by what had to be three tons of food.</p><p>Grandma Tessa and Colleen carried trays to a huge kitchen table by a row of windows. There were platters of meats, bowls of pastas, mounds of salads, along with at least three different kinds of bread. The scent of simmering sauces competed with the fragrance of cinnamon and fruit.</p><p>The elderly Marcelli walked into the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s ten-thirty in the morning,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cOnly a fool would eat now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLorenzo, stop. We have company. Darcy, come.\u201d Grandma Tessa took her arm. \u201cYou must be hungry. All that travel.\u201d</p><p>As tempting as it all looked, Darcy couldn\u2019t imagine keeping down food. She felt too unsettled. But before she could say anything, Lorenzo limped over to stand in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHow old are you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d He grabbed her left hand and looked at her bare fingers. \u201cNo ring. No husband, no babies. What is it with you women today? Listen to your parents and grandparents. Get married and have babies.\u201d He dropped her hand and poked her in the stomach. \u201cYou need babies.\u201d</p><p>Darcy took a step back. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on that.\u201d</p><p>Colleen sighed heavily. \u201cLorenzo, please. Stop torturing Darcy. At least let her get settled.\u201d She looked around the kitchen and waved at Joe. \u201cWould you take her upstairs and show her around? We\u2019ve put her in Katie\u2019s old bedroom. Brenna and Francesca\u2019s is just too frightening.\u201d Colleen smiled at her. \u201cYou can unpack, then come back down and have something to eat. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>For once Darcy didn\u2019t have a snappy comeback. Not knowing what else to do, she smiled and said, \u201cThat would be very nice. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She followed the naval officer out of the kitchen and down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Joe said as he headed for a flight of stairs.</p><p>The house was large and well kept. She liked the blend of colors, the earth tones that offered welcome. Although a hotel would have made her feel more safe, she could see the charm of the Marcelli home.</p><p>He led the way down a long hallway and stopped at the end. \u201cYou have your own room,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been decorated since Katie was in high school, but it\u2019s comfortable enough. You also have your own bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into a large and airy room decorated in shades of lavender. Before she could take in much more than the white eyelet bedspread and the striped wallpaper, a Secret Service agent entered her room, carrying a large suitcase. Three more followed, each with at least one bag. Paige came last. She handed Darcy a wristband.</p><p>\u201cAutomatic transmitter,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we know where you are at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to be a blip on a monitor.\u201d Darcy took it and snapped it into place. The cold metal was comforting. At least if someone tried to take her away, her team would be instantly alerted.</p><p>When Paige had left, Joe glanced at Darcy. \u201cSo much for being a regular person.\u201d</p><p>Surrounded by luggage, security, and wearing the human version of a homing beacon, she wasn\u2019t in a position to argue.</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would I want to be?\u201d she asked. \u201cTalk about boring. So how exactly does a naval liaison know so much about the Marcelli family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen and Marco are my parents.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d meant to surprise her, he\u2019d succeeded. \u201cBut you have a different last name.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cTrue enough. If there\u2019s anything you need, just ask. The Marcellis lead with their hearts. The Grands will do their best to feed you to death. Colleen will hover and mother you, and the sisters will seduce you with wine, chocolate, and girls\u2019 night out.\u201d</p><p>All of which sounded like fun, but she knew better than to admit that. \u201cWhatever,\u201d she said as she picked up one of the smaller bags and put it on the bed. \u201cSo what are you doing here? Why aren\u2019t you on a ship somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m part of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not Secret Service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the liaison with the family.\u201d</p><p>But why would they need one? \u201cThe navy doesn\u2019t get involved with the personal security of the president\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do now.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cYou were a SEAL?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I got promoted out of active duty and into logistical planning, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re doing if the kidnapper returns.\u201d</p><p>As the bedrooms in the guesthouse were identical, Paige had figured it was safe to claim one for herself without waiting for the special agent in charge to okay the decision. She\u2019d unpacked the night before and begun to familiarize herself with the area around the house. Now she listed all the sections that would have to be checked on a regular basis, such as outbuildings, tree groves, and storage sheds.</p><p>The front door opened. Paige sucked in a breath to brace herself then glanced up as Alex Vanmeter stalked into the small living room.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten older, but then they both had. He was still good-looking, in a rugged, street-fighter kind of way. Barely contained energy radiated from him, making her remember how much heat the two of them had once generated.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to make this a hell of an assignment,\u201d he said as he crossed to the refrigerator, pulled open the door, and checked the contents. \u201cI heard she\u2019s a bitch on wheels, but I thought the other agents were lying. Obviously not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they were,\u201d Paige said. \u201cDarcy isn\u2019t difficult at all.\u201d Or she hadn\u2019t been until today.</p><p>Alex grabbed a bottle of iced tea. \u201cSo you think this attitude of hers is temporary?\u201d</p><p>Paige leaned back in her chair. \u201cShe\u2019s scared, Alex. She was just kidnapped because our department failed to keep her safe. You might want to cut her a break.\u201d</p><p>She used his first name deliberately. He might be in charge and able to pull rank, but she\u2019d seen him naked, and she wasn\u2019t about to let him forget it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve worked with her before,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you know about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat her reputation is a lot more about the press wanting a story than about Darcy herself. She\u2019ll cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to have a choice. Nothing is going to happen to her on my watch. I want to meet with the team in two hours. We\u2019ll review the location, set up a schedule. I want you working the house. I\u2019ll be here, mostly, coordinating everyone. The team will work in eight-hour shifts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paige made notes as he spoke. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one more thing.\u201d He moved close to the table and loomed over her. \u201cAre you going to have a problem with me being in charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together before,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNot in quarters as close as these, and not with me running the op.\u201d</p><p>She stood, dropping her pen on the table. \u201cI asked to be assigned to this team,\u201d she said slowly and deliberately. \u201cI care about Darcy and I want to be a part of keeping her safe. As long as you do your job, I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass who\u2019s in charge. You might be a good agent, Alex, but in private, you\u2019re not all that.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>D arcy unpacked three pairs of linen slacks, jeans, several shirts, and five pairs of shoes, all black. As she held up her third black T-shirt, she felt her lips twitch. Dear God, she really did dress like a rock star groupie in mourning.</p><p>Not the best time in the world to notice, she thought as she carried her clothes to the closet. What with her being abducted the last time she\u2019d gone to the mall, she had a feeling she would be doing all her future purchases online. But maybe she could try a color other than black. Maybe\u2014</p> <p>A knock on the door interrupted her mental list. \u201cCome in,\u201d she called.</p><p>The door opened and a very pretty, very pregnant woman entered. She had long, dark wavy hair, olive skin, and huge brown eyes. She held a bottle of wine in one hand and a glass in the other.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Brenna,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI can\u2019t have wine, but I figured you\u2019d need some.\u201d</p><p>Darcy glanced at the bedside clock. \u201cIt\u2019s barely eleven in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but you\u2019re still on East Coast time.\u201d Brenna grinned. \u201cTrust me. With my family, you need all the help you can get. Drink early and often.\u201d She set the bottle and glass on the dresser. \u201cWow. You have a lot of clothes. And they\u2019re gorgeous. I\u2019m currently shopping in the tent department of the sporting goods store. What a nightmare. Nic and I both really want kids, but I have to tell you, unless he plans to carry the next one, this is the end of the line for me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna lowered herself into the room\u2019s only chair, then sighed. \u201cBetter. Now, you look confused. What didn\u2019t I explain?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy sank down on the edge of the bed. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned, then started to laugh. \u201cSorry. Brenna Marcelli. Well, technically Brenna Giovanni. I live in the next house over, which is about two miles away. I\u2019m one of Marco and Colleen\u2019s daughters. I run Marcelli Wines. I have my own winery, too. Four Sisters. It\u2019s doing great, but that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt as if she\u2019d been caught up in a tornado. \u201cOkay. Am I in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019re in Katie\u2019s. She has much better taste. I shared a room with my twin, Francesca, and let me tell you, you don\u2019t want to stay there. Very scary wallpaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re one of four sisters?\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cKatie\u2019s the oldest. She\u2019s married to Zach, and they have one daughter, Valerie. Francesca is my fraternal twin. She\u2019s married to Sam. They have a fifteen-year-old, his from a previous marriage, and twins who are nearly two and a half. Mia, the youngest of us, has just graduated from Georgetown with a master\u2019s in world domination. She starts her job with the State Department in September. Currently, she\u2019s traveling with friends, enjoying her last summer of leisure. And you\u2019ve already met Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The good-looking naval officer. \u201cI thought being in a political family was complicated, but we\u2019re easy compared to your relatives.\u201d</p><p>Brenna rested her right hand on her swollen belly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They won\u2019t quiz you on the various relationships for at least a week. But this can\u2019t be tough duty. You\u2019re used to hanging out at state dinners. I could never do that. I\u2019m way too opinionated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI avoid state dinners. That\u2019s more my sister\u2019s idea of a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like to be the president\u2019s daughter. Everything would be so public. I mess up enough in my life that I really appreciate being anonymous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are advantages to no one knowing who you are,\u201d Darcy said lightly.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s expression turned sympathetic. \u201cThey told us about the kidnapping. How terrifying. Are you doing okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glanced at the marks on her wrists. \u201cI would think they did. But you\u2019ll be safe here. There are tons of us to protect you. Not that I could really do much. Except maybe sit on the guy until he screamed for mercy. But Joe\u2019s burly. All that SEAL training. Just toss him a Q-Tip and he\u2019ll take on any enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Q-Tip, huh? What could he do with an actual weapon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConquer the known civilized world. Oh!\u201d She pressed down on her belly. \u201cSomeone\u2019s awake. It\u2019s time for soccer practice.\u201d She felt around on both sides of her stomach. \u201cJust the two feet, I think. There can only be two. I couldn\u2019t take more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you expecting more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified I\u2019m having twins. The doctor swears there\u2019s just the one heartbeat, but they\u2019ve been wrong before. I\u2019m a twin, my twin had twins, and I firmly believe God has a sense of humor. Plus, I\u2019m huge. Francesca didn\u2019t even show until fifteen minutes before she gave birth, and Katie gained exactly twenty-seven pounds. I am a freak of nature.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wanted to be sympathetic, but she couldn\u2019t help laughing. If Brenna was an example of the Marcelli sisters, she couldn\u2019t wait to meet them all.</p><p>She heard footsteps in the hallway. Grandma Tessa appeared. \u201cBrenna, there you are. How are you feeling? Are your feet swollen?\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised a foot. \u201cPretty much all the time since late June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you due?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe end of September. Another seven weeks. I don\u2019t think I can stand it. Can someone just knock me out until after the delivery?\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa reached in the pocket of her dress and pulled out a rosary. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. Babies are a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Brenna leaned toward Darcy. \u201cIt\u2019s never good when Grandma Tessa takes a trip around the beads. Just so you know.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tessa sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019re already teaching our guest to be disrespectful. What will your mother think? What will the president think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about him,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa returned her rosary to her pocket. \u201cLunch is at twelve-thirty. Brenna, you\u2019re staying. I called Nic, and he\u2019s joining us. Darcy.\u201d The old woman reached for her hand. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy to have you here with us. I\u2019m going to put you across from Joseph. A pretty face like yours will help his appetite. He doesn\u2019t eat enough. Plus, an officer, eh? Think how nice everyone would look at the wedding.\u201d She winked, released Darcy, and left.</p><p>Darcy stared after her. \u201cAm I being set up?\u201d</p><p>Brenna chuckled. \u201cOh, yeah. Big time. Get used to it. Grandma Tessa\u2019s been trying to marry Joe off for the past three years. Matchmaking is a way of life in this family. As the president\u2019s daughter, you\u2019re something of a catch.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure about that. \u201cIf Joe\u2019s your brother, why does he have a different last name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that\u2019s one of our more interesting stories.\u201d Brenna tucked her hair behind her ears. \u201cMy parents met and fell in love in high school. Neither set of their parents approved\u2014young love never lasts and all that. So when my mom turned up pregnant, the families pressured her to give up the baby for adoption. Which she did.\u201d</p><p>Darcy had expected to hear about a child from a previous marriage. \u201cSo he was raised by someone else?\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad. His adoptive parents were great, but they were killed when he was pretty young. He went into foster care. My sisters and I never knew about him. My parents married right out of high school and are obviously really happy together, but they were crushed to find out what Joe went through. But we found him, and now he\u2019s one of us.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cAt least that\u2019s the goal.\u201d</p><p>Darcy shifted on the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to pry, I just wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Grandpa Lorenzo gets on him to change his name to Marcelli, but Joe resists. He\u2019s still holding back, not ready to be one of us. Which is probably more than you wanted to know, huh?\u201d Brenna slowly pushed to her feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you to unpack. I have some wine I need to check on. See you at lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks for the information on the family.\u201d</p><p>Brenna smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more, but I don\u2019t want to scare you off on your first day. But I\u2019m sure Katie, Mia, and Francesca will be visiting before long. Brace yourself. Remember what I said about drinking wine. It really helps.\u201d</p><p>Joe did his best to duck out of lunch. The last thing he wanted was a big family meal and a lot of questions about his career\u2014as in why wasn\u2019t he leaving the navy to move to the winery\u2014and his love life\u2014had he met someone, when was he getting married and having babies? But when he opened the back door to make his escape, he saw Grammy M and Gabriel arriving, and he could no more run out on her than he could back a car over a puppy. Tessa might perform the strongest cheek pinch on three continents, but Grammy M\u2019s warm smile and lilting Irish voice got him every time.</p><p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she said warmly as she climbed out of the large yellow Cadillac. \u201cI\u2019d heard you\u2019d come home. It\u2019s been far too long since we\u2019ve set eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>He walked down to hug the tiny, old woman. \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo busy for those who love you most?\u201d she asked gently. \u201c\u2019Tis a sad thing when a grandson stays away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo I see. Along with the president\u2019s daughter. Who would have thought. Is she pretty?\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t want to think about Darcy Jensen or the fact that he\u2019d been aware of her from the first second he\u2019d seen her. \u201cShe\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel got out of the car and reached for his cane. \u201cThat Lauren\u2019s a real looker. I can\u2019t say much about her sister. Still, a kidnapping had to take some of the starch out of her sails.\u201d</p><p>He limped up to join Grammy M, then took her arm. \u201cStep aside, sonny,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI\u2019ll be escorting my woman to lunch if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M giggled. \u201cOh, Gabriel. Don\u2019t talk like that in front of the young people. You know it makes them uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandson doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Gabriel said with a cackle. \u201cHe likes knowing the family plumbing still works at my age.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced. He was with Grammy M on this particular topic.</p><p>He followed the older couple into the kitchen, where he found it in the usual Marcelli chaos. Tessa and Colleen carried huge bowls and platters of food to the dining room. Nic had arrived. He managed to call out a greeting to Joe as he helped a very pregnant Brenna out of a chair. Marco carried in several bottles of wine, then paused to kiss his mother-in-law on the cheek. The action caused Tessa to notice that Grammy M had arrived.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re here,\u201d Tessa said in a chilly voice.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to meet Darcy,\u201d Grammy M told her serenely. \u201cSo she could see we weren\u2019t all rigid and judgmental.\u201d</p><p>Tessa bristled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should be around a young woman like that. You could send her down the dark path to hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco headed for his mother while Joe took Grammy M by the arm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you and Gabriel seated,\u201d he said, leading her into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cNowhere near the likes of her,\u201d Grammy M said. \u201cShe\u2019s turned cruel and difficult. It\u2019s amazing what old age will do to a body.\u201d</p> <p>Gabriel leaned close. \u201cShe\u2019s jealous.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M smiled and patted his hand. \u201cPerhaps. I just...\u201d Her voice trailed off. \u201cNo use crying over spilled milk, as my nana used to say. \u2019Tis her loss.\u201d</p><p>Brenna waddled into the room. \u201cYou\u2019re both stubborn,\u201d she said as Nic wrapped his arm around her thick waist. \u201cYou two have been friends for what, thirty-plus years? Why let things get in the way now?\u201d</p><p>Grammy M picked up her napkin. \u201cAsk Tessa. She started it. Tellin\u2019 me I had to choose between her and Gabriel. As if she resented my happiness. That\u2019s not friendship.\u201d</p><p>Nic patted Brenna\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid I tell you not to get involved? Did you listen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate that they don\u2019t talk. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>Tessa bustled into the room. \u201cSit everyone. The food\u2019s all ready. Brenna, you\u2019re there, with Nic beside you. No, save that seat. It\u2019s for Darcy. She\u2019ll be across from Joe.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to look at him as he held in a groan. Shit. He\u2019d been home less than twenty-four hours and this was Tessa\u2019s second attempt at matchmaking.</p><p>Marco came in with a tray of pasta. Colleen followed with baskets of bread. Joe retreated to the kitchen, thinking if he helped carry things maybe he could escape being the center of attention for once.</p><p>An unnecessary plan, he realized when he returned and found everyone focused on Darcy Jensen as she entered the dining room.</p><p>She still wore the fitted sundress she\u2019d had on when she\u2019d arrived. The black and white fabric hugged slender curves. He preferred women on the lush side of the scale, but she wasn\u2019t bad-looking. And she smelled good. He\u2019d always been a sucker for that.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is lunch, I\u2019m not sure I can face dinner,\u201d Darcy said into the silence. \u201cIt, um, looks delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d Brenna told her. \u201cAnd you\u2019re probably one of those disgusting women who can eat what she wants without gaining a pound. It makes me want to hate you, but I won\u2019t.\u201d She waved toward Grammy M. \u201cDarcy, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve met my maternal grandmother and Gabriel. We call her Grammy M, short for Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea. Gabriel Reese is her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cParamour in sin,\u201d Tessa snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019re living together without the benefit of marriage.\u201d She made a quick sign of the cross. \u201cSo have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Marco jumped to pull out Darcy\u2019s chair. Brenna introduced Nic while Colleen hustled her mother-in-law into the kitchen, no doubt to warn her to back off. Joe made himself busy at the buffet, opening bottles of wine.</p><p>Lorenzo walked into the dining room and took his place at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cDamn fool idea to have a big meal in the middle of the day,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNo one will want to work later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning to take a nap anyway,\u201d Brenna said cheerfully. \u201cI have to, what with not sleeping at night. Here\u2019s my question. Why nine months? Why can\u2019t pregnancy last three months, or four? Isn\u2019t that enough? I know I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour time will come,\u201d Grammy M promised. She turned her attention to Darcy. \u201cWelcome, child. How was your journey?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. I came here via Florida. Traveling in secret takes longer than regular travel.\u201d Darcy hesitated, as if not sure what to say. \u201cI, um, appreciate your family taking me in. You\u2019ve all been very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re happy to have you,\u201d Colleen said as she walked back into the dining room with another tray. This one contained a roast and potatoes. After setting everything on the table, she motioned for Joe to take his seat. She did the same, with Tessa following close behind.</p><p>Lorenzo make a great show of tasting his glass of wine, then nodding. \u201cBrenna, this is one of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat merlot-cab blend you didn\u2019t want me to bother with,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect, isn\u2019t it? I told you it would be.\u201d She gazed longingly at the bottle. \u201cI swear the first thing I\u2019m doing after I\u2019m done breast-feeding is getting drunk. I miss wine. I can give up caffeine and processed foods and other alcohol, but I really, really miss wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get there,\u201d Nic said as he kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d she complained. \u201cYou get to drink what you want.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo waited until everyone had a glass, then raised his. \u201cWelcome, Darcy Jensen. Welcome to the family.\u201d</p><p>Brenna raised her water, everyone else picked up their wineglass. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked across the table at Darcy. She looked startled by both the words and the gesture, although she raised her glass and smiled.</p><p>He remembered his first reaction to the Marcelli family and had an idea of what she was feeling. Overwhelmed didn\u2019t cover it. The Marcellis tended to suck people up and make them their own. Once branded, it was difficult to escape.</p><p>As the platters and bowls were passed around, he glanced at her. She listened to the conversation around her but didn\u2019t speak much. He would have expected her to claim all the attention, but she seemed content to observe. She took small portions and didn\u2019t finish them. He could see her collarbone and the hint of ribs where her dress dipped between her breasts. Did she avoid food because of fashion or something else?</p><p>Too skinny. Not his type. And yet...He felt it\u2014the subtle tension between them. A precursor to attraction.</p><p>Not to worry, he told himself. What he felt didn\u2019t matter. As long as he didn\u2019t act on it, he was fine. No woman was worth his career, certainly not this one.</p><p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d Lorenzo said loudly. \u201cYou ordered too many barrels. We have no use for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re not all for us,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe extras are for Nic.\u201d</p><p>Nic looked at his wife with an expression of long-suffering. \u201cI have more than enough barrels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You need to age more of your chardonnay in wood, not stainless steel. Then you blend the two together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna, Wild Sea is my winery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love, but that doesn\u2019t seem to prevent you from doing it all wrong. Take the extra barrels and use them. You\u2019ll see a big increase in the quality of the reserve chardonnay.\u201d</p><p>Darcy leaned toward him. \u201cWhy does it matter what they\u2019re stored in?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he spoke, he knew he should have kept his mouth shut. But it was too late. Lorenzo set down his fork.</p><p>\u201cYou should know,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou are the firstborn grandchild. The only boy. This could have all been yours. But no. You resist. Why? So you can play soldier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPop, stop it,\u201d Marco said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Joe told him. He was used to the old man\u2019s complaints. They didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>\u201cIf he would just try. Give it a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested,\u201d Joe told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about wine,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cExcept that you\u2019re supposed to have red with beef. How big is the Marcelli winery?\u201d</p><p>Joe narrowed his gaze. Had she stepped in to deflect the attention from him? Why the hell would she bother?</p><p>\u201cMore acres than you\u2019d want to walk. I can take you on a tour,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cIn a manner of speaking. We\u2019ll have to use carts, what with me being unable to waddle very far, but there\u2019s still a lot to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cAre you kidding? I love the chance to show off everything I know about wine.\u201d She patted Nic\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll explain the difference between the quality we shoot for here at Marcelli Wines and the volume they\u2019re so proud of at Wild Sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBite me,\u201d Nic said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cI believe that\u2019s what got us into trouble in the first place,\u201d his wife told him. She turned back to Darcy. \u201cDoes tomorrow morning work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not exactly filling my social calendar these days,\u201d Darcy told her. \u201cName the time.\u201d</p><p>That evening, Alex walked into the small guesthouse. He\u2019d been avoiding it for the past couple of hours, but he\u2019d run out of work and been forced to return.</p><p>The space itself wasn\u2019t too bad. He\u2019d turned the dining room into a command center. Computers and monitors covered the table and spilled onto the chairs. A large map of the Marcelli and Wild Sea property covered most of one wall. That left the living room as the only place to sit outside of the two bedrooms.</p><p>The rest of the team would be housed at a nearby hotel, but he and Paige would share the house and the single bathroom. He\u2019d suffered through worse, of course. He\u2019d slept in tents, cars, and out in the open, all in the name of getting the job done. The difference was he hadn\u2019t done it in such close quarters with Paige.</p><p>The bathroom door opened and she walked out. Her hair was damp, and she\u2019d traded in her dark suit for a loose pair of pajama bottoms and a tank top. No bra. Her nipples were clearly visible through the thin, ribbed fabric.</p><p>It had been a long time since they\u2019d shared a roof, and he expected her to run for cover when she saw him. When she didn\u2019t do anything but nod, he was determined to show he didn\u2019t care, either.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in for the night at the house,\u201d he said. \u201cRichards had the first shift. He\u2019ll let us know if he spots anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be trouble, but it\u2019s best to be sure,\u201d she said as she walked into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator. \u201cDid you taste the pasta Grandma Tessa sent over? It\u2019s spectacular. I\u2019m going to have to add a couple of miles to my run every morning or I won\u2019t fit into my clothes.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she bent over and pulled out a covered bowl. He wasn\u2019t so much interested in the food as in the way the pajama fabric stretched over her ass. He couldn\u2019t figure out if she was just being herself or if this was all a carefully constructed plan to drive him insane.</p><p>\u201cWe need to clear the air,\u201d he said, hating how stiff he sounded.</p><p>She straightened and faced him. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. We started out in the same training class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d She reached for a bowl and scooped pasta into it. \u201cYou\u2019re worried that I\u2019m bitter. Don\u2019t sweat it, Alex. You had a couple of lucky breaks, where you got to strut your stuff. You\u2019re good, and I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>He hated her causal acceptance. \u201cYou used to be driven. You used to want it all.\u201d He remembered it had been a mutual decision for them to end things. They\u2019d both been more interested in their careers than in each other.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d She put the small bowl in the microwave and punched in a time. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve mellowed with age. These days I\u2019m looking for more balance in my life.\u201d</p><p>She was saying all the right things, and he hated that. \u201cYou get that from your husband?\u201d</p><p>Her green eyes narrowed. \u201cYes. Not so much from his life as from his death.\u201d</p><p>Alex instantly felt like a jerk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m okay with it now. I still miss him, but I mostly remember the good times.\u201d</p><p>With that she took her pasta from the microwave and walked to her room.</p><p>He watched her go and wondered what she remembered from their time together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>5</p><p>D arcy had been on plenty of tours in her time. There had been the factory that made shipping boxes\u2014a thrilling journey into the world of cardboard\u2014and a company devoted to the production of thread. She\u2019d seen cheese being made, tractors, tires, microchips, and mini-blinds. But never wine. Wine seemed a whole lot more interesting.</p><p>She dressed in black cargo pants and a black tank top, then carefully slathered on sunscreen. Somehow over the past couple of years she\u2019d gotten incredibly pale. Unfortunately the lack of color only emphasized the dark circles under her eyes. Another couple of nights without sleep and even her concealer wouldn\u2019t work.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to sleep, it\u2019s that the second she closed her eyes, she felt them grabbing her again. Her wrists throbbed as she remembered the rope. Fear tightened her throat and left her unable to breathe. Far better to give up sleep than face the demons in the dark.</p><p>After slipping on sandals, she hurried downstairs where she found Joe waiting in the kitchen. There were no other Marcellis around. Just Joe sitting at the kitchen table and a tempting pot of coffee on the counter.</p><p>He glanced up from the paper. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>He looked neither friendly nor happy to see her, so she nodded a greeting and beelined for her morning jolt of caffeine. After adding the right amount of milk and sweetener, she joined him at the table and gingerly took the entertainment section of the paper.</p><p>\u201cNot interested in what\u2019s going on in the world?\u201d he asked from behind the paper.</p> <p>\u201cI already did a half hour of CNN while I was getting ready,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s about as much current events as I can stand. Besides, if it\u2019s really important, the White House sends me a briefing.\u201d</p><p>He set down the paper and raised his eyebrows. He\u2019d showered and shaved. His hair was military short, his skin tanned, and his shoulders broad enough to carry the weight of the world on them. He looked good. Capable.</p><p>A plate of Danish sat between them. Joe pushed it toward her. \u201cYou should eat something.\u201d</p><p>The dull ache of acid in her stomach told her she should eat a lot, but she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t remember hiring you as my personal nutritionist. Did we sign a contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too skinny.\u201d He reached for his mug. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I care about your opinion. Let me think.\u201d She sipped her coffee. \u201cNope. Don\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this a chick thing? Do you want to look like a supermodel or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that impacts me how?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cIs it because it\u2019s morning, or are you naturally unpleasant all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m naturally unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth twitched in an almost smile. \u201cGood to know. Why aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to dog on me all day until you get an answer?\u201d she asked, more intrigued than frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cProbably. I don\u2019t have a lot to keep me busy. I could use the distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m not a good stress eater. I wish I were. I understand it\u2019s very comforting. But when I\u2019m tense or upset, I can\u2019t stand the thought of food.\u201d</p><p>His gaze slipped to her too-skinny arms. \u201cBeen upset a lot lately?\u201d</p><p>Darcy shrugged. She knew she\u2019d lost weight in the past year or so. Too much weight. \u201cI\u2019ve had stuff on my mind.\u201d</p><p>He returned his attention to the paper. \u201cBrenna should be here in half an hour. Your Secret Service agents want me to come along on the tour, too.\u201d</p><p>His flat tone told her all she had to know about his enthusiasm level. It annoyed her that once he\u2019d gotten his answer, he\u2019d dismissed her.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. You\u2019re not dying with excitement at the thought of the winery tour.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head. \u201cSomething like that. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m here and I\u2019m going to do my job. Never question the chain of command.\u201d He pushed the plate of Danish toward her. \u201cEat one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hun\u2014\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cTry.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily, then picked up a cheese Danish. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll try. Although Yoda said there is no try. There is do, or do not. Or was it do or not do? I can never remember.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. Nor did he offer an opinion.</p><p>\u201cStar Wars,\u201d she mumbled as she took a bite and chewed. After swallowing she said, \u201cThe second one. The Empire Strikes Back. My personal favorite of the first three.\u201d</p><p>He returned his attention to the paper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very friendly,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you need me to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t kill you to make an attempt. Or should I apologize? Oh, Joe, I\u2019m terribly sorry my kidnapping is interfering with your regular life. Silly me. I should have arranged it for a different month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you were a pain in the ass,\u201d he said.</p><p>The words meant nothing, she told herself, even as she felt their sting.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not a victim,\u201d he added. \u201cGood for you.\u201d</p><p>Not sure what to say to that, she reached for another Danish and tore it in half.</p><p>\u201cDid you fight them?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It took her a second to figure out he meant the kidnappers. \u201cYes, but there were four of them, and I\u2019m not exactly buff. I did get in a good head butt though.\u201d And she hadn\u2019t allowed the fear to control her. When it got bad at night, she reminded herself of that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tougher than you look,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, or what it had to do with him being friendly.</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She glanced down and realized that she\u2019d finished the second Danish. She pressed one hand to her stomach. The acid burn was gone.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, sailor. I have connections.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI bet you do.\u201d</p><p>A car pulled up out front.</p><p>\u201cBrenna,\u201d Joe said as he stood. \u201cI\u2019ll alert the security team.\u201d</p><p>Darcy finished her cup of coffee and carried it to the sink. She rinsed it and set it in the dishwasher as the back door burst open and Brenna stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, I\u2019ve gained three pounds in the past week,\u201d she announced as she entered. \u201cIs that fair? Is it right? I hate being pregnant more than I can tell you. It seriously sucks. I\u2019m huge. Oh, no. Danish. No, no. I can\u2019t. The sugar will give me heartburn.\u201d She turned to Darcy. \u201cDid you eat one? Was it fabulous? Let me live vicariously through you, I beg you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it. And you\u2019re so damn skinny. Look at you.\u201d She stopped and covered her mouth with her finger. \u201cOh, can I say damn in front of you? Have I broken the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say anything you want. I\u2019ll say damn, too, if it makes you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. Okay, let\u2019s go. I hear the Danish calling my name, and if I stay here, I\u2019ll give in.\u201d</p><p>Darcy followed her outside, where she was greeted by a large golden retriever.</p><p>\u201cThis is Max,\u201d Brenna said as the huge dog sniffed and licked and wagged his tail so hard his whole back end shook. \u201cHe likes everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Darcy bent down to hug him and received a quick doggie kiss for her efforts. \u201cAre you a handsome boy?\u201d</p><p>Max yelped in agreement.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be a modified tour,\u201d Brenna said as she patted her belly. \u201cWe\u2019ll take carts, which limits where we can go. But you\u2019ll get a feel for things. Plus, if you\u2019re interested, you can go exploring on your own.\u201d</p><p>Just then two golf carts came around the house. Joe drove one, while Alex piloted the other. Paige sat beside him.</p><p>\u201cOr not,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cWill they let you go out on your own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon.\u201d Darcy hated that protection was necessary, and even worse, that she wanted it. She hated being afraid.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Joe asked as he stopped beside Brenna.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m driving,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you argue, I\u2019ll take you down.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou can drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like it when we take charge,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I accept it as a secret of the universe.\u201d</p><p>Darcy appreciated the advice, but she was more intrigued by her Secret Service agents. She\u2019d only ever seen them in suits\u2014black, navy, dark gray. But today both Paige and Alex were in jeans and T-shirts. Paige looked great, but Alex seemed awkward, as if he wasn\u2019t comfortable in his own skin.</p><p>\u201cWow, casual,\u201d she said, strolling over to their cart. \u201cWhat gives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re blending in,\u201d Paige said.</p><p>Darcy turned to Alex. \u201cYou need to relax a little. You\u2019re not blending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t completed our reconnaissance of the property. There are areas that aren\u2019t secured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Brenna said as she slid behind the wheel of the other cart. \u201cWe won\u2019t go anywhere unsecured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know where that is,\u201d Alex said between clenched teeth. \u201cI haven\u2019t told you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna patted the seat next to her. \u201cCome on, Darcy. Let\u2019s get a move on.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later they were bouncing along the edge of a massive vineyard. Max trotted ahead, then turned back and barked, as if urging them to keep up. Joe sat in the rear of their cart, while Paige and Alex came up behind.</p><p>\u201cSo these are chardonnay grapes,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cNote the pale color. They\u2019re nearly ripe and will be picked first. The cabs are last to ripen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCabernet sauvignon. Our pride and joy. Red wines are the gift of the gods. Whites are nice, too, but honestly, not my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie only drinks white wine,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>Brenna glared at him. \u201cHe\u2019s making trouble. Can you believe it? He disappears for weeks at a time, and when he returns, he makes trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sharing. You women like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlap him for me,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cSlap him really, really hard.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. The morning was perfect\u2014the coolness of the night had faded, but it wasn\u2019t hot yet. The sky was clear, the company enjoyable.</p><p>\u201cWe grow different kinds of grapes here,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cChardonnay, merlot, cabs, some voigner for blending. We also have vineyards up in Northern California. The grapes are brought down here, and everything is blended together. I hope you\u2019re here when we start picking. It\u2019s very exciting. The grapes are pressed on the property and put into huge barrels for fermenting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see that,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Brenna continued to talk about grapes and winemaking, but Darcy found herself focusing more on the family than their wine.</p><p>What a wonderful place to grow up, she thought. So much space, so much love and acceptance. Except Joe hadn\u2019t known about any of this. What would it be like to find out he had this whole other family who wanted nothing more than to make him one of them? Was he angry about what he\u2019d missed? Hurt his parents had given him up?</p><p>They turned around and headed for the barrel rooms.</p><p>\u201cRunning two different wineries is tough,\u201d Brenna was saying. \u201cMine\u2014Four Sisters\u2014is pretty small, but it still takes a lot of time. Plus, working here has the added thrill of dealing with my grandfather. In theory, I\u2019m in charge. In reality, he argues with me about everything. What wine should be used for the reserve and what should be blended. How long to ferment, whether or not to use oak barrels or stainless steel. Don\u2019t even get me started on labels. I\u2019ve been trying to get him to approve new ones for over three years. But does he? No. We\u2019re using the same old crappy labels. He makes me insane.

Brenna showed her the pressing room, the fermenting room, and the equipment that delivered ready wine into bottles. Paige hovered by the main entrance while Alex stalked from room to room, checking for terrorists in all the shadows.</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to my manager,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a second.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy nodded and crouched down to pat Max as she examined the bottling equipment more closely.</p><p>\u201cThis is interesting,\u201d she said. \u201cMy peak tour experience had been watching them manufacture M&amp;M\u2019s, but this is just as good.\u201d She stood. \u201cYou must love being a part of it.\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged, as if it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She faced him. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they\u2019re an amazing family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re related. That doesn\u2019t make us family.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have been more surprised if he\u2019d morphed into a giant moose.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s crazy,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhy on earth would you walk away from all this? It\u2019s your heritage, it\u2019s who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in their money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about money. I\u2019m talking about belonging to something bigger than just you. There\u2019s history here, and love. People who care about you.\u201d</p> <p>He turned away. \u201cI\u2019m here because of my job. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She could hear Lauren\u2019s voice in her head telling her this was a really good time to change the subject. She didn\u2019t want to alienate someone on her security team on her first day. There were probably at least fourteen different, polite ways to handle the situation. Darcy ignored them all.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had to be smart to be a SEAL. I guess not.\u201d</p><p>Brenna returned, and they completed the tour. Joe stayed in the background, watching Darcy as she interacted with everyone she met.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about her as a person before. To him she\u2019d been little more than the slightly attractive reason he was stuck here instead of back on base. Not that there was any guarantee that he would have been allowed to stay on base after the incident with the admiral\u2019s boat.</p><p>Now he saw her as an individual\u2014one with a temper. She liked dogs, had a smart mouth, and was shy with strangers, although she forced herself to act otherwise. She was also afraid.</p><p>Brenna opened her car door and Max jumped inside. She turned to Darcy.</p><p>\u201cI had fun,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Darcy smiled, then leaned in to hug her. Brenna\u2019s large stomach got in the way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m huge,\u201d Brenna said with a sigh.</p><p>Darcy touched her belly. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky.\u201d</p><p>Her voice had a wistful quality that made Joe feel as if he\u2019d stumbled onto something personal. Before he could turn away, Brenna reached for him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, big guy. I\u2019m outta here. Take care of our guest.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI like her. Based on what I read in the paper, I thought I\u2019d hate her, but I don\u2019t. So be nice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you like to think.\u201d</p><p>Brenna moved to the car and climbed in. Darcy stood there and waved until she disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun,\u201d she said when they were alone. \u201cYour sister\u2019s great. I really like how she bullies you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her think she bullies me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. That\u2019s how it is.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were bright with humor, her mouth smiling. She was pretty, he thought, as heat tumbled in his gut and moved south. And as much as he hated to side with Brenna\u2014if she found out she would never let him forget\u2014he agreed with her assessment of Darcy. From what he\u2019d read in the paper, she was supposed to be a class A bitch. So far, no real sign of that.</p><p>Paige strolled up. \u201cHey, Darcy. What\u2019s up for the rest of the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d like to head out and sketch the vineyards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Give us about a thirty-minute heads-up. We\u2019ll send you out with a team of three.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s smile faded. \u201cSure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Paige wandered back to the guesthouse. Joe turned to Darcy.</p><p>\u201cNot in the mood for an entourage?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind that. Sometimes I forget why I need them. I\u2019m not excited to be reminded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were kidnapped. They want to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I want them to be careful.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward the house, but he grabbed her arm to stop her. Her skin was soft against his fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDid I disobey? Do I have to get down and give you twenty?\u201d</p><p>He studied her face. The shadows were darker today. \u201cYou\u2019re not sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Instantly her expression closed, and she jerked free of his hold. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should talk about it to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you volunteering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Paige could help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was going through\u2014not the particulars but what it was like to be unable to come down after an assignment. \u201cThere are ways to handle post-traumatic stress\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare psychoanalyze me,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I do. And while you\u2019re already pissed off at me, I\u2019m going to tell you to start eating better. And exercising. It will help you sleep.\u201d</p><p>She headed for the house. \u201cGo away,\u201d she called over her shoulder as she ran up the stairs and ducked inside.</p><p>He wanted to, but there was nowhere to go. Like her, he was trapped here for the duration. Also like her, he had ghosts haunting his sleep and things he didn\u2019t want to remember.</p><p>6</p><p>T wo days later Joe heard a commotion in the driveway. As Darcy had stuck close to the house, he\u2019d been trapped inside as well, and he was happy for an excuse to get outdoors. As he stepped outside, a familiar battered Jeep pulled up. Instantly several Secret Service agents appeared and surrounded the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t shoot,\u201d Mia said as she got out of the driver\u2019s side and held up both hands. \u201cWe\u2019re unarmed.\u201d</p><p>Joe felt himself smile. When Mia was around, life was never boring.</p><p>She spotted him and squealed. \u201cJoe! You\u2019re here! Did you know about the Secret Service? They stopped us at the turn-off to the driveway and searched the car. Now I think they\u2019re going to take Ian out back and shoot him.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke a tall, lanky blond guy climbed out of the Jeep and also held up his hands.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d the kid said, looking both confused and scared. \u201cWhat I do?\u201d</p><p>Paige took Mia\u2019s friend by the arm. \u201cIf you\u2019ll come this way,\u201d she said as she steered him toward the guesthouse.</p><p>Mia waited until the agents had walked away before lowering her arms and racing toward Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhat gives?\u201d she demanded as she launched herself toward him. He grabbed her and pulled her against him, then hugged her close.</p><p>\u201cAll these questions,\u201d he said, putting her down. \u201cHow about starting with a greeting?\u201d</p><p>She grinned up at him. Mia was barely five foot three, with big brown eyes and brown hair she always had streaked blond. Too much makeup stained her face, and she insisted on wearing trashy cropped shirts and too-short shorts. But she was pure energy, and she adored him with a devotion that never wavered.</p><p>Her full mouth swelled into a pout. \u201cYou should be greeting me. You never answer my e-mails. Why is that? I\u2019m very faithful about writing.\u201d</p><p>He patted her on the head, deliberately mussing her hair. \u201cI don\u2019t consider \u2018hey, get any lately\u2019 correspondence I want to respond to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a stick-in-the-mud.\u201d She glanced toward the guesthouse and then back at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the police brutality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s they?\u201d</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Of all his family members, Mia was the biggest risk to blab. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell anyone you were coming to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my home, Joseph,\u201d Mia told him sternly. \u201cI don\u2019t need permission to show up. So what did I interrupt? An alien landing? Secret nuclear experiments? Although Brenna won\u2019t like anything that messes with her precious wine. Why don\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>The back door opened. Joe heard it, and he knew who had appeared by the expression of total stunned disbelief on Mia\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she breathed. \u201cThat\u2019s the president\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Joe glanced back at Darcy. \u201cMeet Mia Marcelli, the youngest and least mannered of the four sisters.\u201d</p><p>Mia slugged him in the arm, then walked over to Darcy. \u201cWow. What on earth are you doing here? Are you lost?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cNo. I\u2019m hiding out for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Mia turned on him. \u201cThat\u2019s why those government types came and asked all those questions. I thought it was about something else. This is so incredibly cool.\u201d She looked at the guesthouse and gasped. \u201cOh, no. Ian wasn\u2019t cleared, was he? That\u2019s the big deal. I brought an unknown enemy into sacred territory. Jeez. What will they do to him?\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t have the answer, so he shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no help,\u201d Mia said as she took off at a run toward the guesthouse. \u201cWait!\u201d she yelled. \u201cHe\u2019s not a terrorist. We\u2019re just sleeping together. Don\u2019t hurt him!\u201d</p><p>Joe watched her for a second, then turned to Darcy. \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud.\u201d</p><p>Darcy continued to watch as Mia entered the Secret Service headquarters. \u201cShe\u2019s great. I can\u2019t wait to meet your other two sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both a little more low-key. Although Francesca has a master\u2019s in psychology, which makes her think she knows more than she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she must have a field day with you.\u201d</p><p>Joe hadn\u2019t seen much of Darcy in the past couple of days. He knew he\u2019d pissed her off, and he\u2019d half expected her to report him to Paige or Alex, complaining that he\u2019d crossed the line between the hired help and those who were part of the inner circle. But neither of them had said anything to him.</p><p>Now he took in the shadows under her eyes\u2014they were darker than before. There was a wariness in her expression, as if she expected him to attack.</p><p>He told himself he didn\u2019t care if she never slept again, that his entire focus was on getting through this assignment and getting back to the base. Nothing else mattered. Not her, not his family, and especially not the awareness he felt whenever she was around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking fierce about something,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI was teasing about your sister. You don\u2019t have to be so sensitive.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened as if she\u2019d shot him. \u201cI\u2019m not sensitive.\u201d</p><p>Darcy held in a smile. Men were so predictable. Violate their sense of manliness and they got all prickly and defensive.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. How could I have thought such a thing?\u201d He glared at her but didn\u2019t speak. No doubt he wasn\u2019t sure if she was kidding. The last time they\u2019d been together, he\u2019d pissed her off, and she\u2019d reacted. Maybe overreacted. She suspected Joe had only been trying to help.</p><p>\u201cI like your family,\u201d she said as a change of subject. \u201cMia reminds me a lot of Brenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re alike,\u201d he admitted. \u201cKatie and Francesca are similar, too. Less volatile.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She smiled. \u201cLess interested in making you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky man, Joe Larson,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a family most people would envy.\u201d</p> <p>His expression turned from wary to trapped. She sensed he did not want to be having this conversation with her. She also knew that he wasn\u2019t comfortable walking away from her. After all, she was the person they were all trying to keep safe.</p><p>\u201cOh, I have to admit I like that,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>His dark gaze lasered in on her face. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving power over an ex-SEAL.\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow rose. \u201cNot in this lifetime or the next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh. The thing is, you can\u2019t go anywhere, can you?\u201d</p><p>She moved closer, then circled around him. Was it possible to make him do tricks? She grinned. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cEver married?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOnce. You?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou hardly have to ask. Nearly every detail of my life has been played out in the press. No engagements, no serious boyfriends. At least not in a while. Dating the president\u2019s daughter comes with restrictions most guys aren\u2019t willing to take on. Now back to you. What happened to the little woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to ship out for six, eight months at a time. Kind of makes it hard to keep the home fires burning.\u201d</p> <p>Yet other men managed to do it. Why not Joe? He was good-looking enough. He had a body that was near godlike in its perfection. When he forgot to act as though he had a stick up his ass, he was okay to talk to. So why no entourage of women hanging on him? Why did he always act as if he would rather be somewhere else?</p><p>\u201cYou do like women, right?\u201d she asked, pretending a seriousness she didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>Fury erupted in him. She felt both the energy and the heat, but his control was impressive. Not by a flicker of a lash did he react to the insult. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think your past could make for a very interesting story. But don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t ask you. There are plenty of folks around here who would like nothing more than to tell me all they know about you.\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThe hell of family. Why is it so hard for you to be with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a conversation we\u2019re going to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe subject doesn\u2019t interest me.\u201d</p><p>But it interested her. Why did he resist such a wonderful group of people? From what she\u2019d seen in the past two days, all that the Marcellis wanted was the freedom to love him. What wouldn\u2019t she give to have a piece of that for herself.</p><p>\u201cI can help you with this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you don\u2019t have a choice. We\u2019re trapped here, and I could use a distraction.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean any of it, but threatening him was fun.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get to be an expert?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Those who can, do. Those who can\u2019t, teach. That\u2019s me. Your new instructor on getting along with your family. We\u2019ll have classes and everything. You can thank me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely.\u201d His gaze narrowed. \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>She arched her eyebrows. \u201cMaybe. Maybe not.\u201d</p><p>The man actually growled. She had a feeling he was thinking that he would rather have an arm cut off than deal with her and the Marcellis. Not that he had a choice. Neither of them were going anywhere, and she was in a position to force her will on him.</p><p>For once being the president\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t seem like such a bad thing.</p><p>Mia Marcelli didn\u2019t sit still, Paige noted. She squirmed, hunched over, straightened, then bounced to her feet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what those agents wanted when they came to see me last week,\u201d Mia said as she took the mug of coffee Paige offered. \u201cI thought it was about the spy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat spy stuff?\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cThey keep asking me to be a spy. Is that crazy or what? I mean look at me. Do I blend in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you?\u201d Paige asked. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged. \u201cI do languages. Give me a good instructor and a few weeks and I can function using that language. Give me three months and I can talk like a native. It\u2019s my brain. I\u2019m really smart about other stuff, too, but languages are my thang. I try to pick up a couple every year, you know, just for fun.\u201d</p><p>As Paige had struggled with high school Spanish and barely passed, she didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGood for you. Did you accept any of the offers?\u201d</p><p>Mia wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo. I just graduated from Georgetown, and I\u2019m starting with the State Department in September. This is my last summer of freedom, and I was going to spend it traveling with Ian. Are you guys going to kill him?\u201d</p><p>Paige laughed. \u201cNo. We want to find out more about him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Darcy.\u201d Mia\u2019s eyes got wide. \u201cWhy is she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a kidnapping attempt on Lauren. They took Darcy by mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa\u2014that\u2019s scary. I wonder how you guys picked this place to hide her. But it\u2019s good. I mean, the Grands will love her to death. I know they always make me feel better when I\u2019ve had a bad day or something.\u201d</p><p>Alex walked into the kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re nearly done,\u201d he told Paige, then he turned to Mia. \u201cYour friend will be free to go in about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s not dangerous?\u201d Mia asked. \u201cI could have told you that. Ian\u2019s fun, but not the least bit deep, and isn\u2019t depth of character required for true commitment to a cause?\u201d</p><p>Alex stared at her without speaking. Paige was careful to hide her amusement.</p><p>Mia rose and walked over to Alex. \u201cYou obviously work out. Talk about muscles. So who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Alex Vanmeter. I\u2019m in charge of this operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, our fearless leader.\u201d She glanced at Paige and grinned. \u201cI just love military types. And guys into security. There\u2019s that whole \u2018take a bullet\u2019 mentality. The ultimate sacrifice. Of course it doesn\u2019t measure up against Kyle Reese in Terminator. He traveled across time, but death is a close second.\u201d</p><p>Alex sighed heavily. \u201cMs. Marcelli,\u201d he began.</p><p>Mia moved in close and rubbed her palm against his upper arm. \u201cMia. Call me Mia. And I\u2019ll call you Alex.\u201d She stared into his eyes. \u201cIan\u2019s just a summer fling. It\u2019s not serious at all. I mean, he\u2019s fun, but I can\u2019t imagine living with him for the next sixty years. He talks too much, and I\u2019d be forced to kill him. Then I\u2019d need to be punished. Would you want to be the one to punish me, Special Agent in Charge Vanmeter?\u201d</p><p>Paige had a feeling that if Alex had been drinking, he would have spit. Color darkened his cheeks as he jerked free of her touch and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you would like to return to the house until we\u2019re finished questioning your friend,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cAll right. But if you change your mind, let me know.\u201d</p><p>She waggled her fingers at Paige and sauntered out of the guesthouse.</p><p>Paige began to chuckle as soon as Mia left.</p><p>Alex glared at her. \u201cYou think that\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you have a groupie? Absolutely. She\u2019s just playing with you, Alex. She doesn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a bottle of iced tea from the refrigerator. \u201cIf she gets in the way of my job, I want you to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. If you have a problem with Mia, you take it up with her. She\u2019s not a threat, and if you can\u2019t handle a little flirting from a twenty-one-year-old grad student, then you\u2019re not the man I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s glare deepened. \u201cYou like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s your problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. I\u2019m busy with Darcy.\u201d She moved close and batted her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure a big, bad agent like you can handle little Mia.\u201d</p><p>Alex set the bottle on the counter and grabbed her upper arms. There was nothing challenging about his hold, or threatening. But the second he touched her, everything changed.</p><p>For a moment, time shifted and Paige found herself slipping back to her weeks in training. When Alex had been so much more than a fellow recruit. The heat of his hand burned through to memories she\u2019d thought she had forgotten. The scent of his body reminded her of being naked and in bed and never ever having enough of him.</p><p>Wanting slammed into her like a shot from a .45. Need joined it, making her hungry and weak and suddenly afraid.</p><p>Then time righted itself and she was back in the kitchen, a very different person than she\u2019d been before.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Paige. This is deadly serious.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not sure if he meant the situation with Darcy, the trouble with Mia, or what was happening between him and her.</p><p>He dropped his hand, grabbed his iced tea, and walked away. She was left alone in the kitchen, shaken, aroused, and confused as hell.</p><p>Darcy sat in front of the window, doing her best to draw the vineyard. The problem was her view was limited by a couple of large trees. As much as she would like to walk outside and find the perfect spot for an afternoon of drawing, she wasn\u2019t sure she was willing to put up with the security entourage that would accompany her. Their silent but very real presence wouldn\u2019t do much for her creativity.</p><p>Before she could decide if the pain was worth the price, someone knocked on the door. Before she could say anything, it burst open and Mia bounced into the room.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here,\u201d the younger Marcelli said as she jumped onto the bed and stretched out. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. I\u2019m the youngest. You knew that, right? Mom made one last attempt to have a son, and I came along. They\u2019ve hidden their disappointment pretty well. And now they adore me, so they\u2019re stuck, right? Plus they have Joe. So, you\u2019re here. Wow. How are you adjusting? Was it too horrible being kidnapped? I\u2019ll bet you were brave. You look like the brave type. I would have screamed and begged and really embarrassed myself, I just know it. Do you like having Secret Service agents all around? I met Alex. He\u2019s hunky.\u201d She glanced around, as if checking that they were alone, then lowered her voice. \u201cDo you, like, get to have sex with the agents? Is that too personal? Should I wait a couple of days before asking that?\u201d</p><p>Darcy put down her pencil and stared at her visitor. \u201cHonest to God, I have no idea what to say to you.\u201d</p><p>Mia tucked her hands behind her head and beamed. \u201cI know. I often have that effect on people, but they love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>Mia sat up. \u201cThey searched the car. I turned into the driveway, and these men appeared from nowhere. They had guns and ordered me to stop. I had to show them ID, then they searched the car. I think they were looking for a bomb or something. Then they said we could drive up to the house but not to get out of the Jeep until we were instructed to. It\u2019s like being in a spy movie. And the worst part is I can\u2019t tell anyone. That seriously sucks.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt as if she could barely catch her breath. She\u2019d thought that Brenna was high energy, but Brenna had nothing on Mia.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can talk about it with Ian,\u201d Mia continued. \u201cOf course I can\u2019t talk to him about Alex.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question about sex with the agents, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And that\u2019s my answer. No. Haven\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s very hunky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I can\u2019t imagine him naked, though. He\u2019s too uptight.\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed and flopped back on the bed. \u201cOh, I can clearly see him naked, and it\u2019s a very nice picture, let me tell you. Yum.\u201d She raised her head. \u201cYou know I\u2019m just playing, right? I say a lot of stuff to make people nervous, but I don\u2019t really mean it. Ian and I are together\u2014at least for now. I wouldn\u2019t cheat on him or anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Alex will be relieved to hear that.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell him are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Let him suffer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. So what do you think of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the family,\u201d Darcy said and meant it. \u201cEveryone has made me feel really welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re like that. The Grands are so cool, and my folks are, too. Are Grammy M and Grandma Tessa still not talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to get along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that.\u201d Mia scooted around so her head was at the foot of the bed, then she flopped over onto her stomach. \u201cI wish they\u2019d make up. But they\u2019re both so stubborn. Maybe having Joe here will help. They adore him. We all do. Not that he\u2019s so crazy about us.\u201d</p> <p>The bright light in her eyes faded. \u201cHave you heard how he came to be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that he was given up for adoption and then found years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s totally horrible that my mom had to do that. Now Joe\u2019s here, but he\u2019s not a part of us, you know. He won\u2019t let anyone get close. I make him crazy, which is fun, but it\u2019s not the same as being, you know, emotionally intimate. Brenna\u2019s the one he gets along with the best, but he holds back from everyone. He doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>She paused expectantly.</p><p>Darcy did her best to look innocent. \u201cOh. Should I be taking notes?\u201d</p><p>Mia giggled. \u201cNo, but are you interested?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI barely know the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazingly enough, it matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well. Maybe next time. You should think about it, though. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s great in bed.\u201d Mia wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I can talk about Joe\u2019s sex life. As intriguing as it would be, he\u2019s my brother, and there\u2019s a serious ick factor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure your family will be delighted to know you have limits.\u201d</p><p>Mia sat up. \u201cI don\u2019t want limits. But there it is. The thought of my brother having sex is gross. So if you guys do it, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>Darcy made an X over her heart. \u201cMy lips will be sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably gorgeous,\u201d Mia added thoughtfully. \u201cJoe naked. I wonder if he has any scars, you know, from wounds and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>There was a noise in the hall. Both Darcy and Mia turned toward the open door. Joe stood there. Darcy couldn\u2019t read the expression on his face, but it seemed to be an intriguing combination of horror and fear.</p><p>Mia sighed. \u201cHe heard the naked part,\u201d she said in a mock whisper.</p><p>Darcy did her best not to laugh. \u201cPossibly even the sex part.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cHi, Joe. We were just talking about you.\u201d</p><p>Joe\u2019s dark gaze locked with her own. For a second, she would have sworn he\u2019d vowed payback. Then he turned on his heel and left.</p><p>Mia started to laugh. Darcy joined in. She laughed until tears filled her eyes and she could barely breathe. Until that minute she would have said getting kidnapped was one of the worst things that had ever happened to her, but suddenly, she wondered if maybe it hadn\u2019t been so bad after all.</p><p>7</p><p>D arcy was up early because, well, not sleeping had a way of making a person face the dawn. She stood at her bedroom window, watching pale light creep across the vineyards. Suddenly her fingers itched for a pencil. She wanted to capture the moment, the changing light, the way the dew sparkled on the leaves.</p><p>She would never make it as an artist, she acknowledged, pulling on jeans and a T-shirt, then quickly brushing her hair. It was the reason she\u2019d studied graphic arts and advertising in college. But not having an abundance of talent didn\u2019t stop her from wanting to capture the world with a quick sketch on a perfect morning.</p><p>She collected her supplies, then quietly made her way downstairs. The house was still. Reasonable, normal people wouldn\u2019t be up for at least another hour. Which meant she could sneak outside and enjoy the morning in solitude.</p><p>As the thought formed, she felt a tendril of fear snake along her spine. Did she want to be alone? Was it safe?</p><p>\u201cNot going there,\u201d Darcy muttered. She pushed the questions away, along with the chill, and focused on the chance to just be for an hour or so.</p><p>But when she stepped outside, she saw an unfamiliar Secret Service agent in a car by the back door. He got out of the car as soon as he saw her.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Ms. Jensen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning. And it\u2019s Darcy.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Part of her wanted to forget it. To just go back into the house and wait until all this was over. But a stronger voice in her head told her that she couldn\u2019t wait much longer without going crazy. She had to start doing something.</p><p>\u201cI want to draw the vineyard this morning,\u201d she said, holding up her sketch pad. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it will take about an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Give me a second.\u201d He picked up a walkie-talkie and spoke into it.</p><p>No doubt getting permission, she thought glumly. What if they said no?</p><p>Before she could decide on a course of action, she felt a slight prickling between her shoulder blades. She turned and saw Joe coming out of the house.</p><p>Contradictory emotions warred within her. Part of her wondered why she couldn\u2019t spend five minutes alone outside of her bedroom. Another part of her acknowledged that if someone had to disturb the quiet, she wouldn\u2019t mind if it was Joe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOld habits,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She waited for him to comment on her being awake as well, but he didn\u2019t. Instead he nodded at the pad and pencils.</p><p>\u201cHoping for inspiration?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI was, but it\u2019s turning out to be a big deal.\u201d</p><p>The Secret Service agent put down the walkie-talkie. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready,\u201d he said, then spoke into his ever-present wrist communicator. \u201cPigeon is leaving. Repeat, Pigeon is leaving.\u201d</p><p>Joe raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cMy father is Falcon, my sister is Swan, and I\u2019m Pigeon. Does the Secret Service have a sense of humor or what?\u201d</p><p>Joe stepped toward the other man. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay here,\u201d he told him. \u201cI\u2019ll go with our bird friend while she draws.\u201d</p><p>The agent frowned. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be with Ms. Jensen, ah, Darcy, as protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck with Paige,\u201d Joe said. \u201cShe\u2019ll clear it.\u201d Then, without waiting for approval, he returned to Darcy\u2019s side and pointed toward the vineyard. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty smooth,\u201d she said when they were out of earshot and walking through vines heavy with grapes. \u201cYou said to contact Paige, not Alex, knowing she\u2019s the softer touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think it\u2019s easier for me to have you along than the other agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t call you Ms. Jensen.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cGood point.\u201d And in truth, she didn\u2019t mind having Joe around.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue. We\u2019ll walk until I find inspiration.\u201d</p><p>They continued walking, she in front, he right behind. Dew spattered her arms and soaked her jeans. There was a peacefulness to the quiet, and a sense of safety. As if nothing bad could ever happen here.</p><p>At the other end of that plot of grapes they found a narrow dirt track. Darcy paused to survey the miles of grapes and a cluster of trees to the west.</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d she said, pointing. As they followed the path, they were able to walk side by side.</p><p>\u201cI talked to my sister last night,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re holding her on some farm in the Midwest. She\u2019s surrounded by cornfields. When I told her about the wine, she was very jealous.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at her. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t discuss your location, even on a secure line.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grinned. She liked messing with him\u2014it was a little like pulling a tiger\u2019s tail\u2014dangerous but very exhilarating.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d she asked with a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, my little SEAL friend. I told her I was in Washington state. They make wine there, too. But as you\u2019re a part of all this, I\u2019m guessing you already know that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>She studied him. \u201cHow much, exactly, do you know about wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a beer drinker myself.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good. Aren\u2019t you interested in wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s your heritage. It\u2019s in your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want salt water in my blood.\u201d</p><p>The man was nothing if not consistent, she thought. Still, to have so much right there for the taking. \u201cI envy you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s just my father, my sister, and me. And I don\u2019t get along all that well with Mr. President.\u201d For reasons she had never discussed with anyone. \u201cWhich means it\u2019s pretty much Lauren and me. We\u2019re close, although we\u2019re not that much alike. She\u2019s perfect and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she stumbled on a loose rock in the road. Before she could catch her balance on her own, Joe grabbed her arm and pulled her upright.</p><p>They stood there, in the center of the road, his hand on her arm, his fingers touching bare skin. They were close enough for her to feel the heat from his body and his slow, steady breathing. She could see the various colors of brown that colored his irises and the faint scar on the edge of his jaw.</p><p>Her stomach clenched in anticipation, which was crazy. Nothing was going to happen.</p><p>But for the moment, that single heartbeat of time, she wanted it to. She wanted him to...oh, who knew. Kiss her? Say something sweet? She wasn\u2019t particularly picky, as long as he acknowledged the connection between them.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t, and she started to feel awkward. She pulled free of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cObviously Lauren is the perfect one,\u201d she said with a laugh that didn\u2019t exactly sound real. \u201cI\u2019m the clumsy one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Some. A little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly at all.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance replaced her awareness of him. \u201cHaven\u2019t we already had this particular conversation? If you recall, it didn\u2019t end well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the objective isn\u2019t achieved on the first mission, the team doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cThere are so many things wrong with that statement, I don\u2019t know where to begin. For one thing, you\u2019re not a team, and I\u2019m sure as hell not a mission.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and it\u2019s insulting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you can\u2019t avoid what happened forever. It\u2019s not going away until you deal with it. The longer you wait the harder it gets.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to hear that. She wanted to continue to think that the fear would one day just be gone.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said, turning her back on him.</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder and moved her until they were facing each other again. \u201cNo can do. Look, I understand. You think I don\u2019t, but you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019ve been scared and alone and bad things have happened to me, too. I can help.\u201d</p><p>She refused to cooperate. Instead of speaking, she pressed her lips together.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my best qualities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to take a poll on that?\u201d He lowered his hand from her shoulder and sighed heavily. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had years of training and experience. You didn\u2019t have any. When I walk into a dangerous situation I expect trouble, but you were just minding your own business at the mall. Those bastards grabbed you with no warning, and the people whose job it is to protect you screwed up. They weren\u2019t there and they didn\u2019t notice. You were totally and completely alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She honestly hadn\u2019t believed anyone could understand what it had been like, but with a few words, he showed her that he got it.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>She hesitated, then the words came tumbling out. \u201cI w-was in the back of the store and walking to the dressing rooms. They grabbed me. I didn\u2019t have time to scream. They put tape on my mouth and tied my hands behind me, then threw me in the back of a van.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about it, she told herself, but she couldn\u2019t stop the words from spilling out. Somehow she was walking and telling him everything. About the van and how dirty it was, how she\u2019d tried to get to her panic button but couldn\u2019t. About the warehouse and being tied to the chair and scared, so scared, they were going to kill her.</p><p>\u201cI tried to get away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there was nowhere to go, and the chair didn\u2019t make things easy. Then I tried to stay calm. I was afraid I was going to throw up, and I didn\u2019t want that. Then the guy in charge showed up. He looked at me and he said\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the path. Suddenly it was too hard to hold on to her pencils and sketch pad. They dropped to the ground. She rubbed at her still-healing wrists and wished away the rest of the pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Joe asked, his voice more gentle than she\u2019d ever heard it before. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Tears burned. Weak, stupid tears. She would not give in. Not now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014He said that I wasn\u2019t the one they wanted.\u201d She summoned anger and glared at him. \u201cThere. Are you happy? He said not this one. No one cares about this one. I was a mistake. Then they took me back to the mall, dumped me on the loading dock, and drove away.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Joe didn\u2019t know what to say to that. What could anyone say? Darcy stared at him, her expression defiant. She was angry, but it was a thin veneer that could crack at any time, and he sure didn\u2019t want to be around when it did.</p><p>Before he could figure out how to respond, she started talking again.</p><p>\u201cI love my sister,\u201d she said, her voice shaking. \u201cLauren is my best friend. She understands me and loves me. I admire her so much. But the thing is...the very worst thing is, sometimes I hate her.\u201d More tears filled Darcy\u2019s eyes. \u201cI hate her because I\u2019m weak and small and jealous. And then I feel so horrible, because I want to be like her and I don\u2019t know how and everyone loves her best. I\u2019m jealous of my own sister. What does that say about me? What?\u201d</p><p>The last word came on a sob. Joe felt both trapped and deeply inadequate to the task. What was it about a crying woman that reduced most men to cowards? He wanted to bolt, but he couldn\u2019t, so he did the only thing that made sense to him. He pulled her close and kissed her.</p><p>The shock of Joe\u2019s lips on hers was enough to stop Darcy\u2019s tears. One second she\u2019d been in an uncontrolled free fall of self-loathing, and the next she was pressed against a man made entirely of rock, his arms around her body and his mouth very much on hers.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak; she could only react, tilting her head slightly so he could kiss her more. Because it felt good. Better than good.</p><p>His lips were an impossible combination of yielding and firm. He held her with just the right amount of possession. Heat surrounded her, melting all the hard edges and drying her tears. She raised her hands to his shoulders and allowed herself to be swept away by the soft pressure.</p><p>He didn\u2019t deepen the kiss, but she was okay with that. It had been a long time since she\u2019d wanted a man, so long she\u2019d almost forgotten what it felt like to feel the first fluttering of desire low in her belly. Her breasts went from simply a sticky-out part of her body to exquisitely sensitive, and her legs actually got weak.</p><p>When he stepped back, she didn\u2019t know what to say. Embarrassment battled with self-preservation. When in doubt, be a bitch. But before she could say anything to shatter the moment, she caught a glimpse of something dark and powerful in his eyes.</p><p>Need.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t just kissed her to stop her crying. He\u2019d kissed her because he\u2019d wanted to. The revelation kept her mouth shut and opened her mind to a thousand amazing possibilities.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She nodded in agreement. Talk about a complication.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d He shook his head, as if not sure what to say. Then he turned on his heel and walked away.</p><p>Darcy watched him go. When he had disappeared into the grove of trees they\u2019d been heading for in the first place, she picked up her sketch book and pencils and started for the house. Around her, the morning stirred to life. She heard birds and someone driving up to the winery.</p><p>What on earth had just happened? She\u2019d spilled her guts to Joe, and then he\u2019d kissed her. Even more amazing, she\u2019d felt it. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d allowed herself to engage sexually. The few physical relationships she\u2019d had in her past had all ended badly. It had seemed smarter to not go there again.</p><p>But now, with Joe, she found herself anticipating the next time she would see him. Oh, sure, it would be awkward, but they\u2019d get over it. Besides, she would have the thrill of knowing he\u2019d wanted to kiss her. Which made for a very good day.</p><p>Joe avoided the house for the next couple of hours, but he knew he couldn\u2019t stay away forever. What the hell had he been thinking? Talk about letting the little head run his life. Darcy was supposed to be under his protection, not in his arms. Was he looking for ways to screw up his career more? Because if he was, he\u2019d found a hell of a good way to do it.</p><p>Angry with himself for being an ass, her for being so damn tempting, and the world in general because he was stuck here, he stalked into the house and found Brenna sitting in the kitchen. She had a plate of pasta in front of her and several slices of bread next to her glass of milk.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she said cheerfully when she saw him.</p><p>He glanced at the clock. It was barely ten-thirty.</p><p>She followed his gaze. \u201cHey, I\u2019m eating for the team. Don\u2019t you dare get coffee,\u201d she ordered when he started toward the pot.</p><p>\u201cWhat? If you can\u2019t have any, no one else gets to?\u201d he asked as he poured himself a mug.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Oh, man. It\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He took a long, slow drink. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cPig.\u201d Then she stabbed several pieces of penne and chewed on them.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to drink coffee soon,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m breast-feeding. And I plan to, for at least a while. I mean I think I can have a little, but it won\u2019t be the same. I miss my pot of coffee. And wine. And pretty much everything else I had to give up. This had better be an amazing baby, because if it\u2019s not, I\u2019m writing a letter of complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see who you mail it to.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI\u2019m Catholic, big guy. I have access to spiritual management you can only dream about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair and settled across from her. \u201cIs this a late breakfast or an early lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my meal in between. I\u2019ve been starving for days. Not sure why. Maybe the baby\u2019s having a growth spurt. Do they do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot especially. I brought you something.\u201d She pointed to the stack of books on the table. \u201cSince you\u2019re stuck here for a while I thought you\u2019d like a chance to find enlightenment.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the books and saw several of them were textbooks on wine making and grape growing.</p><p>This was Brenna\u2014subtle as an explosion. Too bad he wasn\u2019t interested in playing the game.</p><p>\u201cNot for me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Joe. You could look them over. Read a few pages. You might find yourself fascinated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna, don\u2019t push me on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019m pregnant. It\u2019s not as if you can threaten me physically. Besides, it\u2019s time you accepted who you are\u2014a Marcelli. Wine is cool.\u201d</p><p>He swore under his breath, then pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not interested and I\u2019m never going to be interested. Not in this place, the land, or the wine. Just so we\u2019re all clear on the subject. This isn\u2019t my home, and you\u2019re not my family.\u201d</p><p>A flick of movement caught his attention. He turned and saw Grandma Tessa standing in the doorway that led to the dining room. Her eyes were wide and filled with pain.</p><p>Perfect, Joe thought grimly. The day was going just perfect.</p><p>He hesitated, not sure what to say, then he figured there weren\u2019t any words and he stalked out of the house.</p><p>Darcy wandered through the various rooms of the winery. Although Brenna had given a very detailed tour, she couldn\u2019t remember what all the equipment was for. The various barrels were marked, but not in any language she recognized. She supposed there was a code that explained what was inside, when it had been put in the barrel, and maybe even when it was supposed to come out.</p><p>All so interesting, she thought, breathing in the thick scent of grapes and wine and something yeasty\u2014almost like bread. She found herself wanting to know more about the process and how the decisions were made.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re intrigued.\u201d</p><p>She turned and found Grandpa Lorenzo standing behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it,\u201d she told him with a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I didn\u2019t know about wine until I got here. I don\u2019t drink it much at home, and when I go out, someone else usually picks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout wine, there can\u2019t be life,\u201d the elderly man told her. \u201cCome. I will show you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned heavily on his cane as he led the way into another room filled with large, stainless steel vats.</p><p>\u201cThe white wines,\u201d he said. \u201cChardonnays and blends. Different kinds of barrels give a different taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how can metal give a taste at all?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou are right. The wine is different because it doesn\u2019t have the flavors of the wood. We play tricks with the grapes. We tease them and coax them. Sometimes they listen, sometimes they do not. Like children. We know what is best, but there are times everyone has to learn on his own.\u201d</p><p>He led her into a room filled with all kinds of equipment and a narrow conveyor belt that looked like a snake. \u201cWe bottle here. You will come and watch. It\u2019s very interesting. Brenna can\u2019t stand to be here. She says the treatment is too hard on the wine and it makes her sad to see it battered.\u201d</p><p>He pointed out where the barrels were emptied and how the liquid flowed into the bottles. Labels were applied, corks pushed in, then sealed with foil coverings.</p><p>\u201cSo many things can go wrong,\u201d Lorenzo told her. \u201cThe bottles don\u2019t move, the wine doesn\u2019t pour, the labels are crooked. But we persevere and then we have this....\u201d</p><p>He opened a door, and she saw cases of wine nearly stacked to the ceiling. They were everywhere, leaving only enough space for a small table, a phone, and an intercom.</p><p>\u201cMy retreat,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I want to be alone. I like the room when it\u2019s like this\u2014crowded before the trucks come to take the wine away. In a few days it will be empty. I spend my afternoons out here. Tessa worries about me. I\u2019m too old to be alone.\u201d He touched the intercom. \u201cI call her from here. It buzzes in the kitchen. But still she worries. An old woman.\u201d</p><p>Darcy heard the love in his voice, and it made her feel warm inside. They had to have been married fifty or sixty years, yet there was still caring, still affection.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very lucky,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou would think so, eh, but look at this.\u201d He opened one of the cases and pulled out a bottle of chardonnay. He pointed at the label. \u201cThe same one for too many years. But can we get a new one? No. Brenna brings me designs. They\u2019re so bad. Animals and flowers. We are Marcelli Wines. We have a proud tradition.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His voice lowered and his expression softened. \u201cNow she has a baby of her own to keep her busy. So the labels will stay, and we will go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe she runs two wineries,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Too much, sometimes, but she\u2019s stubborn. When I wouldn\u2019t let her run Marcelli, she started her own label. Foolish girl. But the first releases are out. She scored high and sold everything within a week.\u201d</p> <p>There was pride in his voice. Darcy understood that Grandpa Lorenzo would be an exacting boss, but she wouldn\u2019t mind dealing with the old man. For him, family was everything.</p><p>\u201cYou have a sister?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo nodded. \u201cAnd your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died when I was sixteen. My father never remarried. In politics it\u2019s difficult to find the time to have a personal life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, a man shouldn\u2019t be alone. It\u2019s not right. Look at my Joe. Alone for too many years.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not subtle, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an old man who wants to see his only grandson married. He\u2019s a handsome fellow. Strong. He would be a good provider.\u201d</p><p>Darcy grinned. \u201cYes, and he seems to have very nice teeth. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be a good breeder.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo smiled. \u201cYou tease me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. I don\u2019t think Joe is interested in me that way.\u201d Although he had just kissed her. Hmm, the lip-pressing did sort of make things more intriguing.</p> <p>\u201cYou could make him interested,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cYou have ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as many as you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>She heard someone calling her name. A familiar someone. Male, tall, and with good teeth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in here,\u201d she yelled.</p><p>Joe walked into the storage room. \u201cPaige and Alex were going crazy. You disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. Your grandfather and I were just talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cAbout your heritage.\u201d</p> <p>Joe shook his head. \u201cNot now, old man. Let me get Darcy back to her Secret Service team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this family?\u201d Lorenzo demanded, banging his cane on the wooden floor. \u201cWhat about your duty to it? You should be married and having babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, gotta go,\u201d Darcy said, taking that as her cue to leave. She waved and hurried out of the room. Oh, yeah. Hanging with Alex and Paige was much less pressure than dealing with Joe\u2019s inability to get along with his family.</p><p>Joe watched Darcy duck out. Lucky her. She could simply walk away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in getting married,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>\u201cSo we all know. And what will happen when you are? What will you call her?\u201d</p><p>Joe frowned. \u201cMy wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she be a Larson? That is not your real name. You are a Marcelli. You should take back the family name. Be proud you are one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime,\u201d Joe growled as he turned on his heel and walked out of the room. Change his name? He was Joe Larson, always had been. It was bad enough the old man pressured him about getting married, and now Brenna expected him to learn more about the winery.</p><p>The need to run, to bolt for freedom, quickened his step, but there wasn\u2019t anywhere to go. As long as Darcy Jensen was in residence, he was trapped.</p><p>He\u2019d barely made it to the barrel room of the winery when he ran into Alex Vanmeter. The head of security didn\u2019t look happy as he glared at Joe and announced, \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>A lex led Joe around to the back of the winery and checked to make sure they were alone. Then he turned on Joe and let loose.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d the agent demanded. Fury tightened his features and sharpened his voice. \u201cYou are our liaison with the family. You\u2019re a goddamn trained SEAL. You\u2019re supposed to be protecting Darcy, not putting her in danger. You have no right to prance around here, sucking face with the president\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Joe groaned. Between his family and Darcy, he was in the seventh level of hell and sinking fast.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask how Alex knew about the kiss. No doubt the agent on duty had followed them and seen the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what we\u2019re up against?\u201d Alex demanded. \u201cThis is not an easy location to keep secure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have picked it,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job, and that\u2019s all you get from me. Darcy can kiss who she wants. It\u2019s not putting her at risk, so you can stop the lecture.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lieutenant Commander. Kissing her didn\u2019t put her at risk, but walking off and leaving her alone sure did.\u201d</p><p>Joe stiffened. Alex was right. Joe had reacted in the moment, both by kissing her and then by stalking off. He\u2019d needed to get away, to figure out what he thought he was doing. In that moment he hadn\u2019t considered who Darcy was or why she was here. If that other agent hadn\u2019t been there...</p><p>He swore long and loudly.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d Alex said. \u201cI\u2019ll be e-mailing a report to your commanding officer. I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll be with us much longer.\u201d</p><p>Joe knew he\u2019d more than earned the action. He heard a flushing sound, followed by the visual of his career slipping down the toilet. The hell of it was, this time he had no one to blame but himself.</p><p>\u201cIn your position, I would do exactly the same,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I left the subject unprotected. If your man hadn\u2019t been there, she would have been completely exposed and vulnerable. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWhy should I believe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t make the same mistake twice. Because I know my job.\u201d</p><p>Alex shook his head. \u201cFine. Then remember to do it the next time you\u2019re alone with Darcy.\u201d</p><p>He turned and walked away.</p><p>Joe stared after him. What was wrong with him? He knew better. Why had he reacted to Darcy? Why had he kissed her?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just because she was a woman. He\u2019d worked with women before. Dozens of times. A lot of them had been prettier, smarter, or sexier, and he\u2019d never once lost sight of his objective. Enemy operatives had attempted to seduce him with some highly erotic practices, and he\u2019d ignored them all.</p><p>So why Darcy?</p><p>\u201cJoe! There you are.\u201d</p><p>Mia rounded the corner of the building with Ian in tow. Joe\u2019s bad mood worsened when he saw the tall, thin young man. There was something about Ian that got on his nerves. Reason number one surfaced the second the lanky blond caught sight of him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Joe,\u201d Ian said cheerfully. \u201cHow\u2019s it going? We\u2019ve been walking around the winery. It\u2019s so great here. I\u2019ve never been to a winery before.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve never been much of a wine drinker. But yesterday afternoon Mia took me over to the tasting room. It\u2019s really nice there. I like the garden and all the grass around it. She said you guys have weddings there. It would be beautiful for a wedding. Anyway, we had lots of different wines. We tried all the merlots and had a couple of the Four Sisters pinots. Those were really great. Mia told me all about Brenna starting her own winery. That\u2019s really cool. That she would do that. You\u2019re in the navy, right? A SEAL? I saw that movie. Navy SEALs. It was great. Macho. Didn\u2019t that one guy get shot? Huh. I guess if they\u2019d had you along, that wouldn\u2019t have happened? Oh, the Secret Service cleared me. But I guess you knew that. I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><p>When he paused for breath, Mia jumped in. \u201cSo how are things?\u201d</p><p>Joe shrugged. \u201cFine.\u201d He stared at Ian. What did she see in the guy? Mia caught his gaze and grinned, as if she could read his mind. She mouthed something that looked very much like \u201che\u2019s really good in bed,\u201d which he didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to Darcy,\u201d Ian said. \u201cWhat\u2019s she like? She\u2019s prettier in person, don\u2019t you think? Of course I really like Lauren. She\u2019s always helping with those sick kids and it was really sad when her husband died. It was in that ice storm, wasn\u2019t it? When D.C. was shut down and his car went off the road. I saw their whole wedding. I was in high school and my mom had this big party and all her friends came over and watched. She made these funny sandwiches and a little wedding cake. It was really good, with a chocolate filling.\u201d</p><p>Joe started backing away. \u201cI, ah, gotta write a report,\u201d he said, interrupting Ian\u2019s flow of conversation. \u201cSee you guys around.\u201d</p><p>With that, he ducked into a rear door of the winery and wandered the halls as he headed toward the front of the building. As he rounded a corner, he saw Marco sitting in an office and knocked on the open door.</p><p>\u201cJoe! Come in. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaping Ian. Mia\u2019s had some interesting guys before but never anyone like him,\u201d he said, taking a seat.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Marco leaned back in his chair. \u201cI\u2019m never fond of anyone my youngest daughter is sleeping with, but Ian is worse than most. I try to tell myself that he\u2019s basically a nice guy, even though he never stops talking. Besides, your mother likes him, as does mine.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t react to Colleen being called his mother, or the guilt he felt over what had happened with Tessa. Instead he focused on the topic at hand. \u201cThen they\u2019re too easy.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded at the sales report posted on the wall by the door. \u201cWe\u2019re having a good year. My father has done a great job with the winery for many years, but Brenna brings a touch of magic to the wines. She knows what our customers want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working hard,\u201d Joe acknowledged, wondering if he was about to get nailed again.</p><p>Marco struck immediately. \u201cShe could use some help.\u201d</p><p>Joe regretted sitting down. \u201cI\u2019m sure she can hire a good manager to help after the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that,\u201d Marco told him. \u201cJoe, I know you love what you do with the navy, but in time that will end. You\u2019ll put in your twenty and retire. Then what? Where will you go? We would like you to come here. You\u2019re a Marcelli, Joe. You belong here.\u201d</p><p>Joe stood. \u201cLook, Marco, I know what you want, what the whole family wants. It\u2019s not going to happen. I appreciate that you\u2019re trying. It\u2019s great. You guys are terrific, but this isn\u2019t my world and you\u2019re not....\u201d He hesitated, not sure he could say they weren\u2019t his family again. Hadn\u2019t he hurt enough people already that morning?</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d he finished lamely.</p><p>Marco nodded without speaking, but Joe saw the pain in his eyes. Whoever thought families were a good idea, he wondered as he excused himself and escaped into the quiet of the hallway. Give him a nice armed insurgence any day. At least there he would know what to do.</p><p>Paige faced the special agent in charge and prepared to do battle. \u201cYou\u2019re not reporting Joe to his superior officer,\u201d she said, going for a calm, but forceful, tone.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Alex said flatly. \u201cWhat he did is inexcusable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree he screwed up, but that\u2019s no reason to serve him up on a platter. I\u2019m sure he was shocked by what happened.\u201d She\u2019d been shocked. It had been a long time since the president\u2019s daughter had gotten involved with anyone, and if Paige were offering opinions, she would bet Joe was one of the good guys, but Joe and Darcy? It didn\u2019t seem very likely.</p><p>\u201cHe left her alone,\u201d Alex reminded her.</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. Agent Briggs was with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that. It\u2019s my decision, and I\u2019m not changing my mind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned to leave, but Paige grabbed his arm to hold him in place. Temper flared in his dark blue eyes, but she had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t shake her off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about Joe,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf you report him, you\u2019ll have to explain the circumstances. You\u2019ll have to talk about the fact that they kissed. Darcy will be humiliated. Give the girl a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rules to follow,\u201d Alex began.</p> <p>\u201cOh, and you\u2019ve never once bent them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Figures. \u201cTry being human,\u201d she said. \u201cJust this once. You\u2019ve already lectured Joe. He\u2019s not going to screw up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have screwed up at all. He knows better. He can\u2019t walk around thinking with his dick. He needs his brain engaged.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you being this much of a bastard before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy only concern is Darcy\u2019s safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her happiness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be very happy when she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>He was right, Paige realized. They were talking about Darcy\u2019s life, and there was no room for error. She released him.</p><p>\u201cGiving up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDarcy is my primary concern. I want her alive and happy, but if I only have one choice, I\u2019ll pick alive.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy curled up in the library. It was a quiet spot in the Marcelli house, and she liked the view she had of the vineyards out the east-facing window. She also liked that she was completely and totally alone, and not scared about it. When she\u2019d returned from her visit with Grandpa Lorenzo, she\u2019d informed Paige she would stay in for the rest of the afternoon, which meant she didn\u2019t have to deal with any security.</p><p>Now, as she leaned back in the big leather chair, she breathed in a sense of peace. Maybe it was knowing there were so many people around to keep her safe. Maybe it was because her brain still buzzed with the memory of Joe\u2019s kiss. Maybe her astrological moon was rising into a better house. Whatever the reason, she didn\u2019t care. Feeling good was fabulous.</p><p>She picked up her book, then set it down again. She\u2019d loved the feel of his body against hers. It had been a long time since a man had held her as if he meant it. She wouldn\u2019t mind a repeat of the kiss and maybe a little bit of time spent playing the bases with Joe. Not that he was likely to offer, but a girl could dream.</p><p>The door to the library opened and the star of her sexual fantasies walked in. He glanced around, then spotted her.</p><p>\u201cOh. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, not the least bit put out by his sullenness. From what she could tell, Joe hated everyone. His attitude wasn\u2019t personal. \u201cI\u2019ve always admired a man who handled his abundance of charm with such grace. It\u2019s so elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a bad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I take that comment personally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He closed the door behind him then crossed to the window. \u201cNo. It\u2019s not about, you know.\u201d</p><p>You know? How interesting. The big, bad Navy SEAL couldn\u2019t say kiss? He prowled the room like a tiger, and she had the urge to tweak his tail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, actually. What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cOur kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together, and she had a feeling he was going to start yelling at her. All that energy, she thought, more intrigued than afraid. He must have been one fine soldier.</p><p>\u201cI hate Ian,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>The change of subject caught her off guard for a second. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sleeping with your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cYou\u2019ve never claimed one of the Marcellis as family before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read anything into it. It\u2019s just Mia\u2019s a baby. She thinks she\u2019s wild and tough, but she\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you worry about her.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in midstride and glared.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said. \u201cMy lips are sealed. Besides, even if I wasn\u2019t interested in keeping your secrets, I don\u2019t want to mess up a good thing. I like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I didn\u2019t think I would. There are too many people and it\u2019s so wide open here. But I like the whole family. You should try to appreciate what you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019ve heard enough of that to last a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were smarter, you\u2019d realize how lucky you are to have found the Marcellis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been fighting them ever since.\u201d</p><p>He returned to the window. \u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can, but I don\u2019t want to. Besides, if you hate what we\u2019re talking about, you could leave.\u201d</p><p>His silence told her he couldn\u2019t. But why?</p><p>\u201cAre you hiding out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running out of places to go.\u201d</p><p>A feeling she understood. She uncoiled her legs and rested her feet on the floor. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll stop torturing you for sport, but I won\u2019t change the subject. You have a terrific family. You\u2019re crazy if you don\u2019t appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cWhy does it matter so much to you?\u201d</p><p>Because he had everything she\u2019d ever wanted. \u201cMy family is small, and we\u2019re not so close,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>\u201cThen you take \u2019em. I want to get back to base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the navy is your real home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be nice to spend your day saving the world.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed, as if he thought she might be teasing him. Darcy did her best to look innocent, although the excessive blinking might have given her away. But before Joe could get all macho on her again, the door opened and Grandma Tessa stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cJoseph,\u201d she said tentatively, her expression fearful. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come inside.\u201d She nodded at Darcy. \u201cI made sandwiches. You didn\u2019t come to lunch.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, then back out the window. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>Darcy winced as the old woman seemed to shrink two inches. \u201cAll right, Joseph.\u201d</p><p>Tessa turned and left.</p><p>Darcy stood, walked over to Joe, and socked him in the arm as hard as she could. He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for whatever you did to Grandma Tessa.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared hard at the view. \u201cGet off of me.\u201d</p><p>She socked him again. He didn\u2019t budge, but she really hurt her hand. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me or I\u2019ll start talking about girl stuff.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, no he couldn\u2019t. She searched her memories for something that would bring him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cI was twelve when I got my first period,\u201d she began.</p><p>He swore. \u201cFine. I had a fight with Brenna. I told her the Marcellis weren\u2019t my family. Tessa walked in and heard me.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cThat bites. How could you do that to her? She\u2019s an old woman who loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d he yelled as he turned toward her. \u201cOkay? I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned toward him. \u201cWell, don\u2019t apologize to me. And don\u2019t yell. Besides if you were really sorry, you would have taken her sandwich.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, then closed it. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sandwich. The sandwich. Man, you might know a whole bunch about guns and rescuing people but you don\u2019t know anything about women, do you? Ever hear the expression \u2018food is love\u2019? Tessa is old-world Italian. She shows her affection by feeding her family. Every time she offers you food, she\u2019s offering you love. When you reject the meal, you reject her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>She really wanted to hit him again, but her knuckles still hurt. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Just eat the food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said as he walked out of the library. \u201cThis is all bullshit.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>L ife got ugly for Darcy when her favorite black cotton pants wouldn\u2019t zip up without her performing an inelegant shimmy on her back, on the bed. Once she sat up, breathing became impossible.</p><p>While she knew she had to put on a few pounds, she didn\u2019t think gaining them directly in her stomach and hips was anyone\u2019s idea of attractive. There was only one thing to do.</p><p>After rooting through one of her still-packed suitcases, she came across a pair of bicycle shorts, a black sports bra, and some serious-looking athletic shoes. They\u2019d been designed by NASA or somebody equally scientific. Apparently if she put in some effort while wearing them, she could jump tall buildings and all that.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she muttered as she laced up the shoes. \u201cThis is me\u2014working out.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later she\u2019d made her way to the Marcelli workout room. As all the equipment was relatively new and didn\u2019t look very used, she wondered if the space had been created for Joe\u2019s infrequent visits home. Somehow she couldn\u2019t see Grandma Tessa taking twenty on the treadmill.</p><p>She bypassed the running machine and went directly to the elliptical. There she punched in one of the existing programs, set the tension for as easy as possible, and pushed the On button.</p><p>Exercising was bad enough, but this room made it worse with four walls of mirrors. She got to watch her face turn bright red, then admire the drops of sweat as they formed and dripped off her nose. Talk about fashion forward.</p><p>Oh God, she thought nearly six minutes into her workout. She couldn\u2019t breathe. No way she\u2019d gotten this out of shape. She was only twenty-six.</p><p>\u201cOn the outside,\u201d she wheezed. \u201cOn the inside, I\u2019m a hundred and nine. Why does healthy have to be so h-hard?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath as the machine increased the tension. According to the heart monitor, she\u2019d barely broken triple digits on her heart rate, but her chest felt tight, and her legs were ready to quit in serious protest. Flames licked up her thighs, and not the exciting, sexy kind.</p><p>\u201cLauren does this every day,\u201d she gasped. \u201cAnd she runs. She\u2019s sicker than I thought.\u201d</p><p>At fifteen minutes into her twenty-minute program, she knew she was going to die. The Secret Service would come looking for her and find her sweaty but lifeless body bent over the machine. Paige would be sad, but everyone else would simply move on to the next assignment.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. I ca\u2014\u201d</p><p>The workout room door opened and Joe walked in.</p><p>Suddenly things like breathing and painful muscles didn\u2019t matter. Not when there was an entire buffet of eye candy, not only in person but reflected in the mirrors.</p><p>She instantly straightened so he wouldn\u2019t know how close she\u2019d come to quitting and sucked in her gut. A deep breath and a lot of effort allowed her to say, \u201cMorning. How\u2019s it going,\u201d as if she weren\u2019t completely winded.</p><p>Joe looked at her, then the door. He\u2019d pretty much avoided everyone for the past twenty-four hours. Would he duck out now?</p><p>Apparently he needed the workout more than he wanted to be away from her. He grunted a greeting and walked to the treadmill. He, too, punched in a program, but he set his for warp speed. After about thirty seconds of a fast walk, he started jogging, then broke into a run.</p><p>Darcy had planned on doing her twenty minutes, then escaping to her room for some serious relaxation. But with Joe running so earnestly and his loose T-shirt flopping over thick, powerful muscles, she thought she might stay long enough to work with the set of free weights in the far corner. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her machine beeped, freeing her from its torture. She patted her face with the towel she\u2019d brought, then moved to the bench by the weights. It was in the perfect position, allowing her to see Joe from not only the front but also the back, which was reflected in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cMissed you at dinner last night,\u201d she said as she picked up two ten-pound weights and raised them to shoulder height. \u201cGrammy M stopped by, which meant Grandma Tessa was in a snit. She wasn\u2019t talking, but no one could tell because Ian babbled on and on about college and his studies and where he and Mia have been. He made Vegas sound boring, something I didn\u2019t think was possible.\u201d</p><p>Joe picked up the pace on the treadmill, which she took to mean that he was really enjoying their conversation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here because of the pasta,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s going all to my stomach, which is bad enough, but I know the next stop is my thighs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lifting wrong.\u201d</p><p>She paused in midpush, the weights just above her head, her elbows bent.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with your palms facing in, then turn them out as you push up.\u201d</p> <p>She dropped the weights to her lap because it was too complicated to change position in midexercise. For a half second she considered ignoring his instructions. If she did it wrong again would he abandon the treadmill to sit next to her and show her how? Would he put his large, masculine hands on her damp, hot body and\u2014</p><p>Whoa\u2014stop that fantasy train right there. No more sexy thoughts about Joe, she told herself firmly. He wasn\u2019t for her. He didn\u2019t even like her. One kiss did not a relationship make.</p><p>She did a set of ten presses, then switched to bicep curls. He continued to run at a grueling pace designed to make her hurt just watching him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you mad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scowling.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced in the mirror and realized he was right. She instantly relaxed her face and tried to think happy thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNot a morning person?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t had coffee yet.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask how he knew. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fit into my pants. I figured I\u2019d better start working out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to gain weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the news flash, but you\u2019ve already berated me for that. You don\u2019t get to do it again.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you can stop me.\u201d</p> <p>She felt the scowl reappear.</p><p>\u201cYell at me,\u201d he said. \u201cI can take it. Are you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s an interesting topic.\u201d</p><p>He was trying to make her mad, and he was succeeding. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about you,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI may be a skinny insomniac with post-traumatic shock or some such crap, but at least I don\u2019t go around hurting my grandmother\u2019s feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel like a good point. If anything, Darcy would say it felt small and mean-spirited. \u201cI, ah...\u201d Apologize, she told herself. The thing was, she didn\u2019t do it very often, so she wasn\u2019t very good at it. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>That stunned her, but the shock was nothing when compared with what he said next. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about what you said. The food-is-love connection. You might be right.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d had any rhythm, she would have stood up and done a little victory dance. Instead she contented herself with a smug smile.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks for the endorsement. I won\u2019t let it go to my head. Besides, the concept is hardly revolutionary. Most mothers show love with food, mine always did. The Marcelli family is Italian, so they have that gene in spades.\u201d She considered his past. \u201cDidn\u2019t your adoptive mother do the same thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I was a kid when my parents died. I barely remember what they look like.\u201d</p><p>The sadness inherent in the statement made her want to walk over and hug him. Both the jogging and her visceral reaction to him made that action impossible. Still, an ache settled in her midsection and made her more determined than ever to help him connect with his family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she did the same thing,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we as women can help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he admitted, with obvious reluctance. \u201cMy ex used to make cookies for her kids when they had a bad day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d She instantly wanted to ask more questions about his previous marriage but thought her obvious curiosity might destroy the moment.</p><p>She set down the weights and stood. \u201cI know you\u2019re ambivalent about your family, but what I don\u2019t know is why. They only want to love you, Joe. What\u2019s so bad about that?\u201d</p><p>He hit the Stop button on the treadmill and glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this go, are you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head as the moment died. \u201cIt\u2019s too important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a compassionate person, and don\u2019t you dare laugh. It\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t doubt it. He might not enjoy his current assignment, but it wasn\u2019t because of Darcy. Somehow the press had become convinced she was a prima dona bitch with an attitude, and they slanted all their stories that way. But it wasn\u2019t true. Oh, sure, Darcy could use sarcasm like a weapon and she was verbally deadly when she was angry, but at heart, she was a complete pushover.</p><p>He wiped his face and neck, then stepped off the treadmill and headed for the mats covering the floor at the rear of the room.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her expression turned suspicious. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He held in a grin. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as you might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can\u2019t ask you to change the subject. For some reason you\u2019re convinced you can heal me and make me want to bond with my family. So I\u2019m trying to distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. How?\u201d</p><p>He crooked his index finger, beckoning her over. \u201cCome on, Darcy. You know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to at all,\u201d she said, but she began to move toward him. \u201cAre you going to teach me some new exercises?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I\u2019m going to teach you a few moves to ward off would-be attackers. Your Secret Service team should have done it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to a few self-defense classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough. I\u2019m going to teach you to fight dirty. Stand here.\u201d He positioned her in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m going to grab you. I want you to try and break free.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and wrapped both arms around her. The second he did, he knew he\u2019d made a huge mistake.</p><p>She was hot and sweaty from her workout, which should have been a turnoff, but instead it made him think of other kinds of activity that could work up a sweat. He instantly pictured them rolling around together in bed, bodies sliding together, hands reaching, them both straining to\u2014</p><p>He shook off the thought and did his best not to react. In nylon shorts there was no way he could hide a hard-on.</p><p>Focus, he told himself. He had to remember what was important.</p><p>\u201cElbow me in the midsection,\u201d he said. \u201cAs hard as you can. And don\u2019t worry, you can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, then rammed her elbow into his midsection. He barely felt it.</p><p>\u201cHarder, Darcy. I\u2019m the bad guy. Do it like you mean it.\u201d</p><p>She hit him again, but it wasn\u2019t much more than a slight blow. Her security wrist band barely moved. He released her. \u201cAre you even trying?\u201d</p><p>She huffed. \u201cYes. And let me say for the record\u2014ouch.\u201d She rubbed her arm.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help chuckling. \u201cThat was it? That was your big power play?\u201d</p><p>Fury darkened her eyes and determination pulled at her mouth. Even all blotchy and damp, she was still pretty, he thought, amused by her temper. The sports bra and shorts left nothing to the imagination. She might be all female, but she was sadly lacking in curves. Still, he wanted her. Funny how it didn\u2019t matter that she wasn\u2019t his usual type.</p><p>\u201cI want to do it again,\u201d she said, turning her back to him.</p><p>He obliged her by stepping close and grabbing her. One of his hands was right below her left breast. He felt the heat of the modest swell, and it was all he could do not to reach up and cup the feminine flesh. Would her nipple get hard right away? Would it\u2014</p><p>Bam! She nailed him hard in the gut, and he\u2019d forgotten to prepare. Her bony elbow connected painfully with a rib. At the same time she stomped down hard on his foot, then turned to face him, both hands raised in fists.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said, ignoring the pain. \u201cBut don\u2019t take on your attacker. Run like hell. My point is, you can\u2019t use conventional methods to hurt a man who\u2019s bigger and stronger. That\u2019s what I wanted to demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>She looked disappointed. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He ignored the fading pain in his midsection. \u201cDo I look hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to her face. \u201cGo for the eyes. Or the base of your palm to the base of the nose. Push hard, toward the eyes.\u201d He explained a few other vulnerable points.</p><p>\u201cWhat if there\u2019s more than one?\u201d she asked when he\u2019d paused. \u201cWhat do I do then?\u201d</p><p>He remembered the attack that had brought her here in the first place. \u201cHow many were there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour. They grabbed me and tied me up before I could do anything.\u201d</p><p>He reached out and put his hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to win against four guys, Darcy. There\u2019s nothing you could have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could have held off four guys?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI have years of training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I learn?\u201d</p><p>Would it help? Would it make her feel safer? \u201cIf you wanted to. First you need to get some muscle on your body. Those weights you were working with are fine to tone up, but you need to be pushing yourself.\u201d He glanced over her frame. \u201cYou should be able to bench-press a hundred pounds and leg press double that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAre you crazy? I\u2019ll look like some kind of freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t bulk up. Women don\u2019t. Besides, muscle makes you tight and defined.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWhat is it about women and looking muscular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cultural. As the half of the species rewarded for being bigger, you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said I was too skinny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cLet me guess. You like lots of curves on your women.\u201d</p><p>He sensed this was a dangerous conversation and didn\u2019t respond with more than a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look perfectly okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow. I can hardly breathe from the excited beating of my heart. What a compliment. I\u2019ll treasure it always.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she was upset, but he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cYou know you\u2019re attractive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Her unenthusiastic response and the way she averted her gaze made him wonder if she did. He moved a little closer.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, you are. You have a pretty face, great eyes, and when you smile, it\u2019s like you\u2019re sharing a secret with the world.\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cThanks. I appreciate you saying that, but in my family, Lauren\u2019s the pretty one. Not that I mind,\u201d she added hastily.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get over your sister complex.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and rolled her eyes. \u201cGee, Dr. Larson, thanks for the psychological evaluation. But it\u2019s not that simple. Life keeps getting in the way. For example, the first guy I ever slept with turned out to not be interested in me at all. He suffered through our relationship simply to get an invitation home for winter break where he hit on my sister. Lauren, being Lauren, refused to have anything to do with him, but that didn\u2019t take away the sting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why had he started this conversation?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a jerk, and you\u2019re better off without him,\u201d Joe told her.</p><p>\u201cI know that, but it\u2019s not the point. And at the time, it really hurt. There I was, heartbroken, and my sister was trying to make it better. She\u2019s just a nice person.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sounds perfect.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. \u201cShe is. Pretty much in everything she does. Everyone loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect can get boring.\u201d</p><p>Darcy glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you say anything bad about my sister.\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands and took a step back. \u201cYou have a pretty complex relationship with Lauren.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cSorry for snapping. Sometimes...\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a multifaceted person.\u201d</p><p>And charming, he thought as he moved closer. Funny, vulnerable. And the president\u2019s daughter. He was just the hired help. Getting involved would be crazy.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow,\u201d she breathed as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kiss you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy watched desire darken Joe\u2019s eyes. He might claim he wasn\u2019t going to kiss her, but she would bet a lot of money that he wanted to. She felt all shivery and hot and nervous. But she didn\u2019t move away. Not even an inch. If there was the potential for some lip-lock, she wanted to be there for the whole thing.</p> <p>He reached out and touched her cheek with his fingers. \u201cI could lose my career over this,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo woman could ever be worth that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t step away, and the thought thrilled her. He wanted her. She could feel it in the tension in his body. He wanted her. Not Lauren, he wasn\u2019t interested in political favors. He was\u2014</p><p>He leaned forward and claimed her mouth with his. There was heat and promise in that first brush of his lips. She relaxed into him, raising her arms to his shoulders, and let her body sag into his hardness. He pulled her close, angled his head, and swept his tongue against her bottom lip.</p><p>She parted without thinking. Need overwhelmed her, and the second he eased inside to claim her, she knew it wasn\u2019t going to be enough. She wanted more. She wanted all of it.</p><p>Hunger swept through her, causing her to run her hands up and down his back, urging him closer. Her breasts flattened against his chest, her thighs nestled with his. She wanted to rub against him like a cat\u2014she wanted him touching her everywhere.</p><p>Instead she had to content herself with a deep, sensual, perfect kiss. He claimed her mouth with a mastery that left her breathless. His tongue circled hers, teasing, arousing, delighting. His large hands stroked her back before moving lower to cup her rear. When he squeezed, she arched forward, bringing her belly in contact with his erection.</p> <p>Her breath caught as she realized he was hard. She\u2019d made him want her. Need swelled as did her nipples. They ached. She ached.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she slid her hands under his T-shirt until she touched bare skin. He was hot and slightly damp, and she found herself wanting to explore him all over. First with her fingers and then with her tongue. She wanted to taste him and consume him.</p><p>He pulled back with a suddenness that made her gasp. They stared at each other, both breathing hard. Joe\u2019s eyes were dilated.</p><p>Silence filled the room. She waited for him to dismiss what had happened between them. Not because she believed he could, but because her luck with men just wasn\u2019t that good. He stunned her when he gave her a half-grin, half-grimace and said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be that great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, unable to keep from smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re big trouble. Your father is my commander in chief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that really matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t answer her question.</p><p>\u201cYou go first,\u201d he said, motioning to the door.</p><p>Right. So they weren\u2019t seen together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here,\u201d he continued. \u201cUntil it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt anyone is lurking in the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d He pointed at his crotch.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He was obviously hard, and it was damned impressive. \u201cRight. You don\u2019t want to flash that at Grandma Tessa.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cTalking about her will help solve the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to serve.\u201d</p><p>Mia caught up with Darcy late that morning. \u201cYou have to come right now,\u201d Mia said as she burst into Darcy\u2019s room. \u201cI\u2019m convinced there\u2019s something going on between Paige and Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s crazy. Agents can\u2019t be involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the rules are, but they\u2019re always giving each other these smoldering looks. I\u2019ve called a meeting of the Marcelli women and you have to be there. I mean, you\u2019re one of us, now.\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t think that was true, but she was delighted to be asked. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d Mia grinned. \u201cFrancesca is coming, too, so you can meet her and the twins. They\u2019re at the insane age. Running around and getting into everything. There\u2019s two of them and only seven of us. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cI think we can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cHave you ever been around toddler twins? Trust me, every second is an adventure.\u201d</p><p>It turned out Mia was telling the truth. Eric and Haley were two and a half and too adorable for words. They both had dark hair, and blue, blue eyes. Haley had the kind of curls women sell their souls for. They were also bundles of energy who refused to be contained.</p><p>The Marcelli women gathered in the large living room where Darcy met Francesca Reese for the first time. Brenna\u2019s fraternal twin was tall and slender, with short, dark hair and beautiful features.</p><p>Brenna settled in a corner of the couch, then announced she would need help when it was time for her to stand up.</p><p>\u201cDo you like her hair?\u201d Brenna asked, pointing at Francesca.</p><p>Darcy nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo typical. I cut my hair three years ago and I looked like a yak. She does it right after the twins were born and she\u2019s a supermodel.\u201d Brenna eyed the twins as they raced around the coffee table. \u201cPlease, God, no twins for me. I\u2019d have to kill myself.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M picked up her cup of tea. \u201cBrenna, darlin\u2019, be careful how you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to the Lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sincere. I\u2019m really worried about the twin thing. I can\u2019t have twins. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019ll be forced to send them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Colleen told her daughter. \u201cThey resist the process.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cThis is nice, having my girls here. Except for Katie. I miss her. If only she lived closer.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M smiled at Brenna. \u201cSee how a mother loves her children? You\u2019ll do the same, twins or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Brenna didn\u2019t sound convinced.</p><p>Mia flopped down on the second sofa and reached for a cookie on one of the plates of food Grandma Tessa had brought into the room. There\u2019d been a minor scuffle in the kitchen when Grammy M had shown up with brownies, but now Tessa\u2019s cookies and Grammy M\u2019s brownies sat at separate tables.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it show up in an ultrasound?\u201d Mia asked as she munched. \u201cWouldn\u2019t they see four arms or legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had a couple to make sure things are all right. Nic and I don\u2019t want to know the sex of the baby, and if you keep going, someone is bound to slip. It\u2019s just that at one of the ultrasounds, the technician said there were two babies, but since then, we\u2019ve only seen one.\u201d Brenna tried to lean forward, then sagged back and held out her hand. \u201cSomeone give me a brownie, please. I need chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Little Haley dove for the brownie Colleen picked up, slipped, and banged her head on the coffee table. She started crying, and Eric joined in, Darcy supposed, to be supportive. Francesca grabbed for one twin, Colleen took the other, and Brenna clutched her brownie.</p><p>Mia waited until the sobs had died down, then cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all wondering why I called this meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was because you thought Paige and Alex have something going on,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>Francesca smiled at her. \u201cThey\u2019re your Secret Service agents, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of many,\u201d Darcy said with a shrug.</p><p>Francesca rocked Haley. \u201cYou must get tired of having so many people around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI had plenty of that when I lived here.\u201d</p><p>Tessa bustled into the room and scowled at her granddaughter. \u201cWe\u2019re your family, and you\u2019re lucky to have us.\u201d</p><p>Brenna grinned. \u201cI love you, too, Grandma Tessa.\u201d</p><p>The old woman\u2019s face softened into a smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, back to my agenda,\u201d Mia said. \u201cPaige and Alex. I haven\u2019t actually seen them doing anything, but there are plenty of longing glances. It makes me wonder what\u2019s up. Darcy. You\u2019re the person most likely to know.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at her. Darcy held her mug of tea like a shield. \u201cTime out. I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019ve had Paige on my security team before, but I\u2019ve only just met Alex. To be honest, he\u2019s so by the book, I can\u2019t imagine him with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill waters,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cMen like that can surprise you.\u201d</p><p>Brenna, Francesca, and Mia looked at one another, then Mia said, \u201cMom, if that is any reference to your sex life with Dad, I beg you to stop. No one here wants to know. Especially your daughters. Yuck.\u201d</p><p>Colleen\u2019s smile turned smug. \u201cAll right, girls, don\u2019t freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally freaked,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>Francesca nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s an image I never want in my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex and Paige,\u201d Mia said. \u201cStay focused, people.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Do you want to help them get together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Mia sat up straighter. \u201cI figure we can trick them into being alone together.\u201d</p><p>Interesting plan, Darcy thought. \u201cBut they\u2019re already sharing the guesthouse. Doesn\u2019t that mean they\u2019re alone together every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Mia sank back onto the sofa. \u201cGood point. I guess they don\u2019t need our help. So, Darcy, what do you think of Joe?\u201d</p><p>Darcy immediately sensed the danger of the situation. Still, she faced the other women bravely and decided the best defense and all that.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s great. What can you tell me about his ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected a few murmurs about how lovely she was or maybe shrugs when they said they\u2019d never met her. She didn\u2019t expect stunned silence, followed by forty-seven questions at once.</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Brenna asked. \u201cWhen did he get married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an ex-wife?\u201d Francesca asked. \u201cDo we know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me she\u2019s dead,\u201d Grandma Tessa said as she pulled her beads out of her pocket. \u201cBetter that than a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll tell us what he looked like naked,\u201d Mia mused.</p><p>Joe wandered into the kitchen in the late afternoon. He crossed to the refrigerator before he realized Tessa was at the stove. She looked up when he entered but didn\u2019t say anything. Still, the hurt in her eyes was enough to make him feel like a slug.</p><p>Dammit, what was he supposed to say to her? He couldn\u2019t give her what she wanted, but that didn\u2019t give him the excuse to be cruel.</p><p>He crossed to her and gave her a hug. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what I said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She held him with a fierceness that surprised him. \u201cIt\u2019s been three years, Joseph.\u201d She stepped back and stared up at him. \u201cHow long? When are we family?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how to answer that. He wasn\u2019t going to lie, but he didn\u2019t want to hurt her again.</p><p>She was so small and frail\u2014she didn\u2019t even come to his shoulder. Funny how she seemed so much bigger when she was bustling in the kitchen or bringing a grown man to his knees with one of her deadly cheek pinches.</p> <p>Finally she turned away. \u201cI\u2019ll make you some pasta,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat lunch. You must be hungry.\u201d</p><p>His first instinct was to say no, but then he remembered what Darcy had told him. About food being love.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d he said and was rewarded with a glowing smile.</p><p>\u201cSit, sit. You\u2019ll have bread, too. And salad. Maybe some wine. You like the red, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great. Thanks.\u201d</p> <p>She served the food, poured the wine, then sat down across from him. Later he would swear she waited until he\u2019d taken the first forkful of food and his mouth was full.</p><p>\u201cSo, Joseph. Tell me about your wife.\u201d</p><p>10</p><p>S till feeling the need to hide out after inadvertently dropping a bombshell on the family, Darcy retreated to her room and picked up the secure phone that had been installed the second day of her visit. She dialed a familiar number and was connected with her father\u2019s personal assistant.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Darcy,\u201d she said. \u201cIs he available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. He\u2019s in a meeting with China. Want me to interrupt?\u201d</p> <p>Darcy glanced at her watch. It was nearly five here, which made it close to eight in D.C. As per usual, her father was working late.</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s okay. Tell him...\u201d What? That she missed him? That would make him laugh. \u201cTell him I called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Are you okay? Having a good time?\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked around the room, at the familiar furnishings and the view of the vineyard just beyond her window.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having a great time,\u201d she said.</p><p>Darcy\u2019s bedroom door opened without warning and Joe stalked inside. She was about to point out that he should at least pretend to knock\u2014what if she\u2019d been naked\u2014when she saw the slight twitch in his cheek and something that looked amazingly like the need to squash, beat, or maim in his eyes.</p><p>She put down the book she\u2019d been reading and held up both hands in a gesture that some might take to be surrender.</p><p>\u201cYou never said it was a secret,\u201d she pointed out, speaking quickly. \u201cIt didn\u2019t occur to me they didn\u2019t know. I mean, come on. It\u2019s been three years and you never bothered to mention to your family that you\u2019d been married? That\u2019s not my fault.\u201d</p> <p>He closed the door and walked to the bed. She thought about scooting over and patting the mattress in invitation but doubted that was why he was here.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, his voice tight and clipped, which could be caused by his clenched teeth. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t say I shouldn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you really should have mentioned it to them before this.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the single chair in the room and sank onto the cushion. \u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they hysterical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTessa\u2019s done her rosary twice and is begging me to tell her that my ex is dead, because a dead wife is a whole lot better than divorce in her book. Grammy M and Colleen are hurt, and Brenna and Mia are mad. I haven\u2019t talked with Marco or Lorenzo yet, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give me an earful.\u201d</p><p>He seemed surprised. Men, she thought. Sometimes they weren\u2019t all that bright.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your family. You may not think of them as such, but they think of themselves that way. It\u2019s not like you stubbed your toe and forgot to mention it. You were married. You had a whole other life.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not married now. Haven\u2019t been in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean why did you guys split up?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her without speaking. Darcy figured he was trying to intimidate her. While it kind of worked, she wanted to know more than she was afraid of him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a logical question,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019d ask me the same thing if our positions were reversed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Your loss. So what happened?\u201d</p><p>Joe leaned back in the chair and rubbed the bridge of his nose. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t handle me having to leave without any notice and being gone for months at a time. I\u2019d warned her what it would be like, and she said it was fine. But hearing about it and living it were different. One time I came home and she was gone.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s heart cracked a little in sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. That must have been horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t one of my best moments.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI got over her quicker than I should have, which says something about the state of our relationship, but I really missed the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. Eight and ten. They were great,\u201d he said with a smile that told her he had a lot of good memories. \u201cLater, when I realized who I missed the most, I wondered if they were the real reason I\u2019d wanted to get married. To have an instant family.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words were out, he straightened, getting all stiff, as if he regretted the confession.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted children in his life? She never would have guessed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just so sad,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I got over it.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cMy family doesn\u2019t need to know about the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem. I won\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t mean to spill secrets about your divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I should have told them myself.\u201d</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. Knowing him as she did, she could guess why. But what didn\u2019t make sense was why he\u2019d told her.</p><p>Shortly after midnight, Alex found himself walking restlessly through the small guesthouse. He should have been getting some sleep. He wasn\u2019t on duty, and come morning there would be plenty to do. But he wasn\u2019t sleepy and the light still shining under Paige\u2019s door beckoned him like a siren\u2019s call.</p><p>She\u2019d changed, he acknowledged. Softened, but not in a way that interfered with her doing her job. In that respect, she was as focused as always. She seemed more balanced, more connected with people. The drive had faded, maybe disappeared. He would have bet on her staying as career driven as she\u2019d been when he\u2019d first met her, and it pissed him off that the change was due to another man.</p><p>He paused outside of her door and put his hand on the knob. Going in would be stupid and weak. Better to walk away. He\u2019d managed to forget about her once before. In fact, after they\u2019d split up and gone their separate ways, he\u2019d barely thought about her at all. So what was the big deal now? He could\u2014</p><p>He knocked on the door and opened it at the same time. Paige sat on her bed, reading. There was a glass of wine on the nightstand and soft music playing in the background.</p><p>She raised her eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a little late for business,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re officially off duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He started to back out of the room, but she gestured to the open bottle of wine on the dresser. \u201cHelp yourself,\u201d she told him.</p><p>There was a second glass on the tray. Had she been expecting company? Expecting him?</p><p>After pouring himself a glass of chardonnay, he moved to the overstuffed chair in the corner of the room and sank down.</p><p>\u201cThe assignment\u2019s going well,\u201d he said into the silence.</p><p>Paige closed her book and set it beside her. She wore the same pajamas he\u2019d seen her in before. A tank top over loose pants. No bra. The curve of her breast was clearly visible, as was the slight pucker of her nipple.</p><p>She picked up her wine and took a sip. \u201cI agree. Darcy is relaxing, which is good. I had an interesting talk with Joe today. He thinks Darcy should receive some advanced self-defense training. Maybe get started in some form of martial arts. He also suggested I put together a workout program for her that will get her into some heavy weights.\u201d</p><p>Alex wasn\u2019t sure it would help. \u201cShe was taken by four men. Very few women would be able to stop that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but the training and additional strength would give her more of a sense of control. That might help her sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>He worried more about the subject\u2019s physical safety than her emotional state of mind. Still it couldn\u2019t hurt.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want to do with her is fine with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow thrilled I am to have my leader\u2019s permission,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cI know Darcy will do the dance of joy.\u201d</p><p>He felt the teasing more than he should have. \u201cWhy were you telling me if not to get permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was having a conversation, Alex. You might remember them.\u201d</p><p>She thought he was too into the job. Not interesting enough. The assessment stung. He\u2019d had to work his ass off to get his present assignment. She, of all people, should appreciate that.</p><p>\u201cI know how to have a conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have one. Do you miss being married?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if the question surprised her, but it shocked the hell out of him. He\u2019d planned on saying something about the winery. Those other words had come from nowhere.</p><p>\u201cI miss Ben,\u201d she said quietly. Her green eyes seemed to darken with what? Memories? Pain?</p><p>\u201cA lot of people were surprised when you got married,\u201d he said. Mostly him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI met Ben and fell in love.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d claimed to love him but there\u2019d been no talk of marriage. No search for a happily ever after. Why? What had that Ben guy had that he, Alex, hadn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cIt screwed up your career,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean I didn\u2019t get ahead as quickly as I could have, that\u2019s true. On the other hand, I actually had a private life, and that was very important to me. Ben taught me life isn\u2019t an all-or-nothing sport. There are points of compromise, and sometimes that\u2019s even better than winning.\u201d</p><p>On what planet? Alex drank more wine and wished they were talking about anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhen I met Ben,\u201d she continued, \u201cI warned him I would work long hours and have to travel. He said he would rather have me around some of the time than not at all. It was a unique perspective.\u201d</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t know what to do with that information. \u201cSo, how did he die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLymphoma. He had it when we met, but he was in remission. Unfortunately, it came back and then he died.\u201d</p><p>Alex stared at her. \u201cYou knew he was dying when you married him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew the disease was likely to reoccur and that the odds of us growing old together were slim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d</p><p>Paige smiled. \u201cBecause I loved him. Because I would rather have had a short time with him than none at all.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance flared into something bigger and hotter. \u201cYou were willing to give up your career for some guy who was dying, but you broke up with me because your career was all-important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Ben taught me to compromise. Besides, you never wanted to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>One corner of her mouth turned up. \u201cYou never asked.\u201d</p><p>This was not how he\u2019d wanted the evening to go. He stood and put the glass back on her dresser. \u201cI won\u2019t bother you anymore,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anger gave energy to his stride as he walked to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, wait.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t. Instead he stepped into the hall and closed her door behind him.</p> <p>He stood there in the darkness, but she didn\u2019t come out. She didn\u2019t beg him to return. And then he didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d left in the first place, but it was too late to change that now.</p><p>Joe walked through the winery. Funny how this was the one place he could usually find to be alone. No Grandma Tessa trying to feed him or talk about his ex-wife. No Brenna wanting to talk about grapes or his ex-wife, or Mia wanting to talk about God knows what, including his ex-wife, with Ian offering a hundred different opinions. No Darcy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a specific complaint about her, except he was an idiot where she was concerned. He wasn\u2019t supposed to even like her. She should be a nonperson. Simply the subject to be kept safe. Nothing more. But she was real and alive, and for some reason he\u2019d yet to figure out, she got to him.</p><p>In an effort to distract himself, he walked into Lorenzo\u2019s office. The old man wasn\u2019t there\u2014a good thing because Joe wasn\u2019t interested in going another round on inheritance, his future, or changing his name from Larson to Marcelli.</p><p>He glanced at the old ledger books, the charts that detailed production, and the big map on the wall\u2014the one that showed all the Marcelli land, and most of Wild Sea next door. He moved closer and traced the line of the coast, then studied the elegant script that spelled out the family name.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t one of them, never had been, never would be. But no matter how many times he told them, they ignored him. It was as if they thought they could make him believe by their combined force of will. As if they could force him into what they saw as his destiny.</p><p>A familiar slow step caught his attention. He turned to the doorway and saw Lorenzo enter the room. The old man nodded at Joe, then made his way to his desk where he sat down heavily.</p><p>\u201cThere are too many women in this family,\u201d he announced as he rested his cane against the desk. \u201cThere always have been. God could have blessed me with five grandsons, but instead he saw fit to surround me with women.\u201d He leaned back in his chair and eyed Joe. \u201cYou had the right idea. Join the navy and leave the women behind.\u201d</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re letting women in the navy these days. Even on the ships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFools. It was better before. When a man could be alone with his thoughts. Now\u2014all the talking. If Tessa is awake her lips are moving, and not in prayer.\u201d</p><p>Joe held in his amusement. \u201cAt this point, she\u2019s not going to change.\u201d</p> <p>Lorenzo nodded. \u201cI know. She makes me tired. Of course you would know that. A man learns things when he takes a wife.\u201d</p><p>Joe groaned. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course me.\u201d The old man shook his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter. The marriage was long over before I knew about the Marcellis.\u201d</p><p>Before Joe could respond, Ian popped his head in the office. \u201cHey. There you are. I thought I\u2019d find you here. Hi. We\u2019re going to be heading out. Mia and I want to go down to San Diego for a few days before coming back here. Joe, you think you could get us on base? It would be really cool to see some of the ships and planes and stuff up close. I\u2019d really like to.\u201d</p><p>Ian stepped into the office and looked around. \u201cGreat place. Marcelli is the best. Everything is so interesting here. I really like the wine stuff. Mia doesn\u2019t know much, but we\u2019ve done tasting and watched the guys working. If I wasn\u2019t going into government work, I think I\u2019d want to work with wine. But here. Not in Napa or up there. I grew up here.\u201d He spotted the map on the wall. \u201cCool. I know this part of the coast. My grandfather took me fishing out here all the time.\u201d</p><p>Ian traced a spot on the map and grinned at Joe. \u201cThere are some caves here. A few are really deep. You can get a big boat in them. Some fill up with every tide, so you don\u2019t want to be there at the wrong time. It could be really bad. But I liked the caves. You probably know all about swimming in caves, from being a SEAL. Right? Maybe you two could go fishing. Or if you wait until Mia and I come back, I could go with you.\u201d</p><p>Ian actually paused for breath. Lorenzo looked shell-shocked while Joe took advantage of the lull. \u201cIs that Mia calling you?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, she doesn\u2019t know I came in here. I\u2019d better go find her. Thanks for everything. You guys have been great.\u201d He shook hands with Lorenzo, then turned to Joe. \u201cMia thinks you\u2019re terrific. She\u2019s always talking about you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Joe pulled his hand free. \u201cThanks. You\u2019d better go find her. You know how Mia gets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, right.\u201d</p><p>Ian disappeared. Joe crossed to the chair opposite Lorenzo\u2019s and sank down. \u201cNot my favorite guy.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo frowned. \u201cWhat does she see in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is she with him? I want Mia married and having babies, but not with that one.\u201d</p><p>Joe agreed. \u201cMia isn\u2019t interested in settling down right now. So she picks men who don\u2019t challenge her. She could never be with someone she didn\u2019t respect. That means she\u2019s protected\u2014she won\u2019t fall in love with someone like Ian.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo stared at him. \u201cYou have considered this.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of free time since I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been around the women too long. They are changing your brain. Come. We\u2019ll go taste from the barrels. You can tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo slowly rose to his feet. Leaning heavily on the cane, he led the way into the barrel room, where he motioned for one of the workers to come along. Small samples of wine were poured and glasses handed around.</p><p>Joe braced himself for a volley of criticism. There was no way he could survive a barrel tasting with his limited knowledge. Despite three years of visits to the Marcellis, he still preferred beer to wine.</p><p>\u201cYou taste what will be there in the future,\u201d Lorenzo said, swirling the liquid in his glass and studying it. \u201cThe hints of how the flower will blossom.\u201d He inhaled the smell of the wine. \u201cIt is still young. Like a child. But when it grows, what will it become?\u201d</p><p>Joe took a sip and grimaced. The flavor was too sharp, too thick, too much of everything. Before he could say anything, Lorenzo also tasted the wine.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d he said. \u201cThe blending has already begun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>The old man\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you taste?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>Joe shrugged and told the truth. \u201cReally bad wine.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo muttered something under his breath before saying, \u201cYou know nothing of us. Nothing of our wine. You should know. This should be who you are.\u201d</p><p>Joe was tired of the argument, tired of the criticism. \u201cWho\u2019s fault is that?\u201d he asked, allowing his temper to get the best of him. \u201cIf I remember correctly, you\u2019re the one who made sure I was sent away, so don\u2019t go blaming me for what I do and don\u2019t know. You\u2019re responsible, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago,\u201d Lorenzo snapped. \u201cYou know about us now. You should be here, married, having babies. You owe this family.\u201d</p><p>Joe set down his glass. \u201cI owe you nothing. After thirty years I find out about you. So what? I have a whole life that doesn\u2019t include you or the Marcellis. You get that? I made my own way in the world. You came looking for me when it was finally convenient. You keep pushing, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo narrowed his gaze. \u201cSo now you say you don\u2019t want your family. What kind of man thinks such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the navy is so wonderful? What happens when you get old, eh? They won\u2019t want you anymore. But here, we will always want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit,\u201d Joe yelled, matching Lorenzo\u2019s rising voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. You want some stud service to continue the family name because you have an outdated concept of a woman\u2019s place in the world. Brenna\u2019s doing this a whole lot better than I ever could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Joe turned and saw Darcy standing in the barrel room. She looked more amused than shocked by all the shouting.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She folded her arms over her chest and leaned against the wall. \u201cIf anyone was curious about the two of you being related, this moment would satisfy them. You even yell the same. Anyway, Mia and Ian are packed up and leaving. I thought the two of you might want to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo shook his head. \u201cThat girl,\u201d he said as he limped out of the room.</p><p>Darcy stayed where she was, watching Joe.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have pegged you for a screamer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you were matching him, decibel for decibel. It kinda kills my image of the cool, collected SEAL.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pisses me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Her mouth curved into a smile. \u201cWho would have thought Grandpa Lorenzo could take on the big, bad military guy and win.\u201d</p><p>He moved close and stared down at her. \u201cI know forty-seven ways to kill you with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d The smile widened. \u201cAnd I can bring you to your knees with a single sentence.\u201d</p><p>No way, he told himself, liking how she wasn\u2019t intimidated by him or the argument.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>She rested one hand on his chest, drew in a deep breath, and then sighed. \u201cJoe, I think we should talk about our feelings.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my stitches are even,\u201d Darcy said as she stared at the ten-inch square of fabric in her hands. \u201cAren\u2019t they supposed to be even?\u201d</p><p>Paige leaned over and studied Darcy\u2019s work, then glanced at her own. \u201cHey, you\u2019re doing better than me. At this rate, the most they\u2019ll let me do is collect leftover scraps and throw them in the trash.\u201d</p><p>Darcy tugged at the thread, but it wouldn\u2019t pull through all the way, which left a little bit sticking up that didn\u2019t exactly match the rest of the pattern.</p><p>\u201cThis is for a good cause,\u201d she muttered. \u201cTell me it is, because I\u2019m so not getting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re becoming better seamstresses so that when the next Marcelli bride gets her dress made we can help. Not that we\u2019ll be here, but it beats weeding the vineyards, right?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d make us do that.\u201d</p><p>So far the Marcellis hadn\u2019t asked her to do much of anything except show up for meals and be friendly. Grammy M had stopped by with the squares of fabric and had taught them a couple of basic quilting stitches, with the understanding that in time they would put their newfound skills to good use on a wedding gown.</p><p>While Darcy loved the idea of a family of women sewing each bride\u2019s dress, she had a feeling she wasn\u2019t going to be here long enough to see it happen. Although maybe they would invite her back when Mia got married.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Lauren?\u201d Paige asked, before she tugged too hard, broke her thread, and swore. \u201cI\u2019m not domestic. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Darcy said with a laugh. She tossed her square onto the coffee table in front of the sofa. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve talked to Lauren. I feel really guilty. I\u2019m here and she\u2019s stuck in some farmhouse in the Midwest. Lately she seems to know way too much about growing corn, which is a little scary. I don\u2019t think she has anything else to do with her day but watch it grow and ripen.\u201d</p><p>Paige grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope so.\u201d Darcy glanced at the agent. \u201cYou know, Mia\u2019s convinced there\u2019s something going on between you and Alex.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paige paused in the act of threading her needle. She blinked twice. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The innocence was too studied, too forced. \u201cIs there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent Vanmeter and I are working on your security team,\u201d Paige said primly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd sharing a house. By the way, Mia told the entire family and wants us to help get you together.\u201d</p><p>Paige sagged against the sofa. \u201cTell me you\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a little. Of course now everyone is distracted by the news Joe was married before, if that helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Darcy was stunned. \u201cThere is something going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s not. But...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cThere was. A lot of years ago. Alex and I met during our initial training and we developed a thing for each other. But when training was over, we both decided our careers were more important than any relationship and we went our separate ways.\u201d</p><p>Darcy hadn\u2019t had a clue. She supposed no one did, except Mia, and that was the point. \u201cAnd now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re protecting you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t think she believed that was the end of it. \u201cNothing else. No lingering sparks?\u201d</p><p>Paige smiled. \u201cSpark is too strong. There might be some heavy smoldering, but it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Alex is such a tight-ass?\u201d</p> <p>The smile turned into a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard not to. The guy practically invented the word. He needs to lighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>It was a philosophy Darcy could get behind. Except, over the past couple of days, she\u2019d found herself being less afraid. Less wary of every noise and person she met.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to pursue it?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue,\u201d Paige admitted. \u201cWhat about you? Lieutenant Commander Larson looks very hunky.\u201d</p><p>Darcy leaned forward and grabbed her fabric square. At the mention of Joe her insides got all tight and her face felt hot.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d she said quietly.</p> <p>Paige laughed. \u201cHoney, we all know he kissed you out in the vineyard. You were observed by an agent.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. No.\u201d</p><p>Great. One of the many joys of being related to the president. At least they didn\u2019t know about the kiss in the exercise room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cute and all,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t really have great luck with guys.\u201d The ones she\u2019d met wanted her either for her sister or for her family connections.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried he\u2019s only interested because you could help him with his career?\u201d Paige asked.</p><p>Darcy hadn\u2019t considered that. \u201cCould I?\u201d</p><p>Paige looked at her. \u201cHoney, with a couple of phone calls, you could practically get him his own ship. I doubt he\u2019d be interested. Not in any command he didn\u2019t earn. He shares that with Alex.\u201d</p><p>Darcy chuckled. \u201cAre you saying Joe\u2019s a tight-ass, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Darcy hadn\u2019t touched that particular body part, but she\u2019d leaned against a lot of him, and he was rock solid everywhere. A quality she\u2019d never considered in a man before but now found very desirable.</p><p>Colleen walked into the living room. She carried a tray heavy with sandwiches, cookies, and the inevitable bottle of Marcelli wine. This one was a cab-merlot blend.</p><p>\u201cNow what are you two girls talking about?\u201d Colleen asked as she set the tray on the coffee table and sat in the wing chair opposite the sofa.</p><p>Paige waved her scrap of fabric. \u201cThat I was never very good at the domestic arts. All this lack of success is making me feel inadequate. I\u2019m going to go clean my gun.\u201d</p><p>Darcy watched her go, then turned to Joe\u2019s mother. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not any better at this. My stitches aren\u2019t even.\u201d</p><p>Colleen opened the bottle of wine and poured them each a glass. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about it. At the rate we\u2019re going, one of my granddaughters will have grown up and gotten engaged before Mia ever considers settling down.\u201d She handed Darcy a glass, then relaxed in her chair. \u201cI love Mia so much, but too many days with her around exhausts me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sure full of energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things. I thought Lorenzo was going to have a heart attack when he realized Ian was sharing Mia\u2019s room. We\u2019d given him his own, of course, but young people today....\u201d Colleen stopped and frowned. \u201cMy God. Did I actually say that? \u2018Young people today\u2019?\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m turning into my mother, only without the charming accent.\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed.</p><p>Colleen looked at her and smiled. \u201cI suppose it was bound to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all getting older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to claim that for some time,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cOn the one hand Mia wears me out, on the other the house seems quiet without her. I\u2019m glad we have you here with us, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>The unexpected words surprised Darcy. She tried to be a good houseguest, but she knew she was a relative stranger here. \u201cYou\u2019ve all been very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. We\u2019re not altruistic enough to be noble. We like having you around,\u201d Colleen told her. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure being an honorary Marcelli is as exciting as the life you\u2019re used to. After all, you can go to the White House anytime you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded because it was expected, but in truth she didn\u2019t feel as if she could just drop in. Maybe to see Lauren, but not for any other reason. Certainly not to see her father. Appointments were required.</p><p>\u201cIt must be hard for the president,\u201d Colleen said as she set down her glass of wine. \u201cHe\u2019s been a widower for a long time, yet it can\u2019t be easy for him to date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. There\u2019s a lot of speculation about his love life, but he has always said he won\u2019t get involved with anyone until he\u2019s out of office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that makes sense. How would he know if the woman was interested in him or what he could offer? Still, he must be lonely.\u201d</p><p>Darcy reached for a small sandwich but didn\u2019t bite into it. She\u2019d never considered that her father also had to deal with hangers-on. Sure, in his regular life, but not romantically. Of course there would be women who would want to marry the president. A fair number probably wanted to just sleep with him, but she didn\u2019t want to think about that. Talk about an ick factor.</p><p>\u201cOf course he has his girls,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cChildren are a blessing. And you\u2019re both so close. You in town and Lauren right there in the private quarters.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI think you were smart to have your own place so you could keep your privacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is nice,\u201d Darcy said because she knew the truth was far less appealing. A part of her had been interested in living in the White House. She\u2019d imagined a room across from her sister and plenty of moments to enjoy the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But she\u2019d never been invited. When rooms had been assigned and living arrangements discussed, the assumption had been she would be staying in her D.C. apartment.</p><p>She\u2019d kept her hurt to herself. She hadn\u2019t wanted to upset Lauren or put her in the awkward position of having to petition their father on Darcy\u2019s behalf.</p><p>\u201cDo you go to many dinners and evenings there?\u201d Colleen asked.</p><p>\u201cSome. He hasn\u2019t really started entertaining much yet. I received invitations when he was vice president, but I was still in graduate school and had to refuse a lot of them.\u201d</p><p>Lauren had teased her about not wanting to come to anything but being unwilling to flat out say so. Lauren had said\u2014</p><p>Darcy picked up her wine and took a sip. Was that what had happened? Had she said no so many times that they\u2019d stopped asking? Did they think she wasn\u2019t interested?</p><p>No, she told herself. That wasn\u2019t possible. They had to know the truth. Didn\u2019t they?</p><p>The days stayed warm and sunny. Joe knew from his nighttime reading that warm sunny days were best right before harvest. That the heat and light brought out the sugar in the grapes. Or did it keep sugar from being in the grapes? Damn. He\u2019d just read about it the other night. Why couldn\u2019t he remember?</p><p>Because this wasn\u2019t his thing, he told himself. He wasn\u2019t interested in wine or Marcelli land or grapes.</p><p>He rounded the corner of the house and saw Darcy in the shade, leaning against the back of a large jacaranda tree. Her eyes were closed, and her book had fallen off her lap. Just behind her were two agents, playing cards.</p><p>Joe nodded at them, then approached her. He crouched down at the edge of the blanket and waited until she opened her eyes and saw him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she murmured, her voice low and her skin slightly flushed.</p><p>She wore a loose tank top and shorts, both black. Flipflops lay beside the blanket. Any makeup she\u2019d applied that morning had faded, leaving her lips bare and only a shade or two darker than her cheeks.</p><p>She was gorgeous. Sexy, soft, and a thousand other things he shouldn\u2019t think. If he did, the physical manifestation of his thoughts would inform everyone in visual range exactly what he had on his mind.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d He sat next to her. \u201cYou\u2019re still not sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go there, big guy. I\u2019m too drowsy to fight with you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a fight if you do what I say.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as she laughed. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s even the tiniest chance that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr on this planet,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m okay. And for your information, I\u2019m sleeping better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe fifteen percent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d Her hand lay beside his. He wanted to pick it up and touch it, maybe lace their fingers together. Which meant his brain had failed and he was in serious need of some combat time.</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to somebody,\u201d he told her. \u201cA professional. Even my SEAL teams need help now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Maybe. When this is over and I\u2019m back in D.C.\u201d</p><p>He thought about pushing back, but if she saw someone sooner it would mean one more body who knew her location. That crowd was already too big for comfort.</p><p>\u201cBrenna says the chardonnay grapes will be ready to harvest in a couple of weeks,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cI kind of want to be here to see that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around to make sure no one was listening, then lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading some of the books she left me. Harvest is a lot of work. There are\u2014\u201d He broke off at her smile. \u201cWhat?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cOooh, I could really blackmail you with the fact that you\u2019re studying up on wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d</p><p>The second the words were out, he wondered what he was talking about. Darcy should have been surprised, too, but instead of calling him on it, she changed the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never spent any time in this part of the country, and I have to say I\u2019m sorry about that. I really love it here. I could get used to this kind of life.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cI mean that at face value, so don\u2019t get all weird on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rarely get weird on anyone. I can see how it could be appealing.\u201d</p><p>She stretched out her legs, then drew a knee to her chest. \u201cReally? So why are you so determined to get away from here as fast as you can?\u201d</p><p>A legitimate question. \u201cI love what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cI make a difference every day. I trust my guys with my life, and they do the same with me.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes settled on his face. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t trust the Marcellis?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate, because they are just as willing to give up their lives for you. They love you, Joe. More than you know and certainly more than you deserve. I wish you could see that.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not sure what to say.</p> <p>\u201cThe good news is they\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou are so stuck with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve figured that out already. Brenna and Mia are easy, but I don\u2019t know what to do with the rest of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting Grandma Tessa feed you. That\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to her. My next goal is for you to start calling people by their actual names.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou avoid mentioning anyone by name. Probably because you don\u2019t want to call Colleen and Marco Mom and Dad, which makes sense, but what about the Grands. Even I\u2019m calling them Grammy M and Grandma Tessa. It\u2019s who they are. The fact that they\u2019re related to you is beside the point.\u201d</p><p>He made a noise low in his throat. She laughed.</p><p>\u201cAre you growling at me?\u201d she asked, sounding more delighted than annoyed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a man growl at me before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were probably all too scared of your Secret Service agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take every one of them.\u201d</p><p>Darcy stood by the window in her room, but instead of the view, she saw questions. So many opportunities had seemed to slip through her fingers. Times when she could have said something, only to hesitate out of fear or concern or need. What had she missed because of that hesitation? What had been lost?</p><p>She crossed to the secure phone on the nightstand in the corner and dialed Lauren\u2019s number. Her sister answered in two rings.</p><p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s me,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cHi, you. How\u2019s it going? Are you basking in your sunny days and sultry nights?\u201d</p><p>Darcy smiled. \u201cThere\u2019s not much sultry here. Humidity is required for that.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren sighed. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty here. Near record levels. The corn is growing, though. Growing and moving closer to the house. I\u2019m beginning to feel like a character in a Stephen King novel. Soon I\u2019ll be slipping into insanity.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sat on the edge of the bed and battled guilt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck wherever you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too, but I\u2019ll survive. The Secret Service guys are nice, and I\u2019m teaching myself to cook. Nothing up to White House standards, of course, but I never really bothered before. Even when I was married...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>Darcy knew her sister enough to know she was about to get lost in the past. Given that Lauren was trapped in the middle of nowhere and on her own, she didn\u2019t think that was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cYou should plan your welcome-home party,\u201d Darcy said quickly. \u201cStart working on the guest list. You can put me on top.\u201d</p><p>Lauren laughed. \u201cHardly. You don\u2019t like all those fancy events, but I appreciate you making the effort for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d Darcy asked lightly. \u201cThat I don\u2019t like the White House social scene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t. When Dad was vice president, he made sure you got invitations to everything, but you never came. I know grad school kept you really busy, but we both figured you were too polite to actually say you hated that kind of stuff.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Yes, she had been busy with school, but she\u2019d also been confused and feeling unwelcome.</p><p>\u201cI thought the kindest thing was to not ask you anymore,\u201d Lauren added. \u201cWas I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d Darcy flopped back on the bed. \u201cMaybe. I mean I know I kept refusing invitations, but I didn\u2019t want to be cut off from you two.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sucked in a breath. \u201cIs that how you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Darcy. I\u2019m sorry. You know we don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it. Dad loves you. He talks about you and asks about you, which he wouldn\u2019t have to do if you called him and came by sometimes. He\u2019s busy, but he\u2019s still your father and he cares about you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wanted to believe that, even though it wasn\u2019t true. After her mother had died, she\u2019d been so lost. Finding out the truth about her biological father the same day that her mother died had nearly destroyed her. Worse, the man who was her biological father was already dead, so she\u2019d lost him before she ever found him. She\u2019d been emotionally battered and unable to feel anything for months. Ryan Jensen had reached out to her time and again, only to have her walk away from him. Just about the time she\u2019d been ready to reach back, he\u2019d stopped trying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d Lauren told her. \u201cHe wants you in his life.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wasn\u2019t so sure, but maybe she should find out before making any more decisions.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d her sister said. \u201cChange of subject. I\u2019m so bored here. Tell me something exciting that\u2019s happening in your life.\u201d</p><p>Darcy opened her mouth to say there wasn\u2019t anything exciting, but what came out instead was, \u201cI\u2019ve met someone.\u201d</p><p>Lauren squealed. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. That\u2019s so great. The petty, bitter side of me is complaining that you get to meet a guy while I\u2019m stuck in a cornfield, but I will squash those evil thoughts and focus only on you. Who is he? What\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...\u201d Darcy curled up on the bed and grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous. A naval officer and a former SEAL. I know nothing will come of it, but still, I really like him.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cSounds fabulous. Okay start at the beginning and talk slowly. I want to know every detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re reading the books,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cLearning about the wine. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Joe held in a groan. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I said anything about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that,\u201d Brenna said cheerfully, \u201cbut you did, and now I get to grill you on them. It\u2019s time to give in. Let the wine have its way with you.\u201d</p><p>They were in the storeroom in the winery. Brenna had gotten even bigger, which didn\u2019t seem possible. How far could one body stretch before splitting open?</p><p>As uncomfortable as it made him to look at her bulging stomach, his situation was made worse by the fact that he couldn\u2019t just walk away. Not from a very pregnant woman who looked as if she could go into labor at any time. No matter how much she bugged him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the wine,\u201d he said, facing her and folding his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019ve told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only listen to about half of what you say. It\u2019s not personal\u2014I deal with all men that way.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYou can\u2019t escape us. This is your destiny, Joe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime.\u201d</p><p>The humor fled her eyes as she grabbed his arm. \u201cI\u2019m serious here. I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m going to have a baby. That\u2019s bound to cut into my time. Four Sisters is growing. Grandpa Lorenzo won\u2019t live forever. I need some help.\u201d</p><p>The walls instantly began moving in on him. He pulled away from her and moved toward the door. \u201cMarco can take over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Stop right there. No one is taking over from me. I said help. Like a partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said\u2014Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, big brother. You\u2019re the one. You\u2019re the heir. Not just because you\u2019re male, although that\u2019s a big part of it, but also because you have the determination to make things happen. You have a lot to learn before you\u2019ll be of any help to me. So you need to start now. You have responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to hit something or throw something. The barrels were too large and the desk behind him had been screwed down. He thought about tearing the intercom out of the wall, but what would that accomplish?</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he said, speaking slowly. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me want this. I\u2019m not interested in you, in them, in the winery. In any of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this why your marriage failed?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t let anyone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d She rubbed her stomach. \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving you, Joe. No matter how long you\u2019re gone or how much you push us away. It\u2019s been three years. What will it take for us to finally earn your trust?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, Brenna shook her head and walked out without saying a word. Seconds later Darcy appeared. Her knowing expression only made the need to destroy something even stronger.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t listening in,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were yelling pretty loud until the end there. I\u2019m guessing the whole back forty knows what you two were fighting about. Don\u2019t you ever get tired of having the same argument over and over again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They need to give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you need to give in.\u201d</p><p>He threw up his hands. \u201cPerfect. You want to run my life, do you? It\u2019s your fault it\u2019s screwed up in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because the sole purpose of the kidnapping was to mess up your career plans. I\u2019m trying to help you here, you jackass. But you\u2019re too stubborn to see the truth. You keep pushing them away, and they keep coming back.\u201d</p><p>She moved closer. \u201cYou say the navy is your family, your life. But what do they care about you? You\u2019re a rank and a number. Someone capable of doing a good job. There are a dozen guys who could take your place. Even now someone else is doing your job, and that\u2019s what\u2019s killing you. But this is different. This is your family. They love you. It\u2019s specific and personal and you\u2019re blowing it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to hear any of this. \u201cDon\u2019t call me a jackass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You\u2019re acting like one. You\u2019re such a typical male, wanting to be defined by what you do. But you\u2019re more than that.\u201d</p><p>He moved close and considered shaking her. \u201cYou\u2019re the most annoying woman I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but I\u2019m trying to help you. You should be grateful and offer me a small but tasteful gift. Flowers or chocolate.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and pulled her close. But instead of shaking her, he lowered his head and kissed her.</p><p>She let herself sink into him as she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThat works, too,\u201d she whispered before kissing him back.</p><p>12</p><p>M an, oh man, did Joe know how to kiss. Darcy closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the sensation of his warm mouth on hers. Despite the fact that they\u2019d kissed before, he didn\u2019t attack or assume. Instead he coaxed her into responding. Gentle brushes of flesh against flesh had her wishing for more before he even offered.</p><p>He let her get used to the feel of his hard body, his arms around her. He let her inhale the scent of him and melt in his heat. Only then did he lightly nip her lower lip.</p><p>He followed the shape of her mouth, tracing the line slowly, so slowly that she finally grabbed him by the back of his head and pulled him close.</p><p>Even as he swept inside her mouth, he chuckled. She felt the rumble low in his chest and smiled in return. They were good together, she thought hazily, right before the passion exploded.</p><p>The need came without warning. One second she\u2019d been enjoying his kiss, the next she was desperate. Hunger claimed her. Large, powerful, and nearly out of control, it made her cling, reach, seek. She wanted him touching her everywhere, she wanted him naked and ready. Right here, right now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJoe,\u201d she breathed, not sure what to say.</p><p>He raised his head slightly, and she saw the fire in his eyes. They stared at each other for two heartbeats, then fell together in a frenzy of wanting that left them both breathless.</p><p>He kissed her again, but this time he wasn\u2019t kidding. He claimed her, stroking the inside of her mouth with a fervency that made her shake.</p> <p>She closed her lips and sucked on his tongue. He groaned, then lowered his hands to her hips, where he pulled her against him. She went willingly, wanting to know he was aroused. Her belly brushed against his erection and her insides clenched.</p><p>She clung to him, even as she tried to pull at his T-shirt. Bare skin, she thought frantically. She needed bare skin.</p><p>He pulled back enough to press his mouth to her cheek, then her jaw. He moved down the side of her neck until he reached her collarbone. The warm, damp trail of kisses made her tremble. At the same time he reached for the front of her sleeveless blouse and began to work the buttons.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, giving up on his T-shirt and helping him get her undressed.</p><p>Even as they fumbled with tiny buttons and impossible fastenings, they kissed, noses bumping, lips missing. In the heat of the moment, perfection didn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>When her blouse was finally open, he reached for the front clasp of her black bra and opened it one-handed. She had a half second to be impressed with his technique before he bent down and claimed her left breast with his mouth.</p><p>The combination of hot, wet kisses, a sucking pressure, and her own building need nearly made her scream. She grabbed his head to hold him in place.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she breathed. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Ribbons of pleasure wove their way through her, circling around her breasts before heading to that growing ache between her legs. She felt herself swell and dampen. She wanted him inside her now. Right this second. She couldn\u2019t wait\u2014</p><p>He moved to her other breast and flicked his tongue against the tight nipple. She gasped her pleasure. He did it again, then straightened. Before she could protest, he replaced his mouth with his very skilled fingers and kissed her.</p><p>Oh, yeah, she thought as she circled his tongue with hers and sank into the pleasure. This was good. Better than good. It was amazing.</p> <p>He dropped his hands to the waistband of her shorts and unfastened them. Somewhere along the way, she\u2019d already kicked off her sandals.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he breathed into her ear. His breath was hot and tickled in the most erotic way possible. \u201cI want you, Darcy. Hot, wet, and screaming when I make you come.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. No one had ever talked to her during sex before. She\u2019d always found the event to be silent and fairly unsatisfying. It looked as if all that was about to change.</p><p>A shiver of anticipation rippled through her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise to scream,\u201d she whispered as he pushed down her shorts and panties.</p><p>He pulled back a little and stared at her. His eyes were the color of stormy midnight, his expression predatory. He was a man who wanted a woman and meant to have her. Thrill joined anticipation.</p><p>\u201cCan you promise to come?\u201d he asked as he slipped his hand between her thighs.</p><p>Someone had given him a schematic, she thought happily as he went directly to her very favorite spot and began to tease it. Electricity shot through her, making her want to get to the finish right away as much as she wanted to make it last forever. He circled and rubbed and then slid his fingers inside of her while his thumb kept up the intimate dance.</p> <p>\u201cDarcy?\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you come?\u201d</p><p>The first flicker of promise tightened her muscles. \u201cAs long as you keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a slow, sexy smile designed to bring her to her knees. But before she could stumble, he grabbed her by the waist and lifted her onto the desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go you one better,\u201d he said and slipped between her thighs.</p><p>Even as his arousal filled her, stretching her and touching nerve endings starved for a little attention, he returned his fingers to her most sensitive spot. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, he leaned in and kissed her. Talk about multitasking, she thought, as her brain began to shut down in a delicious overload of sensation.</p><p>There was heat everywhere. Heat and hunger and the promise of perfect release. Muscles tensed in anticipation. Her body ached. She parted her legs more, then wrapped them around his hips to bring him in closer still.</p><p>In and out, in and out. The friction against her slick, swollen center was exactly right. She could feel his tension and knew he was close, but he held back, waiting on her.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she breathed against his mouth. \u201cJoe.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, willing her to come for him. Willing her to scream.</p><p>Brenna hauled herself up the back stairs and waddled into the kitchen. She wanted to stalk, but it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Until she gave birth to the planet-size baby she carried, her stalking days were behind her. Along with her dancing days, her running days, and her sleeping days.</p><p>\u201cI hate gestating,\u201d she said as she leaned against the counter.</p><p>Grandma Tessa smiled in sympathy. \u201cThe babies make it worth it.\u201d</p><p>Brenna glared at her. \u201cThere are no babies. Just so we\u2019re clear. There\u2019s the one baby. Singular.\u201d</p><p>Her mother crossed to her and touched her forehead. \u201cAre you feeling all right? You\u2019re flushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m crabby. It\u2019s Joe. He\u2019s being stubborn and pigheaded. I know they\u2019re the same, but it\u2019s annoying. He\u2019s annoying. I hate him.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOkay, not really.\u201d</p><p>Her mother offered her a glass of water and she took a sip. Because she needed more pressure on her bladder these days.</p><p>\u201cWe were talking in the storeroom. Arguing. He won\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s stubborn,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>Brenna looked at her mother. \u201cHe told Darcy his wife left because of the time he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Colleen and Grandma Tessa shared a glance. The older woman reached for her rosary.</p><p>\u201cIt could be true,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cHe believes it. I saw it in his eyes when he told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cShe left because he wouldn\u2019t let her in. He wouldn\u2019t love her.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa shook her head. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that\u2019s the way he is? What if he can\u2019t change.\u201d Her eyes burned with tears. Damn hormones. \u201cI love him. We all do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to keep loving him,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wish...\u201d Brenna reached for the intercom. She wanted to tell him to get in here so she could sock him in the stomach, then hug him. Schizophrenic love at its best.</p><p>She pushed the intercom and heard a curious sound.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t conversation. Not exactly. It was...breathing. Hot, heavy breathing.</p><p>She released the intercom and jumped back.</p><p>Colleen frowned as Grandma Tessa reached for her beads.</p><p>\u201cDear Lord,\u201d her grandmother said. \u201cWhat was it? Some giant beast in the storeroom?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t sound like an animal to Brenna. \u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she said. \u201cI left Joe in there and passed Darcy on the way....\u201d Understanding dawned. But as soon as the thought formed, she pushed it away.</p><p>No. It wasn\u2019t possible. Her stiff-necked brother would never loosen up enough to\u2014</p><p>She pushed the intercom again and heard Lieutenant Commander Joseph Larson say something very dirty.</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Brenna shrieked.</p><p>She backed away from the intercom. She looked from her stunned mother to her equally shocked grandmother and began to laugh.</p><p>Colleen grinned. \u201cGuess Joe found himself a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the storeroom?\u201d Tessa asked, sounding outraged. \u201cIt\u2019s immoral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI always hoped he\u2019d find someone, but the president\u2019s daughter? What on earth is he thinking?\u201d</p><p>Darcy braced herself on the table and bucked against Joe. So close. So close. He rubbed her center, moving faster and faster until she had no choice but to fly into her release.</p><p>She wanted to warn him, to say something, but she couldn\u2019t speak. Her muscles convulsed as she came over and over again. Pleasure poured through her, a river of release. It was good. It was better than good\u2014it was damn close to perfect.</p><p>Joe straightened and looked at Darcy. Her eyes were wide, and she was still breathing hard. He tucked her hair behind her ears then leaned in and kissed the tip of her nose.</p><p>\u201cNot bad for somebody famous,\u201d he said.</p><p>As he\u2019d expected, she grinned, then swatted his arm.</p><p>\u201cNot bad for some macho, paramilitary type,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018para\u2019 about it. I am military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, like that\u2019s going to impress me.\u201d</p><p>He touched her chin so she had to meet his gaze. \u201cYou screamed.\u201d</p><p>Color rose on her cheeks. \u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>She was right. She hadn\u2019t screamed. But she\u2019d grabbed on to him as if she never wanted to let go, and she\u2019d taken him on the ride of his life.</p><p>Reluctantly he stepped back and reached for his jeans.</p><p>\u201cAh, the postcoital cleanup,\u201d she said as she lowered herself to the floor, then reached for her panties and shorts.</p><p>He supposed he should feel awkward about what they\u2019d just done. It hadn\u2019t been planned, and he didn\u2019t usually give in to impulses like that. If anyone found out...</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that, even though he was going to have to\u2014eventually. But right now there were other issues.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking serious.\u201d She finished fastening her bra, then started with the buttons on her blouse. \u201cRegrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled her close and lightly kissed her. She held on tight. \u201cQuestions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou on any birth control?\u201d</p><p>He watched her closely, knowing he would be able to guess by her expression. Instead of panic, he saw something very close to smug victory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the Pill. Aren\u2019t you lucky,\u201d she said, leaning against him.</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d He stroked her short hair. \u201cI usually take precautions. You messed with my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle ol\u2019 me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else here.\u201d He felt her tremble. \u201cDarcy? You okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded but wouldn\u2019t look at him. He touched his finger to her chin and raised her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She looked defiant, shy, and embarrassed. An amazing trick.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being sophisticated and worldly,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t mess that up.\u201d</p><p>And then he got it. He lashed out when he felt threatened; she used humor. He thought about her life\u2014the public scrutiny, the Secret Service agents.</p><p>\u201cHard to date when you\u2019re the president\u2019s daughter?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cThe guys in D.C. are idiots. And not just the ones in office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>She raised herself on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cI know.\u201d A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve just had sex with the youngest daughter of your commander in chief. I think you need to propose now. It\u2019s really the least you can do.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to pull her close again, but he respected her need to stay strong.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you get nervous if I did?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost worth it to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost isn\u2019t the same.\u201d She stepped back and smoothed down the front of her blouse. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy.\u201d</p><p>She dismissed him with a flick of her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that. Do I look normal? I don\u2019t want anyone guessing what just happened. We have your family to think of, and my security team. Trust me, none of them need to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>He studied her, taking in the swell of her breasts a whole lot more than the straightness of her clothes, then motioned for her to turn around.</p><p>When she\u2019d completed a full circle, she held her arms out at her sides and said, \u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. He moved in and claimed her in a hot, deep kiss that soon had his body ready for round two.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cGood idea. Bad timing, but a great idea. We got lucky once. Do you realize the odds of someone walking in on us?\u201d</p><p>Amazing how he almost didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go first,\u201d she said as she pushed away and started for the door. \u201cWait a few seconds before following.\u201d Her gaze dropped to his crotch, where he knew she could see he was hard again. \u201cOr longer.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt like the beautiful young princess in a classic fairy tale. It was only a matter of time until the birds broke into song and the little woodland creatures gathered supplies to make her a fabulous ball gown.</p> <p>It was the sex. Parts of her body ached from the physical activities, but it was the kind of ache that made her smile and want to do it again. For that she could thank Joe.</p><p>He\u2019d been great. Not just with the mechanics, although he could certainly earn a merit badge in technique and stamina, but with how he\u2019d acted.</p><p>He\u2019d made her feel comfortable, both during and after. He\u2019d joked and he\u2019d held her, and best of all, he\u2019d wanted her again. Guys might be able to fake a lot of things, but not an erection that size!</p><p>Life was good, she thought as she headed toward the main building of the winery. Who knew getting kidnapped would turn out to be so beneficial for her personal life?</p><p>Still smiling, Darcy entered the main building of the winery. She felt more than saw the Secret Service agents behind her, but she ignored them. Today nothing could get in the way of her good mood.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said as she started down the hallway. He stood at the entrance to his office. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you, Darcy. Come in.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded so stern and disapproving, she instantly felt guilty. It was all she could do to keep from rushing to his side, grabbing his arm, and promising she would always keep her room clean. Instead she followed him into his office and took the chair he pointed at.</p><p>He stared at her for a long time. Darcy stared back, noting the gray in his hair and how tired he looked. Then she ran through a list of possible infractions but couldn\u2019t come up with a single one.</p><p>\u201cSo, you like the winery,\u201d he said.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had a clue as to what he wanted to talk about, but her liking the winery hadn\u2019t been on the short list.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course. It\u2019s beautiful here, and the process of making wine fascinates me. I know I\u2019m an imposition to your family, but I can\u2019t help hoping I\u2019m here through part of the harvest. I\u2019d like to see the picking and the pressing.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo smiled. \u201cYou have the love in your veins. It\u2019s like that for some. You don\u2019t always have to be born into it. You\u2019re young, there\u2019s still time. You could study and be a part of all this.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so sure about that. She had a feeling that as nice as the Marcelli family had been to her, they wouldn\u2019t be all that sorry to get their lives back. No one enjoyed having Secret Service agents running around on their property.</p><p>\u201cTessa cleaned your room the other day and found this.\u201d</p> <p>He set something on his desk. It took Darcy a second to realize it was her portfolio. Lorenzo withdrew several large sheets from her sketch pad.</p><p>At least they were only drawings, she thought, surprised that Tessa had gone through her stuff and embarrassed that something so private had been viewed by others. Note to self\u2014don\u2019t start a diary while in the Marcelli home.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, preparing herself to take Lorenzo and his wife on about violating her privacy, when he said, \u201cI like these. This one the most.\u201d</p><p>He tapped one of the designs, then turned it toward her. \u201cYou can make me more like this?\u201d</p><p>She stared at the page of wine labels she\u2019d been toying with. There were several incarnations, using the Marcelli name as the centerpiece in some and the house in the others. Lorenzo pointed to the one with the house.</p><p>\u201cI like this one. I like the different colors. You\u2019ve done pale for chardonnay, and darker for merlot. So the labels are all the same, but different, yes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYou like these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery much. The work Brenna brings me.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAmateurs. Yes, they draw, they design, but they don\u2019t feel the wine in their blood. They don\u2019t know the land, the work, the grapes. You, Darcy, you feel it in here.\u201d He pounded his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll use these for the new Marcelli labels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the wine. Brenna will like them, too. She\u2019s a smart girl. She\u2019ll know how you have to draw them so we can turn them into labels. Stand up to her on the price. She\u2019ll try to talk you down, but this time, I think, we pay more, eh?\u201d</p><p>He wanted her labels? On Marcelli wine bottles? \u201cOn all of them?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>\u201cYes. For all. You will be a part of us, then.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sprang from her seat and raced around the desk. She threw herself at Lorenzo, who gathered her close and hugged her. He was thin and frail under his loose clothes, but he still squeezed her until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>It felt good, she thought happily. It felt great.</p><p>When he released her, she grinned. \u201cThis is my first real design job. I\u2019ve been trying to find work, but it\u2019s hard. No advertising agency wants to hire me. What client is going to be comfortable complaining about a design by the president\u2019s daughter? So I went back to college to get my master\u2019s degree. I thought that would help, but it hasn\u2019t yet. Until now.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo squeezed her hand. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about your education, child. It\u2019s about what you feel in your heart. That\u2019s what\u2019s important. Never forget that.\u201d</p><p>Joe finished his afternoon briefing with the security team and headed back for the house. Marco joined him a few feet from the back door and asked him to wait.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d Marco told him.</p><p>Until that moment, Joe had been having a good day. Making love with Darcy might not have been the smartest thing he\u2019d ever done, but it had been one of the best. He\u2019d enjoyed every second of her company. And he hadn\u2019t wanted to go\u2014an unusual situation for a man who generally preferred to be alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Marco shook his head. \u201cNext time you might want to make sure the intercom is off.\u201d</p><p>Joe felt sucker punched. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody knows.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>D arcy sat propped up on her bed, several sketches scattered around her. She had a meeting in the morning with Grandpa Lorenzo and Brenna to finalize their choices for the wine labels, and she wanted to be able to offer them a variety of options.</p><p>Excitement made it difficult to concentrate on the designs. She wanted to dance around the room and scream her delight. Brenna had called earlier to say she was thrilled to finally have new label designs. Which meant Darcy had her first ever paying job.</p><p>Okay\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to be able to make a career out of this one client, but at least she finally felt legitimate in her chosen profession.</p><p>As she worked, or tried to work, she hummed. She felt good all over. She loved this place, and she loved the Marcellis. Would they be willing to adopt her?</p><p>She grinned at the thought. Probably not a good idea, what with her and Joe having had sex. Not that they knew, but if she was adopted it would create, as Mia had said, a pretty serious ick factor.</p><p>Someone knocked on her closed bedroom door. Grandma Tessa to do a little more reconnaissance? \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Joe stepped into her room and closed the door behind him. Darcy instantly straightened. Her stomach tightened, her thighs heated, and she desperately wanted to pat the bed in invitation.</p><p>He was so gorgeous, she thought as she took in his tall, muscular build and the faint smile. Good enough to be both main course and dessert.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is you\u2019re thinking. I can\u2019t help wanting you, and you\u2019re not making it any easier to say no.\u201d</p><p>He wanted her! Her emotions did a little soft-shoe. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have to say no.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was so good.\u201d Perfect even.</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cDarcy, I\u2019m not kidding. There\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>She refused to let go of her good mood. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get weird on me, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way you think. They know.\u201d</p><p>The last two words didn\u2019t quite make it to her brain. \u201cThey know.\u201d Huh. Who knew what? Who could possibly know....</p><p>She collapsed onto her pillows. \u201cOh God. Your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be them.\u201d</p><p>Panic filled her. \u201cNo. They can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t say anything. I didn\u2019t even hint.\u201d She stared at him. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t say anything. You wouldn\u2019t even under threat of torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even with actual torture.\u201d He crossed to the bed and sat down next to her. \u201cWe were in the storage room,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI actually know that. Did someone see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they heard. There\u2019s an intercom system.\u201d</p><p>She felt herself blush. \u201cWho was it?\u201d she asked, not sure who would be worse.</p><p>\u201cBrenna, Grandma Tessa, and my mother.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, then closed it. What exactly was she supposed to say?</p><p>Brenna she could handle, but.... \u201cYour mother and Grandma Tessa?\u201d The blush turned fiery.</p><p>\u201cThey spread the news to the rest of the family. Marco pulled me aside about an hour ago and tried to have the sex talk with me. It was humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d She covered her face with her hands. \u201cThey know. I can\u2019t believe it. I always thought the ongoing humiliation of my life was because I\u2019m in the public eye, but I guess not. Maybe it\u2019s just me.\u201d</p><p>Joe reached for her hands and pulled them away. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one\u2019s going to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to my face, but they\u2019ll be talking about it. They know.\u201d She wanted to crawl under the bed and never come out. Then she thought of something. \u201cDid they tell Paige or Alex? Alex really wouldn\u2019t like us doing that, and he might try to get you in trouble. You have your career to think about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But the Marcellis are good at closing ranks. No one on the Secret Service team knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf Alex had a clue, he\u2019d rip me a new one. Trust me.\u201d He leaned close and gently kissed her. \u201cWant to take it back?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to think about that. \u201cNot even for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other before Joe straightened and said he should get out of her room before there were even more rumors. Darcy nodded but couldn\u2019t speak. She couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at him. Because in that short period of time, somewhere between the light kiss and his walking out of her room, she felt a definite sort of tugging in the vicinity of her heart.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what it meant, but she knew it couldn\u2019t be good. Not when her stay here was temporary, her track record with men was worse than dismal, and Joe was the kind of guy who didn\u2019t do relationships.</p><p>Paige hung up the phone and finished writing her notes. When Alex walked into the kitchen, she pushed the paper toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve arrested two of the kidnappers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have leads on the rest of them. I\u2019m going to tell Darcy when I see her. She\u2019ll be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Alex looked over the paper. \u201cAt least if the rest of them are on the run, they won\u2019t have time to plan another kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat should make our job easier,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need my job easier.\u201d</p><p>Of course not, she thought. But he did need a sense of humor.</p><p>He walked to the refrigerator, opened it, and stared inside. Then he closed it and turned to her. \u201cWould you have married me?\u201d</p><p>Paige stared at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d asked. Before. Would you have married me?\u201d</p> <p>She had no idea what he was thinking or why he\u2019d brought this up now. It didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cAlex, I don\u2019t understand why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes or no,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me.\u201d Nothing about this was simple.</p><p>Would she have married him? She stared at his eyes. There\u2019d been a time when she\u2019d wanted to get lost in those eyes. When being with him had been so important.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said after a while. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you would have asked. And if you had and I\u2019d said yes, then one of us would have had to leave the Secret Service. You would have expected me to be the one to leave.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. How typical of him. \u201cThen no,\u201d she said gently. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have married you.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cWhy? Because I wasn\u2019t willing to give up my career for you? This is what I\u2019ve always wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about what I wanted? You\u2019d have asked me to give up the one thing you wouldn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t seem fair or a very healthy way to start a marriage. One criterion of a successful relationship is love makes each party stronger, giving them more of what they want. Love isn\u2019t supposed to take your dreams away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no way for us to win.\u201d</p><p>She considered the statement. \u201cI guess not. Some relationships are like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t accept that.\u201d</p><p>What was it about stubborn men? \u201cYou not accepting it doesn\u2019t change the truth.\u201d</p> <p>He stared at her for another couple of seconds, then turned and walked out of the room.</p><p>Paige had no idea what all that had been about. She respected Alex a lot. She thought he was totally hot, and his being in the next room made some nights long and difficult. But there were times when his mind was a complete mystery to her.</p><p>She gathered her paperwork, but before she could stand up, he stalked back into the room, walked over to the table, bent down, and kissed her.</p><p>He cupped her face in his large hands and pressed his mouth to hers. The action was so unexpected, she didn\u2019t know what to think, and then she couldn\u2019t think because her brain had shut down in order to let her feel everything.</p><p>He held her gently. His lips rediscovered hers in a soft caress that took her breath away. She parted before he even asked, wanting him to claim her the way men had been claiming women since the beginning of time.</p><p>He swept into her mouth and circled her tongue with his. Then as quickly as it had begun, the kiss was over. He straightened, then walked away without saying a single word.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix you a nice cuppa,\u201d Grammy M said to Joe as he walked into the kitchen the next morning.</p><p>He squinted at the time and saw it was barely after six. \u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to start my day with the sun,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>Tessa walked into the kitchen and scowled. \u201cIt\u2019s all that sinning. It keeps you from sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M glared at her. \u201cYou\u2019re very concerned about the state of my soul. All this talk of sinning. Could it be because your own man isn\u2019t making you happy in the bedroom?\u201d</p><p>Joe winced and headed for the door. No way did he want to get in the middle of this.</p><p>Tessa might be elderly, but she was fast, spry, and she had that killer grip. She got him by the arm and steered him to the table.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d she ordered, and he sat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make that tea,\u201d Grammy M said, smiling at him.</p><p>Tessa narrowed her gaze. \u201cJoseph doesn\u2019t drink tea. He\u2019s a man. He drinks coffee.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M turned to him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d be wantin\u2019 tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...\u201d</p><p>Tessa speared him with a look that could stop a tank. \u201cJoseph, you always have coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, ah...\u201d</p><p>They ignored him as they both raced to the stove. Joe figured he was about to get both and he\u2019d better drink them equally. Maybe they could just pour them into a big mug and he could choke them down together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fix you an omelet,\u201d Tessa announced.</p><p>\u201cI have fresh scones to go with that,\u201d Grammy M said.</p><p>\u201cFruit,\u201d Tessa added.</p><p>Grammy M sniffed. \u201cAnd some bacon. Maybe sausage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be using the stove,\u201d Tessa told her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. And you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 all of the burners for your omelet. Last time I made one, I only needed the one pan. But you were never very good in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Joe yelled. \u201cI beg you. It\u2019s too early for this.\u201d</p><p>The Grands stared at him, at each other, then turned their backs and went to work.</p><p>Coffee arrived first. Joe sipped it until Grammy M plopped a cup of tea in front of him. Then he alternated. The women worked in silence, carefully stepping around each other, not getting too close.</p><p>He looked away as he remembered how it had been his first couple of visits. Before Grammy M had moved in with Gabriel and the old ladies had had a falling-out. He remembered their elegant dance in the kitchen, a rhythm honed from years of practice and working together. He\u2019d never heard a harsh word exchanged.</p><p>\u201cWill you be seein\u2019 Darcy later today?\u201d Grammy M asked.</p><p>Joe held in a groan. So the news had been passed on to her, had it? No doubt Colleen had told her. Which meant Mia and the other sisters knew, too.</p><p>\u201cShe lives here,\u201d he said. \u201cHard to avoid her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you want to,\u201d Tessa said with a wink. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my type.\u201d</p><p>Tessa smacked him on the back of the head. \u201cYou say that now?\u201d</p><p>Okay, poor strategy, he thought as he rubbed where she\u2019d nailed him. \u201cI mean she\u2019s not...\u201d He closed his mouth and reached for the coffee. It would be better to endure whatever they had in mind, then make his escape.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s past time you were married,\u201d Grammy M said as she put bacon into a pan. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reached for the tea.</p><p>\u201cA man shouldn\u2019t be alone,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good. What will happen when you\u2019re old, eh? You\u2019ll be living above the garage with a dog. What kind of life is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that my only option?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat will become of you?\u201d Grammy M wanted to know.</p><p>The only bright spot in this conversation was that they were finally on the same side of an argument.</p><p>\u201cYou need love in your life,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cYou need to love a woman and let her love you.\u201d</p><p>After getting smacked for saying Darcy wasn\u2019t his type, he didn\u2019t want to think about what would happen if he said he didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>Grammy M put a plate of scones in front of him. Tessa slid an omelet onto a plate and set it on the table. Bacon and fruit quickly followed.</p><p>\u201cThe president\u2019s daughter, Joseph,\u201d Grammy M said, her voice scolding. \u201cYou can\u2019t have your way with her then turn your back on her. You\u2019re a better man than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Tessa said, looking as if she\u2019d smelled something disgusting.</p><p>Joe felt the walls closing in. These were thicker and harder to climb.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to live here, in this house,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cYou could build something else. Close by. On the land.\u201d</p><p>Joe stared at the food, then at the Grands. He believed what Darcy had told him\u2014that for these old women food was love. But right now he couldn\u2019t take any more. He stood, backed away, and when he was clear of the house, he turned and escaped.</p><p>14</p><p>\u201cD id you hear?\u201d Lauren asked eagerly, her voice as clear as if she were in the same room, despite the distance and the secure line. \u201cThey\u2019ve caught a couple of the kidnappers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d Darcy asked, trying for as much enthusiasm as possible when in truth the news had made her heart sink.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to leave soon,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m getting so tired of my own company. The agents are nice, but they\u2019re not here to babysit me. The good news is I\u2019ve caught up on my reading.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt a twinge of guilt\u2014her stay at the Marcelli house had been so perfect, she never wanted it to end.</p><p>\u201cThe downside,\u201d Lauren said, \u201cis you\u2019re going to have to leave Joe. Or will you still be seeing him?\u201d</p><p>Despite being upset at the thought of leaving, mention of Joe made her smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe.\u201d She wanted to. But in reality was that possible? Her smile faded. \u201cHe lives in San Diego. I\u2019m in D.C. He\u2019s a naval officer, and I\u2019m the daughter of the commander in chief. I think that makes us more star-crossed lovers than the happily-ever-after type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovers, huh?\u201d Lauren teased. \u201cI want to hear all about that.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wasn\u2019t willing to talk about it\u2014not yet. \u201cIt\u2019s a figure of speech. Don\u2019t get too excited. Besides, this isn\u2019t going anywhere. He\u2019s not the relationship type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe resists his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trying to be his mother. Romantic love is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been married.\u201d Darcy filled her in on the generalities, then sighed. \u201cThey say people who don\u2019t learn from history are destined to repeat it. In my case, that\u2019s true. Here I am, falling for a guy as inaccessible as my father.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words came out, she wanted to call them back. She clutched the phone tighter and braced herself.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not inaccessible,\u201d Lauren said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know. I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I\u2019m sorry. Please, let\u2019s not get into this long-distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lauren sighed. \u201cJoe sounds so great, regardless of whatever issues the two of you may have. I want to meet him. I know. When this is all over, you stay there and I\u2019ll come by to pick you up. That way I can check out the military cutie and meet the family.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sat up. Her first thought was to scream out her protest. Not Lauren. Not here. This was the one place on the planet where everyone liked her for herself. There hadn\u2019t been any comparing, any disappointing second finishes. No one had rejected her. If Lauren came now, all that would change.</p><p>\u201cYour enthusiasm is overwhelming,\u201d Lauren said, the hurt clear in her voice.</p><p>Darcy flopped back on the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. Of course I want you to meet Joe and everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might try saying that like you mean it. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to show up.\u201d</p><p>She felt like a worm. A selfish worm who had been living the good life while her sister had been stuck in a cornfield.</p><p>\u201cLauren, please. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just...\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m scared, okay? Joe is really special. I like him a lot. Maybe more than a lot. I haven\u2019t felt this way before, and it\u2019s scary and exciting and new and I don\u2019t want to lose him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d</p><p>Darcy squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cHave you looked in the mirror lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You\u2019re just as pretty and much more exotic looking. I\u2019m just your basic blue-eyed blonde. With very common features. Besides...\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cYou have to know I\u2019d never do anything to take Joe away. I\u2019m not even saying I could. Just that I wouldn\u2019t. Ever. I love you. You\u2019re my sister. My family. That means everything to me.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy went from feeling like a worm to feeling like slime. Slime was definitely worse. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not worried about you trying anything, Lauren. You\u2019d never do that.\u201d Had never done that. \u201cIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s...them. Him. Everyone likes you better. Most of the time I don\u2019t care, but this time it would really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I never did anything wrong,\u201d Lauren whispered.</p><p>Darcy rolled onto her side and pulled her knees to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is all about me. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s insecure and stupid and acting like a child. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never try to take Joe away from you. Or anybody. I don\u2019t want to love that much again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to let him go eventually,\u201d Darcy said.</p> <p>Lauren\u2019s breath caught. \u201cI can\u2019t. I loved him so much. I could never love anyone else like that. I don\u2019t think my heart\u2019s big enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could date. That would be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay by myself. I have my memories, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Darcy thought about pointing out that Lauren was only twenty-seven. A little young to be settling for mere memories.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, how did this get to be about me and my lack of love life?\u201d Lauren asked. \u201cWe were talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. How stupid and jealous I am. Not my favorite topic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t get jealous of your life and your freedom?\u201d</p><p>Darcy rolled onto her back and opened her eyes. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re jealous of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You have a lot more privacy than me. No one expects you to be a saint, so you\u2019re not always getting judged. I love how you can tell the world to piss off if you\u2019re not in the mood.\u201d</p><p>Darcy couldn\u2019t believe it. Lauren wanted to tell the world to piss off? \u201cA lot of that\u2019s just a facade,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cWho cares. You can do it. All I can do is cut ribbons at opening ceremonies and raise money. The money-raising part is good, but the rest of it? Sometimes I just want to curl up with a good book or watch Oprah.\u201d</p><p>Darcy realized she was free to do that and a lot more. Funny how she\u2019d never seen herself as the lucky one before.</p><p>\u201cI can TiVo Oprah for you if you\u2019d like,\u201d she offered.</p><p>Lauren started to laugh. \u201cThat would be great. Although I\u2019m catching up on reruns while I\u2019m here. It\u2019s really fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, too.\u201d</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI think you should come visit me here. When it\u2019s safe for us to travel.\u201d</p><p>Lauren sighed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>The slime feeling returned. \u201cI mean it, Lauren. Please. Come visit. It will be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>They talked a few more minutes, then hung up. Darcy sat up and thought about what her sister had said. That she thought Darcy had the better life. Impossible. But it was good to know she wasn\u2019t the only one who got jealous and crazy about her world.</p><p>As for Lauren coming here, maybe it was a good idea. It would force Darcy to face her demons. If the Marcellis liked Lauren better, well, Darcy would just get over it. And if Joe wanted her...Darcy grinned. Then she would just have to beat the crap out of him.</p><p>Joe left the guesthouse after the daily security briefing. Progress had been made\u2014kidnappers caught. Not all of them, but a couple. And if they talked, he would soon be out of here and back where he belonged. Assuming the admiral had cooled down.</p><p>\u201cJoseph. Joe.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and saw Lorenzo limping toward him. The old man leaned heavily on his cane.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said. \u201cWalk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in more conversations about changing my name, learning about the wine, or accepting this as my destiny.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo nodded. \u201cAll right. Walk with me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t a grandfather want to spend time with his grandson?\u201d</p><p>Joe swore under his breath, then fell into step with the old man as they headed toward the vineyards.</p><p>\u201cWe have good weather,\u201d Lorenzo said. \u201cIt makes for good grapes. Brenna wants to be a part of all of it this year, but I think her baby has other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Joe said, remembering how huge she\u2019d been the last time he\u2019d seen her. \u201cIt looks painful.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo grinned. \u201cWomen are strong. Never tell them, but I would not want to give birth. With Tessa, it was only twice. First Marco, then a little girl. She died.\u201d</p><p>Joe glanced at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGod gives and then he takes. It is always that way.\u201d He raised his cane and pointed toward the horizon. \u201cI can remember when there were no vines up there. When we needed only one crew to pick the grapes. Now I can\u2019t even walk the land, there is so much.\u201d He winked. \u201cBut not too much, eh? There can never be too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLand is wealth,\u201d Joe agreed.</p><p>\u201cBut it is more than money. It\u2019s about who we are. When I was a boy, I dreamed of when I would run Marcelli. My father was a stern man. Difficult to please. But I knew I would and one day this would all be mine. I have lived a long time, long enough to see my great-grandchildren born. Tessa speaks of blessings, and she is right.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t know what to say so he nodded. \u201cYou have a good family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to come. Brenna and Nic\u2019s baby will have wine in his veins. He\u2019ll be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be a she.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo shrugged. \u201cIf God wishes. But there will be sons, too. And more children. The families will join. We will grow. I wanted that for you.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t know if he meant children, family, or what. He\u2019d meant what he said about not wanting to argue anymore so he kept quiet.</p><p>\u201cI wanted so many things,\u201d Lorenzo said as they stopped by a row of grapes. The old man bent down and fingered a leaf. \u201cAll those years ago, when Marco told me he\u2019d gotten a girl pregnant, I was angry. I thought he\u2019d thrown his future away. She\u2019s Irish, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d heard,\u201d Joe said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI wanted Marco to marry a nice Italian girl. But he loved Colleen, and I couldn\u2019t make him stop. But I could force them to send the baby away.\u201d Lorenzo looked at him. \u201cI was stubborn and a fool and I\u2019ve paid every day since. You\u2019ve paid. So much lost. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Joe had expected a lot of screaming but not an apology. He started to speak and found his throat had gotten tight and the words wouldn\u2019t come. Before he could make them, Lorenzo spoke again.</p><p>\u201cNow I give you advice. I know you think I\u2019m an old man who doesn\u2019t know much, but I\u2019ve lived a long time. Get married. Not because of the family or because I\u2019ve told you to but because it will make you happy. It\u2019s not good for a man to be alone so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already tried that and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Joe told him. He wouldn\u2019t go through it again. Not the caring, the wanting more, the hope that maybe it could work only to come home and find a letter and an empty house.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t love her,\u201d Grandpa Lorenzo said flatly. \u201cWhen a Marcelli man loves, it\u2019s forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Lorenzo yelled as he thumped his cane. \u201cLove like that never dies. It is who we are\u2014like the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to avoid it,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I have what I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Your navy. There are things a woman can do to a man your navy will never do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but I don\u2019t have to be married to get laid.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cYou think I\u2019m talking about sex? Marriage is about the soul and the heart. It\u2019s about one person who knows everything and still reaches for you in the night. Love like that is a gift.\u201d He paused and the anger faded. \u201cJoseph, don\u2019t have regrets. I\u2019ve lived with them for thirty-three years and they\u2019re a heavy burden. I want so much for you. I want you to be happy. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are!\u201d</p><p>They both turned and saw Katie hurrying toward them, a red-haired toddler in her arms.</p><p>Katie Marcelli Stryker was the oldest of the Marcelli daughters. She and her husband, Zach, lived in Los Angeles, where he was a big-time lawyer and she ran a party-planning business.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Lorenzo said pointing. \u201cTwo beautiful women want to talk to us. We are lucky men.\u201d</p><p>Joe smiled. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Katie stopped in front of them and laughed. \u201cLook what she can do,\u201d she said proudly, then turned to her daughter. \u201cCome on, honey. What did you want to say?\u201d</p><p>The green-eyed beauty held out her arms to Lorenzo and said, \u201cGram.\u201d</p><p>The old man pulled her close and hugged her. \u201cHow are you? Such a little princess. Have you been practicing my name?\u201d</p><p>Valerie nodded shyly and wrapped her arms around his neck. Katie turned to Joe.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my hug, big guy?\u201d</p><p>He gathered her close. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>Katie squeezed him hard. \u201cI heard we\u2019ve got famous company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>She straightened and smiled. \u201cGee, Joe, did you have to have sex with the president\u2019s daughter on her very first visit?\u201d</p><p>Darcy had been through enough Marcelli meals to expect insanity, but this beat all records. Leaves had been added to the already massive table in the dining room so that the whole family could sit together.</p><p>She\u2019d been introduced to Katie and her family. Francesca, Sam, and the twins had arrived, along with Brenna and Nic. Only Mia was missing, and as Colleen had whispered in the kitchen, the blessing behind that was no Ian.</p><p>\u201cKatie, you take that end,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cWe\u2019ll put Valerie in her high chair next to you. Francesca, I\u2019ll take one of the twins by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the other,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cI might as well practice. Unless you think being a twin and sitting next to another twin might make me have twins.\u201d</p><p>Nic leaned over and kissed her cheek. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way. Whatever you\u2019ve got, you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Brenna patted her huge stomach. \u201cI\u2019m thinking a really big baby and a beach ball.\u201d</p><p>Everyone took their seats. Darcy found herself in the middle of the table, next to Grammy M and across from Joe. High chairs were slid into place and toddlers settled. Most of the food was already on the table, although Tessa carried in the last few dishes.</p><p>Lorenzo passed open bottles of cabernet down both sides of the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have family here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe eat, we drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talk,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cWhat did I forget?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bread,\u201d Grammy M told her.</p><p>The two old women scowled at each other before Tessa returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Darcy took the wine Marco passed to her. She poured a glass, then filled Grammy M\u2019s. Gabriel took the bottle from her and winked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lorenzo pushed to his feet. \u201cTo my family,\u201d he said, raising his glass.</p><p>Darcy instantly looked at Joe, who hesitated before picking up his glass. Darcy picked up hers as well, knowing that while she wasn\u2019t part of the Marcellis, she was happy to wish them the best. They had been more than kind to her.</p><p>As soon as the toast was over, Tessa ordered everyone to \u201cEat. Eat before it gets cold.\u201d</p> <p>Serving dishes circled the table. Darcy took small portions of everything. Despite her working out, she\u2019d managed to put on enough weight to make half her wardrobe too tight to wear. But it was hard to care about that when she was having such a good time. Funny how just a few short weeks ago she\u2019d arrived feeling scared and angry. It was as if she\u2019d been nothing but sharp edges, and now she was all rounded corners and curves.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of life on a winery, Darcy?\u201d Katie asked. \u201cIt must be different for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I really like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see her designs?\u201d Tessa asked. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to finally have new wine labels,\u201d Brenna said. \u201cSo please accept my heartfelt thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI enjoyed working on the labels. And it was my first paying job in the graphic design business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for you,\u201d Katie said. \u201cIs that what you studied at college?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I was an art major. Painting\u2014oils mostly. Then I discovered I wasn\u2019t very good and switched to graphic design and marketing.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M patted her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sure your pictures were delightful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I tried, but I didn\u2019t have the talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of talent,\u201d Lorenzo intoned. \u201cYou should have seen the labels Brenna has brought me over the years. Goats. Who puts goats on wine bottles?\u201d</p> <p>Brenna shook her head. \u201cThey weren\u2019t goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnimals then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it, you two,\u201d Katie said mildly. \u201cThey\u2019re always like that, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re used to it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much,\u201d Darcy said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt was worse before,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cWhen Brenna moved back here, before she and Nic got together, wow, did she and Grandpa Lorenzo go at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to be sure,\u201d the old man said. \u201cSure that she wanted to devote herself to the winery. Now she has, and all will be well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a living, breathing soap opera,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cWe should be on daytime television.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you hate daytime TV,\u201d Marco said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t watch,\u201d Colleen told him. \u201cI\u2019d like the money though.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and everyone joined in. Darcy glanced around the table, then spotted Katie watching her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Katie said. \u201cI know everyone else is used to you being here, but I\u2019m still getting over the strangeness of the president\u2019s daughter sitting in the dining room of the house where I grew up. Until now the closest I\u2019ve ever come to seeing you is in magazines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccupational hazard,\u201d Darcy said.</p><p>\u201cI guess. It would be so strange. People thinking they know you when they don\u2019t. Of course I think I know you because of what everyone has told me.\u201d</p><p>Darcy instantly glanced at Joe, then away. Katie grinned. \u201cOh, yeah, I know about that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie!\u201d Colleen said, scolding her daughter. \u201cLeave Darcy alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Darcy said, fighting a blush and having a bad feeling she was losing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her fault,\u201d Francesca said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take this the wrong way, Darcy, but we\u2019re all much more interested in Joe\u2019s part in this than yours. We assume you\u2019re normal, but to the best of our knowledge, our big brother has never dated. No one knew about his ex-wife until recently. Intellectually we know there must be dozens of women, but we\u2019ve never seen him with one before. So we\u2019re all curious about how this is working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a freak of nature,\u201d Joe growled. \u201cI\u2019ve had girlfriends before.\u201d</p><p>Conversation ceased. Darcy didn\u2019t mind, because she didn\u2019t have anything to say either. Girlfriends? As in women in relationships? As in, she was one of them? She was his girlfriend?</p><p>Her insides got all warm and squishy. Was it true? And if it was, did it matter? Joe wasn\u2019t exactly a commitment-type guy. He handed out crumbs when she wanted a banquet. Had she somehow gotten past his emotional wall, or was she just fooling herself?</p><p>Joe shifted uncomfortably in the silence. Brenna opened her mouth, no doubt to say something funny but potentially embarrassing. Fortunately just then Valerie spilled her milk and Eric threw carrots at his sister. Shrieks and tears erupted and Colleen, Francesca, and Katie all jumped to their feet and grabbed for extra napkins. The conversation was forgotten by everyone except Darcy, who found herself staring at Joe. And in a quirk of fate she couldn\u2019t explain, he was staring back. Just looking at her in a way that made her wonder about possibilities and romance and hope and if maybe, just this once, she was going to get it right.</p><p>After lunch there was discussion about going for a walk. In the end only Darcy, Grandpa Lorenzo, Brenna, and Nic started out into the vineyards.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll accept the back pain, being unable to sleep, and the soccer games played in my belly, but why do I have to swell up like a toad?\u201d Brenna asked as they strolled along a shady lane. \u201cMy shoes barely fit, I haven\u2019t been able to wear my wedding ring in three months, and we won\u2019t even discuss clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be worth it,\u201d Nic assured her as he helped her along.</p><p>\u201cHa. Want to trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Brenna turned to Darcy. \u201cA piece of advice\u2014pass on the whole pregnancy thing. It\u2019s so much more disgusting than anyone tells you. There are things going on in my body that make it feel as if it\u2019s been taken over by aliens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much talking,\u201d Lorenzo scolded mildly.</p><p>\u201cYou try carrying around a watermelon in your stomach for nine months.\u201d She came to a stop and rubbed her back. \u201cOkay. This is as far as I go. You two have a nice walk.\u201d</p><p>Darcy glanced at Lorenzo. \u201cDo you want to go back?\u201d</p><p>He stared out at the horizon, then shook his head. \u201cNo. Let\u2019s see how far we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you feel better,\u201d Darcy told Brenna.</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I do.\u201d Brenna waved, then leaned heavily on Nic, who led the way back to the house.</p><p>Darcy moved next to Lorenzo. The old man surprised her by taking her hand and squeezing it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be happy to have you in the family,\u201d he said.</p><p>She winced. \u201cI appreciate that, but Joe and I aren\u2019t...That is to say we haven\u2019t...I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my grandson is thinking about giving his heart.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wasn\u2019t sure about that, although it sounded nice.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Lorenzo asked.</p><p>Darcy stepped back and smiled. \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t answer that, and maybe we should change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an old man who asks too many questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>Lorenzo chuckled. They started walking again. The afternoon was still and clear. There were only the calls of birds to break the silence. After another ten or fifteen minutes, Lorenzo stopped, then looked around.</p><p>\u201cI must sit down,\u201d he said.</p><p>They were in the middle of a row of grapes.</p><p>\u201cRight here?\u201d Darcy asked, then gasped as Lorenzo sank to the ground. She rushed over to him and crouched beside him. \u201cLorenzo?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, but something was very wrong. She could tell by his rapid, shallow breathing and lack of color in his skin.</p><p>Oh God. What should she do? She stood and looked around. Where was her Secret Service agent?</p><p>But no matter how she scanned the horizon, no one appeared.</p><p>She bent down and touched Lorenzo\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go get help,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gripped her fingers. \u201cDon\u2019t go. It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Panic became fear. She felt for his pulse but couldn\u2019t find it. Tears filled her eyes and made it impossible to see.</p><p>She knelt on the dirt and looked around. \u201cHelp!\u201d she yelled. \u201cSomeone help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Lorenzo gave her a slight smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Darcy. It\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t all right, but she didn\u2019t know what to do. She sat on the ground and lifted his head onto her lap. She held his hand until she realized the only breathing she heard was her own.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d she called again, knowing it was too late. Over and over she called, but no one answered. For the first time in as long as she could remember, she was well and truly alone.</p><p>15</p><p>J oe put down the phone and reviewed the list in front of him. Even though several things had been checked off, the pile of things to do was getting longer, not shorter. He knew part of the problem was that no one could concentrate. Even he was having trouble staying mentally on task.</p><p>It had been two days. Only forty-eight hours since the Marcelli world as he knew it had changed forever. He couldn\u2019t think of this place existing without Lorenzo running things. The old man\u2019s gruff pronouncements were as integral as the house or the vines. How could he be gone?</p><p>Everyone had the same question. Everyone wanted to know what to do next. While it made sense for Marco to be in charge, Lorenzo\u2019s only child had turned to Joe when he\u2019d heard the news. The shock in Marco\u2019s eyes had told Joe he was in no shape to make any decisions.</p><p>There was a knock at the open library door. Darcy entered and handed him a list.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the phone calls have been made,\u201d she told him. \u201cEveryone has been notified. The funeral home will take the body as soon as it\u2019s released, and the church has been arranged for the services Friday morning.\u201d</p><p>Joe ignored the list and looked at her. The shadows that had finally started to fade had returned. She looked thin and pale and unbearably sad.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be making calls,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat if someone recognized your voice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to help.\u201d She moved into the room and sat down across from his desk. \u201cI didn\u2019t call any friends or family members. Then I would have had to explain who I was. But I took care of the church and the catering. Tessa is saying she wants to cook, but I spoke to Colleen and Marco and they agree it\u2019s just too much for her. They\u2019re expecting nearly five hundred people at the funeral and nearly that many back here. Katie told me who to call, and they\u2019re going to be ready on time. I\u2019m working on getting tents set up in the backyard, along with tables. I should have confirmation before five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at this,\u201d he said, appreciative of the help. What did he know about putting together a funeral for a man who had been a part of the community for nearly eighty years?</p><p>\u201cI grew up in politics,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI know how to organize parties. I know Katie was the more logical choice, but she\u2019s pretty broken up. They all are. Oh, and Mia just got here.\u201d</p><p>The youngest Marcelli sister had been missing for the past two days. \u201cWhere was she?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShe and Ian went down to Mexico and didn\u2019t tell anyone. She got to her hotel in San Diego this morning and got the message. They drove right back. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be in to see you in a second.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s too much to do.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t. He\u2019d organized tactical assignments for entire SEAL teams. This was nothing, in the logistics department. But emotionally\u2014it was hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll get done,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cThere are plenty of hands to lighten the load.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get philosophical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Lorenzo Marcelli died in my arms.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want to talk to you about that.\u201d</p><p>She looked away. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He doubted that, but before he could say anything, Mia ran into the room. Tears poured down her cheeks as she headed directly for Joe. He pushed back from the desk in time for her to drop into his lap and rest her face against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone,\u201d she cried. \u201cI loved him so much and I never told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew,\u201d Joe told her as he awkwardly put his arms around her.</p> <p>She cried until he felt the moisture seep through his shirt. He patted her back and looked at Darcy, desperate to know what to do next.</p><p>\u201cIt was very quick,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cHe was at peace.\u201d</p><p>Mia straightened and looked at her. \u201cYou swear? He wasn\u2019t in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d The tears made her face all blotchy.</p><p>Ian walked into the room, and Mia left Joe to hurry into his arms. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was fine when we left. Just fine.\u201d</p> <p>For once Ian didn\u2019t seem to have anything to say. He gave them a sympathetic smile and ushered a sobbing Mia out of the library.</p><p>\u201cToo much emotion,\u201d Joe said when she\u2019d left.</p><p>\u201cMia leads with her heart,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to guess she\u2019ll keep doing that until someone breaks it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about that happening. Honestly, he didn\u2019t want to think about anything. Right now he would sell his left nut for a military crisis calling him back to duty. He didn\u2019t care where, just so long as it was away from here.</p><p>But the phone didn\u2019t ring and Tessa entered the room with a tray of sandwiches and a pot of coffee.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been in here so long,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou missed lunch.\u201d</p><p>She seemed smaller and more frail. As if the essence of who she was had been lost. As she set the tray down, she began to tremble. Joe stood, then looked helplessly at Darcy.</p><p>\u201cHold her,\u201d she mouthed.</p> <p>Joe stared at the tiny woman, then opened his arms to her. Tessa stepped into his embrace and began to cry. He pulled her close and stroked her back. She barely came to the center of his chest, and he was afraid if he held her too tightly, she would snap in two.</p><p>Darcy stood and moved to the bookcase, where she grabbed a box of tissues and passed them to him. He offered a couple to Tessa, who took them and wiped her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a foolish old woman,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Darcy hugged her. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful and you miss your husband. Of course there are tears. We\u2019re all sad. Lorenzo would probably tell us we were being foolish, crying over what we can\u2019t change. Then he\u2019d want to know if anyone is checking on the grapes.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked at her. A slight smiled pulled at the corners of her mouth. \u201cYes, you are right. That is what he would have said. But he would have been happy, too, to know how much we miss him.\u201d</p><p>She touched the large, carved desk. \u201cHe would sit here sometimes in the evening. He would do the books and I would read to Marco, or knit. In the winter we\u2019d have a fire.\u201d Tears filled her eyes again. She opened her mouth, closed it, then quickly left.</p><p>Joe sank back onto his chair. \u201cI\u2019ve reached my limit. When is this going to be over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a long time.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cMarco should be running things. Everyone\u2019s looking to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re the strong one. Those with natural leadership ability always rise to a position of authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s his family.\u201d</p><p>She walked around the desk and crouched in front of him. After taking both his hands in hers, she looked at him. Just looked.</p><p>He knew what she wanted\u2014for him to admit it was his family, too. But he couldn\u2019t. Accepting the Marcellis as his own changed too much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cI know that makes me a real bastard, but I\u2019m okay with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenial doesn\u2019t change reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my reality.\u201d</p><p>She rose and, still holding his hands, leaned forward and lightly kissed him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t keep pushing them away. Learn from your past.\u201d</p><p>He jerked free. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t pushed Alicia away. She\u2019d gone on her own.</p><p>Darcy shrugged. \u201cHave it your way.\u201d She left.</p><p>Alone in the silence, he thought. It was all he wanted. All he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>Thursday morning Darcy reported for kitchen duty. Grandma Tessa had found out about the caterers and had a fit. She\u2019d called in all the Marcelli women and Darcy to prepare everything. A menu had been posted on the refrigerator, Mia, Colleen, and Ian had been sent out for supplies, and now Grandma Tessa assigned tasks.</p><p>\u201cBrenna, you\u2019ll need to stay off your feet,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can sit at the table and chop. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Brenna nodded. \u201cAnything you want. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother glared at her. \u201cStop being so nice to me. It makes me want to cry. No tears today. Today we cook. Tomorrow all those people will come to pay their respects to Lorenzo. They\u2019ll drink Marcelli wine and they\u2019ll eat Marcelli food. Nothing else.\u201d Her gaze narrowed as she turned her attention to Katie.</p><p>\u201cI was only trying to help,\u201d her granddaughter said. \u201cI thought I was helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Helping is washing all the chickens when Mia brings them back.\u201d</p><p>The back door opened and Grammy M walked into the kitchen. Tessa stared at her for a long moment, then held open her arms. The two old ladies rushed together and hugged tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Grammy M murmured. \u201cOh, Tessa, your pain. I would have come sooner, but I was thinkin\u2019...\u201d She gave a little sob. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinkin\u2019. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. I\u2019ve barely seen him these past three years. I regret that. And not seein\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>They rocked back and forth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. My harsh words.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M straightened and looked at her friend. \u201c\u2019Tis no matter. I\u2019ll be moving back in. Gabriel\u2019s packin\u2019 my things. It\u2019ll be like it was before.\u201d</p><p>Tessa stared at her. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m movin\u2019 back in. Oh, Tessa, you need me now. I feel so horrible about what I did. You made me mad with your talk of the good Lord punishin\u2019 me, so I vowed not to come back until you apologized. Now I see I was an old fool. We\u2019re not gettin\u2019 any younger. We need to take advantage of the time we have left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Tessa asked fiercely.</p><p>\u201cGabriel? Of course I love him.\u201d</p><p>Tessa marched to the phone and picked it up. \u201cThen you call him right now and tell him to stop packing. You\u2019re staying there. If you love him, Mary, then hold on to him for as long as you have together. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re married or not. I was mad because you seemed to leave so easily. As if I didn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou matter,\u201d Grammy M said, throwing herself at her friend. \u201cYou matter more than anyone.\u201d</p><p>Brenna was already weeping. The Grands cried, Katie cried, Francesca had put aside the flour she was measuring and searched for tissues. Darcy felt her own emotions give way.</p><p>Brenna pushed herself to her feet and waddled over to the Grands. \u201cGroup girl hug,\u201d she said, motioning Darcy in. Katie and Francesca joined them.</p><p>For Darcy, the pain of loss combined with the sweetness of feeling as if she belonged. In this time of family tragedy, the Marcellis reached out to include her.</p><p>Later, when the groceries had arrived and the tasks were assigned, she went with Grandma Tessa to collect the family silver from a pantry under the main staircase.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need all the serving pieces,\u201d Grandma Tessa said. \u201cBowls, chafing dishes.\u201d</p><p>She stepped aside so Darcy could duck into the small room. Shelves filled the space, and each shelf was crowded with beautiful pieces in silver, silver and glass, and crystal.</p><p>\u201cThis is all so incredible,\u201d Darcy breathed. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the White House, and I have to tell you, this is just as lovely.\u201d</p><p>Tessa smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re kind to say so. Bring everything to the dining room table. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t put you to work washing it all. You\u2019re helpful in the kitchen. Francesca will be in charge of washing and polishing. She never was very handy with a knife.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. She would have to put the leaves in the table first, or there wouldn\u2019t be room. But then five hundred was a lot of people to feed, especially on three days\u2019 notice.</p><p>Tessa turned to leave. Darcy hesitated, then stopped her. \u201cI know I probably shouldn\u2019t say anything, but I...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come get you or anyone. I wanted to, but then he said he didn\u2019t want to be alone. I screamed for help, but no one heard me. I just...\u201d She had to swallow against the tightness and the tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he wasn\u2019t with family. At the end, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Tessa looked at her for a long time, then patted her arm. \u201cLorenzo died with someone he cared about very much, Darcy. That makes you family. I\u2019m glad you were with him. So very glad.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded, but she couldn\u2019t see or speak. There were too many tears and no way to stop them.</p><p>Paige was prepared to go to the mat on this one. \u201cDarcy\u2019s request isn\u2019t unreasonable,\u201d she said, striving for patience, when she really wanted to hit Alex over the head and tie him up in the closet for a couple of days.</p><p>\u201cNo one is supposed to know the president\u2019s daughter is here. You don\u2019t think one of the five hundred people at the funeral will notice?\u201d Alex demanded in a tone that told her he thought she was an idiot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hardly going to be parading herself around. She\u2019ll be in a hat with a heavy veil. We\u2019ll walk her in at the end and she\u2019ll duck out a side door right before the services end. She\u2019s not asking to go to the graveside and she\u2019s going to stay in her room with the door locked until the wake is over. That\u2019s more than reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s reasonable is not going out at all. We\u2019re talking five hundred people, Paige. Do you know what kind of security nightmare this is? We should move her to a secure location until all this mess is over. Typical Darcy, she\u2019s refusing to leave.\u201d</p><p>Paige took a step toward him and raised her chin. \u201cTypical Darcy? What does that mean? How has she even once been difficult? How has she made your job harder? The only goddamn time she was left on her own was because of a shift change and the fact that you forgot to schedule overlap. Which happened to be the exact moment Lorenzo Marcelli died.\u201d She poked him in the chest with her index finger. \u201cDarcy was on her own with a dying man and no one around her. Did she come to you and point out the screwup? Did she threaten you? Not even close. So don\u2019t you dare tell me that she\u2019s been difficult.\u201d</p><p>Temper flared in his dark blue eyes. He carefully pushed her finger away. \u201cWhy is this so important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she cares about these people. Because they mean something to her. An emotion you\u2019ve probably never experienced, but it\u2019s there for the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>Alex glared at her. \u201cWe do things by the book on my watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And sometimes mistakes get made.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. Paige knew it had to be killing him that he\u2019d messed up. Such a minor thing, not assigning any overlap. It could have happened to anyone. But it had happened to Alex, and she was more than willing to press that point home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe will be completely covered and unrecognizable,\u201d Paige said more calmly. \u201cI will be with her every second. You can have agents in the church. But she\u2019s going to that funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said curtly. \u201cStraight to the church and straight back. Nothing graveside, and I\u2019ll post agents on the stairs so no one gets up to her floor during the wake.\u201d</p><p>The victory surprised Paige. What had caused Alex to give in? She\u2019d thought they\u2019d have to fight a lot longer and she would have to threaten him with Darcy calling her father.</p> <p>As it was, she was all charged up for a fight that had ended too soon. Lucky for her\u2014there was still one more thing.</p><p>She moved in close again and glared at him. \u201cJust so we\u2019re all clear on this\u2014don\u2019t start something with me unless you intend to finish it. I\u2019m not a toy, and this is not a game.\u201d</p><p>Under other circumstances his bewilderment would have been amusing. Right now it just pissed her off.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you talking about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFigure it out,\u201d she told him, then stalked away.</p> <p>The Catholic church closest to the Marcelli vineyards usually held three hundred. On a foggy, cool, Friday morning, nearly twice that many squeezed inside. Colleen had given Joe an idea of whom to expect. Even so, he was surprised to see so many unfamiliar faces.</p><p>Some were old\u2014contemporaries of Lorenzo\u2019s. Others were much younger. Distant relatives, employees, fellow vintners. A half a dozen politicians sat in the pews.</p><p>There had been over two hundred requests to speak at the funeral. Last night Colleen and her daughters had gone through them and picked thirty. Twenty would speak in the church, the other ten by the graveside.</p><p>Joe listened to the religious service, then to the first few mourners. He heard stories about a Lorenzo he had never known. In some ways the tales made the old man seem alive again.</p><p>Tessa sat next to him, with Marco beside her. She cried through the service, seeming to shrink with every minute that passed. Unable to stand her quiet tears, he put an arm around her and pulled her close.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cYour grandfather was so proud of you,\u201d she whispered from beneath her veil. \u201cSo proud.\u201d</p> <p>His grandfather. He\u2019d never claimed that relationship with Lorenzo. Joe had been careful to avoid calling him by name, much as he did with Marco and Colleen and Tessa. Grammy M had escaped the name stigma because her title didn\u2019t seem to be about any familial relationship.</p><p>There were too many people, Joe thought, wanting to bolt. He forced himself to stay in place, trying to think about other things. He felt Darcy\u2019s presence in the church. She sat in the back, on the side, where she would be whisked away before the service ended. She\u2019d insisted on coming, saying she wanted to be there for the family and for herself.</p><p>He knew in his head funerals were supposed to help. That the ceremony clarified the moment of death and allowed those still living to move on. It had never worked that way for Joe. He\u2019d been to funerals of guys he\u2019d worked with, and the pomp and circumstance had only pissed him off, as it did now.</p><p>Nic stood and walked to the front of the church. He nodded at Tessa and Marco, then introduced himself.</p><p>\u201cI first met Lorenzo when I was ten. I\u2019d walked over from Wild Sea to taste some of his grapes. I was a kid\u2014what did I know?\u201d Nic smiled sadly. \u201cLorenzo found me snooping and took me back to the winery, where we did some barrel tasting. He listened to my opinion and told me his. I was terrified, of course. He was a Marcelli and we weren\u2019t supposed to get along, but he was kind that day and made me wish I could be a part of his family.\u201d</p><p>Nic paused and stared into the crowded church. \u201cYears later, I met and fell in love with his granddaughter Brenna. After a little complaining because I was a Giovanni, Lorenzo welcomed me into the family. And there I\u2019ve stayed, grateful to have known him. He was a man bound by tradition, yet farsighted enough to see what the future would require of those around him. He has given us all room to succeed, while offering us a haven of support and caring.\u201d</p><p>Joe let the words wash over him. Speaker after speaker spoke of a man Joe had barely allowed himself to know. He thought of all the times Lorenzo had pressed him to be part of the family, and of all the times Joe had refused. Lorenzo had wanted little more than a chance to get to know his grandson, but Joe had been determined to make sure that never happened.</p><p>Why? What was the point of disappointing an old man? What had he gained by resisting?</p> <p>And now it was too late. He couldn\u2019t go to Lorenzo and say he understood why he, Joe, had been sent away all those years ago. He couldn\u2019t acknowledge that whatever his last name might be, Marcelli blood flowed in his veins. He couldn\u2019t stop rejecting what had been offered because the man who refused to give up was finally gone.</p><p>Several hours later Joe moved through the crowded kitchen. The guests were being kept outside by a combination of family and Secret Service agents gently ushering them in that direction. Tessa held court over the stove, accepting the condolences of those who stopped by to see her and share stories. Colleen and Grammy M stayed close, while Marco, Francesca, Katie, and Mia circulated with the guests. Nic had taken Brenna home. She\u2019d been inconsolable after the funeral, and with her due date so close, everyone had agreed she needed to rest.</p><p>For the first time, Joe felt out of place. He didn\u2019t know where to go or what to do. Several family friends had spoken with him about his grandfather, but he hadn\u2019t known what he should say in return. He had no stories to share, no fond memories. He\u2019d spent the last three years resisting.</p><p>Finally he made his way to the back of the house and went upstairs. The agent on the landing nodded, then stepped aside to let Joe pass. He walked to Darcy\u2019s room, knocked once, and entered when she called for him to come in.</p><p>She sat on her bed. The plain black dress was still in place, but she\u2019d kicked off her shoes and removed the veil. Her skin was pale, her eyes large and filled with pain.</p><p>\u201cHow are you holding up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my question for you,\u201d she told him as she stood and stepped toward him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t mad. Typical Darcy. She liked to act tough, but she was all heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting through it.\u201d</p><p>She studied his face, then touched her fingers to his cheeks. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cI never told him it was okay. A couple of days before he died, he apologized to me for forcing Colleen and Marco to give me up for adoption. I never said I forgave him. He thinks I\u2019m still mad at him for that.\u201d</p><p>She pressed herself against him. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. He knows what\u2019s in your heart, Joe.\u201d</p><p>If only that were true. But in his book, it was a bunch of crap. \u201cI never said I cared. I never admitted that I was one of them. A Marcelli. I wouldn\u2019t say it. I wouldn\u2019t even call him my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes and spilled down her cheeks. He touched the moisture. \u201cHey, I\u2019m the one who screwed up. Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>J oe couldn\u2019t remember anyone ever crying for him. He didn\u2019t know what to say, so instead of trying to speak, he bent down and kissed her.</p><p>The gesture was supposed to offer comfort and thanks, but the second his mouth brushed hers, heat exploded inside of him. The wanting was as instant as it was powerful. Need took over, making him grab her and pull her close.</p><p>Darcy responded by clinging to him, urging him on. She parted her lips, and when he slipped his tongue inside, she welcomed him.</p><p>Blood raced south, making him hard in a heartbeat. He reached for the zipper at the back of her dress. One long pull had it free. A quick tug at her shoulders and it fell down her arms, exposing her black lacy bra.</p><p>He pulled back enough to get a good look. Soft, pale skin, black lace, tight nipples. If he\u2019d had thoughts about turning back, one eyeful took care of that. Still, there was enough sanity left for him to remember where he was and what was happening.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell am I thinking?\u201d he asked, more of himself than of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think,\u201d she said. She lowered her arms and stepped out of the dress. Underneath she wore a pair of tiny, black panties, her bra, and nothing else. How was he supposed to resist that?</p><p>As he watched, she crossed to the door and turned the old-fashioned lock. Then she drew the curtains so the room was in semidarkness. She moved back in front of him and gently pushed his suit jacket off his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cAllow me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDarcy,\u201d he began, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNo talking,\u201d she told him. \u201cNo thinking. No analyzing. Just feel my touch. What I\u2019m doing to you. Nothing else. Clear your mind.\u201d</p><p>She loosened his tie and pulled it off, then went to work on his shirt buttons. He stood there, feeling strange and awkward, not sure what was going on. Oh, he understood they were both about to be naked, but this was different from his usual lovemaking, although he couldn\u2019t say why.</p><p>There was something in her eyes, something in the way she seemed so solemn, yet determined. Something in her touch that kept him quiet and immobile.</p><p>When she\u2019d tossed his shirt on the chair, she walked behind him and pressed her mouth to his back. He felt her tongue slip across an old scar.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cKnife fight. I rolled when I should have ducked.\u201d</p><p>She nipped the area, sending a jolt of fire right down to his crotch. She moved her hands to his waist, then to his chest, where she stroked him from shoulder to belly, getting close to his erection, but never touching him.</p><p>\u201cAnd this one?\u201d she asked before tonguing another spot on his back.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d He picked up one of her hands and brought it to his mouth, where he bit down on the swell of flesh below her thumb and licked her palm.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t remember?\u201d she asked, her voice breathless.</p><p>\u201cI have a lot of scars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I see. Sit down and take off your shoes and socks.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away and did as she requested. Then he stood again and removed his slacks and briefs. When he was naked, he turned toward her, waiting for more instructions.</p><p>Her gaze swept his body, pausing on his erection.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cLie down on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>He did and watched as she slipped off her bra and panties. He had about two seconds to enjoy the view before she moved onto the bed, then straddled him just below his butt.</p><p>She leaned forward so the very tips of her breasts brushed across his back. The light touch drove him crazy, especially as she rocked her hips slightly, grinding his dick into the bed. It was just enough friction to be dangerous.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t tell her to stop. Not when she kissed and nibbled her way across his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so strong,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou carry so much weight and worry. You can let it go, just for a few minutes. Just for now.\u201d</p><p>Under any other circumstances, he probably would have told her to keep her emotional mumbo jumbo to herself, but right then, the words made sense. He did want to give up the burden for a little while. To not think about anything except how she made him feel. But kisses on his shoulders and back weren\u2019t going to get it done, despite how nice they were.</p><p>In one quick move, he flipped over. He grabbed her around the waist, keeping her in place. Only now her hot, wet center was directly on his.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I get for playing with an expert, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He could have pushed inside of her. A large part of his body wanted just that. To bury himself inside and let the feelings take him away. But not just yet, he thought, thinking about things he could do to her and how good they would feel.</p><p>So he stayed in place, and when she moved up his body so she could kiss him, he didn\u2019t stop her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Instead he claimed her with a deep kiss. He traced her tongue with his, to explore the soft sweetness of her mouth. He slid his hands to her breasts and cupped them. When he teased her tight nipples, she groaned.</p><p>That throaty, hungry sound was his undoing. Suddenly he had to have all of her. He had to touch her and taste her everywhere, except he didn\u2019t want to stop kissing her. Not yet.</p><p>He ignored the throbbing between his legs and concentrated on her pleasure. When she raised her head to catch her breath, he drew her up so that he could suck on her breasts.</p> <p>First one and then the other. Her breathing increased and he felt her body tremble. He urged her up onto her knees as he slid down a little. For the first time, she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at the beautiful naked woman straddling his chest and knew he needed her more than he\u2019d ever needed anyone before.</p><p>\u201cI want to,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She made a vague motion with her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s um...just...I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want her fine. He wanted her writhing and panting and completely out of control. Had some guy refused, saying it wasn\u2019t his thing? Had some bastard hurt her by going down on her? Or was this her first time?</p><p>He had a fantasy of her straddling his face, hanging on to the headboard and riding him to heaven. But that would have to wait for another time. In one quick series of grabs, shifts, and drops, he had her on her back with him between her legs.</p><p>\u201cJeez, how do you do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cI need more self-defense lessons if I\u2019m going to keep up with you.\u201d</p><p>He thought about telling her she couldn\u2019t possibly keep up, but that it was okay because he had no intention of leaving her behind. He opened his mouth to say just that, but instead he realized he was inches above her belly and that any conversation could be had another time. Right now he had important erotic work to do.</p><p>He kissed her stomach, then along the top of her thighs. She squirmed, but it wasn\u2019t in a good way. Her hands pushed at him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He braced himself on one elbow and looked at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Color stained her cheeks. \u201cNothing. It\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve only slept with a couple of guys. I was always afraid of who would talk and what they\u2019d say. Maybe to the press or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the first one was someone from college. I thought he was really special. I thought I was in love with him.\u201d She opened her eyes and looked at him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t. But before I found that out, I suggested we try, you know, oral sex. He got all disgusted and said it was gross and he couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich made you embarrassed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things. It was a couple of days before Christmas and I was taking him home to meet my family. On Christmas afternoon I overheard him coming on to my sister. He said that he and I were only friends, that he had a real thing for her, and that he wanted to make love with her. Then he detailed exactly what he wanted to do with her, including that.\u201d</p> <p>Joe wanted to go find the bastard and pound him into a bloodstain on the sand. Instead he kissed her thigh and asked, \u201cWhat did Lauren do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlapped him as hard as she could, called him a sex-crazed asshole, and told him to get out of the house.\u201d</p><p>He thought about saying he liked Lauren, but he figured Darcy would misunderstand his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a little sensitive about the whole thing ever since,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Give me five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He moved between her thighs. \u201cFive minutes and if you hate it, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>She twisted away. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that. I want to, and I took this correspondence class on some real interesting techniques. You might like them.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, then she started to laugh. \u201cYou did not,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI can show you my certificate. I graduated at the top of my class.\u201d</p><p>Then while she was still laughing, he used his fingers to part her and lightly stroke his tongue against her swollen center.</p><p>Darcy had big plans to endure the five minutes, then push him away. Sure she\u2019d heard that some men liked that sort of thing and she was curious, but Greg\u2019s reaction had scarred her in a way she\u2019d never forgotten. The look of absolute disgust and horror on his face had pretty much shattered her tiny burst of confidence.</p><p>With her second lover, she\u2019d been passive, not daring to ask for anything in case he reacted the same way. Joe had been her third foray into sexuality, and their passionate encounter hadn\u2019t left any time for doubts.</p><p>But now she could think, and once she started, it was impossible to stop her brain.</p><p>The first brush of his tongue felt good. Really good. The second set nerve endings to humming in a way she\u2019d never felt before. Her legs fell open, her hips tilted toward him, and suddenly breathing didn\u2019t seem all that important.</p><p>He licked her over and over. It was different from being touched by his fingers. More intimate. Softer, but more direct. She could feel his breath. His shoulders pushed against her thighs. She was torn, wanting him inside of her and never, ever wanting this to stop.</p><p>Which, of course, it did.</p><p>She opened her eyes and stared at him. Fear swept through her. He hadn\u2019t liked it. He hadn\u2019t liked doing it to her. He hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cGive me your hands. Hold yourself open.\u201d</p><p>He positioned her fingers so she parted herself for him. She felt exposed and stupid, but before she could ask what he was doing, he returned his mouth to her body and rational thought fled.</p><p>The licking, gentle sucking, circling, breathing all continued. Tension moved through her body, starting at her toes and working its way up. At one point she thought she might have felt his teeth lightly graze that one most sensitive spot, but then there was his tongue again and a slight pressure at the opening.</p><p>Then she was caught up in a whirlwind of sensation. Even as he continued to use his mouth on her, he slipped in first one finger, then another. He filled her in a slow, steady rhythm designed to make her scream and beg.</p><p>She drew her legs back and dug her heels into the mattress. She rocked her hips and tried to catch her breath. Need swept through her. It was hot and thick and too powerful to ignore. Closer, she thought as pleasure tightened and grew. She was so close.</p><p>His fingers moved faster, sliding in and out of her. His tongue kept pace. Suddenly her body was out of her control. She shuddered into her release as incredible sensations washed through her. She bucked against him, desperate to keep him there, touching her everywhere.</p><p>He read her mind, slowing but not stopping. Again and again she came until the climaxes slowed and her body relaxed.</p><p>She opened her eyes and saw him smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cNot bad for a rookie,\u201d he told her, then he pushed into a kneeling position and shifted closer. He thrust into her, filling her completely.</p><p>Understanding dawned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still hard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cVery hard. I liked doing that. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Difficult not to believe him when the proof pushed in deep enough to make her clench around him.</p><p>Gratitude made her ache. Not only because he\u2019d pleasured her, but also because he\u2019d replaced a horrible memory with one that bordered on spectacular.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, the steady rhythm had her on the edge again. She wrapped her legs around him, drawing him closer, then quickly lost herself in more waves of release. Two thrusts later, he followed, groaning her name and hanging on as if he would never let go.</p><p>When they\u2019d recovered enough to speak, Joe rolled off her and pulled her against him. He settled her head on his shoulder and wrapped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Darcy snuggled close. \u201cI believe that\u2019s my line,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou were great.\u201d With more than just sex, she thought. In all of it.</p><p>\u201cI needed to be with you.\u201d</p><p>His words did a funny thing to her heart. It sort of stuttered a beat, before returning to the regular pace.</p><p>Danger, she told herself. This was the wrong man. She needed someone to love her back, not run for the emotional hills.</p><p>Oh but she wanted him to be different. She wanted him to care. But Joe had pushed away one wife and the entire Marcelli family. Why would she be any different?</p><p>\u201cYou need to get back,\u201d she said, giving him a little shove, knowing that if he stayed with her much longer, she was at risk of saying something that could embarrass them both.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly understandable, but I\u2019m not excited at the thought of someone in your family coming looking for you and finding you here. They already know about the last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He kissed her, then sat up and reached for his clothes. \u201cI wish you could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. But Paige and Alex are right. Better for me to stay securely hidden away.\u201d</p><p>He dressed quickly and left. When she was alone again, Darcy dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, then stretched out on the bed. Now what? Everything had changed, and she didn\u2019t know how to make it go back. Falling in love with Joe was a huge mistake. Was it too late to protect herself? And even if she could stop herself from caring about him, however was she going to get over falling for his whole family?</p><p>Three days after the funeral Darcy walked into the kitchen and found Grandma Tessa sitting alone at the kitchen table. It was so strange to see the tiny woman simply sitting. Grandma Tessa was always on the move\u2014carrying, chopping, stirring, serving.</p><p>When she saw Darcy, she stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly lunchtime,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI\u2019ll fix you something.\u201d</p><p>Darcy knew the whole \u201cfood is love\u201d talk. She\u2019d given it to Joe more than once. But just this once she couldn\u2019t listen to her own advice.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said gently, pushing Tessa back in her chair. \u201cLet me bring you something.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Tessa\u2019s eyes, although she did her best to blink them away. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Darcy. It\u2019s been a blessing to have you here.\u201d She fingered the rosary beads on the table in front of her. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not hungry. I know I have to eat, but not yet. I miss him too much.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sank down next to her and took her free hand. \u201cI know. You\u2019ve loved him a whole lifetime. It\u2019s only been a few days. You\u2019re allowed to grieve.\u201d</p><p>Tessa nodded and squeezed her fingers. \u201cI keep expecting to see him walk into the room. I can\u2019t sleep. The bed, it\u2019s so big. When did it get so big?\u201d</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Darcy hugged her. Tessa held on tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the girls all gone, the house is so quiet. You bring us life again.\u201d</p><p>Darcy thought that might be an exaggeration, but she knew having people around gave Tessa something to think about other than her sadness. She wished she had something to say, something that would help ease the other woman\u2019s pain. But there weren\u2019t any words.</p><p>So they sat together, hugging and rocking, not speaking. Darcy breathed in the scent of spices and rose soap and did her best to be strong.</p><p>The back door opened. She glanced up, hoping to see Joe. He\u2019d been busy with family stuff for the past couple of days, and they hadn\u2019t had any time alone. But instead of him, Paige walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI have news,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tessa straightened and turned. \u201cPaige. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Paige walked to the older woman and crouched in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop feeding me,\u201d she teased. \u201cI\u2019ve gained twenty pounds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tessa cupped her face. \u201cMaybe, but on you they\u2019re beautiful pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what my supervisor\u2019s going to say after my next physical.\u201d She straightened and glanced at Darcy. \u201cThey\u2019ve caught the last of the kidnappers. Your father will be calling in the next minute or so. The call will be put through here.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wondered if she looked as surprised as she felt. Caught? \u201cAlready?\u201d</p> <p>Paige smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s been nearly four weeks. But the ringleaders had gone pretty far underground.\u201d</p><p>Tessa stood and patted her hair. \u201cThe president?\u201d she asked, sounding stunned. \u201cPhoning here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look fine,\u201d Paige said with a grin.</p><p>Darcy tried to enjoy the humor of Tessa worried about her appearance for a phone call that wasn\u2019t for her, but she could only deal with her rising panic.</p><p>No! It couldn\u2019t be true. If the men were caught then she was free to leave. Actually, she had to leave. The Marcellis would want their house back.</p> <p>But she wasn\u2019t ready. She and Brenna hadn\u2019t finalized the label designs, and the family was still in mourning, and what about Joe? They had to talk and she had to tell him that she....</p><p>The phone rang. Paige reached for it.</p><p>\u201cAgent Newberry,\u201d she said crisply, then nodded at Darcy. \u201cYes. She\u2019s right here.\u201d She held out the phone.</p><p>Darcy took it. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease hold for the president,\u201d a female voice said as Paige left the kitchen.</p><p>Darcy waited a second, then heard, \u201cDarcy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood news all-around. The last of them was rounded up this morning.\u201d He laughed gruffly. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep better at night knowing my girls are safe now.\u201d</p><p>Two months ago Darcy would have dismissed the statement or at least reinterpreted it to mean he was glad Lauren was safe. Now she wasn\u2019t so sure. Maybe he meant it. Maybe she did matter to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to your sister,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe mentioned you\u2019d like to get more involved with things here at the White House.\u201d</p><p>Darcy winced. That wasn\u2019t exactly what she\u2019d said. \u201cI thought it would be nice to do more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, sounding as if he meant it. \u201cI always knew your space was important to you.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cDo you young people still talk about having your own space?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cNot really. But I know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. When you come home, we can talk. I\u2019d like to have you around more, Darcy. You\u2019re very important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She shifted awkwardly. \u201cUm, you, too,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I have to run. Let me know your travel plans. I can have a plane pick you up whenever you\u2019d like. Maybe in the morning?\u201d</p><p>So soon? She wasn\u2019t ready to go. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know, Dad. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead. Darcy handed the phone back to Paige. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to have me home.\u201d</p><p>Grandma Tessa stared at her. \u201cOf course you want to go be with your family,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. Tears burned, but she refused to give in to them. It wasn\u2019t right. \u201cYou\u2019ve all been very kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind.\u201d Tessa dismissed the word. \u201cWe like having you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve liked being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have things to do, yes? A life?\u201d Tessa asked.</p><p>Darcy shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>The old woman took her hand. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything special waiting, you could stay a few days. Maybe a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wanted to so much it hurt. \u201cBut I\u2019m an intrusion. I have a Secret Service team. Less now, but at least two agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d Tessa squeezed her fingers. \u201cSay you\u2019ll stay. We want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Marco and Colleen may not be happy about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cI know my own children.\u201d</p><p>Just then Joe walked into the kitchen. Tessa turned to him. \u201cTell her to stay.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve found the rest of the kidnappers,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cYour assignment is over.\u201d</p><p>The second she said the words, horror washed over her. Of course. Joe was only here because of her. Now he was free to return to the naval base and continue his regular life. The one that didn\u2019t include her.</p><p>\u201cBut she should stay,\u201d Tessa said. \u201cTell her. A few weeks. For the harvest and the first pressing. To bring life to this house. For you, Joe. She can stay for you.\u201d</p><p>Darcy braced herself to hear that he was leaving as well. Emotions crossed his face, but they went so quickly, she couldn\u2019t read them.</p><p>Tessa\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re not going, are you?\u201d she asked, sounding frightened. \u201cJoseph, your family needs you.\u201d</p><p>Time stood still until Joe nodded. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll ask for compassionate leave and I\u2019ll stay a few more weeks.\u201d He looked at Darcy. \u201cYou should stay, too. Unless you have something else you should be doing.\u201d</p><p>That would mean having an actual life, which she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll both stay.\u201d</p><p>Four simple words. They shouldn\u2019t have given her heart wings, and yet they had.</p><p>17</p><p>\u201cY ou\u2019ll be leaving soon,\u201d Paige said. \u201cThat must make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Alex shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind the assignment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not very high profile. When you get back to D.C. maybe you can get assigned to the president.\u201d</p><p>He had the feeling she was talking about something other than the topic at hand, but then conversations with Paige were always filled with undercurrents.</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed the opportunity to protect Darcy,\u201d he said carefully, wondering why he cared about Paige\u2019s opinion on anything. She was the one who\u2019d pointed out the unfairness of his attitude\u2014that if they got married, she would be the one to give up her job, not him. While he understood her intellectual argument, he resented the implication that he was the jerk in all this. Even if maybe he was.</p><p>Not that he gave a damn. Whatever they\u2019d had was long over. They\u2019d each gone their separate ways, and they would again.</p><p>\u201cHey, guys.\u201d</p><p>Alex turned and saw Darcy standing at the entrance to the guesthouse. \u201cYou heard the good news?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout the kidnappers? Yes, Paige told me.\u201d Darcy smiled at her. \u201cI wanted to let you know, I\u2019m not leaving here. Not just yet. There\u2019s so much going on, and well, Tessa asked me to stay and I said yes. I\u2019m thinking for maybe two weeks. I don\u2019t know who my regular detail will be, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d Paige told her. \u201cI\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Darcy waved and left.</p><p>Paige watched her go. \u201cShe\u2019s changed,\u201d she said, more to herself than him. \u201cShe used to be distant and sarcastic. Now she is warmer. Happier. I\u2019m not sure how much of it is Joe and how much of it is the family, but I\u2019m thrilled for her.\u201d She turned to Alex. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, here. With Darcy. I\u2019d like to be assigned to her. With the threat gone, she\u2019ll go back to a normal-size team. I want to be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought they would both return to Washington. He\u2019d thought they would have a long plane ride to discuss what she\u2019d said to him about this not being a game.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it?\u201d he asked, angry but not sure why.</p><p>\u201cWhat else is there?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou want your high-powered career. You want to be the best agent ever, to be alone. I don\u2019t want that anymore. Oh, I want to do a good job, but I want a life, too. I want people around me I love.\u201d</p><p>Not him. She didn\u2019t want him. Which was fine. The hell with her.</p><p>Joe had claimed the library as his office. He didn\u2019t want to work in the winery, and there weren\u2019t any other rooms that had desks and file cabinets.</p><p>Over the past couple of weeks, he\u2019d settled into a rhythm of dealing with winery business in the morning and Lorenzo\u2019s personal papers in the afternoon. The will reading was at the end of the week. That was his cutoff date, he told himself. The Monday after the will was read, he was out of here.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t told anyone yet, although he didn\u2019t know why he was putting it off. No one would be surprised. The family understood his stay was only temporary.</p><p>Only they weren\u2019t acting like it. Assumptions had been made, and he needed to make sure they got unmade.</p><p>Darcy walked into the office, took one look at him, and collapsed into a chair. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re looking fierce about something. Are you planning a revolt?\u201d</p><p>As always, the sight of her eased the band of tension around his chest. Her easy smile welcomed him, and the sway of her body made him think of hot nights\u2014an excellent distraction. She was the one person here who didn\u2019t want something from him.</p><p>\u201cNot a revolt, an escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing anywhere interesting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided. You want to pick?\u201d</p><p>She wore a short black and white skirt and a black sleeveless top. Her time here had added color to her skin and while she was still too skinny by far, there was a bit more meat on her bones.</p><p>He liked the changes. He liked her\u2014which confused him, but in a good way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Hawaii,\u201d she said. \u201cLiving on the East Coast, our escape for sun and sand is usually Florida or the Caribbean. But Hawaii sounds really nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a couple of places. Quiet. Secluded. You could go naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d She glanced over her shoulder toward the closed library door. \u201cYou have a family of lurkers. I love them to pieces, but they don\u2019t grasp the concept of privacy.\u201d</p><p>She was cute when she blushed, cuter still in his bed. They hadn\u2019t had much opportunity to make love. Not with so many people in and out of the house. But soon, he promised himself. Soon.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d she asked in an obvious attempt to change the subject.</p><p>He decided to go along with it. \u201cNot bad. Running a winery is a lot of work. Sometimes I can feel the walls closing in.\u201d</p><p>Her concern turned sympathetic. \u201cYour family is dependent on you in a way they\u2019ve never been before.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat makes you feel funny,\u201d she said. \u201cYou thought it would be different. That they were strong on their own. But things aren\u2019t always as they seem.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. There was something in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about the Marcellis, are we?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI was thinking about my situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My father. He\u2019s...\u201d She looked out the window. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt a part of his life for a long time. I thought he didn\u2019t care about me, but now I wonder if that was just an excuse for me to stay mad and not try.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what they were talking about but knew Darcy would explain further if she wanted him to know.</p><p>She returned her attention to him. \u201cAs a naval officer, are you legally and morally obligated to keep the president\u2019s secrets?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen that coming. \u201cYes. I have top secret clearance. I\u2019m a good security risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be better than good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to be....\u201d She swallowed. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was serious. Joe leaned forward. \u201cI give you my word, Darcy. But if you\u2019re not sure, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI appreciate that. But I want to talk about it. I never have. Not even with Lauren. Oh, I know she knows, but we never discuss it. It\u2019s our elephant on the table. The one we all carefully ignore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>He stood and crossed the library, where he carefully locked the door. Then he returned to the desk, but this time he sat on her side of it, in the chair closest to hers. He took her hand and laced their fingers together.</p><p>She glanced from the door to him. \u201cGee, no pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014don\u2019t tell me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t even know where to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about with \u2018It was a dark and stormy night.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She burst out laughing, then leaned toward him and kissed him.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I feel better now.\u201d She laughed again. \u201cOkay, it was a dark and stormy night. My mom was dying. She\u2019d come home from the hospital because she wanted to die at home. I was sixteen, Lauren was seventeen. We were scared and waiting to hear she was gone. Lauren fell asleep, but I couldn\u2019t. I went downstairs\u2014a hospital room had been set up in the study of our house\u2014and I sat in the hallway. I don\u2019t know how long. It felt like hours. I remember it was so cold, but I didn\u2019t want to leave to go get a blanket or a sweater.\u201d</p><p>Joe had known that Darcy had lost her mother at an early age, but he hadn\u2019t known the details.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have anyone to sit with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cOther family members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. That night it was just me. Finally my dad came out. I could tell from the look on his face she was gone. I started to cry and go to him. He...\u201d She paused, then continued. \u201cHe pushed me away. I tried to cling to him, and he told me not to touch him. That I wasn\u2019t his daughter. He never wanted to see me again.\u201d</p><p>Joe hadn\u2019t had any idea what she\u2019d been going to tell him, but he hadn\u2019t expected this. Horror filled him, but nothing he felt could match the pain in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cWhat to think. I ran to my room. I was crying too hard to speak. Lauren woke up and she got that Mom was gone. We cried together.\u201d Darcy tightened her grip on his hand. \u201cLater my dad came to me. He said he was sorry about what he\u2019d done, what he\u2019d said. He told me it wasn\u2019t about me.\u201d</p><p>Joe moved his chair closer and wrapped his arm around her. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>She blinked away tears. \u201cI\u2019m kind of into it now, so you\u2019re going to have to hear the rest.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead and rubbed her back. \u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cHe told me that my mom had had an affair. She\u2019d met this bright young lawyer at some campaign event, and they\u2019d had a torrid affair. She\u2019d gotten pregnant and had been prepared to leave her husband and baby daughter, only the guy died. So she stayed and they patched up the marriage.\u201d</p><p>Darcy looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m the baby. The child of her lover. No one ever told me until that night. I never guessed. My dad\u2014the man who raised me, not my biological father\u2014never let on. Until the night she died, he loved Lauren and me exactly the same. Or at least he acted that way. But when my mom was dying, she called out for her lover. She died speaking his name. So that\u2019s what upset my dad\u2014so much. When I went to him, he was thinking of her and what she\u2019d done. That\u2019s why he was angry.\u201d</p><p>She brushed away tears. \u201cHe told me he was sorry and that I was still his daughter. He did everything he could to make it up to me. But I didn\u2019t believe him. I wasn\u2019t angry, exactly, but I was scared and hurt. I shut down. For weeks I wouldn\u2019t talk to him. At some point he told Lauren, but we never discussed it either. He kept reaching out to me, and I kept turning away. One day he stopped trying and when I was ready, I didn\u2019t know how to reach out to him. We sort of reached an impasse, which is where we\u2019ve stayed. And in the middle of that is Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this family crap. Now you know why I want out of here.\u201d</p> <p>She clutched his hand tighter. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. You have wonderful people here who love you. There is nothing more important than that in the world.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to have this conversation with her, but he knew she was vulnerable, and he didn\u2019t want to lash out at her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, determined not to get angry. \u201cIt\u2019s not forever. It\u2019s never forever. Why should I walk away from the work I do, the career I love, for this?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cWhat are you saying? The Marcellis will change their mind? They\u2019ll wake up one morning and decide they don\u2019t want you in the family?\u201d</p><p>He pulled free of her and stared out the window. \u201cThey already did that once.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cThe circumstances were completely different. You were a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and now I can fight back.\u201d</p><p>He felt her gaze on him. When he finally looked at her, pain darkened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about them, as much as it is about her,\u201d Darcy murmured. \u201cYour ex-wife. The one who left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. There was no point in rehashing that old news, yet he found himself starting to speak. \u201cI\u2019d been gone nearly five months. I\u2019d shipped out without warning. I couldn\u2019t get in touch with her while I was away. I got back after midnight. When I walked in the house, it was dark. It took me a minute to figure out it was mostly empty. She\u2019d gone a few weeks before. Moved out, took the kids. She left a note and the divorce papers on the kitchen counter.\u201d</p><p>Darcy made a noise low in her throat. He saw tears fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019d told her the life was rough. She didn\u2019t believe me until she lived it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d Darcy asked, her voice thick.</p><p>\u201cI called to let her know I\u2019d signed the papers and sent them back to the lawyer.\u201d He\u2019d wanted to ask about seeing the kids but had figured it would only make things harder for them. Still, he wished he could have let them know he missed them.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask her to come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If she\u2019d wanted to be with me, she would have stayed.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wiped her cheeks. \u201cMaybe she wanted to know she mattered. Maybe she was trying to get your attention.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cI\u2019d married her with the idea I\u2019d spend the rest of my life with her. How much more attention did she need?\u201d</p><p>His heart, Darcy thought, trying not to give in to the sobs rising inside of her. Joe told the story so casually, as if it had all happened to someone else. But she didn\u2019t believe that. She believed he\u2019d been blindsided. Oh, sure, he had a part in the divorce. It took two to screw up a marriage, but for him, this blow would wound deeper than most. Yet one more person had shown him that love wasn\u2019t something to be counted on.</p><p>He was trapped\u2014unable to give emotionally because he believed there was no point, and unable to learn otherwise because he wouldn\u2019t give.</p><p>She wanted to hold him and somehow convince him everything could be different. All he needed was a step of faith. But he was a powerful, capable man. What did he need with faith?</p><p>Which left her where? Falling in love with a man who could never love her back?</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with this?\u201d Lauren asked. \u201cI don\u2019t have to come visit.\u201d</p><p>Darcy rolled onto her back and stared at the ceiling. \u201cIt will be great to have you here,\u201d she said and nearly meant it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you\u2019ve made everyone sound so wonderful, and I\u2019m dying to meet Joe.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not going to do anything to get in the way of your relationship, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. So not your style.\u201d</p><p>Besides, Joe was avoiding everyone and since their conversation the previous day, they didn\u2019t seem to have much of a relationship.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Grandma Tessa know that it\u2019s for sure. She\u2019ll be beside herself. The president\u2019s daughters. She\u2019ll be cooking up a storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. See you Friday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, walked out of her room, and headed for the kitchen. Although she\u2019d already asked the Marcellis about Lauren coming for a couple of days, she wanted to let them know that it was for sure. And someone was always in the kitchen.</p><p>Grandma Tessa stood by the stove. She smiled when she saw Darcy. \u201cThere you are. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t wear most of my pants and shorts. I\u2019m barely squeezing into skirts I brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too skinny.\u201d</p><p>Darcy patted her stomach. \u201cNot for long.\u201d She cheered at the thought of Lauren packing on a few pounds. That was the one place where her sister had more of a problem. Then she scolded herself for being so shallow.</p><p>\u201cI talked to my sister. She\u2019ll be here Friday afternoon, after the reading of the will.\u201d</p><p>Tessa clapped her hands. \u201cGood. Good. We\u2019ll plan a special dinner, eh? I\u2019ll call Mary and have her come help. You can help with the menu. We\u2019ll have wine. Such fun. We can...\u201d She frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re not happy, Darcy. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Really. This is great.\u201d</p><p>The tiny woman walked over and put her hands on her hips. \u201cI\u2019ve had children in this house nearly all my life and I know when something\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Darcy figured she might be too old to be considered a child, but she was certainly acting like one. She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d She shifted her feet. \u201cThis is really stupid.\u201d Even more stupid when the first tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>Tessa led her to the table and motioned to a chair. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sank into the seat, then covered her face with her hands. \u201cI love it here,\u201d she said as the tears really let loose. \u201cYou\u2019ve all been so good to me, and I really love this family so much. But Lauren is really a much better person. She\u2019s nicer and prettier and more fun to be with. You\u2019re all going to like her better and Joe isn\u2019t talking to me and I\u2019m not going to have anyone and I found you guys first. Which makes me sound like a three-year-old. Plus, you\u2019re still mourning Lorenzo and me talking about something so selfish and stupid is really bad.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself for the scolding or at least a disapproving silence. Instead she heard a soft laugh. She looked at Tessa, who grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d the elderly woman asked.</p><p>\u201cAll? It\u2019s a ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Poor Darcy.\u201d Tessa wiped her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl. You try hard and you give with your whole heart. Of course we\u2019ll like you best. You\u2019re one of us now. Who is this Lauren anyway?\u201d</p><p>Darcy sniffed. \u201cShe\u2019s really great. Trust me. Everyone adores her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but she\u2019s not you, eh?\u201d</p><p>Because her life was one entertainment after the other, Joe chose that moment to walk into the kitchen. He took one look at her tear-stained face and started to back out. Tessa stopped him with a glance.</p><p>\u201cJoseph. Come here. Darcy is worried about her sister visiting. Tell her that she\u2019ll always be first in our hearts. And you should make up with her. She\u2019s a good girl. You\u2019re lucky to have her. But do you tell her? No.\u201d</p><p>Darcy winced. This was so not the way to win Joe\u2019s affections.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not surprisingly, Joe ducked out without speaking.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been doing a lot of that lately,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll come around,\u201d Tessa assured her.</p> <p>Darcy wanted to believe it was true, but she had her doubts. So far he\u2019d been doing a fabulous imitation of a man doing his best to bolt for freedom.</p><p>Paige considered the contents of the refrigerator, but it was really tough to get worked up about cooking when all she had to do was walk up to the main house and collect some of the best leftovers on the planet. She didn\u2019t know the secret ingredient Grandma Tessa and Grammy M put into their meals, but it was worth millions. Paige was willing to give up a large percent of her pension to get daily access to Grammy M\u2019s scones alone. And Tessa\u2019s marinara sauce was worthy of stardom.</p><p>There was, however, the calorie issue. She was already five pounds over her normal weight. So a salad for dinner made sense. The fact that there was an entire platter of chicken marsala with a side of grilled potatoes less than a hundred yards away was meaningless. Salad was the far healthier choice.</p><p>She closed the refrigerator and looked longingly at the door. Okay, principle over self-indulgence. Which would win? Alex walked into the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d he announced.</p><p>The unexpected statement left her blinking. She banished thoughts of flavorful chicken and considered his words.</p> <p>\u201cNot leaving here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m on the team. With you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. That begs the question of why. Isn\u2019t there something more important for you to be doing with your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not always interested in the high-profile cases,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m not in this for the glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but nobody even knows Darcy\u2019s here. The odds of something happening to her are pretty close to zero. So you\u2019re setting yourself up for some long days when nothing is going to happen. That isn\u2019t exactly your style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe my style is changing.\u201d</p> <p>Funny how she wanted to believe that. Being around Alex had a way of making her remember the past\u2014their past. But to what end?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking of leaving,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe agency. When Darcy returns to D.C. I\u2019m going to resign.\u201d</p><p>Nothing about his expression changed. She\u2019d thought he might be disappointed, but she was wrong. He wasn\u2019t anything.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, although she wasn\u2019t sure why he bothered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this before. I want a life. I want to belong to something other than my job. I want a personal worldview that doesn\u2019t include daily concerns that someone I care about is going to be shot or kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re leaving me again?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him. \u201cThis has nothing to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has everything to do with me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou told me not to play games, or start something I wasn\u2019t prepared to finish. I\u2019m going to tell you the same thing.\u201d</p><p>He left. Paige gave in to the inevitable and headed for the main house, where she would drown her confusion in sweet sauce and perfectly cooked chicken.</p><p>She and Alex seemed to have mastered the art of the cryptic conversation, which made for an entertaining afternoon but didn\u2019t really get them anywhere.</p><p>Did she want to change that? Did she want to talk to him about what was in her heart? Did she know what was in her heart? All those years ago, life had been both harder and easier. With her late husband, she\u2019d learned what loving someone really meant. She wanted that again. But did she want it with Alex, and if she did, was he willing to make the sacrifices love required?</p><p>The reading of the will took place in the living room. The family lawyer was a young woman of thirty or so, which surprised Joe. He\u2019d expected some old and dusty family retainer. Good to know that Lorenzo still had the power to shock him, even after he was gone.</p><p>The entire family gathered on sofas and chairs. As this was the Marcellis, there was plenty of food, although wine was noticeably absent.</p><p>Joe listened to the lawyer, who explained the nature of the will. There were several provisions for charities, a significant trust fund for Marco and Colleen and the great-grandchildren. But the biggie, the winery itself, was left for last.</p><p>The lawyer flipped the page and cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cMarcelli Wines,\u201d she read, \u201cis my pride and joy. Four generations have worked the land. Soon that will be five. It is my dearest wish that the winery go on forever. To ensure that, I leave it in capable hands. Hands I trust. I leave each of my granddaughters fifteen percent of the winery and to my grandson, Joseph Larson, I leave forty percent. The majority share.\u201d</p><p>18</p><p>A fter the reading of the will, Joe sat in the library until the lawyer and most of the family had filed out. Marco and Brenna stayed behind.</p><p>Joe took one look at their calm faces and said, \u201cYou knew.\u201d</p><p>Marco sat on the sofa across from Joe\u2019s chair and nodded. \u201cMy father told me what he wanted to do about a year ago. We discussed it and agreed it was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t know who the \u201cwe\u201d was in the conversation, nor did he care. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted you to be a part of the family,\u201d Marco said. \u201cHe wanted you to belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t force me to do this,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cWhat was he thinking of, leaving me the majority share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what he wanted. What we all want,\u201d Brenna said from her seat at the opposite end of the sofa. \u201cPartners, Joe. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run the winery,\u201d Joe told her. \u201cYou have for years. You should be in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d Brenna rubbed her stomach. \u201cBut Four Sisters winery is growing. That\u2019s going to take more and more of my time. Plus, honest to God, some of the choices Nic wants to make at Wild Sea. He needs me. You don\u2019t have to panic, Joe. We\u2019re going to hire a manager to run Marcelli until you learn what you need to and get your feet under you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re deciding for me? In case you\u2019ve forgotten, I have a career. One I\u2019ve worked for. One I want. Not here.\u201d</p><p>He stood and glared at them both. \u201cYou think you can finish what he started?\u201d he asked, furious with the change of events. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m leaving on Monday, and right now I have no plans to come back.\u201d</p><p>Brenna paled. Marco looked as if he\u2019d been shot. Before either could react, Darcy stepped into the library.</p><p>\u201cSorry to interrupt,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis is not the time,\u201d Joe told her, his voice cold.</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. \u201cAmazingly enough, everything isn\u2019t about you, Joe. As requested, I\u2019m letting Brenna and Marco know that my sister is due to arrive any second. And just in case it\u2019s of interest to you, your captain left a message to say he would be delighted to join us for dinner tonight and it\u2019s formal. So you\u2019ll need your dress whites.\u201d</p><p>He felt like a jerk. \u201cDarcy,\u201d he said as he reached for her.</p><p>She sidestepped him. \u201cI have to go see my sister.\u201d</p><p>Darcy headed for the kitchen. She appreciated that Joe was under a lot of strain, but she wanted to walk back to the library and smack him upside the head.</p><p>Katie had already told her what had happened when the will was read, so she knew he couldn\u2019t be happy about that. While she was willing to offer friendly support, she didn\u2019t appreciate him turning on her as though she was the enemy.</p><p>Mia and Ian were in the kitchen, while Grandma Tessa was nowhere to be seen. Had the ever chatty Ian driven away the matriarch of the family?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet your sister,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of pictures of her. She\u2019s really pretty. Is she that pretty in person? I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s really nice. Is she nice? I sent money to that children\u2019s charity she supports. Only a few dollars because I\u2019m a student, right? It\u2019s not like I have a ton of cash. But still, it was something.\u201d</p><p>Darcy walked to the coffeepot and tried to block out Ian\u2019s incessant conversation. Mia joined her.</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s a little hard to take,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m going to dump him as soon as we get back to D.C. He\u2019s starting to get on my nerves, too. It\u2019s just been nice to have him around, especially after Grandpa Lorenzo died, you know?\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. She heard a car pull up outside and hurried to the back door.</p><p>She walked out onto the back porch just as the rear door of the SUV opened. Lauren stepped out into the early afternoon light. Sunlight brightened her hair to the color of spun gold and made her features seem as if they\u2019d been touched with starlight. Her tailored cotton blouse topped a trim khaki skirt that showed off her voluptuous curves to perfection. Darcy tugged at her black dress and suddenly felt like a grandmother in mourning.</p><p>Lauren spotted her and grinned. Darcy smiled in return. As she took a step forward, she had a moment of complete clarity. It was what Oprah always called a light-bulb moment.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be Lauren. She\u2019d never actually envied her sister. She\u2019d envied what her sister had\u2014a life she adored, a great love, a close family. Darcy didn\u2019t want to be blond, she wanted connections. A sense of belonging.</p><p>The downside was falling for a man incapable of committing, but whose life was perfect?</p><p>Grandma Tessa hovered. There was no other word to describe the older woman\u2019s anxious, quivering movement as she motioned to the room in question.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d had more time,\u201d she murmured, gesturing to the floral wallpaper and fifteen-year-old rock star posters, \u201cwe could have decorated.\u201d</p><p>Lauren hugged the tiny woman. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely. Just like my room back in high school. You\u2019re so sweet to take me in on a moment\u2019s notice. I could have stayed at a hotel. This is such an inconvenience and I apologize. It\u2019s just I\u2019ve missed Darcy so much, and she\u2019s made all of you sound so wonderful that I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to crash the party. Is that horribly rude?\u201d</p><p>As Darcy watched, Tessa, Grammy M, and Colleen were completely charmed by Lauren.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have you here,\u201d Colleen said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis no trouble a\u2019tall,\u201d Grammy M assured her.</p><p>\u201cStay as long as you like,\u201d Grandma Tessa requested.</p><p>Lauren laughed. \u201cYou might want to be careful with invitations like that. What if I never want to leave?\u201d</p><p>Being who they were, and Lauren who she was, the Marcelli women only looked delighted at the prospect.</p><p>Her sister was gracious, Darcy thought. She wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d been born that way or had developed the skill over time, but it was something she was going to have to cultivate. It seemed to smooth over rough patches. There were other changes she could make, she thought. She could get more involved in her father\u2019s life. Go to the White House more. Her stubbornness was costing her a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>That decided, she completed the tour of the amenities, showing Lauren the bathroom across the hall.</p><p>\u201cAt least we won\u2019t be sharing,\u201d Mia said as she raced up the stairs with one of Lauren\u2019s small suitcases. \u201cGood thing. I\u2019m not too bad, but Ian hogs the mirror for hours.\u201d</p><p>Lauren looked at her and smiled. \u201cMia, right? All these names. I\u2019ll never get them straight.\u201d</p><p>Mia set down the suitcase. \u201cOh, I\u2019m easy to remember. I\u2019m the fun sister. And the only one who isn\u2019t married.\u201d She frowned. \u201cHow on earth did that happen? Oh, yeah. Right. Didn\u2019t want to be tied down.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and Lauren laughed. Colleen welcomed her again, then ushered the Grands away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you girls help Lauren unpack. Don\u2019t forget dinner tonight is formal. Mia, you know what that means.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, Mom. I\u2019ll tone down the makeup and wear something nice. And I\u2019ll be polite to Joe\u2019s captain.\u201d She watched as her mother went down the stairs with the Grands, then leaned in close.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll ask about the sexy SEALs. I tease Joe about it all the time and it makes him crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you tease him?\u201d Lauren asked.</p> <p>\u201cPretending I want to sleep with them all.\u201d</p><p>Darcy eyed her. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of a pretense.\u201d</p><p>Mia grinned. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>They returned to Lauren\u2019s temporary quarters. Lauren closed the door, put her hands on her hips, and shook her head. \u201cDo you have to always wear black?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Darcy laughed, then hugged her. \u201cI missed you, too.\u201d</p> <p>Mia looked between them. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Darcy is always in black. I never noticed before. It\u2019s very city chic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hear that?\u201d Darcy asked. \u201cI\u2019m chic, and you\u2019re an Easter egg.\u201d</p><p>Mia flopped down on one of the beds. \u201cHey, don\u2019t pull me into a family argument. Lauren looks fabulous, too. But in a different way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m much more wholesome,\u201d Lauren said primly. She picked up one of her suitcases and put it on the other bed. \u201cAnd I wear colors.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked at the pile of luggage. \u201cDo you have a maid or something to take care of your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just me. Well, back home there is a full laundry and dry cleaning service, so I don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p> <p>Mia sat up. \u201cYou mean back home at the White House.\u201d</p><p>Darcy sat next to her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re starstruck. I figured you were too cool for that.\u201d</p><p>Mia laughed. \u201cI only pretend to be cool. I\u2019ve never known anyone who\u2019s been related to a president before I met you two.\u201d She leaned toward Lauren. \u201cSo tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Darcy bumped her shoulder against Mia\u2019s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me questions about the White House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Mia looked at her. \u201cI guess I just think of you as one of us.\u201d</p><p>Darcy felt her whole body relax as Mia\u2019s words sank in. It was about the nicest thing anyone had ever said to her.</p><p>Mia squinted at Lauren. \u201cI see the resemblance a little, but you guys are pretty different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren\u2019s the beauty,\u201d Darcy said easily.</p> <p>Lauren threw a pair of socks at her. \u201cYou\u2019re very attractive.\u201d</p><p>Mia glanced between them. \u201cLauren\u2019s the classic beauty,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cbut Darcy has the face you can\u2019t look away from. At least my brother can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Darcy rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you start with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can if I want to.\u201d She leaned toward Lauren. \u201cThey\u2019re having sex. We all know about it, but we\u2019re pretending we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Darcy groaned. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Lauren asked. \u201cI already know you have sex with him. Although she won\u2019t give me details. I hate that. I want specifics.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cNormally I would, too, but he\u2019s my brother. He\u2019s going to look gorgeous tonight,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019ll both have to control yourselves.\u201d</p><p>Lauren hung up yet another pastel-colored skirt. \u201cBecause of the formal dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDress whites,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll all have to look nice,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cSo he can be impressed, too.\u201d</p><p>19</p><p>J oe was downstairs fifteen minutes before his captain was due to arrive. As per his custom, Owen Phillips was ten minutes early. Joe stood at attention by the house and waited until Phillips stepped out of his fully restored \u201968 Mustang and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Joe said, saluting.</p><p>Phillips returned the salute, then said, \u201cGood to see you, Joe. Sorry about your grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>His captain smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a family dinner. I think we should ease off on the formalities.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded, thinking if they weren\u2019t standing on ceremony then why were they both wearing ice cream suits.</p><p>\u201cGreat place,\u201d Phillips said as he looked around at the vineyard. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed this part of the state. Very pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ah, it is. The vineyards do well. We\u2019ll be having Marcelli wine with dinner.\u201d</p><p>Phillips looked at him. \u201cYou told me you\u2019ll be back on base on Monday. It\u2019s only been a couple of weeks since your grandfather died. You\u2019re welcome to take more leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that, but I\u2019m ready to get back to work. My team needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe admiral has cooled down enough that you should be safe to return to duty, but I have to tell you. If I had a home like this, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be so quick to leave it. A man could search all over the world and never find anything quite like this.\u201d</p><p>Before Joe could respond, the back door opened and the Grands hurried down the stairs. For two old ladies, they sure moved fast.</p><p>\u201cWe heard the car,\u201d Grammy M said, beaming at the captain. \u201cWe were thinkin\u2019 it was your friend.\u201d</p><p>Joe winced. \u201cCaptain Phillips, may I present the matriarchs of my family? This is Tessa Marcelli and Mary-Margaret O\u2019Shea. Better known as Grandma Tessa and Grammy M.\u201d</p><p>Phillips nodded at them both, then took Tessa\u2019s small hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your loss,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not imposing too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Tessa told him. \u201cWe invited you so we could meet you. Besides, I like the company.\u201d Then, before Joe could warn the other man or stop her, Tessa reached up and pinched Phillips\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a handsome one. Married, I suppose?\u201d</p><p>Phillips looked stunned. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Nearly twenty years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. You\u2019re too old for Mia.\u201d</p><p>Grammy M stepped forward and managed something that looked suspiciously like a curtsey. \u201cWe\u2019re all so happy to be havin\u2019 a friend of Joe\u2019s here. You work with him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes.\u201d The captain still seemed shell-shocked.</p><p>Colleen and Marco came out next. \u201cWe heard you were here,\u201d Colleen said as she smoothed the front of her silk dress. \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for trying to get you in the door before you meet everyone,\u201d Joe told his commanding officer. \u201cI did warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Phillips grinned. \u201cI\u2019m liking them.\u201d</p><p>Joe looked at the couple and opened his mouth to introduce them. \u201cMarco and Colleen Marcelli,\u201d he said. Then without planning the words in advance, he added, \u201cMy parents.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence. The Grands, Colleen, and Marco turned to stare at him. Colleen recovered first.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long drive, Captain. Thank you so much for making it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Colleen.\u201d</p><p>He shook her hand. \u201cAnd you must call me Owen. All of you.\u201d He glanced at Joe. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>Joe grinned. \u201cYes, sir. Understood.\u201d</p><p>Joe finally got everyone in the house. Katie, Zach, and Valerie were in Los Angeles, but the rest of the family had come for dinner. He made introductions, then realized not everyone was there.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Darcy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWith her sister,\u201d Mia said smugly. \u201cThey were trying to figure out what to wear. It could be hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d Colleen said, chiding her youngest. \u201cDarcy is always on time.\u201d She smiled at Owen. \u201cVery polite and simply charming. I\u2019ll admit we were a little nervous about hosting a daughter of the president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much like royalty,\u201d Mia joked.</p><p>\u201cActually, that\u2019s true,\u201d Colleen said. \u201cBut she\u2019s been a delight. We\u2019ll all be sorry to see her go.\u201d</p><p>Mia jabbed Joe in the ribs. \u201cYou could do something about that.\u201d</p><p>Before he could tell her to shut up, he heard something on the stairs and glanced up. Darcy and the sister he\u2019d yet to meet started down the stairs. He had a vague impression of long blond hair and curves, but neither interested him. Instead he couldn\u2019t stop staring at Darcy.</p><p>She wore a long, silky-looking dress in a pale peach color. The cut or style or something emphasized her slender body in a way that got his blood boiling. Thin straps were all that held it up, he thought, knowing he could make quick work of them.</p><p>Her large eyes seemed to glow and her mouth was soft and pouty-looking. Pearl earrings hung nearly to her bare shoulders, while a twisted strand hugged her neck.</p><p>She was beautiful. More than beautiful\u2014she was spectacular. Feminine, sexy as hell, and if he remembered correctly, he\u2019d spent the last few days acting like a complete idiot around her.</p><p>Colleen moved toward the two women. \u201cYou\u2019re both so lovely,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cAllow me to present our dinner guest. Captain Owen Phillips. Captain, this is Darcy Jensen and Lauren Jensen-Smith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Darcy said as she shook his hand.</p><p>Lauren did the same and pleasantries were exchanged. Colleen ushered everyone into the living room for a predinner drink, but Joe lingered in the hallway. He touched Darcy\u2019s arm before she could follow the family.</p><p>\u201cYou look great,\u201d he said, when they were alone.</p><p>She gave him a once-over, then shrugged. \u201cNot bad, yourself. I always did like dress whites.\u201d</p><p>Emotions swelled up inside him. The sensations were unfamiliar and uncomfortable and all unnamed. But they made him want to say something, do something.</p><p>\u201cDarcy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019 through,\u201d Grammy M said as she walked toward them with a tray of appetizers. \u201cHot food here.\u201d</p><p>Joe moved to one side and let his grandmother pass. He tried to think of what to say when Marco came out of the living room.</p><p>\u201cYour captain wants to start with our wines.\u201d He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long night. Good thing we booked him a room at the hotel down the road.\u201d</p><p>When Marco had passed, Darcy touched his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she told him. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>An interesting concept, when he didn\u2019t understand himself.</p><p>\u201cNow will you believe me?\u201d Lauren asked sometime close to midnight as she sprawled across Darcy\u2019s bed. \u201cI swear, Joe looked like something out of a cartoon the way his mouth dropped open when he saw you. I thought he was going to dislocate his jaw or something.\u201d</p><p>Darcy curled up in a chair in the corner of the room. She\u2019d traded in the dress she\u2019d borrowed from her sister for shorts and a T-shirt, but she could still remember the sensual feel of the silk on her body and the stunned appreciation in Joe\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty surprised.\u201d</p><p>Lauren grinned. \u201cColor is our friend. When we go home, I want to go shopping with you and you\u2019re not allowed to buy anything black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for lingerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Yeah, that can be black, but nothing else.\u201d Lauren sat up and faced her. \u201cHe\u2019s really great. I can see the appeal. And when you look at him, there are stars in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething. You\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>Darcy nodded. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does. You\u2019ve never been in love before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy track record with men isn\u2019t the greatest, and I don\u2019t think this time is going to work out any better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lauren shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Joe couldn\u2019t stop looking at you all through dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and it was really cool, but how much does that mean? He finds me attractive, and okay, the sex is hot, but that\u2019s not a real relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad start.\u201d</p> <p>Darcy wished that were true. \u201cHe\u2019s not like other guys. He holds back. No one touches his heart. He let his wife go without a word. It\u2019s been three years and he\u2019s still resisting the Marcellis. How long will he resist me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he won\u2019t. Maybe he\u2019s starting to get it.\u201d</p><p>Darcy wished that were true, but she didn\u2019t have any evidence to back it up. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. Strong and loyal. I\u2019d trust him with my life and even my heart, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested in either. I\u2019ve learned so much being here. About myself and life and people. I\u2019ll be okay when it\u2019s time to leave. I\u2019ll...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvive?\u201d Lauren asked, her face serious, but her eyes bright with humor.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare disco me. Yes. I\u2019ll survive. Better than that. I want to get closer to you and Dad. I want to come to the White House and find a charity I can support and get involved in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell him how you feel?\u201d Lauren asked. \u201cBefore you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide. It\u2019s not that I want to keep the truth from him, it\u2019s that I\u2019m not sure letting him know how I feel is very kind. I don\u2019t think he can take one more person wanting him to love her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree. He seems like a pretty tough guy.\u201d</p><p>Someone knocked on the door.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d Lauren said as she stood and crossed the room.</p><p>She pulled open the door, and Darcy saw Joe standing there. He looked between the women.</p><p>Before he could speak, Lauren grinned and stepped into the hallway. \u201cI was just leaving. You kids have a good time. Don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201d</p><p>With that, she was gone.</p><p>Joe hovered awkwardly in the hallway. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to leave,\u201d he said.</p><p>Darcy laughed. \u201cOkay. That could make things interesting.\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. \u201cI meant I didn\u2019t want to run her off.\u201d</p><p>He stood in the center of the room and stared at her. There was a sadness in his eyes she hadn\u2019t seen before. She rose and faced him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d He took a step toward her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been difficult and a jerk. Whatever I have going on isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019ve always been good at moving on. At taking the next assignment. I don\u2019t know what to do. But I do know that this is the only place where I can draw a breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy room?\u201d she asked, surprised it was anything close to a haven for him. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if your family won\u2019t think to look for you here.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her and pulled her close. \u201cNot your room. Being with you. It doesn\u2019t matter where.\u201d</p><p>Alex paced outside the guesthouse. The night was clear and cool. There was a forecast of rain, but he didn\u2019t believe it. Not that it mattered one way or the other. Rain, snow, sleet, weather wasn\u2019t his problem. Paige was.</p><p>He didn\u2019t understand her. He\u2019d stayed because...because. He swore. He didn\u2019t know why. Because leaving hadn\u2019t felt right. Because they\u2019d had unfinished business. Or so he\u2019d thought. But in the past couple of days, she\u2019d acted as if he didn\u2019t exist. Or matter. If he lived to be a thousand he would never understand women. Why did they have to be so damn complicated?</p><p>He turned and stared at the front door. He could talk to her. That was something women really seemed to like. Talking. Endless talking.</p><p>But about what? She was going to want to ask a bunch of questions, and he didn\u2019t have the answers. She was like that. Tricky. Sly. Beautiful.</p><p>He stared up at the stars and thought about how she moved and the sound of her laughter. That in all the years they\u2019d been apart, he\u2019d never forgotten her or wanted anyone the way he\u2019d wanted her.</p><p>Alex swore under his breath and walked into the guesthouse. He headed directly for Paige\u2019s bedroom and opened the door without knocking.</p><p>She lay on her bed, reading. Her hair was mussed, her face free of makeup. The tank top she wore over pj bottoms looked thin and worn. Not the least bit sexy\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop him from wanting her.</p><p>They stared at each other. Neither spoke. Paige put down her book, then slid down on the bed and smiled.</p><p>That\u2019s all it took. One smile.</p><p>Even as he jerked off his T-shirt, he moved toward her. He reached for her as she reached for him, and then he was in her arms. She felt soft and feminine and so familiar that he ached inside. Their mouths locked in a deep, hungry kiss. It had been so long, he thought as need rocketed through him. Too long.</p><p>Even as their tongues tangled and brushed and circled, they tore at each other\u2019s clothes. He needed her naked\u2014he had to touch her or die.</p><p>There were no gentle preliminaries, no murmured words, no light touches. Just reaching and getting naked and kissing. And then she was on her back and he was between her legs. She stared at him, her green eyes dark with passion.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he told her, right before he claimed her.</p><p>Tessa sat alone in the dark. Her room was quiet, even with the window open. Moonlight allowed her to see the vineyard and nearly to the ocean. Hints of salt air mingled with the heavy fragrance of the ripening grapes.</p><p>The chardonnay harvest had begun. Soon the machinery in the pressing room would clank to life, and the cycle would begin again.</p><p>Across from her chair stood the big, empty bed where she and Lorenzo had slept for so many years. She\u2019d avoided it, spending her nights dozing in her chair. But tonight she felt differently. More at peace.</p><p>\u201cAre you here?\u201d she asked the quiet darkness. \u201cLorenzo?\u201d</p><p>As she asked the question, she smiled. Even if her husband could reach her from the great beyond, he was just stubborn enough to refuse to speak to her.</p><p>\u201cI miss you, Lorenzo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Tessa stood and made her way to the bed. As she lay down on the cool sheets, she waited for the knot of fear and panic that had driven her from this bed the first night after he died. It didn\u2019t come. Instead she felt somehow safe and comforted. And a slight dipping of the mattress, as if someone had joined her.</p><p>No one had, of course. When she turned to look, she was still alone. But not so lonely anymore.</p><p>Four hours later, Darcy was asleep, but Joe couldn\u2019t relax enough to stay in bed. He dressed and quietly left her room. Instead of returning to his own, he walked out of the house and into the night.</p><p>The sky was clear, the moon nearly full. He walked into the vineyards, brushing against the heavy grapes.</p><p>The leaves were dry from lack of rain, but dry, warm conditions were supposed to be good for harvesting. Or was it less sun and no\u2014</p><p>He shook his head. None of it mattered, he told himself. He was leaving on Monday and he wasn\u2019t coming back for a long time. He had SEAL teams to get ready. Plans had to be made, training implemented. There was a whole world outside of the vineyard, and he intended to be a part of it.</p><p>\u201cAnywhere but here,\u201d he murmured into the night.</p><p>But even as he spoke the words, he felt a heavy weight on his shoulders. Brenna\u2019s baby was due anytime now. How would she hire a manager before she gave birth? What about Marco and Colleen? They were sticking around to help when they really wanted to be on the road, selling the wines. There was the harvest, the pressing, the bottling. So many responsibilities and he\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he roared, glaring up at the heavens. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you are, Lorenzo, but you couldn\u2019t make me care before and you can\u2019t make me care now. I\u2019m not staying. This isn\u2019t where I belong. I\u2019ve never belonged here. I don\u2019t blame you for this\u2014it\u2019s simply the truth. Not here.\u201d</p><p>His words drifted into the night. There was no response, and he felt a little foolish after his outburst. Yelling at ghosts wasn\u2019t going to accomplish anything.</p><p>He turned to walk back to the house, only to pause. There was something...</p><p>He inhaled deeply and realized what it was.</p><p>Smoke.</p><p>20</p><p>D arcy woke to a loud shrieking sound she couldn\u2019t place. Joe wasn\u2019t in her bed and there was no way the alarm signaled good news.</p><p>She\u2019d barely thrown back the covers when Mia burst into her room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fire,\u201d Mia yelled. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire in the vineyards.\u201d</p><p>Fire? How could that happen? Sure it had been dry, but what on earth could start a fire in the middle of grapevines?</p><p>Rather than consider an answer, she grabbed clothes and pulled them on. Lauren ran into her room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d her sister asked.</p><p>\u201cA fire in the vineyard. Get dressed. We\u2019ll go downstairs and see if we can help.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of a couple of minutes, everyone had assembled in the kitchen. The emergency siren had been turned off, but there was still a sense of urgency.</p><p>Grandma Tessa was already making coffee. Joe paced back and forth, talking to Marco in a low voice and making notes on a pad of paper. Marco left the kitchen and Joe glanced at everyone else.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fire in the east field. I can\u2019t tell how big it is, but it\u2019s spreading fast. Everything is just dry enough to burn. The fire department is on its way. They\u2019re sending three companies, and at dawn we\u2019ll get air support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Brenna?\u201d Darcy asked. \u201cShe\u2019ll want to know.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken with Nic, and they\u2019re on their way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fire,\u201d Ian said. \u201cWow. Do you know how it started? There hasn\u2019t been any lightning, has there? I didn\u2019t think you got a lot of lightning in this part of the country. Maybe some homeless guy smoking or something. Could a match have started the fire? Or a downed electrical wire. Only why would it be down. There are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Joe, Colleen, Marco, and Mia all turned to Ian.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d they said together.</p><p>Ian took a step back. \u201cSorry. I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp silently,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>The back door opened and Alex and Paige raced inside. \u201cYou know about the fire, right?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. Marco returned. He had several rolled sheets of paper in his hands.</p><p>\u201cMaps,\u201d Joe said. \u201cWe need to help the fire department find the best places to fight the fire.\u201d</p><p>Marco spread out the large maps on the kitchen table, anchoring the edges with salt and pepper shakers and a bowl of sugar.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the house,\u201d the elder Marcelli said. \u201cHere\u2019s the east field.\u201d</p><p>Everyone gathered around the table.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a service road,\u201d Joe said, tracing a dark line on the map. \u201cWhere are the water connections?\u201d</p><p>Marco pointed to several triangular icons. \u201cThese show them. The trucks can hook up directly to our main water supply.\u201d</p><p>Joe straightened and counted heads. \u201cWe\u2019ll split up into teams and take maps with us. Tessa, I\u2019ll tell you where to send Nic when he arrives. You\u2019ll stay here with Brenna, Lauren, and Darcy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not staying,\u201d Darcy told him. \u201cAnd before you start arguing, I\u2019ve spent the last five weeks walking all over this vineyard. I know it better than you do. I know what the water stations look like. I\u2019m going to help.\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze locked with hers, then he nodded once. \u201cAlex, you\u2019re with Darcy. Mia and Ian, as well. I want this fire stopped, but even more than that, I want Darcy kept safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat goes for everyone,\u201d he added, before she could wonder if his concern was about her, Darcy, the woman he shared a bed with, or her, Darcy, the president\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cI know the vineyard is important, but it\u2019s just grapes. They can be replanted, but none of you can be. Stay safe and think before you do anything rash. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p> <p>Sirens could be heard in the distance. A car pulled up and squealed to a stop.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get ready,\u201d Joe said.</p><p>The next fifteen minutes passed in a blur. Brenna was helped inside where Grandma Tessa did her best to keep her calm. The various teams went out to join the firefighters, which was how Darcy found herself seated in a large truck, staring at a map by flashlight and calling out when she thought they were close to a water connection.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here,\u201d she said, looking up and pointing.</p><p>The truck stopped on the service road. She waited for the firefighters to scramble out, then she eased to the ground and got her first good look at the fire.</p> <p>It stretched across what looked like miles. Bright, hot flames consumed the vines much more quickly than she could have imagined. Every now and then a column rose to salute the sky, as if in victory.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Darcy murmured, even as she inhaled the sharp scent of scorched grapes and burned leaves.</p><p>The firefighters went to work with their hoses. Darcy circled around the back of the truck and found Mia.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go locate the next water station,\u201d Darcy said. \u201cFor the next truck. It shouldn\u2019t be that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead on,\u201d Mia told her. \u201cAlex, we\u2019re going up to find the next water connection.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and joined them. In the distance Darcy saw another truck pull up. Several people climbed out. She thought she saw Joe, but in the swirling smoke, it was hard to be sure. Still, her heart jumped a little, as if it recognized its one true love.</p> <p>And then she knew she had to tell him the truth. She couldn\u2019t leave without admitting she loved him. To do so would be to dishonor the connection she felt with him.</p><p>But first, there was a fire to fight and a vineyard to save.</p><p>For a Navy SEAL, water was a safe haven. Joe didn\u2019t like this new enemy that consumed without conscience. The flames grew and stretched and took. It didn\u2019t seem to matter how much water they sprayed, the fire lived on.</p><p>He stayed close to the fire chief, giving information when he could and helping with hoses. As he worked, he eyed the sky. How long until dawn? How long until the air support could join them?</p><p>Time seemed to stand still until the world was simply heat and flames and water. He sweated and coughed from the smoke and hoped everyone was staying safe.</p><p>Too many civilians, he thought. Too many people who didn\u2019t have the training. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. The winery was supposed to be easy. Not on my watch, he thought. Not on my watch.</p><p>Frustration became anger. Lorenzo had left him the winery so he would stay. The old man had wanted him to care. Now, with the fire destroying all that four generations of Marcellis had built, Joe found himself cursing his own worry and concern.</p><p>\u201cGood news,\u201d the fire chief said as he handed Joe a bottle of water. \u201cThe fog\u2019s coming in.\u201d</p> <p>Joe unscrewed the top of the bottle and swallowed half the contents in one long drink. Then he turned to the west and saw the stars had disappeared behind a bank of heavy fog. The air was less dry, the flying ash and cinders less hot.</p><p>\u201cWill this make a difference?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll help,\u201d the chief told him. \u201cA heavy fog bank will combine with the smoke and make it a bitch to see, but there isn\u2019t any wind. If we can get the humidity high enough, we\u2019ll get a handle on this son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Joe finished the water. \u201cI want to know how it started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me, both,\u201d the chief told him. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re not going to like what we find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be. You have cultivated vineyards up here. No power lines, no lightning strikes. The ground is dry, but not parched, and the heavy fruit doesn\u2019t burn easily.\u201d</p><p>Joe couldn\u2019t think of anyone who would want to burn down Marcelli Wines. They were successful, but not a major holding. Not like Wild Sea.</p><p>He reminded himself this wasn\u2019t the time or the way to find answers. Instead he went back to work on the fire. When the firefighters came and asked him to help pull up several rows of grapes to widen a fire break, he reached for a shovel and dug in.</p><p>Time passed. The moments were measured in sweat and sparks and smoke. The fog continued to roll in until some of it reached behind the fire, creating an eerie backdrop for the dancing flames.</p><p>He heard a horn honk and turned to look. Paige and Lauren drove up on a golf cart.</p><p>\u201cWe have food and water,\u201d Lauren yelled. \u201cTake a break.\u201d</p><p>He joined the other men as the women handed out thick sandwiches and chilly bottles of water.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Paige tucked a bottle of water into his jeans pocket. \u201cThe other teams are making progress, too. The fog\u2019s helping. We\u2019re hoping for rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go check on them,\u201d he told the chief.</p><p>\u201cYou know where to find us.\u201d</p><p>Joe hopped on the back of the cart and directed Paige toward the other teams.</p><p>\u201cThanks for helping,\u201d he said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve put in my time here, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI care about the Marcellis as much as you.\u201d She faced front and shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019re good people.\u201d</p><p>They were good people, he thought as he jumped out of the cart and walked over to another group of firefighters. Marco and Colleen were studying maps spread on the ground.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Marco said, pointing. \u201cAbove it is the steepest terrain we have. I wouldn\u2019t risk going any higher. If we make our stand there, we should be fine.\u201d He glanced up and saw Joe. \u201cWe\u2019re winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>Marco motioned to the thickening fog. \u201cPop wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d</p><p>Joe wanted to point out that the fog was a weather phenomenon common to the area, not proof of ghostly interference, but he couldn\u2019t seem to say the words. Maybe because he\u2019d felt Lorenzo\u2019s presence as well. Four generations of Marcellis had worked the line. There was no way the old man would let that be lost.</p><p>The smoke was less thick here. He could see the acres of grapes yet to be touched by the flames.</p><p>\u201cIf we can get a protective break around them,\u201d he said, thinking out loud.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Marco said. \u201cWe can save most of them. Still have a decent year.\u201d</p><p>There was, Joe realized, a point when a soldier knew to give up the battle. When the victory or the loss became inevitable. Casualties could still occur on both sides, but the outcome had been determined.</p><p>When had that happened to him? He\u2019d been fighting long enough, but against what? His destiny? What was so bad about claiming this as his heritage? What did he resent about it?</p><p>He liked it here, he admitted to himself. He liked the family and the location. Darcy loved it and them. She was...</p><p>Colleen touched his arm. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? You\u2019re smiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarcy,\u201d he admitted, wondering when exactly he\u2019d let Darcy in.</p><p>\u201cReally? I knew you two were getting along, but I didn\u2019t think things were that serious. She\u2019s the president\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I figured that out already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only meant that there will be complications.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, Joe. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOkay, back to the fire. I\u2019m going to check on the other teams.\u201d</p><p>His mother hugged him. \u201cOn Darcy, you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he was eager to see her. This wasn\u2019t the time or place to discuss anything, but he needed to hear her voice and know she was all right.</p><p>Darcy had never fought a fire before, and she made a mental note to keep it off her to-do list. So far the firefighters had kept them back, relegating them to behind the truck activities. Even so, carting water and supplies, showing the way to the next hose hookup was hard, hot work. The smoke made it tough to breathe easily, and even with the fog rolling in there were still sparks flying everywhere.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t going to give up, especially when it seemed as if they were making progress. The flames didn\u2019t seem to reach as high, and every now and then she thought she could see a little farther into the vineyard.</p><p>She walked back to the trucks and reached for one of the sandwiches Paige and Lauren had brought. She\u2019d just taken her first bite when Ian came running up.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s looking for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cReally? Is he all right?\u201d</p><p>Ian grinned. \u201cI think he wants to make sure that you are. Come on. This way.\u201d</p><p>He led her around the trucks and into the vineyard. They were heading away from the fire.</p><p>\u201cJoe\u2019s out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Just then someone called her name. She turned back and saw someone running after them, but she couldn\u2019t see who it was. A man, but who?</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Darcy told Ian. \u201cIs that Joe?\u201d</p><p>Ian moved beside her and took her arm in his left hand. Then, before she realized what was happening, he pulled a gun out of his jacket, took aim on the approaching man, and pulled the trigger.</p><p>The world slowed. Later, Darcy would swear that she could actually see the bullet burst out of the barrel. She saw the man stop in midstride. He twisted and then he was falling to the ground.</p><p>\u201cJoe!\u201d she screamed in horror. Not him. It couldn\u2019t be him.</p><p>She started to run but found she couldn\u2019t move. She turned to see what was holding her in place. Ian had a grip on her arm. Other men appeared out of the darkness. There were four of them. Just like before.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed into the night.</p><p>The men didn\u2019t stop. One of them tackled her, and she found herself flat on her back. She couldn\u2019t breathe, and no matter how she squirmed and clawed and kicked, they didn\u2019t let go. Her arms were yanked behind her back, and ropes were fastened around her hands. More ties bound her ankles. She screamed again and one of them stuffed a handkerchief into her mouth. The dry, dirty cotton made her gag.</p><p>Joe! Joe! Was he shot? Bleeding? Dead?</p><p>Two of them half dragged, half carried her to a van. Past and present blended until she wasn\u2019t sure what was real and what was from before.</p><p>She bucked and twisted and lashed out as best she could. One of the men released her. She hit the ground on her side. Pain shot through her shoulder, but she didn\u2019t give in to it. Instead she rolled toward the vines, intent on hiding, on getting away.</p><p>Then the men were around her. They picked her up. One of them used bolt cutters to remove her security bracelet. Ian held a gun to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cTry escaping again and I\u2019ll splatter your brains all over the place. Got me?\u201d</p><p>Ian, she thought. How could it be him? He was harmless. He was Mia\u2019s annoying boyfriend. It couldn\u2019t be Ian.</p><p>But it was, and the gun in his hand told her he was deadly serious.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re right over here,\u201d Paige said as she stopped the cart. \u201cWe should be able to find them by following Ian\u2019s chatter.\u201d</p><p>Joe nodded as he got out of the cart. He looked around. The firefighters were clearly visible, but not anyone else.</p><p>Without warning, his gut clenched. There was no reason, but he\u2019d learned to trust the sensation.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d he told Paige. \u201cGet backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he ordered, even as he headed out into the vineyards. \u201cDarcy,\u201d he yelled. \u201cDarcy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was hard to hear anything with the roar of the fire in the background, but he listened intently. A groan caught his attention.</p><p>He raced toward the sound only to find Mia on all fours. She\u2019d just finished vomiting.</p><p>\u201cMy head,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cThat bastard hit me on the head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d Joe asked, although he already knew.</p><p>\u201cIan. What the hell is wrong with him?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Joe felt her pulse, then touched the bump on her head. He stood and called for Lauren. \u201cMia\u2019s been hurt,\u201d he told her. \u201cGet her to the cart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Darcy?\u201d Lauren asked frantically. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t know and thinking about the possibilities made his blood run cold. Who else had been part of the team? \u201cAlex,\u201d he yelled. \u201cAlex!\u201d</p> <p>Paige joined him. \u201cWhere are they? Where are Alex and Darcy?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, Joe hurried to the edge of the vineyard. There he saw the broken vines, ripped leaves. A struggle. He reached down and picked up Darcy\u2019s security bracelet. Paige was behind him and to his left. She screamed.</p><p>\u201cAlex\u2019s been shot. He\u2019s been shot.\u201d</p><p>21</p><p>O nce again Darcy found herself tied up in the back of a van. There was just enough predawn light coming through the back window for her to see the filthy floor, complete with a hole about eight inches across.</p><p>What was it with kidnappers that they couldn\u2019t afford decent vehicles? she wondered, trying to be disgusted and angry instead of terrified. And if they had to buy some beat-up piece of crap, couldn\u2019t they at least keep it clean?</p> <p>The van took a corner at high speed. Darcy went sliding, along with candy wrappers, sheets of paper, and who knows what else. She didn\u2019t want to think about things like rats and bugs, nor did she want to remember the easy way Ian had shot someone.</p><p>Not Joe, she prayed. Not anyone, but especially not Joe.</p><p>Ian! A kidnapper! It wasn\u2019t possible. How had he ever shut up enough to plan anything? Oh God. Joe. Be alive.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to consider any other possibility, so she forced herself to think about something else. Like how she was gagging on the handkerchief. She pushed her tongue against the cloth and worked her mouth until she was able to spit it out. The cloth hit the floor, rolled, and fell out the hole in the bottom of the van.</p><p>As she watched it go, she wished she were small enough to simply fall out the bottom of the van. Any bumps and bruises from hitting the road would be better than what Ian had in mind for her.</p><p>Oh God. Fear exploded inside of her. She turned and twisted on the dirty floor as she tried to free herself. She screamed and screamed but knew no one could hear her. It was five or six in the morning on a narrow road in the middle of nowhere. Who was going to be around to listen?</p><p>Worse, did anyone even know she was gone? With the fire and everyone busy with that, it could be hours before they noticed she was missing.</p><p>Tears burned her eyes but she refused to give in to them. Be strong, she told herself. Tough. She\u2019d already survived one kidnapping. Of course those kidnappers hadn\u2019t wanted her, they\u2019d wanted Lauren and\u2014</p> <p>Darcy sat up. Lauren had been right there at the winery. Ian could have taken her just as easily, but he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThis is not how I wanted to be the special daughter,\u201d she screamed, kicking at the side of the van. \u201cI was thinking more of an award or something.\u201d</p><p>A few candy wrappers fluttered out the hole. Great. Now she was littering.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the hole, then at all the garbage in the back of the van. Could she use it to signal where they were going, or at least where they\u2019d been?</p><p>She scooted so her back was against one of the walls of the van, and kicked a candy wrapper toward the hole. After counting to sixty, she pushed it out. Another minute later, she pushed out a rag.</p><p>Would anyone realize it wasn\u2019t just trash? she wondered. Would the trash get blown away? She needed something bigger. Something more significant.</p><p>She looked around at the back of the van. Nothing came to mind until she looked at her feet. Her shoes.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t like the thought of being barefoot, she liked the thought of being dead even less. She toed off one of her shoes and nudged it toward the opening. It slipped through and fell to the road. She would continue with the trash, then put out the other shoe in another ten minutes or so.</p><p>If only she knew how long they would be driving, she thought. Should she wait longer than ten minutes? What would happen when they got wherever they were going?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think about it,\u201d she told herself. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p><p>But there was little else to occupy her mind. Fearing and wondering if Joe were alive. After dumping out more trash, she debated removing her other shoe. Before she could decide, the van came to a stop. The fear returned and with it a certain sense of dread.</p><p>\u201cTowels,\u201d Joe yelled. \u201cThick towels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not sterile,\u201d Tessa told him as she and Grammy M hurried around the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We need pressure.\u201d He took the towel Tessa handed him and held it over the wound in Alex\u2019s side.</p><p>The Secret Service agent looked up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it coming. Should have.\u201d</p><p>His color was nonexistent, his breathing labored. From what Joe could tell, the bullet had gone in and out cleanly. But what it had done while passing through remained to be seen.</p><p>He looked around at the frantic faces in the kitchen. Paige was on the phone, detailing what had happened. He felt a burning need to hunt down Ian and kill him. But until Paige was done, he was the only one in the house with the training to keep Alex alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Colleen asked, her expression both worried and grim. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Ian took Darcy. Should we start searching the buildings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo point. They\u2019re gone. I saw tracks heading west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToward the interstate,\u201d Marco said. \u201cThey could be anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Goddamn son of a bitch, when he got his hands on Ian, he was going to rip him apart and watch him bleed to death.</p><p>Mia crouched in a chair. She was still woozy from being hit on the head and needed to be checked out. There was too much to do, he thought grimly.</p><p>Paige hung up the phone. \u201cOkay, the team\u2019s coming. Local, state, and federal law enforcement have been notified. Road blocks will be up within the half hour. We\u2019ll have full tactical support in less time. The president has been notified.\u201d</p><p>Joe didn\u2019t want to think about that phone call or what the other man must be feeling. Joe had enough trouble battling his own worry, and he was a trained professional.</p><p>\u201cI should have known,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Paige hurried to the kitchen table where she stared down at Alex. \u201cWe all should have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe checked out clean,\u201d Alex said, his voice heavy with pain.</p><p>\u201cToo clean,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI never liked him.\u201d</p><p>Someone began to cry. He turned and saw Lauren. Grammy M and Colleen hurried to her. Lauren looked at him.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right, won\u2019t she? You\u2019ll get Darcy back.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an answer to that, but he nodded. \u201cOf course we will.\u201d He turned to Paige. \u201cGet her team back here.\u201d</p><p>The extra Secret Service agents had been at the hotel in town, the same one Captain Phillips had retired to the previous evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already called them. The rest of Darcy\u2019s team will be assigned to Lauren until we can get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lauren said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Paige shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safer somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You can protect me here. I want to know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all be here to protect her,\u201d Marco said. \u201cAnyone trying to kidnap Lauren will have to come through us.\u201d</p><p>Joe appreciated the sentiment, but it wasn\u2019t going to be much help against trained experts.</p><p>He replaced the blood-soaked towel with a fresh one. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to argue,\u201d he told Paige. \u201cShe\u2019s staying until the team arrives. Then let them deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Lauren said stubbornly.</p><p>Joe glanced at her. It was the first time she\u2019d reminded him of Darcy.</p><p>Darcy. Fear crashed in on him. He\u2019d never felt anything like it before. Sure, he\u2019d worried about his team, but he\u2019d never felt this icy, crushing sensation in his chest. If something happened to her...</p><p>Brenna limped into the kitchen. She cradled her belly with one hand and leaned against Nic. \u201cSo, ah, how is Alex getting to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelicopter,\u201d Paige said, pressing on the bleeding wound from the underside.</p><p>\u201cIs it big enough for two?\u201d</p><p>Joe turned to look at her. Really looked. It was only then he noticed the dark stain down the front of her maternity dress.</p><p>\u201cMy water broke,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m in labor.\u201d</p><p>In the second between when the van stopped and Ian opened one of the doors, Darcy heard an odd sound. It was familiar, but she couldn\u2019t place it. Something rhythmic and swooshy. Then the door swung open and she saw they were parked on the beach. The thick fog added a sense of the macabre to the otherwise perfect view.</p><p>Why here? Why not some airport or a freeway?</p><p>\u201cCome on, Darcy,\u201d Ian said. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d</p><p>Her instinct was to fight them. There were only two of them. Then Ian pulled out his gun and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t make trouble, but if you do, I\u2019ll shoot you. Not to kill, you understand. Just enough to slow you down. I\u2019ve never been shot, but I\u2019d think it really hurts. Especially if I mess up and it goes through bone. So you don\u2019t want to be a problem, right?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cThen get out of the van.\u201d</p><p>She did as he said, sliding forward on her butt until she reached the open door. The other man, tall, with dark hair and cold eyes, grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet.</p><p>Darcy looked between them as a horrifying thought occurred to her. She could see their faces. Which meant she could easily identify them. Which led to the logical conclusion that they didn\u2019t plan for that ever to happen. They weren\u2019t going to let her go.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to die, she thought frantically. Not now. Not like this. Joe was...</p><p>Joe might be dead. No, she couldn\u2019t think like that. He was strong; she would be strong, too.</p><p>Instinctively, she twisted away from the man. She managed to get free, but with her feet tied, she couldn\u2019t run. She teetered, then fell to the sand. Seconds later, something hard slammed into her ribs as Ian kicked her. She screamed.</p><p>\u201cThat was a warning,\u201d Ian said coldly. \u201cNext time I will shoot you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch her breath. The pain was incredible. It was like fire along her rib cage. Had he broken something?</p><p>Ian stood over her. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, Darcy. You\u2019re our prisoner, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. If you cooperate, I promise to make your time with us as pleasant as possible. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll hurt you. Those are simple rules, right? You can understand them.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo use you as a bargaining chip.\u201d</p><p>Not good, she thought as she sucked in air. Not good at all. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t negotiate with terrorists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that. I\u2019m guessing I can change his mind. See, it\u2019s a great policy right up until someone you love is kidnapped. We\u2019ll start with polite requests, and if that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll send you back to him in pieces. I know that sounds scary and I\u2019m sorry about that. We\u2019ll give you something for the pain, but it\u2019s probably still going to hurt. We can\u2019t help that. The point is when we send your finger or your ear or your hand to the press, your dad is going to be a whole lot more willing to give us what we want.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was going to pass out. The good news was, she wouldn\u2019t have to listen to Ian anymore. He was speaking so calmly, she thought, unable to believe any of this was really happening. How could Ian be doing this? Ian, who had stayed at the Marcelli house. Ian, who had dated Mia and driven them all crazy with his talking.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. They won\u2019t know where we are, and I\u2019ve found a spot they\u2019ll never even look.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded at the other man, who then pulled her to her feet, bent down, and shoved his shoulder into her midsection. When he stood, the pain of her bruised side nearly made her pass out. She thought she was going to throw up.</p><p>They started walking toward a small boat pulled up on the sand. She didn\u2019t like boats, especially small ones. She didn\u2019t like being kidnapped, either, she thought grimly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a cave,\u201d Ian said. \u201cI found it years ago, when I went fishing around here with my grandfather. I used to think it was a really cool hideout, but I never thought I\u2019d use it for a headquarters.\u201d</p><p>She slipped free of the man\u2019s shoulder and felt herself falling and falling. When she hit the boat, the impact was hard. Her head cracked against a wooden seat.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Jesse. We don\u2019t want to kill her.\u201d</p> <p>Not yet, she thought as the world started to fold in at the corners and then fade to black. Not yet.</p><p>Joe stared at the maps spread out on the counter of the kitchen. Where would they take Darcy? They had an hour\u2019s head start, which gave them a lot of leeway. Still roadblocks were already up, and the heavy fog meant all regional airports were closed.</p><p>Would they try to get distance between themselves and the winery or were they holing up close by? What would he do?</p><p>Joe touched the largest map, but he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t figure out the plan. Ian had done this. He\u2019d been the enemy all along, and no one had noticed.</p><p>Had he planned this from the beginning? Joe didn\u2019t think that was possible. No one had known Darcy was coming here more than forty-eight hours before it had happened. Which meant Ian had taken advantage of a lucky break.</p><p>Who was he? The name had to be false, along with the identity. He\u2019d been completely clean. No one that clean pulled off something like this.</p> <p>\u201cThe bleeding\u2019s slowed,\u201d Paige said, sounding relieved. \u201cHold on, Alex. The helicopter will be here soon. You, too, Brenna.\u201d</p><p>Brenna waved from her sprawled position on a kitchen chair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be in labor for hours. I appreciate the ride, though. Right now the thought of a thirty-minute car trip is very disheartening.\u201d</p><p>Nic crouched next to her and held her hand. \u201cJust breathe, okay.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI can breathe and scream. I\u2019m good at both of those. It\u2019s the whole birthing process I\u2019m worried about. And the fact that I swear I can feel more than two feet pressing against me.\u201d</p><p>Joe blocked out the conversation and concentrated on the maps. But before he could figure anything out, Mia walked over and touched his arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He took a second to give her a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. I\u2019m the one who brought him here. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know who he really was. I traveled with him, I slept with him. I should have guessed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can only see what you see. You can\u2019t read minds.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI should have known. Somehow.\u201d</p><p>Joe led her into the dining room. \u201cDid he ever say anything about his family? About friends? Do you have any names?\u201d</p><p>Mia stared at him. \u201cNo. He talked about his grandfather all the time. The one who took him fishing. But not his parents. He was more interested in mine. I just...\u201d She stifled a sob. \u201cHe was so excited about meeting Darcy. I thought he was starstruck. Then, later, he asked me all kinds of questions. I figured he had a crush on her or something. But it wasn\u2019t that. Now Alex is shot, and they have Darcy, and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><p>She began to cry. Joe pulled her close and kept his mouth shut. A part of him did want to blame Mia, but he was as guilty as she.</p><p>Darcy regained consciousness when she was carried from the small boat and put onto a canvas chair in the middle of a cave. Her hands and feet were still tied and her ribs ached, along with her head. If this kept up much longer, she was going to be one big bruise.</p><p>She waited until Ian and someone she hadn\u2019t seen before walked away, then she raised her head and looked around. The cave was larger than it looked from the outside, for which she was grateful. She\u2019d grown to dislike small, dark spaces.</p><p>The boat had been tied up next to one just like it on the side of the cave, not that far from where she sat. On the other side were a couple of tables covered with electronic equipment. Bottled water and canned foods filled a pallet by the rock wall.</p><p>She could hear men talking, which made her nervous. She didn\u2019t want to know who they were. She wanted to be set free and not be able to identify them later so they wouldn\u2019t have to kill her.</p><p>The cave itself seemed to bend around, perhaps creating a second room. She wasn\u2019t sure, as she couldn\u2019t see it, but that\u2019s where the voices came from. Maybe the rest of them would stay there, she thought.</p><p>Ian reappeared. He walked toward her and held out a length of chain with bands at each end. \u201cFor your ankles,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cSo you can\u2019t get away. Oh, in case you\u2019re wondering, these are heavy. If you head for the water, you\u2019ll sink right to the bottom. No swimming for freedom, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>He was so calm, she thought. Calm to the point of pleasant, which just wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>When he bent at her feet, she thought about kicking him but decided it wasn\u2019t the time for an escape. Not when she was tied up and didn\u2019t know how many other men were around. He secured the chains around her ankles, then unfastened the ropes. Finally he used a smaller chain to attach her left arm to the chair itself, leaving her right arm and hand free.</p><p>\u201cThirsty?\u201d he asked, motioning to the bottles.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He brought her water and opened it, then crossed to the table of communication equipment. \u201cI\u2019m going to call your dad,\u201d he said as he put on a headset. \u201cI don\u2019t mind you screaming, but you can\u2019t tell them where we are. And as I don\u2019t trust you...\u201d</p><p>He motioned with his hands. Jesse appeared with a gag. Darcy tried pulling away, but she was weighed down by the chains and the chair. Jesse quickly secured the gag, effectively silencing her.</p><p>Ian hit a button on a console. Instantly the sound of a dial tone filled the cave. He punched in a phone number, then waited until a woman said, \u201cThis is the White House operator. How may I direct your call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to the man in charge,\u201d Ian told her. \u201cPresident Jensen. I\u2019m the guy who has his daughter. She\u2019s right here. I\u2019d let you talk to her, but she\u2019s all tied up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at his own joke.</p><p>\u201cOne minute, sir.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence, then a man picked up. \u201cThis is Special Agent in Charge Allister. Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ian Welton, Allister, but you already knew that. I\u2019m sure the folks back at the ranch, or winery in this case, have already told you all about me. And you\u2019re not who I want to speak with. I called for the president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here right now.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced at Darcy and raised his eyebrows. \u201cDaddy\u2019s not home. Where do you think he is?\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can patch me through to him,\u201d Ian said, returning his attention to the call. \u201cWhich I want you to do. I have a list of demands. And before you tell me you don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists, I\u2019ll remind you I have his daughter here. He only has the two, so I think he\u2019d miss this one if we had to return her in pieces.\u201d</p><p>Stay calm, Darcy told herself. Stay calm. People were looking for her and they would find her. She would be okay. She had to be. For Joe. Because if he\u2019d been shot, he would need her. And if he hadn\u2019t, then he would come find her.</p><p>\u201cThreats don\u2019t help your cause,\u201d Allister said. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019d like a really good burger, but instead I\u2019ll take the release of Jonathan Misner from prison. He is to be picked up by helicopter and taken to the county airport. There you will have a plane waiting, along with two million dollars in cash.\u201d</p><p>Misner, Misner. The name was familiar, but she couldn\u2019t place it at first.</p><p>\u201cThe domestic terrorist?\u201d Allister asked.</p><p>Then she remembered. Jonathan Misner was responsible for the bombing of a large suburban Chicago mall nearly three years ago. Dozens of people had been killed and hundreds injured. He and his men had been opposed to money being sent abroad for foreign aid. They\u2019d wanted the funds to stay home, along with jobs and technology. Their demands had been for the United States to isolate itself from the rest of the world.</p><p>Misner had been captured nearly a year after the bombing. It had been one of those quirks of fate\u2014a routine traffic stop had brought him to the attention of a small-town deputy. Later, the deputy had followed him to a local motel and called in federal authorities. Several of Misner\u2019s men had gotten away, but the leader had been captured. He had been arrested and convicted, and was on death row in federal prison.</p><p>\u201cWe see him as a revolutionary,\u201d Ian said calmly. \u201cImagine what the king of England thought of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Not an original argument, I\u2019ll grant you, but accurate. You have twelve hours. If I don\u2019t see Misner staring on CNN as he\u2019s led out of prison, I\u2019ll have to hurt Darcy.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced at her and gave her an apologetic smile. \u201cFunny thing is, I really don\u2019t want to do it. I like her a lot. But the cause is bigger, and I want Misner out of prison. If he\u2019s not released by\u201d\u2014Ian glanced at his watch\u2014\u201cseven-forty-three P.M. Pacific Time, I\u2019ll have to make my point. We\u2019ll start small. Her little finger from her left hand. She\u2019ll be gagged, so you won\u2019t hear her screaming, but trust me, she will be.\u201d</p><p>22</p><p>T he task force arrived by air. Shortly after eight in the morning, three Sikorsky Superhawk helicopters descended from the sky and landed on the open grassy area by the long driveway leading up to the house.</p><p>Most of the personnel were navy, with a few Secret Service agents thrown in the mix. Joe knew that other members of the team would arrive as soon as they could be flown in from other parts of the country. Captain Phillips had driven from his hotel to act as a liaison.</p><p>Joe stood by the front of the house as the helicopters shut down. When the team was assembled, he stepped forward to lead them toward the winery. He\u2019d already commandeered the conference room and had Marco call the office staff to tell them not to come in to work. The team could spread out into the various offices and have access to the phone lines if necessary, although it wouldn\u2019t take long for them to establish their own communications system.</p><p>\u201cThrough here,\u201d Joe said as they walked into the main building of the winery.</p><p>One of the team members, Admiral Grant, moved next to Joe. \u201cThe fire was started as a diversion?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. \u201cWe have preliminary confirmation of arson. A final report will take some time, but there\u2019s enough evidence for our purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were two Secret Service agents with Darcy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just Alex. Alex Vanmeter. The agent who was shot.\u201d</p><p>The admiral raised his eyebrows. Yes, Darcy should have been protected by two agents. She also shouldn\u2019t have been sent off with the very man trying to kidnap her. Joe had already beaten himself up about it a dozen times. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLauren was with Paige,\u201d Joe continued.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt the reason only Darcy was taken,\u201d the admiral said.</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t so sure. Ian and his group had planned their kidnapping very well. If they\u2019d wanted Lauren, he didn\u2019t doubt they could have taken her. The fire had put everyone in a panic.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve given your report to Captain Phillips?\u201d the admiral asked.</p><p>Joe nodded. They\u2019d reached the conference room. He pointed out the maps of the area and the contact list, which included local law enforcement officials, the fire chief, and the main number of the house.</p><p>Joe started to step into the room, but the admiral blocked his way.</p><p>\u201cThat will be all,\u201d the man told him.</p><p>Joe glared at him. \u201cSir, I know I screwed up. I know the kidnapping is my fault. But I\u2019m still the best tactical officer you have.\u201d</p> <p>The admiral shook his head. \u201cA good tactical officer doesn\u2019t let his subject get kidnapped. You\u2019re relieved of duty, sailor.\u201d</p><p>The door closed in his face.</p><p>There was no lock. Joe could have stepped inside and forced them to listen, but to what end? He didn\u2019t have anything to say. Nothing useful, anyway. Telling them that he wanted to trade himself for Darcy was meaningless. Letting them know that he would give his life for hers a hundred times over would only get in the way.</p><p>He turned from the conference room and headed for Lorenzo\u2019s office. There he could stare at the maps on the wall and will them to reveal their secrets to him. Where had Ian taken her? What would the little shithead do with her?</p><p>An hour later, he was no closer to a solution. He slumped in Lorenzo\u2019s chair and endured the frustration of having no way to act. Nearly as bad as imagining what Darcy must be going through was the reality of knowing that he had had Ian within his grasp and had never considered him a danger. If he had, he would have cheerfully ripped him into a dozen pieces.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t. Instead he\u2019d listened to Ian talk on and on about everything from his opinion of the growing world economy to his seemingly endless anecdotal stories about his studies, his various roommates, and the time he spent locally with his\u2014</p> <p>Joe stared at the map. Ian had talked about his grandfather taking him fishing around here. He\u2019d talked about caves.</p><p>He reached for the phone and called the main house. \u201cMarco,\u201d he barked, when Tessa answered.</p><p>Marco came on the line.</p><p>\u201cMeet me in the conference room right now,\u201d he ordered. \u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>Joe slammed down the phone and raced to the conference room. He burst in without knocking. The fourteen people sitting around the table all looked at him.</p><p>Captain Phillips stood. \u201cJoe, you\u2019re screwing up here,\u201d he began, his voice cold.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a good goddamn about that,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cI know where Ian\u2019s taken her.\u201d</p><p>Phillips stared at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t caught him, have you? Not with any of the roadblocks. You\u2019re not going to. He\u2019s already off the road. He\u2019s taken her to a boat somewhere close. There are caves on the coast, some of them big enough to hide in. He\u2019ll wait until dark, then use a boat to get her away.\u201d</p><p>Phillips and the admiral exchanged a glance. The Secret Service agent in charge nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve found the van,\u201d Phillips told him. \u201cIt was abandoned on the beach. Apparently there was a hole in the rear floor because we also found a trail of trash, rags, and one of Darcy\u2019s shoes.\u201d</p><p>Joe felt a flash of pride. As scared as she must have been, she hadn\u2019t lost her head. Good for her.</p><p>The conference room door opened and Marco stepped in. \u201cMy father,\u201d Joe said. \u201cMarco Marcelli.\u201d He crossed to the maps pinned to the walls. \u201cWe think Ian took her by boat to a cave. Which ones are big enough to hold a dozen or so people and equipment?\u201d</p><p>Marco joined him at the map. He studied it for a second, then pointed. \u201cHere. There are three caves big enough. I used to play in them when I was a kid. A couple of these have several rooms.\u201d</p><p>Three was manageable, Joe thought. Three caves, three teams. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deadline?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Phillips shook his head. \u201cJoe, this isn\u2019t your fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is. This happened on my watch. What are his demands and how long do we have?\u201d</p><p>Phillips considered the question, then explained Ian\u2019s demands for Misner\u2019s release. \u201cThe first deadline is seven-forty-three tonight.\u201d</p><p>Not much time, Joe thought, calculating the travel time from San Diego to here. But enough. \u201cWe\u2019ll have three SEAL teams, one on each cave. They can be here by one, and we\u2019ll put together our plan.\u201d</p><p>Phillips looked at the admiral. \u201cIt\u2019s what he\u2019s best at.\u201d</p><p>Admiral Grant nodded. \u201cAll right, Joe. You take charge of your SEALs. Everything comes through me.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cThe president will be landing in a couple of hours, and he\u2019ll want a full briefing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we make Ian think we\u2019re giving in to his demands?\u201d Joe asked. \u201cHaving him monitor that will provide a distraction and keep Darcy safe.\u201d</p><p>The admiral picked up a phone. \u201cLet me see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Despite Ian removing the gag and offering Darcy more water, she still felt nauseated and faint. She wanted to cradle her left hand against her stomach and protect her suddenly vulnerable fingers. She wanted to run screaming out of the dark cave, into safety. She wanted to be back at the Marcelli house, with Grandma Tessa offering her food and Joe tempting her into his bed. She wanted to live, fingers and all.</p><p>Fear grabbed at her and refused to let go. The need to scream built until she had to press her hand to her mouth to hold it inside. Focus, she told herself. She had to focus. Be calm. Relax.</p><p>Tears burned, but she held them in. Eventually the need to scream faded to a whimper. She thought about Joe and how tough he was, how he would want her to be tough, too. She thought about Lauren and knew however much she loved her sister, Lauren couldn\u2019t possibly handle being kidnapped. She would be too scared.</p><p>Darcy nearly laughed. After all these years had she just realized she was the strong one, emotionally? What a time to have a self-actualization-type breakthrough.</p><p>Sometime around noon, Ian offered her a sandwich. She didn\u2019t want to eat, but she knew she needed to keep up her strength. Later, she was allowed to use the Porta Potti in the back of the cave. There was no escaping from that route, she thought as she glanced around at rock walls.</p><p>She returned to her chair, was chained in place, and waited to see what would happen. Ian kept the television turned to CNN, but there was no mention of her kidnapping at all. The first hint of news came a little before three when the phone rang.</p><p>Ian picked it up and flipped on the speaker. \u201cWelton here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIan, how are you?\u201d</p><p>Darcy watched as Ian grinned and waved toward the back of the cave. \u201cJonathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The other man chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you did it, but they\u2019re letting me out. Hell of a job, kid. Hell of a job.\u201d</p><p>Ian squared his shoulders. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t let you rot in jail. I\u2019d planned on kidnapping the British prime minister when he came to San Francisco in three months, but then someone dumped a better idea in my lap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t tell me anything. What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced at Darcy and winked. \u201cKidnapped the president\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Darcy. She\u2019s right here. Couldn\u2019t have been easier.\u201d He explained how he\u2019d been dating Mia and had gone to meet her family, only to discover Darcy in residence.</p><p>\u201cLuck like that doesn\u2019t happen every day,\u201d Ian said. \u201cWhat could I do?\u201d</p><p>Jonathan laughed. \u201cGood for you, Ian. Now you know this could be a trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready got that covered.\u201d</p><p>Darcy didn\u2019t know what to think. There was no way she believed her father would agree to release a prisoner on death row. He couldn\u2019t. Which meant it was a trick, or someone was lying. She shivered from fear and cold, even though it was warm in the cave.</p><p>She stared at the lapping water only a few feet away. If not for the heavy chains, she would take her chances in the ocean. Maybe she could swim to shore.</p><p>Ian ended his call and disappeared into the other room of the cave. She heard the men cheering as they discussed the good news. A few minutes later he came back with something in his hands. Something that looked like a vest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wear this,\u201d he said, holding it out to her. \u201cI know it looks scary, but it\u2019s perfectly safe. There isn\u2019t even a manual detonation. It has to be done by remote control, so you can\u2019t trigger it yourself by sneezing or something. See?\u201d</p><p>The fear became tangible. She felt it deaden her arms and legs. She could barely breathe as she stared at the vest.</p><p>Strips of gray material had been sewn into rows of pockets on the outside of the vest. She\u2019d seen enough action movies to know the claylike substance was some kind of explosive.</p><p>Everything had been wired, with the colorful wires all meeting back at a common point that would be right above her left breast.</p><p>\u201cLook. No boom.\u201d He smiled and shook it, then dropped it on the floor. As if that proved anything.</p><p>Hysterical laughter threatened. Right. Safe, right up until the minute someone pushed the little red button on the detonator and she exploded into a million pieces.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to, Darcy, but I\u2019m not giving you a choice. I\u2019d like to. You\u2019re really nice. Lauren\u2019s okay, but you\u2019re prettier, and I like you better, which is why I wanted to kidnap you. Although I\u2019ll be real sad if I have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to point out he was probably going to anyway, but what was the point?</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, we have a greater good to think about,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. The government has to understand we\u2019re not responsible for the world. We have our own problems to deal with. Charity begins at home, right? We\u2019re not being especially charitable right now. Do you know how many children go to bed hungry every night right here in this country? Shouldn\u2019t we be taking care of them? So you see why I have to do this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He held out the vest. She leaned back and shook her head.</p><p>Ian sighed. \u201cJesse,\u201d he yelled. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the vest on her.\u201d</p><p>Jesse appeared from the rear of the cave and roughly pulled her out of the chair. She twisted and turned and wished her feet weren\u2019t manacled together so she could kick the crap out of him. But they were, and the heavy chains didn\u2019t allow for much mobility.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried as he put one of her arms through the vest.</p><p>Jesse raised his hand and slapped her hard across the face. The pain and shock immobilized her enough for them to unlock her hand and finish putting on the vest. Then they pushed her back into her seat and resecured her wrist to the chair.</p><p>The vest was thick and lighter than it looked. There was an odd smell that terrified her. Her heart beat so quickly she thought it might fly right out of her chest. This couldn\u2019t be happening to her. It couldn\u2019t. Her face throbbed from the slap, and she knew deep down in her heart she wasn\u2019t getting out of this alive. Not now. They were going to kill her, and there was no way anyone would ever find her in time.</p><p>Joe finished briefing the team, then picked up his diving gear and weapons. Everything felt good in his hands. Right.</p><p>He suited up, then climbed in the back of the truck for the short trip to the boats that would take them close to the caves. From there they would approach underwater.</p><p>At nearly five in the afternoon, he and his men waded out into the ocean and slipped onto the boats. Joe\u2019s headset crackled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLarson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just got word. They warned us not to try anything. They\u2019ve wired her with an explosive. If anything happens they don\u2019t like, she\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>Joe heard the information but he refused to react to it. Now he was on a mission and it was all about doing the job. He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to think emotionally or feel. Darcy\u2019s life depended on his ability to disconnect from her.</p><p>\u201cThis changes everything,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cYou have to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Joe told him. \u201cWe\u2019re still going forward. If they\u2019ve got her wired, they\u2019re prepared to kill her. They\u2019ll probably do it anyway. We have to get her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarson?\u201d Another man came on the line. \u201cThis is President Jensen.\u201d</p><p>Joe stiffened. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my daughter we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>It was also the woman Joe loved. \u201cI understand what she means to you, sir. I\u2019ll bring her back alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, I will bring her back or die trying.\u201d</p><p>Jensen didn\u2019t respond. Phillips came on and gave a few last-minute instructions, then Joe motioned for the team to head out. As they moved north across the ocean, Joe breathed in the scent of salt air. The water had always been a haven, he thought. It was the one place a SEAL could feel safe, and where he performed best.</p><p>Three caves. He\u2019d taken the team going into the largest one. His gut told him she was there. They had a plan and a willingness to do whatever it took to save her life. He loved her too much to let her die.</p> <p>Darcy sat in her chair, shaking. She would have thought that over time the fear would lessen, but it hadn\u2019t. She held on by a thread.</p><p>Ian and Jesse stood in the rear of the cave, speaking in low voices. The acoustics were such that Darcy could hear them, and their words didn\u2019t make her feel any more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cYou think they\u2019re really going to release Jonathan?\u201d Jesse asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. They don\u2019t want anything to happen to Darcy. We\u2019ve got them. Once we get word he\u2019s released, we\u2019ll call the boat and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Boat? They already had two. Darcy glanced at the small vessels in question and realized Ian was talking about something bigger. Of course. They were flying Jonathan to a rendezvous point and they would meet him there with a boat.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jesse said. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve put this place behind us, we\u2019ll dump her overboard. No one will ever find her.\u201d</p><p>Darcy froze and waited for Ian to deny the statement. When he didn\u2019t, she knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to hold it together much longer. A scream built up inside her.</p><p>Suddenly the television picture disappeared into snowy static. Ian ripped off his headset and yelled, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Cries of pain came from the back of the cave. Without warning, the water seemed to rise up and a shock wave blasted across the open space.</p> <p>Darcy felt herself tossed around like a toy. She and the chair slammed into the wall and everything went black.</p><p>Joe and his men rushed out of the water. The jamming signal had rendered everything electronic inoperative, including the remote detonation for the bomb. He\u2019d sent in the stun grenades such that Darcy received the least of the impact, but she\u2019d still been blown back into the wall.</p><p>\u201cNo one gets out of the cave,\u201d Joe said into his headset.</p><p>The instruction was unnecessary\u2014his team knew what to do, but he couldn\u2019t help it. There was too much at stake.</p><p>He ran to Darcy\u2019s side and checked her for injuries. No blood, although her head might have hit the wall. He saw the chains and cursed, then reached for the vest.</p><p>\u201cJoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Darcy.\u201d She was awake. Thank God. He fingered the various wires, then reached for his small tool kit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dead. I thought he shot you.\u201d Tears trickled from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat was Alex,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m okay and so are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was horrible. I was so scared.\u201d She touched the vest. \u201cIt\u2019s a bomb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Trust me. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d He managed a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve taught the class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always knew you were a great guy to have around in a crisis.\u201d</p><p>He sorted through the wires, then cut three. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked as he pulled off the vest and tossed it away.</p><p>\u201cLike I was hit on the head with a hammer. You know, he could have detonated that remotely.\u201d</p><p>Joe wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close. She was still attached to the chair, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cWe jammed the signal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why the TV went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Signals from the cavalry. You okay?\u201d</p><p>She clung to him. As soon as he felt her hands on his back, he allowed himself to relax a little.</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been scared.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back enough to look at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine. Remember how last time you said I had to talk to someone?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and touched the bruise on her cheek. \u201cI have some names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to need them.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cOh, Joe. You\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Darcy. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. Not ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take me,\u201d Ian screamed as he ran out from the back of the cave and drew a gun.</p><p>Joe pushed Darcy behind him and, in one quick move, pulled out his gun. One of the guys on his team got there first. After a terse order to \u201cfreeze,\u201d three shots rang out in the cave. Ian stumbled then collapsed.</p><p>Joe ignored the bleeding body. \u201cThe rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll captured, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it in. Tell them to send the boat in for Darcy.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her. She had her eyes closed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>One of his men brought over a key for the chains. Joe released her and pulled her onto his lap. She huddled against him and started to cry.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said gently, smoothing her hair and kissing her face. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. You\u2019ll want to look good for your dad.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. The entire military is here. Lauren, too. The Marcellis are really worried about you. Oh, Brenna\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. Now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. She\u2019s at the hospital. Last I heard, there\u2019s no baby, but plenty of screaming.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI don\u2019t blame her. Nothing about the actual process of giving birth seems pleasant.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He stared into her brown eyes and knew he\u2019d finally found the one thing that had been missing his whole life.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Darcy.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, but before she could say anything, Joe felt a tap on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThe boat is here, sir.\u201d</p><p>Joe shifted Darcy onto the ground, then stood and swept her into his arms. She grabbed him around his neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSaving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already done that once today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on doing it for a long time to come.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>They were escorted out of the cave and back to shore by the Coast Guard. Darcy had expected a Secret Service agent or two to be waiting, but what she saw instead was something closer to the staging area for a space shuttle launch. There were five or six ships cruising the immediate area. At least two dozen cars were parked along the sand. Three helicopters sat on the road, and two trucks filled with military personnel stood watch a hundred or so feet away.</p><p>Joe took her arm and helped her step onto the sand. She looked from the staring crowd back to him. \u201cAll this for me?\u201d she asked, not able to believe it.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>The fear had faded, but in its place was a shaky feeling. Too much emotion in too short a time, she told herself. She clung to Joe, her only stable point in a spinning world, and promised herself that as soon as she caught her breath she would deal with his amazing and unexpected declaration of love. She would have guessed he cared, but not that he could admit he actually loved her.</p><p>The crowd parted and her father hurried toward her. \u201cDarcy!\u201d</p><p>He held out his arms.</p><p>The unexpected gesture made her hesitate at first, then she rushed forward to hug him. He pulled her close and squeezed so hard, she could barely breathe.</p><p>\u201cI was scared to death,\u201d he murmured in her ear. \u201cWhen I heard what had happened, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d she said.</p><p>He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to happen to you. I\u2019d be lost without you.\u201d</p><p>She read the truth in his eyes and felt sadness for all the time they\u2019d wasted.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Daddy,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you, too, Darcy. You\u2019re my daughter. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, too close to crying to speak. Her father put his arm around her and led her to the waiting SUV. Before she climbed in, she looked back for Joe, but he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asked. \u201cJoe Larson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDebriefing,\u201d her father told her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see him later, and you can thank him for rescuing you.\u201d</p><p>She planned to do a whole lot more than that but doubted her father wanted to hear about the details.</p><p>\u201cIs Alex all right?\u201d she asked as she slid onto the leather seat.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s already out of surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We\u2019ll stop by the hospital on our way back to the Marcelli house.\u201d</p><p>The Marcellis. She\u2019d nearly forgotten. \u201cThe fire. Is everyone all right? Did they get it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Just as you were kidnapped, it started to rain. That put out the rest of it. A few acres were burned, but I was told they can be replanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan did that,\u201d she said. \u201cHe started the fire as a diversion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe authorities know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not letting that Jonathan person out of prison, are you?\u201d</p><p>Her father pulled her close and put his arm around her. \u201cStop worrying, Darcy. I\u2019m doing a good job of running the country. Just think about yourself and the fact that you\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been held by her father in more years than she could count, but the sensation was still familiar and comforting. Funny how she\u2019d spent so much time looking for a place to belong and it had been waiting for her all along.</p><p>Mia sat alone in the house. She couldn\u2019t remember the last occasion when she\u2019d been the only person there. Usually Grandma Tessa or Grammy M were puttering around, but not this evening. Everyone had gone to the hospital to check on either Alex or Brenna. Mia had promised to come as soon as she could. But she\u2019d needed to be alone. To think. To recover from the horror of what had happened.</p><p>Ian had betrayed her. He\u2019d used her to do something horrific, and she\u2019d never had a clue.</p><p>She\u2019d trusted him, both in and out of her bed. She\u2019d thought he was funny and smart, if a little too talkative. She\u2019d been friends with him for nearly two years, lovers for three months, and she\u2019d never guessed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paige had pointed out that she, Mia, was a civilian. She couldn\u2019t be expected to know. But Mia was used to being smarter than that. No one had ever fooled her so completely.</p><p>She reached for her backpack and pulled out her wallet. Tucked inside was a plain white business card. There was no name on it\u2014just a phone number. She\u2019d been given the card one of the many times someone had approached her about becoming a clandestine operative for the government.</p><p>She stared at the number for a long time before dialing it.</p> <p>It rang twice.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m, ah, Mia Marcelli. I was given this card a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d</p><p>Mia heard the man typing on a keyboard. \u201cYes, Mia. I have your file. How can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>File? She had a file? \u201cI\u2019m interested in what you do. In being, you know, a spy.\u201d</p><p>Paige sat by Alex and held his hand. He was still pretty out of it, but she wasn\u2019t going to let go. Not until he told her to go away, which, based on how out of it he was, wouldn\u2019t be happening anytime soon.</p><p>He stirred slightly. She rose and leaned over him.</p><p>\u201cHey, big guy. How are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>His eyelids fluttered. \u201cPaige?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here. You had surgery. They poked around and made sure you\u2019re going to be okay. Apparently you got lucky. The bullet didn\u2019t damage anything you couldn\u2019t live without.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d He stared into her eyes. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I leave the service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTexas. There\u2019s a little house I\u2019ve been looking at outside of Austin. I\u2019m thinking of getting my credentials and teaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be good at that.\u201d He opened his eyes and drew in a breath. \u201cHow small is the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout twelve hundred square feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much room for anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. She felt it stutter, then still completely. \u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be anyone interested. I haven\u2019t bought the house yet. I could get something bigger, if you wanted.\u201d</p> <p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cI remember when you told me you didn\u2019t regret losing me. I want to be someone you\u2019d regret losing.\u201d</p><p>She bent down and kissed him. \u201cI was mad,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI did regret losing you.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cI doubt that, but it\u2019s nice of you to say it. I want to change, Paige. I want to matter to you.\u201d</p><p>Emotions flooded her. They came on so quickly, she didn\u2019t know which one to experience first.</p><p>\u201cYou do matter. I love you, Alex.\u201d</p><p>The curve turned into a smile. \u201cI love you more. Because you\u2019re a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou act like you\u2019ve got a stick up yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too emotional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too by the book.\u201d</p><p>He gazed at her. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change,\u201d he said. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, except I think I want to love you a little more each day. Are you all right with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever better.\u201d</p><p>Joe wasn\u2019t sure what the other patients in the small hospital thought about the invasion. There were Marcellis everywhere, Secret Service agents, military personnel, the president, and his two daughters.</p><p>He\u2019d been excused from his debriefing to visit Brenna, who\u2019d just given birth. As he left her room, a marine stopped him and said the president would like to see him. Joe followed the man to a busy office on the ground floor of the building. But instead of hospital staff manning the phones7, there were agents and military officers.</p><p>Joe walked up to the president and saluted.</p><p>Ryan Jensen looked him over. \u201cYou\u2019re the man who rescued my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, done. Now, what exactly are your intentions toward her?\u201d</p><p>The room went silent. For a split second, no one spoke, no one pretended not to be listening. Then a phone rang and the various staff members returned to their work, although Joe had a good idea they were all still waiting to hear his answer.</p><p>Joe squared his shoulders, looked his commander in chief in the eye, and said, \u201cI love her and I intend to ask her to marry me, sir. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Jensen didn\u2019t blink. \u201cI see. And if she were to agree, where would you live? On base?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. I\u2019ll be leaving the navy to help run the Marcelli winery. I thought we could build a house near the hacienda. Darcy likes it there, sir. She likes my family. It\u2019s a good place to raise children.\u201d</p><p>Jensen\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cMy daughter is an extremely special young woman. You\u2019d better take damn good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Joe turned and saw Darcy standing in the doorway. She looked from him to her father and sighed.</p><p>\u201cStop interrogating Joe. What if he doesn\u2019t want to marry me? You can\u2019t make him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to bet?\u201d the president asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it\u2019s an executive order any of us would be proud of,\u201d she told him, then turned to Joe. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll get my father off your back.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to her and took her hands in his. \u201cI don\u2019t want him off my back,\u201d he said, staring into her eyes and knowing he would never get tired of looking at her. \u201cI want him monitoring everything I do because then he can see how happy I\u2019m going to make you. And because you deserve that. I love you, Darcy. I want to marry you. I want you to have the wedding of your dreams and a life so filled with happiness, you can\u2019t stop telling people how lucky you are.\u201d</p><p>A single tear trickled down her cheek. He brushed it away with his thumb. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m already so happy.\u201d She threw herself at him. \u201cI love you, Joe. I want to marry you. I want to get married in the gazebo on the winery grounds and have a dress made by the Marcelli women. I want to be a part of your family, and I want you to be a part of mine. I want to have kids and dogs and learn about wine and live with you until we\u2019re older than Grammy M and Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou up to the task?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d</p><p>They kissed again and went on kissing until the sound of someone clearing his throat interrupted. Joe pulled back. \u201cThink I should ask your dad\u2019s blessing?\u201d he asked with a grin.</p><p>Darcy nodded. \u201cHe\u2019ll say yes, but it would be a nice gesture.\u201d</p><p>He turned to the president, who eyed him with two parts suspicion and one part acceptance.</p><p>\u201cOh, did you hear about Brenna?\u201d Darcy asked.</p><p>Joe chuckled. \u201cOh, yeah. Twins. Brace yourself. They run in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can handle it. We can handle anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
