At five feet five inches, it was damned hard to convince the males of her family, all over six feet, that she was serious about anything. But in this one instance, she knew she had no other choice.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is a little bit much for you to take on, Squirt?\u201d Caleb, editor-in-chief of the National Forum and her second oldest brother, smirked with an edge of superiority. Merinus refused to give into his baiting. She looked down the long table, directly into her father\u2019s thoughtful expression. John Tyler was the one to convince, not his moron upstarts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked hard, Dad, I can do this.\u201d She fought to put the steely determination in her voice that she often heard her oldest brother use. \u201cI deserve this chance.\u201d</p><p>She was twenty-four years old, the youngest child in a family of eight and the only daughter. She hated makeup, despised dresses and social functions and she heard often how she was a disappointment to the female race, according to her brothers. She wanted to be a journalist; she wanted to make a difference. She wanted to stand before the man whose picture lay on the table before her and see if his eyes were really that brilliant amber. Perhaps she was more woman than they knew. She was obsessed. Merinus silently admitted to it, and knew she would play hell trying to hide it. From the moment she had seen the picture of the man in question, she had been nervous, panicky, terrified that his enemies would get to him before she could present her father\u2019s offer.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re the best person for this job, Merinus?\u201d Her father leaned forward, clasping his hands on the table before him, his blue eyes serious, thoughtful as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m a woman.\u201d She allowed herself a small smile. \u201cYou put that much testosterone in the same room with just one of the behemoth seven here, and you\u2019ll have an automatic refusal. But he would listen to a woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen to her, or try to seduce her?\u201d one of her other brothers questioned harshly. \u201cThis idea is unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>Merinus kept her eyes on her father and prayed Kane, the oldest brother would keep his mouth shut. Their father listened to him where she was concerned and if he decided it was too dangerous, then there was no way John Tyler would allow her to go.</p><p>\u201cI know how to be careful,\u201d she told him softly. \u201cYou and Kane trained me well. I want this chance. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>And if she didn\u2019t get it, then she would take it on her own. She knew her brothers couldn\u2019t make contact, but she could. She suppressed a shiver at the thought. Some would say the man wasn\u2019t even human. A genetic experiment conceived in a test tube, carried to term by a surrogate and inheriting the genes of the animal his DNA had been altered with. A man with all the instincts and hunting abilities of a lion. A perfectly human looking male. A man bred to be a savage killer. Merinus had read the notes, experiments and the thirty-year journal of the scientist who carried him within her body. Dr. Maria Morales had been a friend of her father\u2019s in college. It was she who had the box ready to be delivered to John in the event of her death. It was his decision who would carry out the woman\u2019s last request.</p><p>He was to find her surrogate son at the location she had given. Help him defeat the secret Genetics Council by convincing him to come forward, making a way for him to find safety. She had enough proof to get them digging. Kane had done the rest. They had names of the Council, proof of their involvement, everything but the man they created.</p><p>\u201cThis is too dangerous to trust to her,\u201d Caleb argued again. The others were silent, but Merinus knew they would voice their opinions soon enough.</p> <p>Merinus took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI get the story, or I follow whichever moron in this room gets it. You won\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis coming from the woman who refuses to wear makeup or a dress?\u201d another brother piped in with a snicker. \u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have what it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take being a whore,\u201d she bit out furiously, turning on the youngest brother. \u201cIt\u2019s simple logic, dunce. A woman, whether in pants or a dress will draw more attention from a man than any other man will. He\u2019s careful, he doesn\u2019t trust easily. Maria\u2019s notes state that plainly. He won\u2019t trust another man. The basic male threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he could very well be just as dangerous as he was created to be,\u201d Caleb argued for Gray as he swiped his fingers through his short brown hair. \u201cDammit, Merinus, you have no business even wanting to be anywhere near this bastard.\u201d</p><p>Merinus took a deep breath. She lowered her eyes, staring down at the bleak loneliness reflected through glossy paper. His eyes mesmerized her, even in the picture. There were decades of sadness reflected there. He was thirty years old now, single, alone. A man without a family or even a race to call his own. How terrible it must be, and to be hunted as well was a tragedy.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay here,\u201d she said loud enough for them all to hear. \u201cI\u2019ll follow whoever goes out there and I won\u2019t let you hound him.\u201d</p><p>The silence was heavy now. Merinus could feel eight sets of eyes on her, varying degrees of disapproval reflected in their expressions.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with her. I can handle the research part, Merinus can make contact.\u201d Kane\u2019s voice had Merinus jerking her head up in surprise.</p><p>Shock echoed along her body as she realized that the brother who suffocated her the most was actually willing to help her in this. It was hard to believe. Kane was arrogant and ninety percent of the time, the world\u2019s worst jerk. He was an ex-Special Forces commander as bossy as any man ever born. For the first time she looked directly at him. His expression was cool, but his eyes were angry. Deep and hot with fury, the dark blue orbs met hers without their usual light of teasing mockery. The intensity in his look almost frightened her. He wasn\u2019t angry with her, she could tell, but Kane was pissed. And a pissed Kane was not a good thing.</p><p>Merinus was aware of her father sitting back in his seat, watching the eldest son now with surprise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put a lot of time in this already, Kane,\u201d John remarked. \u201cSix months at least. I thought you would be ready for a rest?\u201d</p><p>Kane glanced at his father, shrugging his shoulders with a tight movement.</p><p>\u201cI want to see it through. I\u2019ll be close enough to help her out if she needs me, but also able to do the research that could be too damned dangerous for her. If she can be ready to leave tonight, then we can do this her way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d Her response was instantaneous. \u201cJust tell me what time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe ready at four. We have an eight-hour drive ahead of us and I want to do some recon before morning. Damn good thing you don\u2019t care if you chip a few nails, brat, because you\u2019ll be doing just that.\u201d</p><p>He came to his feet abruptly as the men around him erupted into a furious argument. Merinus could only watch him silently, amazed at his decision. What the hell was up with this?</p><p>He ignored the heated protests of his other brothers. The arguments of Merinus\u2019 safety, the lack of assurance that \u2018some damned hybrid animal\u2019 wouldn\u2019t infect her. Merinus rolled her eyes, then bit her lip nervously as Kane\u2019s face tightened into a mask of dangerous fury. His eyes went dead. She couldn\u2019t describe it any other way. As though no life or light resided inside him. It was a scary look. The room silenced. No one but no one messed with Kane when he looked like that.</p><p>\u201cBe ready, baby sister,\u201d he said evenly as he passed by her. \u201cAnd if you pack one damned dress or a single tube of lipstick, then I\u2019ll lock your ass up in your bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, Kane,\u201d she whined sarcastically. \u201cThere goes my luggage quota. Asshole.\u201d He knew better than to think she would pack either one.</p><p>\u201cKeep your nose clean, brat.\u201d He flicked the ends of her long brown hair as he walked by her. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up this evening.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Sandy Hook, KY</p><p>That was not a sight for virgin eyes. Merinus trained her binoculars on the vision below her, stretched out in the warming rays of the sun, as naked as a man could be and more than a little aroused. That gorgeous, heavily veined shaft of male flesh rose a good eight inches\u2014no less, could be more\u2014from the base below his flat abdomen. It was thick and long and mouth-wateringly tempting. She blew out a hard breath, lying flat on the rock she had found, the only viewpoint into the small sheltered back yard. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him.</p><p>Callan Lyons was tall. At least six feet, four inches, muscular, broad chested and narrow hipped, with</p><p>powerful thighs and the most gorgeous damned legs she had ever seen. This just wasn\u2019t a sight that a nice, prudish little journalist like herself should be seeing. It could give a girl ideas. Ideas like how it would feel to lie next to him, rub over him, kiss that smooth, golden skin. She shivered at the thought. She and Mr. Lyons had been playing an amusing little game for over a week now. She pretended not to know him, who he was, where he could be found, and he pretended she wasn\u2019t snooping around town asking questions about him and his deceased mother and where he lived. It had gone so far as direct conversation several times. Like she hadn\u2019t come prepared, she thought mockingly. Papers, notes, memos, pictures, the whole nine yards. She had studied the man for weeks before demanding this story. She still couldn\u2019t believe Kane had stood by her and brought her with him to contact Callan. Not that he wasn\u2019t breathing down her neck half the time. He would be now if he hadn\u2019t had to run back to D.C. to talk to a scientist they thought might have been involved with the original experiments. And Merinus was supposed to be finding out about Callan\u2019s mother and making contact with the elusive object of her fascination.</p><p>So here she was, on the story of her life, and instead of the investigative reporting she should be doing on the man below, she was watching him sun himself. But what a sight. Tanned, muscular skin. Long, golden brown hair, the color of the lion that was supposedly infused into his DNA structure. A strong, bold face, gorgeous, almost savage in its planes and angles. And lips, full male lips with just a hint of a merciless curve. She wanted to kiss those lips. She wanted to start with his lips and kiss and lick her way down. Across that broad chest, the hard, flat stomach to the erection rising from between his tanned thighs. She licked her lips at the thought.</p><p>She jerked as she felt her cell phone vibrating at her hips. She grimaced impatiently. She knew who it was. It had to be her oldest, most aggravating brother.</p><p>\u201cWhat, Kane?\u201d she hissed as she flipped the phone open and settled it against her ear. She was rather proud that her eyes never once strayed from all that male glory below.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been Dad,\u201d Kane reminded her, his voice flat and hard.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been the Pope too, but we know the averages on that one,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d he growled almost affectionately.</p><p>\u201cWhy Kane, how sweet,\u201d she simpered. \u201cI love you too, asshole.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief chuckle over the line, making her smile in response.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the story going?\u201d His voice turned serious, too serious.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting there. I have an appointment later today with a woman willing to talk about the mother. She was murdered in her own home. Dad doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>Maria Morales, known as Jennifer Lyons in the small Southern California town had died at the hands of an attacker, not a thief or a random victim, but someone who wanted only blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to learn researching the mother?\u201d Kane asked her. \u201cYou need proof on the son, Merrie, don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m after, big shot,\u201d she bit out. \u201cBut to get to the son, I need information. Besides, someone\u2019s trying to give me the runaround on Morales. You know how I hate that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was a puzzle there, just as big a puzzle as the one stretched out on the deck below her. Sweet Heaven. She watched as his hand moved to his scrotum, not to scratch as she assumed, but to caress, stroke. There went her damned blood pressure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m research, remember?\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou are just contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can do some of both,\u201d she hissed.</p> <p>There was a weary sigh across the line.</p><p>\u201cHave you made contact with Lyons yet? Offered him the deal Dad has set up?\u201d Yeah, the deal of a lifetime, show yourself, tell your story for us, and we\u2019ll make you famous. Fuck your life. She hadn\u2019t liked that deal to begin with but she knew it was the only one Callan was ever likely to receive that would provide any measure of security.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Getting there.\u201d She fought to breathe evenly as his hand clasped the base of that thick cock and he began stroking all that firm, wonderful flesh.</p><p>He was going to masturbate. Incredulity flared through her system, especially her vagina, at the realization. Right here before her eyes the man was going to masturbate. She couldn\u2019t believe it. His hand barely circled the broad shaft, moving slow and easy, almost lazily from tip to base. She felt the flesh between her thighs heat. The muscles of her vagina clenched, moistened, her womb contracted as sensual heat speared her body like a bolt of lightning. Her nipples hardened, ached. Her body became so sensitive she could feel the breeze caressing her bare arms now, like the stroke of a ghostly lover.</p><p>Gracious, was this how men felt when they watched women masturbate? No wonder they liked it so well. Long, broad fingers stroked over his cock from tip to base, the fingers of his other hand gripped the sac beneath, massaging it in time to the stimulation of the other hand. Where was a damned breeze when she needed it? She was due to overheat any minute.</p> <p>\u201cHurry, Merinus, you don\u2019t have the rest of your life,\u201d Kane grunted. \u201cThe bastard has mercenaries stalking him. I can\u2019t keep your ass covered forever, you know. I have three more days here, and Dad\u2019s pitching fits over you being there by yourself.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, mercenaries. She blinked as she watched those hands cover the thick head of his own erection, the tips of his fingers caressing the area just underneath. She licked her lips, wishing she was there helping him. She was a doomed virgin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurry, I promise,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNow let me get off here so I can get some damned work done. I don\u2019t have time to bullshit with you all day.\u201d</p><p>She heard him sigh roughly.</p><p>\u201cCheck in soon. You wait too long to call,\u201d he accused her.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? You call everyday instead,\u201d she told him absently. \u201cI have to go, Kane. Got work to do.</p> <p>Chat with ya later, hon.\u201d</p><p>She heard him curse as she disconnected and tucked the little phone back into its handy case at her hip. Good Lord, she was going to have a stroke. Cat boy was playing his cock like a finely tuned instrument now. She could have sworn she saw the head pulse, throb. His hips arched, then a thick stream of creamy semen erupted from the tip, splattering on that hard abdomen and coating the rough hand.</p><p>\u201cOh man, let me taste,\u201d she whispered, unable to take her eyes from the sight. Then he stretched, his eyes opening. She breathed in sharply as their gazes connected, a self-satisfied smile stretching across those wonderful lips. Of course, he couldn\u2019t know she was there, she assured herself. It just wasn\u2019t possible. Was it?</p><p>Callan chuckled to himself as he turned his gaze away from where the woman thought she was hiding. Damn her, he could smell her arousal on the breeze, even across the distance of nearly a mile. Didn\u2019t she read her own homework? He knew the files she had hidden in her truck clearly stated he had exceptional eyesight, hearing and smell. Though he had never smelled another woman\u2019s heat in quite the same manner as he did hers.</p><p>He rose from the deck, stretched again, presenting her a glimpse of the tight muscles of his ass as he snickered in enjoyment. Teasing the little journalist was more fun than he ever imagined it would be. Each time she approached him, pretending she had no clue who he was, it was a test in patience, wondering when she would snap. He doubted it would be much longer. Not that he intended to touch her. Callan sobered on that thought. No, it was better he didn\u2019t. Hell, it would have been better if he had left when she first arrived, but there was something about her that held him firm, kept him curious. The rumor of a cat\u2019s curiosity wasn\u2019t folklore, though he could have done without a measure of that specific genetic mark.</p><p>\u201cShe still up there?\u201d Sherra stepped to the doorway of the house as he pulled shorts over his hips, covering his still hard cock. \u201cQuite a show you gave her, Callan.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling broadly, though there was a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m enjoying the game too much.\u201d He grinned back at her. \u201cShe has a unique way of going after a story, you have to admit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr going after you.\u201d Sherra moved back from the doorway as he entered the kitchen. \u201cDoc wanted to see you again in the lab. Your latest tests were a little off, he wanted to run them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff how?\u201d Callan frowned. The monthly tests had never been off. Sherra shrugged. \u201cThe glands along your tongue appear enlarged.\u201d</p><p>Callan ran the side of his tongue over his teeth, frowning at the slight difference in the feel of them. Nothing to worry about, it had happened before.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m catching a cold or something.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHeart rate, adrenaline, semen and blood tests are off too. Could be the equipment, but he wants more samples just to be on the safe side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. We need new equipment already?\u201d He sighed. \u201cThat shit costs, Sherra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeps us sane though,\u201d Sherra reminded him as he pulled a bottle of water from the refrigerator. \u201cGo keep him happy, you know how cranky he gets if a test gets off. He \u2018bout went crazy last year when Taber\u2019s went haywire, remember?\u201d</p><p>Hell yes, he remembered. Taber had been half crazy during that year too. Irritable to the point that he was almost savage. He disappeared for days at a time, no excuses, no apologies.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember a cool half million disappearing from the account for the updated machines too.\u201d</p><p>Callan grimaced. \u201cDammit, he\u2019s going to have to take better care of his toys. That was just a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Sherra grinned, her nose wrinkling, the sharp pout of her lips smoothing out with the smile.</p><p>\u201cBetter go let him have more samples then, just to be sure,\u201d she urged him. \u201cWe don\u2019t want him purchasing new equipment on a whim.\u201d</p><p>Callan shook his head, heading quickly to the underground cavern where the lab was located. It wasn\u2019t the most perfect place to keep their secrets, but it worked. The cool atmosphere wasn\u2019t as damp as most caverns were, it was dry and solid, with a steady underground well and easy access from the house. Doc enjoyed the place and it made it easier to keep their lives secret.</p><p>\u201cMore tests,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI need those like I need this hard cock aggravating the fuck outta me.\u201d</p><p>He would have taken care of the first problem if it would cooperate with any woman other than the tight-assed journalist stalking him. But no, it wilted like limp lettuce if he even attempted it, then shot up like fire forged steel the second her scent reached him. Inconvenient, to say the least. The fact that she was the one woman he couldn\u2019t have wasn\u2019t helping matters. He knew the psychology of it. He wanted her more for the very fact that he couldn\u2019t have her. A journalist stalking him was not a good thing. His secrets were many and his survival depended on him keeping them. He kept a low profile, stayed away from town as much as possible and let few people get to know him, which meant there was only one reason why a journalist, especially a Tyler journalist, would be searching for him. His surrogate mother and her infernal idea that by revealing himself he could attain his freedom was the cause of this. The box she had mailed out to the National Forum and her old college friend, John Tyler, right before her death, hinted at the evidence the man could have. There were notebooks of memos, test results, lab results, DNA sequencing, the whole nine yards needed to bury him, all missing. They had fought over it the night she had been attacked and killed. Argued for hours while the others steered clear of the kitchen where they screamed and cursed like mortal enemies. In the end, she had won though. He had agreed to go with her to New York the minute he was able to pull yet another team of mercenaries off his ass.</p><p>He and the others had left to do just that. When they returned they found Maria in the kitchen where they had left her, lying in her own blood. And now, a year later, Merinus Tyler was searching for him. Which would be okay, he thought, if he could just fuck her and send her on her way. But he had a</p><p>feeling the tenacity and determination he glimpsed in her expression didn\u2019t leave him much hope for that.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The Gass Up station, convenience store and diner were all in the same lot. And Callan was there as well. Merinus pulled into the blacktopped parking area late that afternoon and got out of the SUV slowly as she looked around.</p><p>There were half a dozen vehicles parked here and there, several at the gas pumps and one weary looking pickup with its hood raised, waiting to enter the garage section of the station. Taking a deep breath, Merinus moved quickly to the garage section and the lone man standing outside, gazing rather intently at the innards of the old pickup parked there.</p><p>The game was fun, but getting old. Still, she was reluctant to be the one to end it. Especially after watching him stroke all that hard, glistening flesh of his hard-on to a serious orgasm. She still hadn\u2019t recovered from that one. Neither had the flesh between her thighs. It wouldn\u2019t stop throbbing, demanding the hard stroke of that broad-headed penis deep inside it.</p><p>She took a deep breath anyway and approached the truck cautiously. Today, Callan was dressed in thin faded jeans and T-shirt, a baseball cap covering his hair. She hoped he wasn\u2019t trying for a disguise. If he was, it wasn\u2019t working so well. She had seen him the minute the station had come into view.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, could you tell me where I could find Taber Williams?\u201d Merinus asked him cheerfully, careful to stand well clear of him. Oil marked his gray T-shirt and the snug denim that encased long, muscular legs. Besides, if she got too close, she may not be able to keep her hands out of his jeans. She still hadn\u2019t forgotten the hours past and the sight of all that hard male flesh. But the game was on again. She didn\u2019t know and he wasn\u2019t telling. Stupid game.</p><p>The broad shoulders stiffened, then the head, covered in a red baseball cap turned just slightly, the eyes hidden by dark sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cNot here,\u201d he muttered, then turned back to the engine.</p><p>So much for small town hospitality, Merinus frowned. He was being rude today. Snarly. Male.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where I could find him? Or perhaps leave a message for him?\u201d she asked the wide back. Damn nice form, but hell on manners.</p><p>Those broad shoulders shrugged.</p><p>\u201cTell me. I\u2019ll tell him.\u201d Short and to the point, but he never did raise his head from the object of his attention, namely the motor and not Merinus.</p><p>Merinus dug one of her small cards from her jeans pocket and handed it to him.</p><p>\u201cThis is my cell phone number. Could you ask him to call me as soon as possible? It\u2019s important that I get in touch with him.\u201d She was becoming irritated with the curt, who-the-hell-cares attitude he was displaying. He could at least bother to pretend to be interested. Maybe she was playing it too cool.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get it.\u201d The card disappeared into oil-splattered jeans. Merinus narrowed her eyes at the man.</p><p>\u201cCould you tell me where he lives? I could just give him the message myself,\u201d she finally bit out between clenched teeth.</p><p>Muscles rippled as he shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cLives here for the most part,\u201d she was told. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merinus waited, but there was no other information forthcoming.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Callan Lyons? Could you tell me where I can reach him?\u201d she asked sweetly, allowing a shade of mockery to infect her tone.</p><p>There was a long pause as the man reached into the motor and adjusted wires, then thumped at the metal.</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d she asked him with false sweetness. \u201cCallan Lyons? Do you know where I could find him?\u201d</p><p>Those broad shoulders shrugged again, and Merinus gritted her teeth in anger.</p><p>\u201cWho knows where Lyons is,\u201d he finally said. \u201cHe comes and goes.\u201d</p><p>Merinus rolled her eyes. Wasn\u2019t that the truth? And he looked damned fine coming, too.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI\u2019ll just check back later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do that, sweet thing,\u201d he muttered, glancing back up at her with a tight smile. Merinus narrowed her eyes. He laid the wrench he was using on the inside frame carefully as he watched her as well. She could feel that gaze, starting at her white sneakers and moving slowly up her bare, tanned legs to the hem of her shorts, then up. He paused at the small streak of bare, tanned abdomen, then over her breasts until he reached her face.</p><p>Merinus stared back at him, her eyes narrowed at the insolence she read in his body and expression.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d A single, burnished brow arched above the lenses of his glasses.</p><p>\u201cNothing else,\u201d she muttered, turning and walking quickly to the diner instead.</p><p>Callan watched her go, hiding his smile as she glanced back at him. Damn, she looked fine, he thought. And she was definitely on the hunt. A flare of regret rose in him as he admitted he would have definitely enjoyed the chase if circumstances were different. If he wasn\u2019t who he was, if his own life wasn\u2019t hanging by luck alone, then he could have enjoyed a game or two. And he\u2019d be damned if that woman didn\u2019t look good enough to play with. It made his mouth water, looking at all the smooth, sexy skin, just faintly tanned and as tempting as sin itself.</p><p>But it was, and he was determined that Miss Merinus Tyler would neither become embroiled in his life, nor add to the danger. He could watch her, but he\u2019d be damned if he would let her get any closer. But hell, watching her was damned near as enjoyable as anything he\u2019d ever done in his life. Dangerous woman, he thought. A damned dangerous woman. And her scent. It was all he could do to keep his hands off her, his mouth from tasting her. It was heat and wanting, spice and cream. She could be addicting.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, she don\u2019t give up easy, does she Cal?\u201d Tanner, his younger brother strode slowly from the inside of the garage as Merinus disappeared into the small restaurant.</p><p>\u201cNo, Tanner, she doesn\u2019t give up easy.\u201d Callan grinned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty. All that thick brown hair and those big brown eyes.\u201d Tanner grinned as he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI bet Taber will be real sorry he missed her today.\u201d</p><p>They both knew better than that. Taber was all for Callan meeting up with the little journalist. Callan wasn\u2019t so certain how Taber would feel now that Ms. Tyler was searching for him, though.</p><p>\u201cHelp me get this truck running, Tanner. I need to head home to sleep so I can patrol tonight. And this motor is refusing to cooperate.\u201d Callan twisted at a wire, but still nothing.</p><p>\u201cAhh, you just don\u2019t know how to talk to \u2018em right,\u201d Tanner laughed, pushing Callan out of the way as he moved in to look at the motor. \u201cThese older motors are like women, man. You have to know how to stroke \u2018em, and how to speak real soft and sweet to \u2018em.\u201d He ended his words with a slight twist of his wrist.</p><p>The motor sang to life with the movement, chugging weakly, but willingly.</p> <p>\u201cShow off,\u201d Callan laughed.</p><p>\u201cBring her in later and I\u2019ll tune her up for you.\u201d Tanner pulled a stained rag from his back pocket with a grin and wiped his hands.</p><p>\u201cTell Taber to leave the keys to his truck and I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Callan nodded as he headed for the driver\u2019s</p><p>side door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d Tanner nodded with a broad grin. \u201cAnd if you need any help with that pretty thing later, you just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to,\u201d Callan laughed again, amused by Tanner\u2019s less than obvious ploy. \u201cKeep your jeans zipped, Tanner, and we might keep you alive yet.\u201d More than one father was ready to take a shotgun to the hot-blooded youth.</p><p>Callan didn\u2019t wait for an answer. He gunned the motor, then slid the truck into reverse, backing quickly away from the garage before sliding it in gear and heading home.</p><p>It was late that afternoon when Merinus left the diner and headed back to her motel room, armed with dinner. She was tired, sweaty and cranky. After spending the better part of the day watching over Callan\u2019s house and trying to find the road into it, she was more than a little frustrated. She had seen his truck leave and return to the large cabin, but she had yet to find a road in. How do you hide a road? And she couldn\u2019t get in close enough to follow the graveled track that she could see leading away from the house. To do so meant entering the small clearing in front of it. Not a good idea, as several other people seemed to always inhabit the place.</p><p>She had hiked for miles that day in several different directions, and followed more than one wide path through the forest. Still, nothing.</p><p>She pulled into the parking lot of her motel and breathed a weary sigh. Dinner, then a shower. Tomorrow, she would try again. There had to be a road up there, she was just missing it. That was all. She was beginning to feel more than a little stupid in doing so. Her questions around town were getting her nowhere. Those who admitted to knowing Callan only scratched their heads when she asked for directions to his home. The rest just scratched their heads period and played dumb. Small towns weren\u2019t her thing evidently, because the people just made no sense at all.</p><p>They directed her to the Gass Up station every time she asked about Callan. He was there a lot. She had staked it out first thing. And the very people who swore they didn\u2019t know him acted pretty damned familiar with him when they pulled in.</p><p>Damn him, he knew she was there. She unlocked the door to her room, flipping the light on as she entered. He knew who she was and he probably had a good idea what she wanted, but he still ignored her. Which was likely a good thing. After that little scene this morning, she didn\u2019t know if she could trust herself to keep her hands off him or not.</p><p>Merinus ate quickly, staring absently at the television as she considered that damned driveway into Callan\u2019s property. It had to be there somewhere. Roads didn\u2019t just disappear. Did they?</p><p>The problem plagued her through her dinner and her shower. As she stepped out of the bathroom, wrapped in a terry cloth robe, the phone on the nightstand jangled loudly. Frowning, she picked the</p><p>receiver up cautiously.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d She kept her voice pitched low, wondering who could be on the other side.</p><p>\u201cIs this Merinus Tyler?\u201d It was a man\u2019s voice, rough and cold.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s asking?\u201d</p><p>There was a brief silence.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to find Callan Lyons, get something to write the directions on. You\u2019re missing the right turn.\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt elation fill her. Finally, someone was willing to talk.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Callan?\u201d she asked as she slapped a pad of paper on the small bed table and tugged a pencil from the drawer.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something to write on? Here\u2019s how you get there.\u201d</p><p>Merinus wrote down the directions hastily, concentrating as she tried to remember the landmarks he was giving her. She admitted she hadn\u2019t yet tried that route, but it appeared to go nowhere.</p><p>\u201cDo you have it?\u201d The voice asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d The line disconnected.</p><p>Merinus took a deep breath, staring down at the paper. Could she get there in the dark? It wasn\u2019t too late. There was still at least a good hour left of light. And it wasn\u2019t like she could sneak up on the house anyway.</p><p>Throwing off her robe, she dressed quickly in jeans and a sleeveless blouse before slinging her purse over her shoulder and rushing out to the jeep. The turnoff she was given was only a few miles up the road. Cold Springs, he had said. She remembered seeing the little green sign on her excursions to the neighboring county.</p><p>She had him now. She contained her whoop of joy as she jumped into the jeep and started the ignition. He could run, but if she could find that road to his home, there was no way he could hide from her any longer.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Nearly an hour later, she was clenching her teeth in sheer desperation as she made yet another turn along one of the country back roads she had taken in her search for Callan\u2019s home. The written directions beside her were giving her few clues to where she actually was as her jeep bumped and nudged itself along a pitted dirt road that seemed to lead to nowhere.</p><p>Applying the brake, Merinus sat and looked around in confusion. How had she done it? She could have sworn she had taken the right road a few turns back.</p><p>\u201cLord, save me from simple minded directions,\u201d she groused. Pushing her hair back from her forehead, she put the jeep in reverse and turned around in the wide grassy shoulder that bordered the track. Surely it couldn\u2019t be this difficult, she thought. Hell, she had never gotten lost in any big city she had ever been in, and now this little hick county was getting the best of her. It couldn\u2019t be happening, her brothers would laugh her out of the nation if they found out.</p><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d She pulled off the road again several miles later, looked around and admitted defeat. She was lost. Well and truly and irrevocably lost, and she had no one to blame but herself. Heaving a sigh, she looked around wearily. There had to be a way out of here. Something she had missed somewhere. Getting out of the SUV, she stretched her tired muscles, then paced over to the edge of the road, looking into the valley below for some sign of civilization. There wasn\u2019t a sign to be found. All she could see was the same thing around her, trees and thick brush, and not even the roof of a house or a barn. Not that a barn meant anything around here, she had seen many of them, ransacked and falling down from neglect, nowhere near a house. After looking around for a moment longer, she walked to the other side of the road and began to climb the forested rise there. Maybe, if she could get further up, she could see something. There had to be a house somewhere. It wasn\u2019t like she was in the desert or the rainforest, dammit. People lived here. That farmer had assured her earlier that if there was a road, then it led somewhere. So something or someone had to be out here. And she was going to have to find them soon. It was getting dark, and she sure as hell didn\u2019t want to be stuck out here alone after dark.</p><p>As she entered the thicker part of the forest, she turned around to make certain she could still see the SUV. As she did, a noise behind her startled her, causing her to turn in fear. The man stood several feet in front of her, his eyes dark beneath the camouflage brim of his hat as he watched her. Merinus felt her heart begin to race rapidly in fear as his eyes traveled over her body, sparkling with a deadly intent.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do we have here?\u201d The man was tall, his camouflage hat pulled low over black smudged eyes, his face hard and menacing in the shadows of the forest. Merinus felt fear skate through her body. Her heart pumped quickly in her fear, the blood thundering in</p><p>her ears as she took in the cold, harsh expression of the man\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d Merinus backed up as the man loomed over her, a leer spreading across his face. \u201cI was just looking for a way off the mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost are you?\u201d he sneered, his gaze stripping her. \u201cPoor little thing. You need some help, do you?\u201d</p><p>He sounded suspiciously like the guy who called with the stupid directions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I can manage.\u201d Merinus backed away slowly, fighting the panic spreading through her body. As she tried to back away, her arms were grabbed from behind and fear shot through her with the force of a tidal wave. She felt her system clog with hysteria as she felt the hard grip, felt the harder body behind her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe we can help you find your way.\u201d The voice behind her suggested as the steel hard hands pulled her closer against his tall male body. \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like to party with us a little first, though.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a question; it was a statement of intent. Merinus swallowed tightly as she fought to keep her sanity as the fear washed over her. She was in a shitload of trouble and she knew it. God. What did Kane tell her? What did he say to do?</p><p>As the man behind her tightened his grip, she released the muscles of her legs, lifting her feet from the ground. A startled sound from the man behind her was her only warning. As she began to fall, Merinus tucked her body and rolled away from the men then jumped to her feet to run. Her screams shattered the forest as she heard the first guy give a quick order to catch her. She ran, and she screamed. She didn\u2019t try to conserve energy, because she knew she most likely wouldn\u2019t make it to the jeep anyway, so she used it to pierce the lonely countryside with her terrified cries. She almost made it to the jeep. She was within feet of the protective shelter when she was tackled, her body slamming into the hard, gravel encrusted ground with enough force to knock the breath from her body and to still her cries.</p><p>\u201cBitch,\u201d the man cursed as she cried out. He jerked her arms behind her and she was hauled roughly to her feet.</p><p>Fighting to breathe, the metallic taste of her own blood in her mouth, the sickening stench of her own terror wrapped around her as she was once again face to face with one of her attackers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a journalist,\u201d she gasped. \u201cMerinus Tyler. The National Forum. There will be people looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s a pretty little journalist like yourself doing around here?\u201d If it were possible, his voice became colder, crueler. \u201cMaybe we should teach you where not to stick your pretty little nose, Ms. Tyler.\u201d</p><p>Merinus had no warning, she had nothing to prepare her for the hand that shot out and hit her face with enough force to snap her head around and send stars shooting across her vision. As the world seemed to darken around her, she could have sworn she heard deep-throated growls and a vicious feline snarl echo</p><p>through the forest.</p><p>Merinus fell to the ground, dazed as she was suddenly released, the sound of her attackers\u2019 hard soled boots thudding quickly away from her as several gunshots were fired. Bracing her hand on the rough gravel of the road, she fought desperately to scramble to the SUV. She had to get in the truck. The cell phone was there. She would call the sheriff, surely he knew enough about the area to find her.</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d Male hands supported her carefully, even as she shrank from the touch with a ragged cry. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, come on, let\u2019s hurry and get you in the truck and get you the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt the soft seat, fought to pull herself onto it despite the hands that lifted her tenderly, if quickly into it.</p><p>\u201cGet started now.\u201d The rough order was given from whoever jumped in next to her and slammed the door closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she doing out here anyway?\u201d a female voice demanded as the motor of the truck fired up and the quick lurch and rough jerking of the vehicle signaled the speed the driver had pulled out with. Breathing easier now, Merinus raised her head and stared into the most electrifying, golden colored eyes she had ever seen. A gasp escaped her lips, and then to her profound humiliation and distress, she felt darkness closing slowly over her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna faint...\u201d Darkness closed over her, soft and inviting as she slumped against Callan\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Callan cradled her close to his chest with one arm while he braced himself with the other. He was still fucking shaking. He couldn\u2019t help but clutch her against him, his cheek pressed against her head as he thanked God over and over that he had gotten to her in time. What the hell was she doing up there? There was nothing but broken cliffs and wilderness for miles in every direction. He knew she was desperate to find the track into his driveway, but surely she had enough sense to know it wasn\u2019t up there.</p><p>\u201cHey, look at this.\u201d Sherra extended a piece of paper to him as she fought to move the vehicle quickly down the mountain. \u201cWhere are we taking her? Your place or her room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer room.\u201d Callan took the paper from her hand, glancing at the scribbled directions written on it.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did she get this?\u201d</p><p>He met Sherra\u2019s gaze in the rear view mirror.</p><p>\u201cLooks like the boys are wanting to play, Callan,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen you with her, know she\u2019s searching for you.\u201d</p><p>A tool. That\u2019s all she had been to them. A means of taunting him, of taking something they thought he wanted. He hadn\u2019t been careful enough. Somehow, he had let the bastards see his interest in her. He lifted her into his lap, holding her closer, absorbing the shock of the jeep bouncing over the rutted road to protect her from it. She was so light in his arms, her body delicate and small against his taller, broader</p> <p>length.</p><p>He inhaled her scent, fighting to ignore the hard throb of his erection beneath his jeans, the desire to caress her skin with his lips. He contented himself with rubbing his cheek against the silk of her hair. A soft, peaches and cream scent lingered in it, as it did on her skin. Tempting him. He always had been partial to peaches in any form.</p><p>\u201cCallan, what are you going to do?\u201d Sherra pressed him.</p><p>Merinus was in danger now, they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cPut Dayan on watch for her,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know him. Tell him to stay as close as possible, just in case. Have him call me if trouble comes around her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble doesn\u2019t have to find her, she finds it, evidently,\u201d Sherra remarked. Callan smiled, his fingers rubbing over Merinus\u2019 arm softly. She didn\u2019t back down much, he had to give her that. She was stubborn as hell, but he didn\u2019t consider that a good trait in this case.</p><p>\u201cShe still out of it?\u201d Sherra asked worriedly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So hurry and get to that damned motel before her nosy ass wakes up. We\u2019ll be in for it good if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He could just imagine her pleasure, which wouldn\u2019t be mutual, to find herself in his arms right now. Not to mention the damned questions that would come pouring out of her mouth. She was just waiting on the chance to lay into him, and he wasn\u2019t too eager to give it to her. It was coming. He knew the only way to avoid her would be to leave the county again. Something he was going to do soon anyway to lure the damned soldiers away before they learned about the whole Pride. As far as the Council knew, the others had died in that damned explosion more than ten years ago. He wanted to keep it that way.</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d Sherra pulled up to the motel room door swiftly. She grabbed Merinus\u2019 purse, searched around then pulled the key from its depths.</p><p>Callan let her open the door before he quickly exited the vehicle, Merinus limp in his arms, and strode inside. He laid her on the bed, noticing the white robe that lay on the mattress, the remains of her dinner on the table. The television was on, the sound turned down, a low light burned beside the bed. He moved away from her, reluctant, regretting the need to leave before she awoke. He touched her cheek, a fleeting caress, then before he could stop himself, he leaned over, touching his lips to the corner of her mouth, his tongue barely glancing the soft curves. She was as soft and as sweet as he knew she would be.</p><p>\u201cCallan, we need to hurry,\u201d Sherra whispered from outside the door. \u201cBefore someone sees us.\u201d</p><p>Merinus\u2019 lips parted, a low groan vibrating in her throat as her head turned, unconsciously seeking more of the caress. Her tongue touched his, hesitant, unsure. He fought to keep the kiss light, to deny his need to stroke the heated depths of her mouth as he wanted to. He contented himself with a soft tangle with her tongue, then drew back quickly and forced himself to leave the room. He closed the door softly behind him as Tanner\u2019s truck pulled in beside the jeep. Following Sherra he</p><p>jumped into the cab quickly, silently, watching the door as Tanner reversed. He stared straight ahead, ignoring Sherra\u2019s worried look, ignoring his own needs pulsing hot and demanding through his blood stream. Son of a bitch, he wanted Merinus. He wanted to lay against her, stroke every sweet curve of that slender body before burying his cock so deep inside her that neither one of them would ever be free. As they pulled out of the parking lot, Callan watched as Dayan pulled into a small, secluded parking area within sight of Merinus\u2019 door. She would be watched carefully until he could leave. He should have left sooner, before those damned mercenaries had somehow figured out his attraction for her. Before they decided to use her against him.</p><p>\u201cCall Taber in when we get to the station,\u201d he told Tanner, his voice cold as he made his decision. \u201cWe go after those bastards tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, Callan.\u201d Tanner\u2019s voice was edged with fury. He may not be personally involved, but Merinus was a female, she was supposed to be protected, no matter the cost. The younger man rarely came to violence until faced with the abuse of a female, young or old.</p><p>\u201cSherra, you go back to the motel, send Dayan back.\u201d Callan knew Dayan would be pissed, his answer was to ignore the bastards. \u201cYou stick around and watch out for her, take Dawn if you want to.\u201d</p><p>Sherra was more than capable of protecting herself, but Callan hated sending her alone anyway.</p><p>\u201cGet a piece of them for me.\u201d Memories and bitterness filled her voice.</p><p>\u201cFor all of us then.\u201d Callan nodded as Tanner pulled into the Gass Up. \u201cLet\u2019s get things together and we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p><p>They knew where the soldiers camped, though the men were unaware of it. Like the others before them, they thought their training and their precautions would hide them from the instincts ingrained in Callan\u2019s DNA. They would find out otherwise.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>Merinus woke up aching the next morning. Not the flu or summer cold kind of ache. The utterly female ache of needing a man. How a virgin was supposed to know what that ache meant, she wasn\u2019t certain. But there was no doubt that was the cause of it. Her cunt was slick and creamy, her panties damp, too damned damp to suit her. Her breasts were swollen, her nipples distended and hard, and she could have swore she tasted cinnamon on her lips.</p><p>Her lips were sensitive. She ran her tongue over them. They weren\u2019t swollen, just sensitive enough for her to be very aware of them. Then she remembered the night before. She frowned, her brows snapping together in instant ire. Damn him. He hadn\u2019t even stuck around long enough to wake her up?</p><p>She jerked to an upright position, then groaned roughly as her sore muscles protested the effort. Oh hell, now that just hurt. There was no cause for those bastards to act that way. She groaned roughly as she reached for her cell phone. Kane was supposed to take care of this. She keyed his number in swiftly as she stood to her feet. Waiting on Kane to answer, she shed her clothes and pulled on a big, soft cotton T-shirt until she could get to a hot shower.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell were you last night?\u201d His voice came over the line with a stern, cranky tone.</p><p>\u201cWatching soldiers,\u201d she informed him tensely, knowing better than to tell him the truth. \u201cThere are two on the ridge above the Lyons\u2019 house. I thought you had that taken care of.\u201d</p><p>His contacts in the private and government sector put him in a place where he would have, or should have known those men were being sent out there. There was silence across the line.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he finally cursed quietly. \u201cPull out, Merinus. Someone\u2019s gone to the trouble to hide these bastards from me. I\u2019ll bring Dad and we\u2019ll come in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll head for another paper at the first offer,\u201d she cut in. \u201cYou aren\u2019t pulling me off this, Kane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Merinus, it\u2019s not safe anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo find out who they are and give them a call. Tell them you\u2019ll rip their balls off and feed \u2018em to your favorite dog or something,\u201d she suggested. \u201cMake them pull back until I can finish this. Don\u2019t start making excuses, either.

No one messed with him, and most people in his little world owed him enough favors that he rarely had to ask for anything twice.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Merrie, why don\u2019t you just pounce on them yourself if you have all the fucking answers?\u201d Kane bit out.</p><p>Merinus bit her lip, painfully aware of the bruise across the left side of her face now. Yeah, that one worked really well.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I can do that,\u201d she mused thoughtfully. \u201cThey looked kinda big, but hey, maybe if I throw your name around a little\u2014\u201d She should have thought of that one yesterday.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he cursed. \u201cYou would, too. Okay. Okay. Just hang on a few hours and let me see what I can find out here. Stay out of trouble, dammit, until I can find something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always stay out of trouble,\u201d she lied smoothly. If Kane knew the trouble she was getting into he would come down, tie her hand and foot and haul her back to New York so damned fast it would make her head spin.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Right.\u201d He grunted absently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting on you.\u201d Evidently he was already hard at work on his trusty little computer.</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d he mumbled, then disconnected.</p><p>Merinus sighed roughly as she flipped the phone off then tossed it on the bed. Dammit. Like she was going to sit around and play dead while he hunted around the Internet for a source of information. Bruise or no bruise, she was hardly finished. And she was growing tired of this game she was playing with Callan.</p><p>Glancing at the clock, she winced at the time. Late morning. She had definitely overslept. A shower and lunch first though, then she was tracking Callan Lyons down and that was that. If she had to stake out that damned gas station until hell froze over. Her phone rang, interrupting that furious thought.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was fast enough,\u201d she said as she brought it to her ear. \u201cDid you threaten their balls or what?\u201d</p><p>There was silence over the line. Merinus frowned.</p><p>\u201cKane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t need as much help as I thought you did yesterday.\u201d The male voice was low, rumbling and filled with amusement. \u201cAny woman who could threaten such an important area is tough enough to take on a few mercenaries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr the asshole that left her unconscious all night,\u201d she bit out. \u201cCallan Lyons, we aren\u2019t going to get along if you keep up like this.\u201d</p><p>That brought a definite chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWho said we had to get along, darlin\u2019? I was trying to help out some. That scream you blasted out rocked my mountain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, big boy, tell me where to find you and I\u2019ll come thank you, real personal like.\u201d Like her foot up his ass for being so damned difficult.</p><p>\u201cHm, tempting offer,\u201d his voice dropped, becoming huskier. Merinus breathed in long and silent. Oh, what that voice did to her insides. Any minute now her juices would be running from her cunt right down her leg.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound tempted enough.\u201d She grinned, her own voice lowering, becoming silky, intimate.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Callan, surely you don\u2019t want to have to rescue me again? I\u2019m not going to give up, ya know?\u201d</p> <p>There was that silence again.</p><p>\u201cYou sound soft, Merinus, too damned soft for what you\u2019re up against,\u201d he finally sighed.</p><p>\u201cCallan, I can\u2019t give up.\u201d She sat down on the bed, gripping the phone tightly. \u201cYou have to talk to me. I have things to show you, things I have to tell you that can only be done in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a story, pretty lady, and I know that\u2019s what you\u2019re after,\u201d he told her, his voice so gentle, so soothing she felt stroked, petted.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhy would you be hiding from me if you weren\u2019t? All I want to do is talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t stop with talk,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. I could be as mean as those soldiers you tangled with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe I wouldn\u2019t fight you.\u201d She closed her eyes, knowing she wouldn\u2019t. Just the sound of his voice had her pulse skyrocketing, her body heating up like a damned furnace. Dammit, if her vagina clenched any tighter she would strangle his cock when it finally got inside her. What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>She could hear him breathing over the phone, deep and rough. She wondered if he heard her as well.</p><p>\u201cLike what you saw the other day?\u201d His shocking question was delivered in a hot, rough voice. Merinus took a deep breath, her tongue running over her dry lips nervously.</p><p>\u201cYou knew I was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I knew. I could feel your hot little eyes on me, Merinus. Do you think I jack off for the hell of it?</p><p>I\u2019m a grown man, not a kid. I don\u2019t get a hard-on with just any stiff breeze anymore.\u201d</p><p>Merinus fought the little whimper that edged in her throat. She clenched her thighs together, fighting the ache there.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were watching. Because I know you want me and you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he growled. He actually growled the words. \u201cDamn you, woman. This is insanity, you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Oh, she knew. She knew it wasn\u2019t the story she wanted anymore. It was just saving his life, revealing a major conspiracy, a crime against nature itself. It was more now, and she felt helpless in the grip of what it had become.</p><p>\u201cI could return the favor.\u201d Where the hell had those words come from? Merinus felt her face flush the minute they came from her mouth.</p><p>There was silence again. Long, thick with tension.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re tempting me.\u201d His voice sounded strangled.</p><p>\u201cYou know where I\u2019m at,\u201d she offered, amazed at the huskiness of her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d He sounded as ensnared by the heated offer as she had been at the sight he had given her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure.\u201d She swallowed tightly, dragging her hand through her hair as she fought the overriding need pulsing in her body now. \u201cBecause I want to be with you. If nothing else, put you through the hell you put me through.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing was rough, but so was his. She could hear the throb of desire in it, the same as it throbbed through her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old for this,\u201d he said, though his voice lacked conviction.</p><p>\u201cToo old for sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor voyeurism. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m actually going to touch you, woman, you\u2019d burn me alive.\u201d</p><p>Once again, there was no real heat in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI want you to touch me.\u201d She was confused by the intensity of her need. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I\u2019m sitting here aching for you so desperately I\u2019d agree to damned near anything. This isn\u2019t normal for me, Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo hunt up an old lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to have one first,\u201d she snapped, offended by the desperation in his tone. \u201cForget it. I\u2019m not going to beg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I might\u2014\u201d he bit out. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not a fucking virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a fucking virgin. Virgins have yet to fuck, remember?\u201d</p><p>He cursed. Low, rough, a rumble amplified by the phone connection as heat seemed to sear her across the airwaves.</p><p>\u201cI want inside you so bad my cock is about to burst,\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo jack off again,\u201d she snarled. \u201cNo, wait an hour first. I want to at least watch.\u201d</p><p>The phone disconnected. Merinus threw it across the room as a squeal of feminine outrage erupted from her throat. Damn him. She ached. No she didn\u2019t, she hurt. And all she could think about was that thick cock sliding into her, thrusting hard and deep, her vagina milking it, caressing it deeper and tighter than his hand had done days before.</p><p>Enough was enough. The game was over. She would be damned if she would lie here, virtually in heat, dying for some hick moron\u2019s touch that didn\u2019t want her. She would take him the message her father sent</p><p>her and get it over with. Lay the offer on the table then head for home. She didn\u2019t need this, and she didn\u2019t need him. Now, if she could just convince her body of that.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cHave you finished hiding from me?\u201d</p><p>Callan knew he was in trouble when he saw her approach him moments before. Trouble was always recognizable. It had a scent, a feel, a low vibration of warning that thrummed through his veins. This feeling rioted through his system now. She stood beside him, watching him with a frown as he tinkered with the reluctant engine of his old truck once again and fought to get a handle on his self-control. The scent of her drifted on the breeze, the scent of fresh, clean woman, the beginning heat of arousal. Those scents lay around her now, tempting him, drawing him.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to answer me?\u201d she inquired, tilting her head, irritation flashing over her expression. Long strands of straight, thick brunette hair fell over her shoulder, caressing silken skin and tempting his hands. Dammit, he didn\u2019t need this kind of trouble. Not after that phone call earlier, not after the hot surge of lust her offer had hit him with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in plain sight. How\u2019s that hiding?\u201d He tested a line into the carburetor. \u201cNow what the hell did you want with me? Didn\u2019t those soldiers give you a nice little warning, Ms. Tyler? They play for keeps.\u201d</p><p>She was intent on ignoring the danger of the situation evidently. She leaned her bare arms against the side of the truck, peering into the guts as though she knew what the hell she was doing.</p><p>\u201cA friend sent me.\u201d She shrugged. That movement caused the gentle curve of her breasts to rise a shade above the scooped neckline of the sleeveless top she wore.</p><p>Red. Dammit, it should be a crime for a woman that damned pretty to wear red. He glanced at her. Her brown eyes, clear and wide, studied the motor intently, rather than looking at him. The sweet spice of her need wrapped around him, making his cock harden demandingly. Big problem, Callan thought. Literally.</p><p>\u201cSo who sent you?\u201d he questioned her with mild interest. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not.\u201d She glanced up at him, suspicion riding her expression. \u201cBut your mother had a few. My father sent me to extend his condolences and to see if you needed anything.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the woman again. Her gaze was knowing now. She had found him and she was more than aware of it. He laid the wrench down on the side of the truck and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou should return to your home, Ms. Tyler,\u201d he told her quietly, warningly. \u201cThis is not the place for you or your father\u2019s questions.\u201d</p><p>Merinus looked around casually, careful to keep her voice low.</p><p>\u201cFather can help you, Callan. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Frustration filled him now. The naivety of journalists often astounded him. They believed so deeply in their freedoms, the public\u2019s right to know and their convictions of justice that they could not see the evil that shrouded them all. The innocence of this journalist fairly took his damned breath away.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He rose to his full height, staring down at her as he took her slender arm in his hand and began pulling her along with him.</p><p>\u201cCome where with you?\u201d Suspicion laced her voice. There was no fear though, and he wanted to rail at her for her courage. The ignorance of her belief that she would come to no harm.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs. To the office.\u201d He pulled her through the garage to the back corner and up the steep stairs that led to Taber\u2019s office.</p><p>The garage and attached store was owned by the Pride, as were all their holdings. But Taber was listed as sole owner on paper. It was better that way. Less suspicion. Less chance of being found. Callan jerked the door open and pushed her inside. Closing it carefully behind them, he turned the lock, reasonably confident of privacy now, considering the sound proof room they were standing in. He would have one chance to bluff his way through this, and one chance only. He was considering how to begin when she drew an envelope out of her purse and pulled out the damning evidence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother to lie to me.\u201d There was a vein of hurt in her voice, as though she knew what he had intended.</p><p>Callan crossed his arms over his chest. He narrowed his eyes on her and let his frustration free in a harsh, rumbling growl that he hadn\u2019t intended to give voice to. The low snarl, catlike in sound, dangerous in purpose, filled the air.</p><p>He watched the woman blink. The pictures fluttered from her hand, the heat of her body rose, the scent of it thicker, mixed now with fear. The pictures lay on the floor now, incriminating, damning. Callan, as a child, a thick lion\u2019s fur covering his body, his eyes, amber gold and bright, shining into the camera. The fur had slowly fallen away, until only a smooth, light scattering of fine, nearly invisible, ultra soft hair remained. The other was a sonogram, and Callan knew pertinent information was recorded on the back of it. Blood type, DNA sequence, anomalies. All recorded. All nails in a coffin that Merinus Tyler could help build.</p> <p>Merinus watched the tall, powerful man as he bent and scooped the pictures from the floor. His face was expressionless, his eyes hard, brilliant amber in the tan darkened features of his face. She hadn\u2019t intended to show him the proof she carried with her, but she had known he was ready to lie to her. The knowledge had vibrated through her body. Lie. The word had been like a whisper, dark and vibrating. But Merinus had proof. She hadn\u2019t come to him with supposition and half-truths. The evidence Maria Morales had sent John Tyler had been conclusive, irrefutable. But to bring truth to the test results and pictures, they needed the man. She hadn\u2019t meant to drop the pictures, but the smooth rumble of warning from his throat had been more than a surprise</p><p>\u201cMaria was like a little packrat,\u201d he sighed, shaking his head as he stared down at the pictures. Long, thick, coarse, tawny gold hair lay below the nape of his neck, framing a sharply lined face, savage in its angles. Wide, tilted eyes, thick lashes and cheekbones with an odd flattened angle where they should curve high and sharp. His nose was aristocratic, but the ridge seemed smoothed out, much as the cheekbones were.</p><p>Merinus ignored the hard beat of her heart as he finally looked at her. Her womb tightened uncomfortably, making her cunt clutch and protest the emptiness there. It was unusual, this sensation. She was well aware it was arousal washing over her. It made her breasts feel swollen, made her nipples harden uncomfortably, and those unusual eyes did not miss the reaction.</p><p>\u201cShe asked Father to help you,\u201d she said, trying to cover her nervousness. \u201cHe wants you to come in with me. He has safeguards set up\u2014\u201d</p><p>He laughed. His lips twisted into a humorless curve and the bitterness in the sound struck at her heart. He shook his head, his gaze mocking.</p> <p>\u201cIf this is why you have come here, Ms. Tyler, then you have wasted your time.\u201d Gone was the good ole boy, in its place a cold, hard creature. She saw it in the tense readiness of his large body, the flash of sharpened incisors at the sides of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t safe,\u201d she told him worriedly. \u201cOur research into this has uncovered a plot to kill\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd eventually they will succeed.\u201d He shrugged as though unconcerned. \u201cWhen they do, steal the body and write your story and good luck to you in living. Until then, I need no help of yours.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flared inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to try to stop them? To keep this from happening again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has already happened again and again and again,\u201d he told her coldly. \u201cThey used wolves as well. To my knowledge, I am the only known success they have achieved.\u201d</p> <p>Merinus shook her head. She had seen the pictures of those pitiful forms, born so deformed that there was no hope of life. Only Callan, as he said, had been their success.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou\u2019re letting them win, Mr. Lyons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am living. I do not kill; I do not follow their command. They have not caught me, nor captured me again since my teens. I will defeat them until I can no longer, Ms. Tyler. Then, as I said, the rest is history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is offering you an alternative,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She fought a shiver that washed over her body as he moved, bringing his body closer to her. Heat suffused her, making the flesh between her thighs moisten. If the feeling wasn\u2019t so strange, she would have been amused.</p><p>Callan Lyons was watching her with a frown, a question in his eyes as he came closer. She watched him inhale deeply, his eyes narrowing on her. As he brushed against her, the shiver couldn\u2019t be controlled. It tightened her scalp, tingled down her neck, then spread out over her body, drawing goose bumps in its wake.</p><p>He stopped behind her, his body so warm the heat seemed to wrap around her. She could feel her body wanting to relax against him, wanting to be surrounded by him. Her thighs weakened, and between them she could feel the slow leak of moisture from her inner flesh, preparing her, readying her. Insanity. She gasped, startled when she felt his chest brush against her back, his head lowering to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI am going to unlock that door, Ms. Tyler. When I do, I want you to walk out of here, get in your vehicle and go home. Make no stops between here and there and do not mention my name or what you know to anyone, do you understand me? It just might keep you alive.\u201d</p> <p>Merinus turned her head, a grin edging her lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to intimidate me, Mr. Lyons?\u201d Good gracious, where had that husky edge to her voice come from? Maybe the same place that the sharp contraction to her womb originated from. She felt him tense behind her. His hand moved to her arm, his fingers curling, the backs of them running softly across her flesh.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what the Council does to pretty little women like yourself?\u201d he asked her, his voice low, a deep rumble of warning from his chest. \u201cThey impregnate you with their latest batch of genetically altered cells. Then they take you out daily, to check the progress. If your body rejects it, then they do it again and again until you either hold the fetus, or you\u2019re too weak to be of use to them any longer. Then they give you to the soldiers to use until you die. It\u2019s not a pretty way to be taken from this earth.\u201d</p><p>Merinus bit her lip as she felt pain, overwhelming, intense, striking at her chest. It wasn\u2019t fear, it was horror, revulsion, absolute pain for the women who had endured it, the man who had obviously seen it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, staring back, seeing only the thin line of anger his mouth had settled into.</p><p>\u201cYou are risking your very sanity being here.\u201d His breath caressed her ear, a shiver working over her skin once again as he spoke to her. \u201cYour sanity and your life. You should leave.\u201d</p><p>His voice throbbed with menace. It pulsed with heated arousal. Thick and husky, it rippled over her nerve endings, seared her cunt.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d She stared forward as he moved again, coming back to face her. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not willing to let them continue to kill and maim, and you shouldn\u2019t be either. We can stop them. My uncle, Samuel Tyler, is a Senator and close to the President. He\u2019s waiting to do whatever is necessary. I have seven brothers, each one doing their part, and my father is willing to put every resource he has within his paper to back you. We have to make them stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think this will stop them?\u201d he asked her incredulously. \u201cYour innocence is to be envied, Ms. Tyler. It\u2019s actually quite frightening. You can\u2019t take these people down.\u201d</p><p>She had to. She couldn\u2019t stand to live if they managed to kill him. He was proud, determined and too damned remarkable in his very humanity to allow them to murder him. She had to convince him that his only safety lay in revealing the horrors he had escaped.</p><p>\u201cYou know who they are. You know what they are. You have the rest of the proof that we need to stop them,\u201d she argued determinedly. \u201cYour mother died because of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother was a victim of a random crime,\u201d he growled. \u201cHad the Council struck her, she would have disappeared and her body returned to me in pieces. The Council did not destroy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no sign of theft.\u201d Merinus had read the police report. \u201cIt was a personal crime, Mr. Lyons. Whoever killed her wanted her dead.\u201d</p><p>Merinus hadn\u2019t come to this place unprepared. Her father had made certain she knew everything involving Maria Morales\u2019 death and the evidence they had against the Council.</p><p>\u201cAnd they succeeded. But it wasn\u2019t the Council.\u201d He stared down at her, his eyes hard, furious. \u201cI know their scent, I know the stench of their evil. As cloying and cold as the scent of your arousal is sweet and hot.\u201d</p><p>Merinus opened her mouth to argue until the last words penetrated her brain. She felt her face flush, her heart rate increase. She stared at him in surprise. How had he known?</p><p>\u201cExplain to me why a young, innocent woman is standing here before me, her cunt wet and prepared for an animal? And I am an animal, sugar, unlike any you will ever know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Merinus trembled beneath Callan\u2019s regard. His amber eyes almost glowed, his voice lowered, husky. A quick, very brief glance below his hips showed a bulge that made her more than nervous. Evidently, she wasn\u2019t the only one afflicted. And an affliction more than described it. She felt fevered, her skin sensitive, ready for his touch. It was unlike anything she had ever known. It was unlike anything she ever wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She heard the nervousness in her voice, the confusion. The longer she stayed in his presence, the worse the temptation to touch him was growing. She stared at his chest, no longer able to stare into his eyes. Those amber depths drew her in, made her want, made her need things she wasn\u2019t certain she should want. She flinched when his fingers gripped her chin, uncertain, almost frightened now. Had he not been aware of the desires flaring in her body, she could have handled this. Could have handled the direct look from his eyes, the caress of his fingers against her chin. She ran her tongue nervously over her dry lips, aware of the sudden fullness in them, the ache, the throb just beneath the skin. His eyes narrowed. His thumb reached out, running experimentally over the soft curve, picking up the moisture from her mouth. Her chest tightened as she tried to breathe normally. She couldn\u2019t seem to draw in enough air to fill her lungs sufficiently. She felt the need to fight for breath, to release the moan she held there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous.\u201d There was that growl again, rumbling just beneath the surface of his words.</p><p>\u201cWhatever this is, Merinus, could mean our lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnomaly.\u201d She bit her lip. She had no answers for this.</p><p>A mocking curve of his lips showed his disagreement.</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as an anomaly when dealing with one such as I,\u201d he assured her. \u201cI\u2019m instinct, Merinus. An animal barely disguised. Any response is one to fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an animal.\u201d She shook her head, seeing the bitterness in his eyes. She drew away from his touch quickly. He made her body weak, pliant. She needed all her wits about her now.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you call it then?\u201d There was a thread of anger running through his voice. \u201cIf I did as you asked, and by some miracle of God did not end up dead, then I would be known as America\u2019s Freak. More experiments, more tests. At least this way, I\u2019m free. As long as I can run faster than their soldiers and hide better than their trackers, then I can survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd is survival enough?\u201d she asked him, angry that he didn\u2019t want more. \u201cWhat about those who will come later? The poor souls that meet their killing criteria? Don\u2019t you feel in some way responsible to stop it?\u201d</p><p>Cynicism washed over his expression.</p><p>\u201cSo passionate,\u201d he murmured, leaning against the wall, his arms crossing over his chest as he watched her. \u201cI\u2019m one man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a nation that will back him,\u201d she argued desperately. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour innocence is to be commended, Merinus,\u201d he bit out, straightening now, stalking closer to her.</p><p>\u201cAs are your motives. But you have no idea of the piece you\u2019ve bitten off here. It\u2019s bound to choke you.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her arm, jerking her against his body, allowing his erection to cushion against her stomach. Merinus breathed in harshly, her hands bracing against his chest as he locked her to him.</p><p>\u201cYou spout off with your morality and your ideas of justice, and all the while your juices froth from your cunt, tempting me, driving me insane with the scent. It\u2019s not the story you want and it\u2019s not justice. You want to be fucked by the Cat Man. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her hips, ground himself against her. Merinus gasped out, fighting against the slow relaxation of her body against his, the needs suddenly swamping her. Where had they come from?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she cried out hoarsely, shaking her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this before I came here. I only wanted to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t this frighten you, Merinus?\u201d His hand gripped her hair, pulling her head back. \u201cAren\u2019t you scared of this sudden lust? Because if you aren\u2019t, you should be. It has me damned near shaking in my boots with my need to lay you over that desk and fuck you until you scream with your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Merinus shuddered, then cried out when his head lowered. His lips went to her neck, his teeth scraping over it in a slow, dangerous gesture. Merinus shook. Her hands gripped his powerful arms, she stared at the ceiling in dazed rapture as his tongue swiped over her skin. The moist roughness, the sandpapery rasp had her going to her tiptoes, silently demanding more. Her head tilted further, exposing the vulnerable curve of her neck. Her skin tingled, screamed out for more.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you taste good, Merinus. Damn good.\u201d He licked across her skin again, and she cried out. She couldn\u2019t believe the sensation. Like rough velvet, only better. A sharp spasm of need rippled through her womb, the clenching muscles of her vagina had her whimpering in arousal. What was this?</p><p>Why did it feel so good when her neck had never been an erogenous zone before?</p><p>Then his lips covered hers. Merinus had been kissed before, many times, but nothing like this. His tongue swept into her mouth and the taste of him was intoxicating. Her tongue met his, drawing him deeper, caressing over him, luxuriating in the taste of him. Hot, spicy. The taste was all male, dark and elusive, conquering. She groaned against his lips, needing more, needing to examine and discover the origin of his taste. But he moved, drawing back, his lips going to her neck once again. His teeth nipped at her skin briefly, a growl emanating from his chest as one hand moved from her hip to below her breast. He was close, so close to the torturously swollen mound, the throbbing nipple. She whimpered, pressing against him, uncaring who or what he was, caring only about the primeval response of her body to his.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here,\u201d he rasped, though he refused to release her. \u201cGet out of here before I do something neither of us will survive.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved from her neck, along her collarbone, sipping, licking as he weaved a path back to the scooped collar of her shirt and the rise of her throbbing breasts. Merinus was burning alive for his touch. Her nipples hardened further, jutting against the soft material of her shirt, hard, desperate for the warmth of his mouth. If he didn\u2019t touch them, if he didn\u2019t suck them deep into his mouth she was going to explode. Oh God, if he did, she would explode anyway. She was close, so very close to orgasm it terrified her. Her blood pumped, rushed through her body. She trembled in his grip, her body arched against the arm at her back as a desperate moan whispered from her throat. She felt the bottom of her shirt jerked from the waistband of her shorts and pulled quickly above the swollen mounds. Her nails bit into his shoulders, confusion, desire, fire tearing through her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell have we done to each other?\u201d His voice whispered the confusion churning in her body. His hand moved, cupping her breast. The dry heat of his flesh against hers had her hips arching in desperation. His thigh slid smoothly between her legs as he turned her, bracing her against the wall, allowing her the minute release of riding the hard muscled thigh pressing between hers. Oh, that felt good. Her clit throbbed, ached, swelled painfully at the friction she created as she rode him.</p><p>\u201cCallan,\u201d her cry was a shocking mixture of fear, overwhelming need, and questioning desperation as his mouth covered the hard nipple that rose pleadingly from her breast. He drew on her, the sensation spearing into her womb, her cunt. His tongue rasped over the hard flesh, the texture of his tongue was rough but incredibly gentle, deeply erotic. He suckled her, laved her, then nibbled at the flesh as she writhed on his thigh, moaning, begging for release.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d He pulled back from her, staring down at her with eyes glittering with lust and confusion. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal, Merinus. This need should not be here.\u201d</p><p>He jerked her shirt back over her breasts, restoring order to her clothes, if not her senses.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He pushed her onto the couch that sat against the wall and began to pace the floor. Merinus shook her head. It wouldn\u2019t stop. The pulsing, throbbing need was only intensifying.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d she gasped, shaking her head. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He paused, turning to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He frowned, staring into her eyes, confusion crossing his face.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped, fighting for control. \u201cYou did something to me. Now make it stop.\u201d</p> <p>Callan came to his knees before her, staring into her eyes, frowning at whatever he saw there. A tremulous laugh escaped her throat.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Callan, you really need to watch those kisses. They\u2019re dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have never been a problem before,\u201d he growled, his fingers lifting to her forehead as though checking for a fever.</p><p>\u201cShare them around do you?\u201d she asked, gritting her teeth against his touch. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I think I\u2019m</p><p>going to call my brothers to come out and kick your ass now.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t. Not really. They would welcome the chance to take her seriously, especially Kane, her hot shot Special Forces brother who held a grudge against the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you feeling?\u201d he asked her quietly. \u201cBesides the obvious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe obvious multiplied as high as you can go,\u201d she bit out, clenching her thighs together. \u201cDo you know I\u2019m a virgin? Seriously, virgins shouldn\u2019t be this turned on. It has to be bad for their health or something. We\u2019re an endangered species, ya know?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the shock in his expression.</p><p>He tilted her head, his gaze going over her neck, then he jerked her shirt up again, examining her breast. Merinus looked down, almost grinning at the site of the love bite that marred her nipple.</p><p>\u201cCallan, that tongue of yours is dangerous.\u201d She moaned as his thumb raked the hard flesh. She heard his low moan an instant before he covered the other peak with his mouth. Her hands went to his hair, holding him close, feeling his tongue stroke her gently, his mouth drawing on her tightly. She squirmed against him, moving her body lower, wanting to press herself tight and hard against the bulge that threatened to burst the seams of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cGod, I smell you. So hot and sweet,\u201d he gasped as he pulled back, his head lowering as he rested it in the valley of her breasts. \u201cI want to taste you so desperately Merinus, that it rages through me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shocked pleasure electrified her body.</p><p>\u201cI want to bury my mouth in that hot little cunt of yours,\u201d he groaned. \u201cI want to lap every bit of your cream and stroke you with my tongue until you give me more.\u201d</p><p>The cream in question wept slowly from her vagina in mute plea for just that. Her swollen clit throbbed, her womb spasmed. His mouth nibbled at the curve of her breast, his tongue stroking the swollen flesh, the rough texture of it making her shiver with need.</p><p>\u201cPlease, do something,\u201d she groaned, her thighs tightening on his as he pushed his cock deep into the vee of her thighs. \u201cI swear, Callan, your touch is like a drug.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. She felt his muscles tense, then an oath sizzled from his mouth as he jerked away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to regret asking. But what\u2019s wrong now?\u201d She laid her head back against the couch, breathing heavily as she dragged her shirt back down.</p><p>She could hear him fighting for breath as well. She opened her eyes, watching as he stood several feet from her, watching her.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of here, I\u2019m going to fuck you,\u201d he bit out savagely. \u201cThink about it, Merinus. You don\u2019t know me. I\u2019m a stranger to you. A genetic animal that\u2019s getting ready to tear your clothes from your body and fuck you on a grease stained couch. Is that how you want your first time?\u201d</p><p>Merinus frowned. \u201cWell, it didn\u2019t top my list of things to do today. But I\u2019ve always been good at</p><p>improvising.\u201d</p><p>She could think of no reason not to lie back on the couch and let him have his way with her. She didn\u2019t understand his problem and her body was in such a riot that she really didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, think,\u201d he bit out, moving to sit on the opposite end of the couch as he raked his fingers through his hair. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been assaulted by lust in such a way. This cannot be normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would I know?\u201d she frowned. \u201cI told you, I\u2019ve never done this before. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I what?\u201d he questioned her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had sex before?\u201d she asked him impatiently. \u201cYou seem so reluctant, I was just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have had sex before.\u201d He frowned. \u201cIt was a required subject before my escape from the labs. I had sex everyday for over two years.\u201d</p><p>Shock tore through her system.</p><p>\u201cYou were sixteen when you escaped,\u201d she said, horrified. \u201cThat was too young.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a glare. \u201cI was recaptured at seventeen and held until I was twenty before I destroyed the labs. You need to be certain of your sources, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey taught you how to have sex?\u201d She couldn\u2019t imagine anything so barbaric.</p><p>\u201cOf course, killing a person can be done in many ways. They taught me how to bring pleasure and how to inflict pain.\u201d He sneered. \u201cI know every way imagined to fuck a man or a woman, with any degree of each sensation.\u201d</p><p>Merinus swallowed tightly, blinking over at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy would they do that to you?\u201d</p><p>Overriding her lust was her terrible pain for this man. He looked disgusted, both with himself and with her.</p><p>\u201cThey did that to train me,\u201d he reminded her coldly. \u201cI was to be a killer, Merinus. There are many ways to kill, to maim, to force the information you want from your victim. I was taught all those things. But that does not answer the question of our present problem. I don\u2019t remember a time when my kiss has ever drugged a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me,\u201d she breathed roughly. \u201cYou kiss really good, Callan.\u201d</p><p>His lips kicked up at the corner and his eyes filled with a weary sort of humor.</p><p>\u201cYou are a dangerous woman. How are you feeling now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHorny,\u201d she sighed. \u201cVery horny, Callan.\u201d</p><p>The hot throb between her thighs was threatening to soak through her shorts. She was so ready, so needy she felt ready to explode.</p><p>\u201cThis could be a problem,\u201d he sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhy, because you are too?\u201d she bit out. \u201cYeah, really complicates your little survival idea doesn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><p>Merinus rose to her feet. She was tired of this. If she didn\u2019t get away from him she was going to beg him to fuck her brains out. Just what she needed to start her week off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d He frowned as she picked up her purse from the middle of the floor and took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cBack to camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCamp?\u201d He sounded incredulous.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, camp,\u201d she stated. \u201cI set a tent up on the lower piece of your property a few hours ago. You can find me there if you want to talk, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>Incredulity crossed his expression</p><p>\u201cYou are camping on my creek?\u201d he bit out. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing. When did you do that? Do you think those damned soldiers won\u2019t find you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set it up this morning. I told you, I\u2019m tired of waiting. I\u2019ll find my way to you sooner or later if it kills me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose soldiers just might,\u201d he bit out. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t stay there, Merinus. It\u2019s trespassing,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>\u201cSo sue me, since you don\u2019t seem to be willing to fuck me.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting, Callan. But I\u2019m a pretty impatient person, I\u2019d hurry if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you\u2019ll do what?\u201d he asked her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll call my brothers and let them have the job after all,\u201d she told him, unlocking the door. \u201cAnd trust me, they would put your Council soldiers to shame for sheer tenacity. I\u2019m the welcome wagon, the Tyler Seven are hell.\u201d</p><p>She swept out of the office, leaving only her scent. Clean, fresh, so fucking hot it made his cock throb. He collapsed against the back of the couch, staring at the nearly empty room, breathing harshly. Dammit, this wasn\u2019t a good thing. She hadn\u2019t even made it out of the building yet, and it was all he could do to keep from dragging her back and making a damned lust filled meal out of her on the couch. He groaned, the thought of pushing his head between those silky thighs, his tongue lapping the sweet moisture that produced that intriguing scent was nearly more than he could bear. He licked his lips and bit back an oath. Something was wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be this strong. Pulling himself to his feet, he strode to the desk and jerked the receiver from the phone base. Dialing quickly, he waited for a voice to answer.</p><p>\u201cDoc Martin\u2019s.\u201d Sherra\u2019s voice was carefully cultured, smooth and cool.</p><p>\u201cGet Doc out to the house as soon as possible. I have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>There was silence on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d she asked him worriedly.</p><p>\u201cPhysical. I need some tests. Just get out there.\u201d</p><p>He hung the phone up before she could answer. He was throbbing, his flesh sensitive, his body demanding relief from the little journalist that tempted him so desperately. Lust wasn\u2019t like that. He knew he was intensely sexual, more than a little driven in that area, and he knew it wasn\u2019t like this. It didn\u2019t drug, it didn\u2019t intoxicate. It didn\u2019t dig its claws into your loins, demanding satisfaction. Which meant it could be a problem. An instinctive, genetic problem only now showing itself. Shaking his head, he could only pray he was wrong as he headed for his truck and the peace of his home.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cIt may take a few days.\u201d Doc Martin, the only scientist left alive from the original five that had worked with the creation of Callan and the others, set the dozen or so vials in a small box and began to pack his instruments.</p><p>He had blood samples, saliva samples, hell, even more than one semen sample. Despite the manual releases, though, Callan\u2019s cock still throbbed. His blood rushed through his veins and he couldn\u2019t get the scent of that damned woman from his body.</p><p>\u201cAny guesses?\u201d Callan asked him.</p> <p>Doc shrugged. \u201cIt could be anything, Callan, though I say we can safely narrow it down to a sexual problem. I won\u2019t know anything conclusive until the tests are finished. And I need samples from the woman as well. You need to bring her here tonight, let me get those samples to test alongside yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He couldn\u2019t trust himself anywhere around her.</p><p>\u201cFrom what you say, she\u2019s affected as well, Callan,\u201d Sherra stated from behind the doctor. \u201cWe need to know what\u2019s going on. This isn\u2019t just about you. It could affect all of us.\u201d</p><p>The full Pride was assembled, the other three watched him somberly, more than a little concerned at the news of this new problem they were facing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what mine say. If she\u2019s still experiencing this problem, then we\u2019ll see,\u201d Callan bit out.</p><p>\u201cUntil then, there\u2019s no sense in alarming her.\u201d No sense in tempting the lust raging between them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous enough that he\u2019s had any reaction with a normal person,\u201d Dayan said darkly. The cougar breed was brooding, his brown eyes unsettled, angry, his expression more savage than usual.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t monsters, Dayan.\u201d Beside him, Dawn, the youngest of the pride, also a cougar breed, protested softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call it, Dawn? Do you want to fuck a normal male and take the chance that your nature will destroy him?\u201d Dayan sneered.</p><p>Callan watched Dawn flinch, her face paling, fear flashing across her expression.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Callan growled. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you, Dayan, that you would turn on the women now?</p><p>There is nothing to indicate we would hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not normal. She has no business\u2014\u201d</p><p>A savage snarl erupted from Tanner\u2019s throat. Bengal, unpredictable, and fiercely protective of the women, as a young male his temper often ran hot and impatient.</p><p>\u201cEnough, dammit.\u201d Callan came to his feet, staring at them all. Taber and Tanner had placed Dawn behind them and now faced Dayan, incisors showing, their expressions masks of anger.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at it again,\u201d Sherra sighed. \u201cIt won\u2019t go any further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt should not be going on this far.\u201d Callan turned to her angrily. \u201cIs this what you do while I\u2019m drawing the Council soldiers from our home? Fight amongst yourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when Dayan attempts to take over,\u201d Tanner burst out. \u201cYou left Taber in charge, he has no right to order us, or Dawn and Sherra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is getting out of hand, Callan,\u201d Taber\u2019s voice was less violent, but the potential of it throbbed just beneath the surface. The jaguar breed his DNA was mixed with could be calm and patient, or savagely aggressive.</p><p>\u201cDayan?\u201d Callan questioned him, his voice hard.</p><p>Dayan shook his head. \u201cWe are not normal.\u201d He seemed more subdued now, backing down from the others. \u201cIt\u2019s insanity to pretend we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of us attempt to pretend that we are normal.\u201d Callan raked his fingers through his hair in frustration. \u201cGo home. See if you can find your patience before tomorrow night. I want you and Taber patrolling the ridge for soldiers. We can\u2019t let down our guard, especially now.\u201d</p><p>Other than a brief nod, Dayan did little to respond before he turned and stomped from the room.</p><p>\u201cDawn?\u201d The young woman still seemed to cower behind Tanner and Taber. \u201cCome out of there, little sister. Why would you still be frightened?\u201d Because shadows and memories tore at her, tormented her. He knew well why she feared.</p><p>She moved from the safety of the other two men, glancing back at Taber as though for reassurance.</p><p>\u201cDayan is trying to force her to move in with him,\u201d Sherra said as she began to help Doc pack their supplies. \u201cHis desire for her frightens her.\u201d</p><p>Dawn paled. Callan breathed a weary sigh. There were days he wondered if they would survive with their sanity in tact.</p><p>\u201cTake her home with you, Sherra,\u201d Callan ordered. \u201cI don\u2019t want her left alone.\u201d</p><p>He ignored Dawn\u2019s look of surprised thankfulness.</p><p>\u201cKeep her there,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll have my hands full running Ms. Tyler off. I need no other worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Doc said as he studied a page from the thick notebook he had stolen from the lab years ago.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Callan frowned, easing closer.</p><p>Jacob Martin shook his head worriedly, his lined face creasing into a scowl as he read the information he had found.</p><p>\u201cThere was a case of this, with the first Leo created, about ten years before you. He was kept in another location. This occurred with a female scientist, actually.\u201d He turned worried eyes to Callan. \u201cIt affects not just you, Callan, but the woman as well. The two of you are in a \u2018mating frenzy\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMating frenzy?\u201d Callan asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cI must have missed this, because you\u2019ve never displayed these symptoms before.\u201d The scientist shook his head in confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small notation, really. The Leo and the female were destroyed, so there were no tests done regarding the phenomena. But extreme sexual distress, fevered conditions, heightened senses, the ability to scent the female\u2019s arousal, were all notated. The scientist labeled it as \u2018mating frenzy\u2019. A condition similar to that of feline animals.\u201d</p><p>Callan sat down as he breathed out wearily.</p><p>\u201cNo tests mean no way of knowing what will happen,\u201d he said wearily. Doctor Martin shook his head. \u201cThere was mention that several scientists wanted to study it, see if the Leo could breed with the woman, but those over the project wouldn\u2019t allow it. They destroyed the pair.\u201d</p><p>Callan braced his elbows on his legs, his hands hanging between his knees as he lowered his head, shaking it in horror. The decisions of life and death were made so easily within the hell they had been created in.</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to keep an eye on the woman. I need those tests from her, Callan,\u201d the doctor warned him. \u201cWe need to track this, for the others if for no other reason. If it happens with you, then it will happen with them. And we don\u2019t know if the woman is in any danger from this.\u201d</p><p>Callan wondered if the night could possibly get any worse.</p><p>\u201cYou need to check on her, Cal,\u201d Sherra warned him. \u201cOr let one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he growled, he wanted none of the other males around her. \u201cI\u2019m taking the cell. Doc, you and Sherra hang around here for now. I\u2019ll contact you if she\u2019s still\u2014\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHorny?\u201d Sherra grinned mischievously.</p><p>\u201cAroused,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when you can leave.\u201d</p><p>Merinus was aroused. She lay on the sleeping bag within her tent, naked, her body sheened in sweat, pulsating, throbbing with a fever of lust. Her hands cupped her breasts, her fingers pressing against the hard nipples and she couldn\u2019t contain her moan. It felt so good. Almost as good as when Callan had touched her there. She rolled the hard little points between her fingers, her head tossing. Her breasts were so swollen, so sensitive, they were nearly painful.</p><p>Her skin tingled. One hand ran over the damp contours of her flat stomach to the smooth flesh between her thighs. Slick, wet heat greeted her fingers. Her clit throbbed, pulsed. She shivered at the feel of her own fingers glancing over the hard little button. Need arched like electricity over her body. Hungry, consuming. She wanted, needed Callan.</p><p>She admitted she was in a hell of a mess now. Somehow, someway he had made her crazed for his touch, his kiss. That kiss had been so hot, spicy. The taste of his mouth lingered in hers, making her crave more of it.</p><p>Her fingers slid down the thickly coated slit of her cunt. Her thighs tightened, her legs trembled. Oh, she ached. Her fingers tweaked at her nipples, pulling at them, tightening around them until she was moaning heatedly. Her hips bucked against her fingers as they circled her clit. Oh, that felt good. But not as good as Callan could make it feel. She wanted to feel his mouth on her clit, sucking, his tongue stroking it as he had her nipples.</p><p>She panted for air now. Remembering the moist, heated warmth of his mouth. Her fingers moved more firmly on her clit, a moan working from her throat as heat swelled in her, around her. She was on fire. Dying. What had he done to her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCallan,\u201d she whispered his name tremulously.</p><p>She would laugh, if she weren\u2019t so hot. If the need pulsing through her body wasn\u2019t so intense, so</p><p>searing.</p> <p>She wondered where Callan was. Surely he had some idea what was happening to her? Was this his punishment for her daring to come out here and try to drag him into public awareness?</p><p>This wasn\u2019t working. Breathing hard, her fingers stilled on her flesh. She wasn\u2019t going to climax, not the way she was doing it. Dammit, she knew she should have bought that damned book on masturbation. But no, she was convinced she could find some buff, muscled god to take care of the job for her. Here she was, stuck in bum fucked nowhere, so horny she was burning alive, and no muscle god to put out the fire.</p><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d she slapped at her sleeping bag, frustrated tears coming to her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him when I find him. I\u2019ll let Kane neuter him. I\u2019ll blow his balls off with my gun.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, turning over on her side, breathing roughly. She could get through this. She blew out hard, attempting to find some measure of control. She could do this, she thought. She really could make it until tomorrow, then she was stalking into that damned garage and Mr. Callan Lyons, Catboy Extraordinaire, was going to take care of this damned problem, one way or another.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p> <p>\u201cSherra, get up here if you want those blood samples.\u201d Callan\u2019s voice was low, he could feel and hear the growl emanating from his chest. The \u2018mating frenzy\u2019 was building in him, but he knew Merinus was being tortured by it. He could hear her breathy moans, smell her heat.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Cal, bring her to the cabin,\u201d Sherra argued fiercely. \u201cA tent is not the most romantic place. And it\u2019s sure as hell not a good place to retrieve samples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I touch her, I\u2019ll lose control, Sherra,\u201d Callan whispered. Admitting it took all his strength. He couldn\u2019t touch her, couldn\u2019t get close to her. He heard the silence from Sherra\u2019s end, thick, tense.</p><p>\u201cOkay, pull back. We\u2019ll come out there and get her. You stay out of range of her, Callan. We need her blood and saliva samples before you touch her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you better get up here fast. If she threatens to neuter me again, all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>Callan disconnected the cell phone and moved further away from her camp. He couldn\u2019t bear her moans. And the scent of her was making him crazy. His hands clenched into fists, his body tightened with his need. He could feel the small, minute protrusion beneath the head of his cock flaring. The barb. He knew it was there. He had seen the X-rays of it countless times, but never, in all the years he had been having sex had it flared to life. Now it throbbed. It pulsed with a life of its own; the nearly unbearable swelling of it was a demand in and of itself.</p> <p>How long he waited, Callan wasn\u2019t sure. Time was measured in the throb of his cock, the beat of his blood through his veins, the lust that seemed to build steadily.</p><p>\u201cHey bro,\u201d Taber bent next to him as Dawn and Sherra moved quickly for the tent. \u201cTell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>Callan shook his head, sighing deeply.</p><p>\u201cFind a cure.\u201d He grimaced with a harsh laugh. \u201cTalk about a major complication here, Taber. Until then, you and Tanner scout the area, make sure we don\u2019t have any watchers. I\u2019ll follow Dawn and Sherra as soon as they get Merinus from that tent and headed to the house.\u201d</p><p>Taber nodded. He clapped Callan on the shoulder, a gesture of affection they all practiced, then moved quickly away. Callan leaned back against the boulder behind him and breathed a hard sigh. Dammit. Way too complicated.</p><p>\u201cMerinus. I\u2019m a friend of Callan\u2019s. Can I come in?\u201d The female voice was soft, incredibly gentle. Merinus jerked into a sitting position, pulling the sleeping bag to her breasts as she stared at the zippered door.</p><p>\u201cWhere is that dirty bastard?\u201d she cursed angrily, reaching out and pulling the tab down furiously. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>The two women framed in the opening moved in purposely. The door was re-zipped and they regarded her curiously.</p> <p>\u201cMerinus, we need to get you dressed and to Callan\u2019s home. Our doctor is waiting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a cure?\u201d She narrowed her eyes on them.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d The blonde grimaced. \u201cIf you\u2019ll get dressed we\u2019ll explain everything on the way out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can walk out of here,\u201d Merinus bit out, anger unfolding in her again. \u201cI don\u2019t know what he did to me, but it\u2019s not pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallan is in little better shape at this time. Now, my name is Sherra and this is my sister, Dawn. We\u2019ll</p><p>help you get dressed. My jeep got pretty close, so you shouldn\u2019t have to walk far.\u201d</p><p>As Sherra spoke, Dawn jerked a pair of light sweat shorts from a backpack and a loose, sleeveless top.</p><p>\u201cGood, loose clothing should be better.\u201d Sherra took the items and held them out to Merinus. \u201cDo you need help dressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Merinus clenched the material in her hand. She had removed her clothes for a reason, didn\u2019t they know that?</p><p>Heaving an irritated sigh, she clenched her teeth together and dressed herself quickly. Moving wasn\u2019t comfortable. But then again, breathing wasn\u2019t comfortable. It didn\u2019t hurt, exactly. The pleasure was just so intense that it was damned impossible to contain her moan when the light cotton material fell over her breasts, stroking her nipples.</p><p>\u201cOh God, I\u2019m going to kill him,\u201d she mumbled, flushing with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cYou have my permission.\u201d Sherra unzipped the door and moved out of the tent. \u201cCan you make it? We brought a friend in case you couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d</p><p>Merinus shook her head, embarrassment flaming her body now.</p><p>\u201cI can walk. Let\u2019s just hurry up and get there.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, Sherra was right. The jeep was much closer to the tent than Merinus had been able to bring her Blazer. It was still running and the air conditioner was blasting.</p><p>\u201cHang on and we\u2019ll hurry,\u201d Sherra promised her as she bounced out of the parking spot. Oh, now that wasn\u2019t fair. Merinus felt ecstasy shimmer up her spine as they bounced over rocks and ruts. She closed her eyes, holding tight to the steel bar beside her and the edge of the seat. Each jarring of her body only incited the fever raging through her.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely need to write a story on this. What does he call it anyway?\u201d Merinus asked. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in damned heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose.\u201d Sherra shot her a concerned look. \u201cIt\u2019s called a \u2018mating frenzy\u2019. We didn\u2019t even know it existed until tonight. We don\u2019t have much research into it. It\u2019s only happened once, before we were born.\u201d</p><p>The statement didn\u2019t take long to hit Merinus\u2019 brain.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d She turned to her in shock. \u201cThere are more like Callan?\u201d</p><p>Sherra nodded, watching the rough track she was driving over carefully. \u201cThere are five of us. Three males, Dawn and myself. The evidence towards us was destroyed in the lab. Only the files on Callan remained. Thankfully, the scientists were trying to double-cross their masters and didn\u2019t tell them about their little side experiments with the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>There was bitterness and rage in the woman\u2019s voice, not that Merinus blamed her. She could only imagine the horrors two young women would have endured there.</p><p>\u201cSo, you have your own doctor then?\u201d Merinus panted as they bounced over a succession of ruts. Oh, glory. She closed her eyes. If she didn\u2019t climax soon, she was going to burn alive.</p><p>\u201cThe only scientist left. He helped us in the labs, then helped us escape. He watches over us, makes sure everything is okay physically. Sometimes mentally.\u201d Sherra shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. Kinda old now, but a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell, Sherra, please watch those bumps,\u201d Merinus sighed dismally as the woman accelerated over a washboard road. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m dying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Merinus, we really need to hurry.\u201d The Blazer shot forward. Despite the narrowness of the dirt track, the sheer drop from the side of the cliff, the woman pushed the jeep at an incredible speed, steadily climbing up the nearly impassable road.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not far now,\u201d Sherra promised her as they hit the top, then curved around and headed down another cliff. \u201cJust a few more minutes.\u201d</p><p>A sharp turn again and they were running straight up the middle of the wide creek that ran through two mountains. Several miles up the creek, they turned again to a graveled road that led to a rustic, large log cabin. No damned wonder she couldn\u2019t find the road, she thought. There was no road.</p><p>\u201cJust pull into the garage,\u201d Dawn said from the back. \u201cWe need to take her downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc has a little lab below the cabin, in a cavern we found when we first came here. The dry, cool conditions there are perfect for his work.\u201d</p><p>The vehicle bounced into a wide garage off the side, then came to a jarring stop.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Callan will be here in a minute, and I want you safely out of sight when he shows up.\u201d Sherra led her to a door that opened to a cool stairwell.</p><p>\u201cI thought the point would be to get very close to Callan,\u201d Merinus sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like this, Sherra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, give Callan time and you\u2019ll like it even less,\u201d Sherra chuckled. \u201cHe\u2019s bossy and arrogant. We love him, but he\u2019s hell on the nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the bed?\u201d Merinus followed the dimly lit stairs, close on Sherra\u2019s heels as they curved and led into a large open cavern.</p><p>The stone room was brightly lit, with assorted tables, computers, bright lights and complicated machines.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Frankenstein?\u201d she sighed, coming to a halt and staring around in amazement.</p><p>\u201cI told you, he\u2019s on his way.\u201d Laughter echoed in Sherra\u2019s voice. \u201cCome on, meet Doc and we\u2019ll get those samples we need.\u201d</p><p>Samples. Blood samples, saliva, even a swab of her vagina. Merinus lay back on the flat bed, a sheet covering her, her body damp with sweat. Sherra, Dawn and the grandfatherly doctor moved around her constantly. Even her sweat was being tested. It wasn\u2019t comfortable, but compared to the raging lust</p><p>zinging through her, it wasn\u2019t bothersome.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready for the antidote now,\u201d Merinus stated when she began to feel the deep, hard contractions of her womb, coinciding with the hard, throbbing pulse that attacked her vagina. \u201cTime to do something here, guys.\u201d</p><p>Doctor Martin was bent over a complicated microscope, computers and gadgets whirring as he pressed in several commands to the keyboard, raised his head and checked his readout. He sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cDoc?\u201d Sherra stood at his side, reading the display on the computer screen herself.</p><p>\u201cA mating,\u201d the doctor muttered, running his hand through his thinning gray hair as he glanced up at Sherra. \u201cLook at the results of combining his sperm with her vaginal secretions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, it\u2019s now time to explain to Merinus.\u201d She heard the waver in her own voice and admitted to the fear that was becoming impossible to hold at bay.</p><p>What did she really know about these people? They could be dangerous. This could be some elaborate show for their own experiments. She felt her body tremble, not just with lust, but with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Merinus,\u201d Dawn assured her, her voice soft, hesitant. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to hurt you. I\u2019m certain Doc and Sherra are almost finished.\u201d</p><p>Merinus looked up at the other woman, seeing sympathy, shadows of nightmares and pain in her dark, whisky brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think its time to call in the Amazing Seven,\u201d she whispered, thinking of her brothers. They could fix anything. \u201cMy brothers,\u201d she explained to Dawn\u2019s confused look. \u201cThey\u2019ll be really pissed over this. I\u2019ve really stepped into it this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kane, hard-nosed asshole that he was, would scream and yell at her, then he would likely kill Callan. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be the smartest route, at least not until this problem with her hormones was fixed.</p><p>\u201cDo any other sperm samples react to the excretions?\u201d She heard Sherra ask the doctor. Oh Lord, this was bad. They were combining the samples taken from her body with other men\u2019s cum. Merinus gritted her teeth.</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for the doctor\u2019s response. \u201cGet me a phone. Time to call home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerinus, it really is okay.\u201d Dawn glided forward, her heart shaped face concerned as Sherra and Doctor Martin turned to her. \u201cJust a bit longer and we\u2019ll be finished.\u201d</p><p>Merinus sat up on the bed, intending to move to her feet. To dress. To leave. A hard shudder worked over her body then, her vagina spasmed and a fierce jolt of incredible need shook her body, forcing a moan past her throat.</p><p>\u201cThis is bad,\u201d she whimpered, bending over clutching her stomach. \u201cOh God, this is bad. Time to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerinus.\u201d Sherra rushed to her side as beeps and pings began to echo through the cavern as the machines, attached to Merinus\u2019 body by electrodes, began to go off. \u201cJust a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d Callan stood in the entrance of the makeshift lab, his hair flowing to his bare shoulders, his golden eyes glittering with lust.</p><p>Merinus gasped as he came toward her. She had to touch him, had to have him against her. He looked big and hard and so warm. There was no hesitation in her when he reached for her, lifting her from the lab bed.</p><p>She groaned aloud when his fiery skin touched her, his arms lifting her against his chest as he turned and stalked from the room. The sheet trailed to the floor, rasping against her skin as it slowly fell away.</p><p>\u201cIs it going to hurt?\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep her lips from his chest. She had to taste him. She bit at hard muscles, licked the small wound as his body shuddered.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d he growled. It rumbled through his chest, a deep, predatory sound that had her shivering in pleasure. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too damned late to worry about it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Callan carried her through the darkened house, his steps quick, stalking as he moved through a large kitchen, a rustic living room, then into a long hall. Then he was turning into a doorway, kicking the door closed as he passed it and moving to the wide bed on the far wall. Merinus didn\u2019t have time to think and Callan didn\u2019t make her beg. The moment her back touched the mattress he was moving over her, his lips taking hers, his tongue plunging forcefully into her mouth. He tasted so good. Eagerly, her tongue mated with his, the spicy taste of his mouth easing the incredible pain of lust that gripped her body. Like a drug addict in the first seconds of her \u2018fix\u2019, her body began to ease, the harsh contractions in her stomach to lessen. But she wasn\u2019t taking chances. Her hands gripped his hair, holding him to her as his mouth devoured her. Lips and tongue mated with hers, hard, hungry, her response urging him closer, urging the kiss deeper.</p><p>His arms went around her, blunt nails scraping along her back as she arched to him, her nude body</p><p>twisting closer, desperate to mate every cell in their bodies together. His hard chest, with its fine sprinkling of golden brown hair rasped her nipples, engorging them to the point of pain. Powerful thighs parted hers, a hand at her back moved to cup her breast, and still he kissed her. He licked at her lips, nibbled at them, drew her tongue into his mouth and sucked at it before teaching her to do the same. More of the incredible taste of him. She arched closer, the bare flesh of her cunt jerking against the long, hot thickness of his erection as it lay against the soft flesh.</p><p>\u201cSo good,\u201d he whispered against her lips, the rumble of pleasure that echoed through his chest making her shiver. \u201cYour kiss, Merinus, the taste of you, is exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo taste more,\u201d she gasped, her head arching back as that rough, rasping tongue stroked over her neck.</p><p>Oh, that was good. Real good. Hot, with a gentle abrasion that had her panting as he moved slowly to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease me,\u201d she begged, twisting in the grip of an erotic heat that was burning her alive. \u201cTake me, Callan. I can\u2019t stand it much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you first,\u201d he bit out, his tongue licking her breasts, his lips nibbling sporadically. \u201cI want to bury my mouth in your cunt, Merinus. The smell of your heat is starving me for you.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved to her abdomen, stroking its way to her parted thighs. She almost screamed when his fingers, thick and hot entered the narrow, soaked slit of her pussy. She opened her eyes, seeing his grimace of pleasure, the raw lust that transformed his face. Then in amazement she saw his arm lift, his hand moving to his mouth.</p> <p>Two fingers glistened with the frothy cream of her body. She whimpered as he took them into his mouth, his eyes darkening on a sigh of ecstasy as he tasted her. His lashes lowered, becoming heavy with sexuality, his lips were fuller, his face tense, tight with the needs that surged through his body as well.</p><p>\u201cYou taste as delicate as spring, as hot as summer,\u201d his rough whisper sounded tortured. \u201cI have never tasted anything so good, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. You like to talk,\u201d she moaned. \u201cOh God, I never could stand that in movies. It\u2019s too sexy, Callan.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, the curve of his lips tight.</p><p>\u201cI want you to know how hot and sweet your body is, Merinus,\u201d he told her darkly, moving, edging lower along her body. \u201cI want to tell you how I\u2019m about to lick that sweet cunt of yours, eat that delicate cream from your body.\u201d</p><p>Her hips jerked involuntarily to the rough growl in his words, as well as the words themselves.</p><p>\u201cAsk me to eat you,\u201d he demanded roughly. \u201cSay the words for me, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d Her eyes widened as his face poised over the desperate, aching part of her body. He was watching her heatedly, his eyes glittering, savage, hot.</p><p>\u201cSay the words for me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cGive me permission to devour you.\u201d</p><p>Merinus licked her lips, panting hard as he spread her legs further, his fingers barely glancing over the moisture glazed flesh.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she moaned, shaking, desperate for the touch. \u201cEat me, Callan. Please lick me. Lick me now\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, a hard shudder wracking her body.</p><p>His tongue rasped through the slit of her lips from bottom to top. Slow, sliding, erotically rough and so hot she felt her flesh melting. His hard hands gripped her thighs, holding them apart when she would have clenched them around his head.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d his low moan of pleasure vibrated against her clit. She felt the small bud throb, beg. Merinus gasped for breath as he licked her, his tongue dipping into the tight entrance of her vagina, swirling around, gathering more and more of her taste as his heated growls of pleasure echoed against her body.</p><p>She was mindless now. She could feel the sensations building, her skin tingling, the pressure increasing in her clit as he stroked around it, over it, sucked it lightly into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, suck it.\u201d The shocking words erupting from her mouth did little to dim the haze of need sucking her in, as his mouth sipped at her flesh. \u201cOh yes, Callan. Yes. Just like that,\u201d she was almost screaming now as he suckled her clit deeper, harder. \u201cPlease. Oh please\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was building in her. Her body tightened involuntarily, every bone and muscle in her reaching for his mouth, the hot draw of his lips, the moist wash of his tongue. It was killing her, killing her with pleasure, building, increasing. She could feel her heart struggling to keep up with the demands her arousal was placing on it. It beat hard and fast, bursting through her veins, a pleasure in and of itself. Then one hard male finger slid past the soft folds of skin. His mouth suckled her clit faster, his finger pushing inside her, filling her, burning her.</p><p>She heard her scream as the pleasure burst inside her. Desperate, hard, her hips bucked and she felt herself dying. Her climax was like a tidal wave, tearing through her, heaving her body, shaking it, shuddering through it, destroying her as she held tight to his hair, praying for some anchor to hold her to earth. It was never ending. Hot pulsing relief spasmed through her cunt, causing it to grip tighter about his plunging finger, soak his hand, her thighs with a rush of liquid that would have terrified her at any other time.</p><p>Then his mouth was there, devouring the release, his tongue plunging into her vagina, building the pleasure again as the sandpapery texture of that organ rasped her tender flesh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you first,\u201d he growled, his body moving powerfully, his hands lifting her as the thick head of his cock lodged against the entrance to her vagina. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you until you scream again, Merinus. Over and over. Scream for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>She screamed. One hard thrust buried the thick, steel hard erection into her body to the hilt. She felt his scrotum slap against her buttocks, watched his hard face twist into a grimace of sublime pleasure, his eyes closed, his body arched, tight, tense.</p><p>Callan fought for breath, for control. She was so tight and hot around his cock, her muscles gripping him like a slick, velvety fist. Control. He had to fight for control. He could control the raging lust beating at him, demanding a hard, fierce ride. She was tossing beneath him, her hips bucking, driving him harder into the soft flesh of her cunt, grinding against him.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he eased back, wanting to scream himself at the incredible pleasure from the friction of her flesh against his. His cock was so sensitive it was nearly unbearable. He could feel the small barb-like protrusion emerging from beneath the head of his cock, slowly, unfolding from its former hiding place. He prayed. He prayed to a God he had once doubted that it would bring her no harm. That the once inactive portion of his cock, the small, curved, hard protrusion would not bring her harm. Because there was no way he could stop.</p><p>She squirmed beneath him, fighting for breath, her body damp with perspiration, her female honey coating her inner thighs, as well as his. He thrust inside the tight depths of her body, groaning on every stroke at the tight heat clasping him, the sensitive swell of the barb raking her tender flesh, driving him insane with the pleasure it washed over his body.</p><p>He gritted his teeth against the sensations as he braced his body over Merinus\u2019. She was bucking against him, her head twisting against the sheets of the bed, arching desperately, begging now for release.</p><p>\u201cCallan\u2014\u201d Her plea was a hard gasp, a breathless moan as her hands went to his shoulders, her nails biting into his skin.</p><p>His sharp growl at the added sensation surprised him. He felt his cock swell, pulse. He drove against her harder, deeper, one hard hand spanning her hip as he held her still, the other under her shoulders, arching her breasts to his devouring mouth. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her. Her nipple was hard, succulent, the grip on his cock tightened each time he drew on it.</p><p>She was getting close. So damned close. And so was he. He could feel the white hot fingers of fire moving down his spine now, the swelling of the barb, the lengthening of the tiny hard membrane. Then all hell broke loose. He slammed inside her, deep, hard, as he felt the membrane extend fully, felt it rake across the silken flesh of her vaginal walls, the area of the elusive g-spot. It lodged there, causing his thrusts to become hard jerks in fear of tearing her, hurting her. But the pleasure. The pleasure was unlike anything he had ever known. It wrapped over the head of his erection like tiny fingers of paradise, at the same time he heard Merinus scream. Her body arched, her eyes widened, she stared at him in dazed, wild hunger for a second before her orgasm hit. She clenched around him, the action making her so tight and hot he could do nothing but follow her. His guttural growl as he felt the harsh ejaculations into her body shocked him.</p><p>The barb, so feared for so many years, destroyed his sense of balance. He could feel it moving, stroking the sensitive spot it had lodged in, each movement had Merinus crying out, jerking, tightening, her orgasms lengthening as he came inside her. She was breathing hard, crying now, her head tossing with the extremity of her pleasure before his own began to ease, and he felt the little protrusion recede, allowing him to pull weakly from her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merinus still trembled. Her cheeks were wet with sweat and tears as she gasped for breath. Her breasts were swollen, her nipples hard little peaks that had not eased with her climax.</p><p>\u201cMerinus,\u201d he whispered her name gently as he eased her into his arms, lying beside her, his hand smoothing down her damp back. \u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore, baby. I don\u2019t think I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched, one hand clutched at his back, the other around his neck.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d He was terrified that perhaps he had, and was unaware of it. She shook her head against his chest. A weak movement as her tongue stroked over his skin. Callan took a deep, careful breath after that small caress. He was still hard, he could easily take her again, but he feared for her. She was virgin, and there had been little gentleness in him when he had slammed inside her tender body.</p><p>She whispered against his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He moved back, staring into her dazed, distressed eyes. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you again.\u201d A tear fell down her cheek. \u201cI need more, Callan.\u201d</p><p>She was exhausted. He could see it in her expression, in her eyes and hear it in her voice. She was shy and confused and frightened by the overwhelming sensations that were controlling her body.</p> <p>\u201cShh, don\u2019t cry, baby. You need only ask.\u201d He smiled softly, his thumbs wiping the tears from her eyes. She was so tired it worried him, but he couldn\u2019t ignore her need, not when it was his own as well. He turned her to her side, bringing her leg over his as he tucked her buttocks against him.</p><p>\u201cWe will do this easy,\u201d he promised her. \u201cI know you\u2019re tired, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, gasping, moaning as the thick length of his cock re-entered her, stretching her, sliding in deep. The tight clasp had him gritting his teeth at the renewed pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good,\u201d he murmured at her ear as his fingers went to the swollen bud of her clit and massaged it gently. \u201cSo tight and hot around me, Merinus. Unlike anything I have known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re drugged. That\u2019s why,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou drugged us, Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would stay drugged forever, Merinus.\u201d He nibbled at her earlobe, loving the sharp intake of her breath, the way she thrust back at him. \u201cThere is no pleasure on this earth as good as the feel of your pretty cunt wrapped around me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh God, why did that just sound so sexy?\u201d she groaned, tightening around him, shivering at the feel of his lips against her neck.</p><p>\u201cBecause it is sexy,\u201d he assured her, smiling. He licked the soft flesh just beneath her ear, loving the little gasps she made. \u201cIt\u2019s sexy and erotic and hot as hell.\u201d He pushed harder into the tight sheath, gritting his teeth now at the pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll kill each other before the need goes away,\u201d she panted. \u201cCallan\u2014\u201d A plea stole from her as he felt the shivers working through her vagina.</p><p>He felt it as well, the barb\u2019s re-emergence, the added stroke over her tight muscles.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt you, Merinus?\u201d He was tortured, terrified he had been wrong, and she was in pain, despite her need. \u201cTell me if it hurts you. I\u2019ll try to stop.\u201d</p><p>He buried his head in her damp hair. God help him if he was hurting her. God help them both.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she gasped as his strokes became deeper, harder. Callan couldn\u2019t control it. His hips began to thrust his cock harder inside her, the ultra sensitivity of the barb making the pleasure so damned good he wanted to howl with it.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt you?\u201d he demanded again, gritting his teeth, fighting for control.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried out, her hand moving to grip his slamming hips. \u201cAh, more. I need more.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her to her stomach, moving behind her, instinct guiding him now, the pulse of pleasure overtaking his mind. Spreading her thighs wide he slammed his hips into her buttocks, feeling his scrotum tighten against the base of his cock as he drove deep and hard inside her. His head lowered, his teeth gripping the sensitive area between shoulder and neck as she screamed out in pleasure. And it was pleasure. She was begging for more, held still by his hard body, his plunging hips, the sharp teeth that held her still for his invasion.</p><p>He was the animal he had always feared. In the back of his mind, Callan was appalled at his own actions, but helpless in the face of the frenzy overtaking him. The barb was only half erect, sensitive, sliding, gliding over tight vaginal walls and smooth flesh. It was more than he could bear. He could control himself no longer.</p><p>Primitive, throaty, his growl demanded her surrender, her submission to him as he powered inside her, over and over. She was crying out now, her body tight, reaching, desperate. The barb extended full length, scraped, she screamed out in desperation, her muscles locking on his erection as her orgasm swept over her once again. Callan plunged deep and hard, his own climax rocking his soul, the growls constant now, rumbling from his chest as he felt the hard spurt of his semen inside her, the burning grip of her muscles, the wash of her own release.</p><p>Then she was still. Slowly, the inner muscles unlocked and Callan felt his own erection begin to subside minutely. Her body became pliant, relaxed and he knew that either sleep or unconsciousness claimed her. Either, he knew, would be a welcome relief for her.</p><p>Panting, he lay down beside her. Jerking sheet and comforter from the foot of the bed, he covered them both, weariness lying heavy on his shoulders. He tucked her body close to his, breathing in her scent, her warmth. He was exhausted. Never had he climaxed so hard, so deep. As though his seed were being jerked from his soul, rather than the tight sac beneath his cock.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered the word as his grip tightened on her, exhaustion draining him. He was aware he made the claim, and he admitted it terrified him clear to his soul.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Merinus awoke, tender and groggy. She shifted in the bed, seeking the warmth that had held her through the night, but Callan was gone. Opening her eyes she blinked, stared up at the ceiling and tried to ignore the pressing need that still throbbed in her vagina. Damn, talk about a potent kiss. She licked her swollen lips experimentally. Callan had nibbled on them more than once, licked them. His tongue, the rough texture of it, the stimulating feel of abrasive velvet running over her skin, the memory of it caused her to shiver.</p><p>She needed a shower. Dried perspiration itched on her skin, made her feel grungy. The smell of sex, hot and wild, lingered on the air and on her body. She grimaced. Rising from the bed, she stepped gingerly over the cool hardwood floor, moving to the opened door on the far right of the room. A bathroom, complete with a large sunken tub and a brief written message on the counter greeted her. Bathe. Relax. Stay in the house. I\u2019ll return soon with your things. So much for her camp, she sighed. After the hours it took to set it up so neatly, it might have been nice to actually use it for longer than a few hours. She wondered how long he had been gone, then decided it didn\u2019t really matter. He would return soon enough, and she desperately needed that bath.</p><p>She ran the tub nearly full, adding a liberal portion of bubbling bath salts she found at the edge of the tub, then eased herself into the hot water. She washed her hair quickly, wrapped it in a towel then lay back against the rim to allow her body to soak. She glanced down her body, seeing the red abrasions on her skin, small sensitive points where his tongue had stroked her a bit roughly. Her breasts were still swollen with need, her nipples still hard.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t understand it. The events of the day before seemed more like a dream than reality. But reality was the tenderness between her thighs, the flush on the smooth mound of her cunt, the sensitivity of her body. The need for Callan wasn\u2019t as intense, as harsh as it had been the day before, but it still throbbed in her. She still ached for him. It made no sense.</p><p>\u201cMerinus.\u201d Sherra\u2019s voice called through the closed door, her knock light. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>Merinus checked the bubbles covering her, then sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>The other woman entered the room, concern marking her pretty features, lingering in her light blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf Callan\u2019s DNA is lion, then what\u2019s yours?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to beat around the bush. There were</p><p>more than just Callan and she knew it.</p><p>Sherra sighed. She sat gracefully in a padded chair at the end of the tub.</p><p>\u201cSnow cat,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cDawn and Dayan\u2019s mix is cougar. Tanner is Bengal. Taber is jaguar, Callan is lion.\u201d She watched Merinus carefully, her expression composed, calm, but her eyes were shadowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to my body?\u201d She would ask the questions of their DNA later. Right now, there were more pressing problems.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mating, Merinus,\u201d Sherra said gently. \u201cOur tests aren\u2019t conclusive yet. Doc\u2019s still working on it. But it seems pheromones, chemistry is the culprit. Yours matched with Callan\u2019s and his body reacted to it. There\u2019s still so much we don\u2019t know about our bodies. Aren\u2019t certain of. Unfortunately, we\u2019ll need more samples. I had hoped to catch you before your bath to begin them. Your body will give us more answers than Callan\u2019s can, as the mix of his semen and your body\u2019s secretions are contained within you.\u201d</p><p>Fear raced through her now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on birth control,\u201d she whispered, her voice trembling. She couldn\u2019t believe she hadn\u2019t thought of that before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Sherra rushed to reassure her. \u201cThe semen of our males has never been compatible with a female before. But just to be on the safe side, the injection doc gave you last night would prevent conception, should the reaction have changed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this \u2018thing\u2019 going on with my body?\u201d she asked her hesitantly. \u201cWill it stop?\u201d</p><p>Sherra sighed roughly. \u201cWe think so. Callan\u2019s semen seems to have a counteracting agent in it, but it appears very slow acting. In time, I believe it will go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, I really stepped into it this time,\u201d Merinus breathed wearily, closing her eyes at the problem she now found herself steeped in. \u201cThis is not good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps for Callan it is,\u201d Sherra said softly. \u201cHe was growing very angry, very hopeless, Merinus. He leads us. Protects us. Maybe this was what he needed. I can\u2019t say he was relaxed when I saw him this morning, but he now plans for more than just his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what are those plans?\u201d Merinus asked her, watching her through the steam of the bath.</p><p>\u201cProviding for you. Protecting you,\u201d Sherra informed hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Merinus shook her head fiercely. \u201cThis is just a story. This chemical thing will go away, and so will I. I can\u2019t stay here. And if he goes back, then I go to the next story. This is not permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think.\u201d Callan stood in the doorway, his face dark, the savage lines pulled into a mask of male arousal and hard purpose. \u201cYou cannot leave me now, Merinus. No matter what either of us would wish.\u201d He glanced at Sherra, the look hard, commanding.</p><p>\u201cI need those samples, Callan. Quickly,\u201d she told him as she came to her feet. \u201cAnd Merinus is sore\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not need you to tell me my responsibilities, Sherra.\u201d He flashed her a sharp look. \u201cI have always seen them through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have,\u201d Sherra said worriedly. \u201cWhen she\u2019s finished, please, we need her in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a guinea pig,\u201d Merinus burst out. \u201cI won\u2019t be poked and prodded at incessantly.\u201d</p><p>She flushed as Callan arched a brow sarcastically. Then her body heated as her gaze skipped to his thighs, then back up. He was aroused. Ready for her. Again. Her body heated up further, her blood pumping harshly through her veins.</p><p>\u201cLeave, Sherra. I will have her there soon for your tests.\u201d Callan moved aside, allowing the woman to escape, then closing the door behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merinus stared at him from the depths of the tub, breathing heavily, her body reacting to the fiery glitter in his slumberous eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take you again, yet,\u201d he promised her softly. \u201cBut soon. Do you need help now getting out of the bath? I can fix you lunch before you are forced to endure Doc\u2019s testing.\u201d</p><p>Merinus\u2019 eyes narrowed on him. He was commanding, forceful. She hated that in a man.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a grown woman, I think I\u2019m capable of bathing myself,\u201d she told him sweetly, patiently. She felt everything but patient inside.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, while your body is demanding my touch, it is not a good idea to push me with your female stubbornness,\u201d he warned her, male aggression stamped on his features. \u201cI am not fully in control of myself right now. I could not promise you I would be gentle if you pushed me.\u201d</p><p>Merinus\u2019 lips thinned. How typically male. She opened her mouth to speak, but stayed silent as his hand rose, demanding.</p><p>\u201cHear me well,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cFinish your bath. Then come eat. Your clothes are on the bed. I have tried to tell you, I am not whatever fairy tale you have worked up in your head. At this moment I am more instinct than I am control. I am more the animal I was created with right now, Merinus. Do not push the animal, because even I cannot predict its response.\u201d</p><p>The heavy grief in his voice silenced her anger. His eyes were filled with bleak memories, emotions she couldn\u2019t define. But she saw the pain there. Pain and a terrible loneliness.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very independent,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t change that. Orders don\u2019t sit well with me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have the patience to tamp down the beast that demands submission. For now, perhaps it would be best to control your independence in the face of something neither of us can predict. Now, once again. Do you need my help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I think I can manage.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help her anger. She saw no reason for him to lose control over something as simple as allowing her choices. And she wouldn\u2019t tolerate it for very long. Only as long as it took her to get the hell out of there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d He tilted his head, watching her with narrowed eyes. \u201cI can smell it, Merinus. It mixes well with your lust.\u201d He breathed in deeply as though savoring the scent.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go away and let me finish my bath,\u201d she bit out. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to come in here.\u201d</p><p>She watched him grit his teeth.</p> <p>\u201cI would suggest wearing loose clothing, perhaps one of my shirts that I laid on the bed for you. Your skin is still sensitive, and clothing will irritate it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how sensitive my skin is, Callan,\u201d she informed him, fighting to keep her voice calm. \u201cI know what my body is doing, and why. I don\u2019t need any other explanations, all I need is privacy.\u201d</p><p>His golden brows snapped to a frown. A rumbling growl emanated from his throat.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t do that growling thing at me.\u201d She was tired, horny and irritated. She didn\u2019t need any more male aggression. \u201cGo away and leave me alone. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Merinus Tyler, are an irksome woman,\u201d he accused her.</p><p>\u201cJust go ahead and say \u2018bitch\u2019, my brothers do it all the time,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cNow, go play Lion-O someplace else. I don\u2019t have time for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLion-O?\u201d he questioned her, clearly offended at her reference to the cartoon character.</p><p>\u201cLion King?\u201d she asked sweetly. \u201cI\u2019m not here to pamper your ego. Now leave me alone.\u201d</p> <p>She watched his fists clench. His eyes narrowed further, giving him a predatory, dangerous appearance. He opened his mouth to speak, then seemed to change his mind. He turned and stalked from the room, jerking the door open then slamming it with a bang. Merinus flinched, then clenched her thighs together. Damn it.</p><p>\u201cI heard you were in town asking questions about Maria the other day,\u201d Callan said as he set a cup of coffee beside her sandwich plate when she sat down at the table. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He seemed less than pleased by the information. He sat across from her, cradling a steaming cup of coffee himself, his amber eyes watching her unblinkingly.</p><p>\u201cShe was murdered.\u201d Merinus refused to apologize or back down. \u201cShe was special to my father, Callan. I could tell by the way he talked about her. I want to know who killed her and why.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for long moments. Long enough for Merinus to pick up a half of the roast beef and tomato sandwich and bite into it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your father\u2019s business, nor yours,\u201d he berated her softly as she ate. \u201cYou are once again involving yourself in a place where you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Merinus watched him carefully, gauging the tension in his body, the growl of warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill the person responsible, Callan?\u201d Merinus forced the words from her mouth, needing to know the truth. She wouldn\u2019t blame him if he had, but she had to know. The realization of how little she knew him weighed upon her. She had spent the night in his bed, his body connected to hers, driving her to heights of pleasure she never imagined existed. She knew he had been bred to kill, but had no idea if he had crossed that line between his humanity and animal instinct.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who killed her, Merinus.\u201d He shook his head wearily. \u201cI wish I did, then I wouldn\u2019t have to wonder anymore. And I could repay him then, in kind.\u201d</p><p>The implication that he would kill was heavy in his voice. Merinus finished her sandwich, but her enjoyment for it had dulled somewhat.</p><p>But you suspect someone?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cHell, I suspect everyone,\u201d he bit out. \u201cIt could have been anyone. The Council is good at getting nice, ordinary folks to do their dirty work. I know, I\u2019ve seen it done before. My list of suspects is as long as four different counties and just as wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what they were looking for? Surely Maria said something before she died?\u201d Merinus probed cautiously, aware of the tension in his body, and the buried anger in his heart.</p><p>\u201cWhat she said didn\u2019t matter,\u201d he finally sighed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t name her killer, she asked for your father. I begged her to tell me who did it and she refused. She protected them, and I swear I haven\u2019t been able to figure out yet who she was protecting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would she have protected? Who was that close to the two of you, Callan?\u201d she asked, fighting to keep her voice even, the suspicions concerning the killer\u2019s identity to herself.</p><p>\u201cWe trusted no one, and those close to us couldn\u2019t have done it. They wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWhoever it was will show themselves eventually, and when they do, I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>The finality of his voice sent a shiver down Merinus\u2019 back. It was cold and hard and filled with menace.</p><p>\u201cCallan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough questions about Maria. I\u2019ll solve that when the times comes. How are you feeling now?</p><p>Merinus sighed roughly.</p><p>\u201cCallan, you have to do something soon,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep hiding.\u201d</p><p>The bright, golden brown depths were filled with sadness, arousal, and regret as he watched her. His lean, tanned face was striking in its sheer maleness. His eyes, despite the dark emotions, were so beautiful they made her heart clench.</p><p>\u201cWhen I can hide no more, then I\u2019ll leave here, Merinus. It\u2019s all I can do.\u201d He shook his head at the futility of her argument.</p><p>\u201cWe could help you, Callan.\u201d She tried to stem the tears, but they only fell harder as she felt her heart breaking not just for him, but for Sherra and for herself as well.</p><p>\u201cNo, Beauty.\u201d He grinned at her, though there was no humor in his smile. \u201cNo one can save me and we both have to accept that. I\u2019ll ensure your safety, and that of the others, but they know about me. There is no safety for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Callan\u2014\u201d He stood from the table, halting her words.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re finished eating, then I promised Sherra I would bring you to her. They need those samples and I need you soon before I die.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her from her chair, his lips going to hers, his tongue swirling into her mouth. Merinus groaned. The kiss was hot, so tempting, his taste alone enough to nearly make her peak.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you for lunch,\u201d he whispered as he nibbled her lips. \u201cRight across the table, Merinus, with my head buried between your thighs. Your taste is enough to make me drunk.\u201d His teeth scraped her neck, his hand roaming beneath the dark blue, soft shirt he had loaned her. His hands clenched on her buttocks, parting the flesh, his fingers tucking into the crevice as he pulled her closer. Merinus gripped his shoulders, moaning low and deep as his mouth whispered over her skin, moist and hot. Then he was kissing her again, drawing her tongue into his mouth, possessing her, making the heat in her body rise, the need between her thighs pulsate.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d Sherra spoke behind him, her voice firm. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting on her.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, staring down at Merinus while she shivered in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Sherra,\u201d he warned the other woman as he let Merinus go slowly, reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019ll wait up here for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Merinus. It shouldn\u2019t take us long,\u201d Sherra promised, casting Callan an impatient look. Merinus sighed. \u201cDamn it. Sex wasn\u2019t supposed to be this complicated.\u201d But she followed the other woman anyway, determined to hurry and get it over with, and get back to Callan\u2019s arms.</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>By the time the tests were completed, Merinus was nearly in pain, the arousal was hitting her so hard again. She could feel the moisture glazing her inner thighs, the heat and need building in her cunt like a volcano preparing to erupt. The pressure was tremendous. But on top of that was another problem. As hours ticked by, Sherra and the doctor both began to wear steadily on her nerves. Or more to the point, the touch of their hands, even protected by the latex gloves, did. It made her literally sick to her stomach, made her skin crawl, made her want to shrink from them as they came near her. She couldn\u2019t fully explain the sensation, even to herself. She knew though, if she had to tolerate one more minute of it, she was going to be sick. And she needed Callan. She was desperate to touch him, to feel the incredible warmth of his skin, his hands stroking over her. She was cold, aching, frightened.</p><p>\u201cNo more tests,\u201d she informed them as she dressed, buttoning Callan\u2019s shirt with shaking fingers over the throbbing mounds of her breasts. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tests are necessary, Merinus,\u201d Sherra told her with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cLook, I cannot fucking tolerate being touched anymore,\u201d she snapped, almost in tears, her skin still crawling from the sensation of someone\u2019s hands, other than Callan\u2019s on her. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Shock crossed Sherra\u2019s expression, bemusement filled the doctor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean, Merinus?\u201d Sherra\u2019s voice stayed soothing, but Merinus heard the confusion in her voice.</p><p>\u201cJust what I said.\u201d Merinus fought her tears. \u201cWhere\u2019s Callan? He was supposed to come for me.\u201d</p><p>She had to find him. Her body was going crazy, rioting. Tiny fingers of sensation were washing over her skin, leaving her shuddering, shaking.</p><p>\u201cCallan\u2019s upstairs, just as he promised he would be.\u201d Sherra reached out to touch her, but Merinus jumped back, flinching away from the contact. \u201cMerinus, something else is evidently happening. You have to let us help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me.\u201d Merinus shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSherra, get Callan down here,\u201d Doctor Martin had watched the byplay silently, but his voice now became commanding. \u201cGet him down here quickly.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merinus gripped the side of the bed. Her legs shook as she fought to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she panted, suddenly terrified by a thousand different feelings and sensations assaulting her. \u201cMake them take me home, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will discuss it with Callan, Merinus,\u201d he promised her softly, but she heard the indulgent tone of his voice. He was merely placating her. Lying to her.</p><p>She shook her head, fighting to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck is Callan,\u201d she cried out, disoriented now. She was sweating heavily; she could feel the moisture running down her face, between her breasts. Her heart was beating hard, laboring, her lungs fighting for breath. \u201cWhat did he do to me?\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched as she felt herself collapsing against the bed.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, Merinus.\u201d The doctor reached for her.</p><p>She felt his hands on her arm and jerked back, fire seemed to lance her skin, searing her flesh as she fought to get away. She stumbled over the bed, going to her knees, feeling the scrape of the hard floor as she fought to right herself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d she screamed out.</p><p>She was crying now, her stomach cramping. She clasped her abdomen, bending over, rocking against a pain she had never felt before. She was terrified. So scared that her entire body was shuddering now. She was cold, shivering, filled with dread and on the edge of hysteria.</p><p>\u201cMerinus.\u201d Callan\u2019s shocked voice echoed around the room.</p><p>Seconds later his hands gripped her arms, pulling her against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d His voice was raised, furious, the dangerous growl rumbling in his touch.</p><p>\u201cWithdrawal,\u201d the doctor bit out. \u201cI believe, Callan, your woman is in withdrawal.\u201d</p><p>Callan felt fear course through his body. Merinus was clawing at him, fighting to get closer to him, crying, hysterical with fear or pain, he couldn\u2019t say which.</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d He lifted her head, staring down into her face. She was pale, her eyes dark, nearly black with shock.</p><p>\u201cFrom you,\u201d Doctor Martin stated roughly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do for her now.\u201d</p><p>Callan cursed.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered desperately, her tears hot on his flesh, her body shaking, her skin cold and clammy. \u201cPlease, Callan. Please help me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her quickly into his arms, his lips going to hers, his kiss swallowing her cry as he turned from the others. His tongue went to her mouth, tempting hers, mating with it. He knew when the need had been at its height the night before, his kiss had soothed her, eased the clawing need. God help him and her if it didn\u2019t now.</p><p>He kissed her desperately, aching, hurting for her as she twisted in his arms, fighting to kiss him deeper, her lips and tongue mating with his, a hot moan of need whispering into his mouth, making it nearly impossible for him to control his own lusts now. But she eased. Slowly. The hard shivers that coursed over her body lessened, her whimpering cries became moans of desire.</p><p>\u201cWe need the saliva sample now.\u201d He heard the doctor at his side. \u201cWe cannot touch her, Callan. I need</p> <p>your help.\u201d</p><p>Moving his lips from hers, Callan laid Merinus back on the cot. She was watching with dazed need, like an addict needing a fix. Dear God, what had they done to her. He gripped her jaw gently.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he whispered as she flinched back, seeing the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d</p><p>The swab went around her mouth quickly.</p><p>\u201cYour turn.\u201d A clean swab poised at his mouth. Callan allowed the swab, watching Merinus carefully.</p><p>\u201cNo more tests,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t stand their touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let me,\u201d he asked her, his voice soft, cajoling. \u201cWe must find a way to stop this, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need another vaginal swab and Sherra needs blood. Now, Callan.\u201d The doctor\u2019s voice was imperative.</p><p>Merinus was shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Callan moved to her side. \u201cConcentrate on me, Merinus, and it will go quickly. Hold onto me, baby.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped one of her arms around his neck, the other he stretched out on the bed for Sherra, clasping their hands, holding her still. Then he lowered his mouth to her. She had the softest, sweetest lips, her tongue branded his when he touched it, her kiss made him weak, made his cock throb. He felt her jerk when Sherra inserted the needle into her arm, but she didn\u2019t fight it. The same when the vaginal sample was taken again, she endured it, focusing on his kiss, his touch, rather than the degrading tests that were required.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he whispered against her lips when they were finished. He picked her up in his arms, striding quickly now from the lab. Damn them. Him, Sherra, the doctor. What had they done to Merinus? Withdrawal, somehow she had become dependent on whatever primal drug his kiss released into her system. Dammit, they didn\u2019t even know what it was, didn\u2019t know how to control it.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. He couldn\u2019t stand this unbearable knowledge of what he was doing to her, the futility of trying to find a way to ease it.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she whispered desperately as he entered the main part of the house with her. \u201cI need you now, Callan.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers were digging into his shoulders, her voice weak, pleading. He couldn\u2019t make it to the bedroom with her. Her body wasn\u2019t the only one affected, she wasn\u2019t the only one steadily losing control. He laid her on the couch, ripping the damp shirt from her body then quickly shedding his jeans, before going to his knees between her spread thighs. His erection was steel hard, hurting from the need. Her scent was like a brand to his senses, hot and</p><p>seductive, just as addicting as their kisses, as the need for orgasm. He knew she was still sensitive, still sore. He fought for control. How he found it, he would never be certain. He slid into her, moving back to watch narrowly as the smooth folds of flesh parted around the width of his cock. Her vagina hugged him, sucked him in. His fingers smoothed over the silken flesh of her cunt, his eyes going to hers slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou wax?\u201d he whispered, drawing his finger over the glazed skin until he could circle her swollen clit. The pearl pulsed beneath his finger, begging for his attention.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her head tossed as he touched the sensitive flesh, as his cock slid in to the hilt, throbbing at the entrance to her womb.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d he asked her, gritting his teeth against the tightening of her inner muscles over his flesh.</p><p>Her eyes opened, dark, seductively, her lips parting as she moistened them with her tongue. His hips bucked against her.</p><p>\u201cA friend convinced me to try it,\u201d she panted, grinding against him, her breasts arching to his hands, her breathing harsh as he caressed her swollen nipples. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he gritted out. \u201cTell me why you keep it like this.\u201d</p><p>He slid nearly free of her body, his teeth clenching, perspiration dampening his entire body as he slid into the tight depths once again. Her muscles clenched, hot, milking his flesh. He had to keep his sanity. His control.</p><p>\u201cIt feels better,\u201d she gasped. \u201cFreer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel nothing but hot satin against me, Merinus,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cYou destroy my control like this. Hot velvet inside, silk and satin out. You make me mindless.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her, the fingers of one hand sinking into her hair, his lips nibbling at hers as he drew back, then inched in slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh, Callan.\u201d She shivered against him, her hands clutching at his back, her nails biting into his flesh. \u201cI need you harder. Please, do it harder.\u201d</p><p>He resisted temptation. He wanted her slow and easy first. He wanted to take her to the edge of madness where he seemed to teeter each time he touched her.</p><p>\u201cFeel how tight you are, Merinus,\u201d he groaned against her neck, his tongue lapping at the perspiration there. \u201cFeel how my flesh stretches you, fills you. You were created for me alone.\u201d</p><p>Her cunt tightened on him, her muscles spasmed as he whispered the words against her neck. He pulled back, his hand tightening in her hair, the other holding her hip, keeping her still as she fought to buck against his body.</p><p>His lips tracked to her breast, swollen, curved so sweetly, her nipple poised like a ripe little berry atop it.</p><p>He licked it, allowing his tongue to rasp it, his teeth to grip it as she jerked against him, trying to force a deeper contact. And all the while his cock moved slowly inside her, pushing past tight, slick muscles, pulling back, dragging the emerging barb across her tender tissue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill me,\u201d she panted. \u201cWhat in the hell is that, Callan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d he murmured against her breast. He was terrified to tell her, afraid disgust would ride the heels of her desire if he did so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Intense.\u201d She gripped him hard, making him grimace as he dragged his flesh nearly free of her, then pushed forward again. \u201cFirm,\u201d she panted. \u201cIt feels like a little finger raking over\u2014me.\u201d Her cry of pleasure electrified him as he felt the barb emerge further. He wouldn\u2019t last much longer. Control. He stilled, deep inside her, fighting for breath until he felt the small protrusion relax marginally. Damn, this was killing him. The sheer pleasure of the elongated growth scraping over her flesh was almost soul destroying. There had never been anything like it.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d she whimpered, pressing against him as he drew her nipple into his mouth for a quick taste.</p><p>\u201cSlow and easy, Merinus,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cFast and hard. Oh God, Callan. If I don\u2019t come soon I\u2019m going to die.\u201d</p><p>She was dazed, beseeching, clenching around him, her soft cream sliding over him. He wouldn\u2019t last much longer. The barb was pulsing, a demand of its own, his cock was throbbing, demanding action, demanding the fierce hard friction that sent him spiraling into climax.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d He kissed her breast again. \u201cI know you\u2019re tender.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m dying.\u201d He felt her legs lift, encircle his hips and his control disintegrated. Merinus cried out as the thrusts began. Hard, hot, driving into her. The thick expanse of his cock stretched her, biting at her flesh, whatever the hell that little thumb of silken torment located on his erection was doing to her, would kill her. It scraped over the walls of her cunt, caressing nerves she never would have known existed, swelling against her, pulsing, separating from the driving flesh of his erection.</p><p>Her legs tightened around his hips, driving him deeper within her as she fought for breath. It was so good. His scrotum slapped at her buttocks, the flesh of his lower abdomen raked her swollen clit. She felt fire in her vagina, in her womb, burning her, searing her. Her muscles clenched around him, loving the feel of the rough rasp of whatever it was that stroked the inner walls of her. It was hot. Oh God, it was killing her with pleasure, like a hard tickle. That\u2019s what it was. A strength destroying tickle that locked her muscles, stole her strength.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, baby,\u201d he groaned against her breast. \u201cI can\u2019t control\u2014\u201d</p><p>The little thumb lengthened, raked, locked his cock deep inside her, then impaled the ultra sensitive tissue in the very depths of her cunt. It moved, pulsed, tickled and stroked until she exploded. She screamed, feeling the hard jets of his semen as she climaxed around his flesh, her hips arching, her clit erupting in pleasure, lava thundered through her veins, bubbling with the fierce ecstasy as she pulsed</p><p>around him, milking his cock, soaking his flesh.</p><p>His hips jerked against her, his rumbling growls vibrating against her breasts as he breathed harshly at her shoulder, groaning in the throes of his own frenzied release. Then slowly, she felt the pressure ease. Once again it was only his cock, thick, softening only marginally as he pulled free of her.</p><p>\u201cOnce I rest,\u201d she said drowsily. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna tell me what that was, Callan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She snuggled against his chest as he collapsed beside her, dragging an afghan from the back of the couch and wrapping it around her, her breasts cushioned against the incredible heat of his chest, her body languid, sated for the moment.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to,\u201d he whispered at her ear, somber.</p><p>\u201cHm, you have to.\u201d She yawned. But first, a nap. Her eyes closed, her body relaxed against his heat and she drifted quickly into rest.</p> <p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>\u201cI have work to do.\u201d Merinus kept her voice carefully controlled, calm, as she sat at the kitchen table the next morning, staring down at her untouched cup of coffee.</p><p>Breakfast had been completed in silence, despite the amount of people who had ranged around the table. There were six of the Breeds as they called themselves, Merinus and the doctor. The sheer scope of the story she was now looking at terrified her. Not because of the implications of it, but due to the part she now played in it.</p><p>The others had left after eating. The other three males disappearing outside, Sherra, Dawn and the scientist returning to the lab while Callan stayed and watched Merinus in concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat work do you have that doesn\u2019t require you to be right where you are?\u201d His broad, bare shoulders lifted in a shrug, as though her forced confinement here was not a problem.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my cell phone?\u201d She ignored his question. \u201cAnd I want you to take me back to camp. I have interviews to do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am your story, then why would you need to do other interviews?\u201d he asked her curiously.</p><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s death\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cIs not part of this story, Merinus,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cHer death was not at the hands of Council members, I have told you this already. And it is a mystery you cannot solve. So let it go.\u201d</p><p>His voice was quiet, smooth. He watched her with those golden eyes, still hot with lust, but shadowed with demand.</p><p>\u201cI have a life, Callan, a job,\u201d she told him firmly. \u201cI have to get back to it. And I need my cell phone back. I have to talk to my family, let them know I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat will you tell them?\u201d he asked her, his eyes showing an amazing degree of genuine confusion. \u201cYou cannot tell them the truth, Merinus. Not until we have this figured out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll worry. And if they worry, all seven of my brothers will head out here and start kicking ass until they find me,\u201d she warned him. \u201cIt would be easier if you would just let me call them and let them know I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no problem with you calling them.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI have problems with what you might say. I will not have a team of scientists or Council killers following on their trail. I\u2019ve had the two who attacked you taken care of, do not bring more down on our heads right now.\u201d</p><p>Shock scattered through her system.</p><p>\u201cTaken care of?\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow did you take care of them?\u201d</p><p>Irritation flashed over his features. \u201cI slapped their hands and sent them home to their mommas,\u201d he bit out. \u201cHow did you think I was forced to do this, Merinus? They are killers. They would have raped and tortured you and given no thought to your pain or your life. Why does it matter how I took care of them?\u201d</p><p>He stood to his feet, stalking to the sink with his empty cup. Merinus pushed her fingers through her hair, breathing out roughly. Anger rose in her as the situation began to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cDid you kill them?\u201d she asked him furiously.</p> <p>He had his back to her, staring out of the kitchen window, his shoulders tense.</p><p>\u201cI had no choice.\u201d Heavy, cold, his voice whispered through the room.</p><p>\u201cThen you are no better than they are,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>\u201cThere is where you are wrong.\u201d He turned on her, his eyes blazing, his mouth pulled into a snarl that revealed deadly incisors. \u201cI did not ask them to create me, Merinus. I did not ask for the DNA they coded into my body, nor did I ask them to train me to kill. I did not ask them for any of their \u2018gifts\u2019. I most certainly did not ask them to stalk me, torture friends and make my life hell because I would not</p><p>slaughter innocents for them. And I will not tolerate them sending their soldiers out to destroy me, nor what I hold as mine, Merinus. It is the law of nature. Only the strongest will survive.\u201d</p><p>Rage trembled along his body, in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the jungle,\u201d she yelled back at him, standing to her feet as she placed her palms flat on the table. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to kill if you would let the world know what is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, such innocence,\u201d he growled, throwing his hands up in exasperation. \u201cFickle public that America possesses. We would likely be burned at the stake as monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet real, Callan, it\u2019s not the middle ages anymore,\u201d she burst out. \u201cDon\u2019t you think the public has a right to know? To be aware of the atrocities going on? Show them for the monsters they are and it will ensure your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not do this,\u201d he bit out, shaking his head roughly. \u201cYou have no idea of the men you go against, Merinus. Men whose social, financial and political resources span not just America, but also other nations, other pocketbooks. You will not take these men down. You cannot stop the killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even try,\u201d Merinus argued fiercely. \u201cLook at you, Callan. Hiding, never knowing what the hell is going on with your own bodies, unable to get the help you need, when you need it. This isn\u2019t living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the best I can do.\u201d His eyes were blazing. \u201cLet me tell you an alternative, Merinus.\u201d Her name was a curse on his lips. \u201cAn alternative is living in a structured lab, taken out only for tests and training, or breeding purposes. It\u2019s cold and sterile and a worse hell than you could ever know. At least here we are free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you kill?\u201d Her fists clenched as she fought to understand the life he lived. The war raging against him, through him.</p><p>\u201cIf they would cease to try to kill me, then I would no longer kill them,\u201d he informed her coldly, arrogance settling over him like an aura of danger.</p><p>\u201cYou can stop it,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>\u201cAs can they,\u201d he told her as she watched him fight for control. \u201cI would not kill their damned mercenaries if they would cease in sending them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo in. Father can help you.\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand his need to hide when help was being offered.</p><p>\u201cI am not a freak for your tabloids to ponder my humanity over.\u201d He shook his head sharply. \u201cI have as much right to live as you or your brothers. I will not have that questioned, nor will I leave it up to a fickle public to decide my fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t how it happens.\u201d Merinus clenched her fists angrily. \u201cThe public will help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if your \u2018spin\u2019 on the story is better than that of my enemies,\u201d he bit out. \u201cAnd trust me, Merinus, you are good, as are your brothers. But they will bribe your scientists, your doctors, they will jerk every weapon you have out of your hands until I am branded as no more than a monster. And then, there will be no place where I can hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t happen,\u201d Merinus assured him.</p><p>Merinus knew her father, uncle and brothers had been very careful. They wouldn\u2019t take a chance with his life.</p><p>Mockery washed over his face.</p><p>\u201cWill it not?\u201d he asked her. \u201cJacob thought he could aid us and refuse their offers. He returned home to the brutal deaths of his wife and children. A lesson. How many of your scientists would risk that?\u201d</p><p>Shock sped through Merinus\u2019 body. She knew the Council killed indiscriminately, she had the proof of it. But hearing Callan voice it, so coldly furious, made it somehow more real.</p><p>\u201cI promise you, my family has made a way for you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLook at us, Callan. Look at me. I can\u2019t be away from you for more than an hour without my body going into some kind of crazy withdrawal. I can\u2019t live this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will only be temporary,\u201d he promised her. \u201cDoc will fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she bit out. \u201cWhat if it can\u2019t be fixed, Callan? What if we can never be free of each other? What if we don\u2019t want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be born an animal, or an experiment. Wants don\u2019t count.\u201d His voice held a ring of finality.</p><p>\u201cAnd if Doc doesn\u2019t fix it?\u201d His attitude only spurred her anger further. \u201cWhat about me, Callan? Will you just run away and leave me to deal with it as best I can?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, turning away from her. She watched his muscular back heave with a harsh breath, his head lower.</p><p>\u201cIf I must,\u201d he told her softly, refusing to look at her now. \u201cI will if I have to make the choice of revealing my secrets, or being with you, Merinus. My family must come first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about your family,\u201d she told him, unreasonably furious at the stand he was taking. \u201cWhat\u2019s to keep me from telling?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her and the blood chilled in her veins. His eyes were cold, stone hard and as emotionless as his expression. Gasping, she backed away from him, fighting an instinctive fear that rose inside her.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d Sherra\u2019s voice stopped him from answering.</p><p>The tall blonde stood in the kitchen doorway, a syringe in one hand as she faced them.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need, Sherra?\u201d he asked her sharply. \u201cI have no time for more of your tests.\u201d</p><p>Merinus watched Sherra\u2019s eyes narrow.</p><p>\u201cGood, because I would more likely try to kill you rather than test you,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ve brought</p><p>Merinus\u2019 contraception injection. Perhaps you need to go outside and get your control back while she takes it.\u201d</p><p>Callan gave her a hard look.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intimidate me, brother,\u201d she informed him, moving into the room in determination. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t try to intimidate Merinus. This is hard enough on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not try to intimidate, Sherra,\u201d he reminded her darkly.</p><p>\u201cNo, you usually succeed,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut now is the wrong time to practice that tough attitude. Go stalk something non-human for a change, while I explain to Merinus why you were forced to kill to save the young girl those soldiers found a few hours after we rescued her, rather than letting her think you did it in cold blood.\u201d</p><p>Callan\u2019s eyes narrowed, while Merinus\u2019 widened.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sherra nodded, stopping beside her and indicating Merinus should lift her arm for the injection.</p><p>\u201cWhen he went back to track them, disable them, then send them home in shame, they were in the process of attempting to brutalize a young girl they had kidnapped earlier. When he interrupted them, they elected to fight rather than surrender, and when Callan would have still shown mercy, one of them attempted to kill the girl anyway.\u201d</p><p>Merinus took a deep, hard breath as she looked at Callan.</p><p>\u201cThey are still dead.\u201d He sneered. \u201cAnd they would have died for touching you alone.\u201d</p><p>Callan watched Merinus blink at his statement. He hadn\u2019t meant to reveal that, but the words had come out anyway. He had no intentions of leaving those bastards alive, as he would have normally done. He had been in a killing rage after rescuing Merinus from their hands, intent on destruction. The soldiers had just made it easier for his conscience to bear the weight.</p><p>They had touched what was his. He recognized the emotion, the origin of the fury now. They had laid their hands on his woman, put their scent on her. They had crossed a line Callan had never known existed. One that assured their deaths.</p><p>It worried him, this attachment he had for her, the violent emotions that swirled in his brain and in his body. He wanted to deny them, not just to her, but to himself. How could he walk away from her if he couldn\u2019t go more than a few hours without touching her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He watched, fighting to keep his face expressionless as Sherra gave Merinus the injection. He knew Doc wasn\u2019t giving her a normal contraceptive. The injection wasn\u2019t as powerful as the Depo-Provera shots given in a gynecologist\u2019s office. They lasted only days and didn\u2019t affect the system as severely.</p><p>\u201cI hate these shots, Sherra.\u201d He could still hear the throb of anger in Merinus\u2019 voice.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Sherra soothed her as she pulled the needle free. \u201cWe have all the samples we should need for a while. Until there\u2019s a change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere better be a change soon,\u201d Merinus said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m getting sick of this. There are things I need to do.\u201d</p><p>She needed to leave. Callan tamped down the instinctive fury he felt at that thought. She wanted to leave here, to put distance between them if he continued to refuse to give in to her demands to return with her, to reveal himself. His teeth clenched. She was so innocent, too damned innocent. There was no way he could be free of the Council as easily as she believed. If it could have been done, then Maria and Doc would have found a way to do so before her death.</p><p>\u201cCallan, Doc still needs samples from you,\u201d Sherra informed him, disrupting his thoughts. \u201cDaily. When will you be in the lab?\u201d</p><p>Callan shrugged. \u201cWhenever you are ready. Send Dawn up to stay with Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d Merinus retorted, her earlier anger still evident in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cToo bad,\u201d he told her, unconcerned. \u201cI am not comfortable leaving you alone, so I will ensure you are not alone. Your wishes in this don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>He ignored Sherra\u2019s look of surprise, Merinus\u2019 narrowed eyes and flash of stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Callan, I think all this excess testosterone flooding your system is putting you in overload.\u201d Sherra frowned.</p><p>\u201cTestosterone overload?\u201d Merinus gave an unladylike grunt. \u201cMore like asshole overload if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Callan growled low and deep at the defiance in her voice.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t you go doing that growling thing at me.\u201d She pointed her finger at him commandingly. \u201cI\u2019ve had it with you this morning, Callan. Don\u2019t bother leaving that lair in the basement if you can\u2019t act decent.\u201d</p> <p>His cock was throbbing. He could smell her arousal already and he could feel his blood pumping hard and demandingly into his cock. He should throw her across the table and fuck her into a screaming orgasm before leaving her. That would teach her to defy him in such a way. The thought of her, stretched out across the dark wood of the table as he drove inside her was nearly an irresistible vision of lust. She would throw her head back, beg him to ride her harder, deeper. He breathed in deeply.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d He stalked across the room as he ordered Sherra to follow him. \u201cAnother minute in this woman\u2019s company and I will become violent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I will,\u201d Merinus muttered, though her voice sounded weaker, more petulant than furious as it had before.</p><p>Strange, she had not pouted since he had first set eyes on her, he didn\u2019t expect to hear it coming from</p><p>her now. Let her pout, when he returned to her, he would show her who the dominant one was between them. He would make her scream for her release, beg him to throw her into orgasm. And he knew how to do it. The Council had been amazingly thorough in his lessons. Sex could be a weapon as well as a pleasure. A tool to kill, or to cajole, whichever the situation warranted. He would show her that foreplay could be a torture, a lesson in pleasure so incredible it bordered on pain. His cock jerked at the thought. Damn it, tests first, then he would show his woman who was boss.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>She wasn\u2019t about to wait on him. She was fed up with tests and orders, and the throbbing, heated need that pulsed through her body. All she had to do was get away from him. That was all. The enforced confinement only bred the dependency her body was harboring for him. If she could just get away from him, then she could control it.</p><p>Merinus hurriedly dressed in jersey shorts, a light tank top and her running shoes. She tucked some cash in the zippered pocket of the shorts, then slipped from the house. She knew the other three males were patrolling the hills around the cabin for mercenaries, but she hoped they were overlooking the main road in. A vehicle could be heard easily coming in, she knew. That area wouldn\u2019t be a weak point. Taking a deep breath, she sprinted across the yard and worked her way into the forest that bordered the road. Staying close to the graveled track, she kept just inside the tree line, jogging quickly toward the main road.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t take Callan long to find out she was missing, and tracking her sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him. She had to get to camp. Callan may have stolen the cell phone she carried with her, but there was a spare hidden in the jeep. And the jeep was still there. She had heard him discussing it with the others that morning. He wanted them to get the jeep and begin taking her camp down, removing all traces of her from the area.</p><p>Despite Sherra\u2019s attempts to ease her fears, Merinus feared Callan\u2019s intentions. He spoke so easily of killing those soldiers. What was to keep him from killing her when their passion had ended? When his body no longer craved her, when his lusts dimmed for her. She would become an inconvenience, one that knew his secrets.</p><p>Fear rushed through her veins, giving her the added adrenaline needed to push herself, almost at a run,</p><p>over the two miles of rough terrain to the main road. There, luck was with her. She had no more begun a hurried jog down the pavement when a car passed, then slowed. Relief washed over her when she saw the young girls watching her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cHey, ain\u2019t you the journalist that\u2019s been running around town?\u201d the blonde, gum snapping driver asked her with a smile.</p><p>The girl waitressed evenings at the small restaurant she ate in, Merinus remembered.</p><p>\u201cI need a ride back to camp,\u201d Merinus told her urgently. \u201cCould you drive me there?\u201d</p><p>She was sweating, her blood thundering through her veins. She needed Callan. She swallowed at the bile rising in her throat as she fought the weakening symptoms.</p><p>\u201cSure. Get in. You look kinda sick, though. Sure you don\u2019t want to go to the doctor?\u201d</p><p>Merinus pulled the back door open and slid in thankfully.</p><p>\u201cNo doctors.\u201d She barely halted the shudder of her body at the thought of someone touching her. \u201cJust take me to the access road to my camp. I\u2019ll be fine from there.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if her jeep was still there. Another cell phone was hidden there, a spare, just in case, Kane had told her. She had to get to that phone.</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d A heavy foot hit the gas and the car shot forward. Merinus bit her lip, fighting the need to scream out at her to stop, to take her back to Callan. Addictions could be cured, she told herself. Detox. Kane had gone through it a long time ago, and he told her once, any addiction could be cured. All you had to do was fight it. Just fight it. She could fight it, Merinus assured herself.</p><p>Her fists clenched in the pockets of her shorts, her body throbbed and the air became stifling. She tasted blood from her teeth biting into her lips and she was forced to clench her teeth instead. Control, she chanted to herself. Control. Kane said all it took was control.</p><p>The roar that erupted from Callan\u2019s throat when they realized Merinus was missing almost shocked him. He knew it shocked the others. Dawn whimpered, Sherra flinched. The three men whose sole job it was to protect the house paled.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know she was out there?\u201d The primal growl in his voice had the three men taking a step back.</p><p>\u201cWe were above her, Callan. There was no reason for us to believe she would try to slip away from you,\u201d Taber defended them all.</p><p>\u201cAnd why would you not patrol the road? Do you think no one would think to use it?\u201d he bit out harshly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is it there for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing if they were on foot as Merinus was,\u201d Callan rasped furiously. The rage pulsing through his body was hot and violent. Damn her to hell, she had run from him. Taken money and the keys to her vehicle and ran, despite the needs raging through her body. And she needed. He knew, because the hot throb of lust was making him demented.</p><p>\u201cWe miscalculated,\u201d Taber admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou fucked up, there\u2019s a difference,\u201d Callan accused him. \u201cShe\u2019s headed for camp.\u201d He pushed his fingers through his hair, fighting to think. \u201cShe\u2019ll want her vehicle so she can run. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel, unwilling to wait any longer.</p><p>\u201cSherra, you and Tanner head for town, make certain she\u2019s not there. The rest of us will head to camp. My damned luck she\u2019s fucking called in the Marines by the time I get there.\u201d</p><p>The Marines or those damned brothers she kept threatening him with. That woman thought her brothers could move the damned world if they wanted to. He bit back an oath of disgust as he jumped into the Bronco and turned the key. Taber and Dayan followed quickly, settling into their seats as Callan tore out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s becoming a liability, Callan,\u201d Dayan charged as they sped onto the main road minutes later. \u201cA danger to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Dayan.\u201d Callan flicked a glance at the other man through the rear view mirror. He watched fury wash over Dayan\u2019s face, his brown eyes narrowing in offense. Callan was passed caring. Respect came with a price. He and Taber had fucked up, and Callan would be damned before he would accept the responsibility for that himself. They each had a job to do and he had done his part. The other males had failed in theirs and the price could end up being their lives if they didn\u2019t find Merinus.</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t have much of a head start on us,\u201d Callan bit out. \u201cNo more than an hour, and she would have taken much of that jogging to the main road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be less if she didn\u2019t get a ride right off,\u201d Taber offered. Callan flicked him a sarcastic glance. Of course, she would have got a ride right off. No one around here left anyone walking.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s called her family, you\u2019ll have to let her go, Callan,\u201d Dayan bit out. \u201cWe\u2019ll all go into hiding again. There\u2019s no other choice.\u201d</p><p>Callan refused to answer him. He turned sharply onto another graveled path, a short cut that would take him right to the area Merinus had parked her jeep. The drive was mere minutes compared to the half hour it would take by going around. He prayed he got to Merinus before she got to that damned jeep. If she managed to get out of the county before he caught up with her, then they were both in more trouble</p><p>than he even wanted to consider.</p><p>Callan would not even consider letting Merinus go. He couldn\u2019t. Not yet. Not now. Not while his body was inflamed, his natural instincts to subjugate his mate rioting within his body. He couldn\u2019t believe she had made such a damned foolish move. That the strong, determined woman he was getting to know would run in such a way. That she was brave enough to tempt the beast lying just below the surface.</p><p>She was sweating, her breathing laboring in her lungs by the time she reached the small clearing where her jeep was parked. It was still there. She was almost crying in relief as she stumbled against the vehicle, fighting the zipper to her shorts pocket and struggling to pull her keys out. She nearly dropped them twice before she managed to fit the key into the lock and twist it. She scrambled into the interior, shuddering, her body weak, unsteady as she groped at the glove box to open it. The door finally fell open, revealing the spare cell phone that Kane insisted she keep up. Flipping it open, she keyed the rapid dial and listened for the call to go through.</p><p>\u201cMerinus!\u201d His voice was a desperate yell across the line.</p><p>\u201cKane,\u201d she gasped, lying across the seat now, clutching her stomach. \u201cOh, God. I\u2019m in trouble, Kane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She could hear him cursing, raging. There was fear in his voice though, and worry.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Merinus, I told you this was fucking stupid,\u201d he screamed again.</p><p>\u201cJust shut up,\u201d she tried to yell back, but her voice was weak. \u201cCome get me, Kane. He\u2019ll find me and I can\u2019t drive. You have to come get me. This is big. God, bigger than we knew\u2014\u201d The soft growl at her back had her freezing in terror.</p><p>\u201cMerinus?\u201d Kane questioned into the sudden silence.</p><p>Merinus whimpered. She felt him behind her, big, hard, aroused. She knew he was aroused, knew he was furious.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Kane\u2014\u201d The phone was jerked out of her hand as she was lifted from the jeep seat. She heard Kane screaming at her, watched as Callan closed the line, slowly, deliberately.</p><p>\u201cThat was a mistake,\u201d she snarled in his face, her fist striking out at him, catching him off guard. He released her long enough for her to scramble away from him then dash through the trees as she ran for the main road. If she could get close enough, maybe someone would hear her screams for help. Someone would know she was in trouble.</p><p>\u201cLeave her,\u201d he ordered Dayan and Taber as they started after her. \u201cPack this shit up and hide it. Jeep and all. I\u2019ll meet you at the house in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Callan tossed the ringing cell phone into the jeep with a snarl.</p><p>\u201cYou just going to let her run?\u201d Taber asked him curiously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s headed away from the road, not to it.\u201d He shrugged, knowing how often greenhorns got lost in the area due to the paths that pretty much looked the same. \u201cDo as I said. I\u2019ll catch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh, Callan, maybe you should let me go after her,\u201d Taber suggested. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly calm right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s safe. For now,\u201d Callan assured him. \u201cJust do as I said, and I\u2019ll meet you back at the house later.\u201d</p><p>Callan was furious. He couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t managed to get to her before she made that damned phone call. The last thing he needed was the Tyler newspaper clan descending on the little town, looking for him. He should have taken care of the camp and her jeep sooner. That was a miscalculation on his part. And he would have never suspected she was carrying two cell phones. All he could seem to consider right now was the fact that she had run from him. Deliberately, had left the house and tried to escape him. She belonged to him, at least until whatever the hell it was that made his cock throb decided to stop. Until then, she was a necessity to him. Just as he knew he was to her. He could smell her heat beckoning him. Fear and confusion and arousal. It was a heady scent that sent his own pulse pounding, his erection jerking in response. He didn\u2019t run after her, he stalked her. Moving around her, behind her, choreographing his moves as he pushed her towards the area he wanted. A clearing in the heavy growth of the forest, a secluded, private area sheltered on three sides by cliffs, with only a narrow entrance in or out. He wanted her there, in the privacy of the place he had chosen as his own.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take him long before he was following her through the entrance, his steps light, silent. He could hear her breathing heavily, cursing. He smiled, her brothers must have taught her those curses, because no lady could have thought of them on her own.</p><p>She was sitting beside the stream, sweat dampened, her head lowered as she muttered weakly about</p><p>\u201cdamned animals and superior men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ve had it now.\u201d She stared up at him, her eyes dark, glittering wildly with lust and defiance.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hunt you down like a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong species, darling.\u201d He smiled slow and sure.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes on him as he stripped the shirt from his back.</p><p>\u201cAsshole,\u201d she muttered, her breathing becoming harsh, heavy as he kicked the leather moccasins from his feet.</p> <p>\u201cMine.\u201d He growled.</p><p>Her eyes widened as he stripped his pants from his body, his cock springing free, hard, jutting. He watched her nipples harden further beneath her shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yours,\u201d she bit out, her protest weak.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off, Merinus,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cIf I attempt it, I\u2019ll tear them from your body. You should have never run from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I just wait around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the fucking clothes off before I rip them from you,\u201d he threatened her again, his fists clenched as he fought the urge to do just that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you.\u201d But she did. He could smell her want, feel it in the heat radiating from her body.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d He made a move toward her, satisfaction filling every pore in his body as her shirt came off quickly, then her shorts.</p><p>She was naked. Gloriously, beautifully naked. She stared up at him, flushed and furious, her breathing harsh in the sudden silence of the glade.</p><p>\u201cKane will come for me,\u201d she warned him darkly. \u201cHim and the rest. He won\u2019t let you keep me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have to find you first,\u201d he told her softly, smiling with his victory as he came toward her. \u201cAnd I promise you, he won\u2019t find\u2014\u201d</p><p>Stars exploded in front of his eyes as her foot connected with his balls. He blinked, fought the onrush of bile rising in his throat, and fought for breath as he fell to the ground. Fuck. That hurt. He wheezed, fighting for breath, aware of the jerkiness of her movements as she pulled her clothes back on. She was weak, her body trembling, the need pouring through her making her clumsy. Son of a bitch, she was going to want for a while. Then she was off and running again. Callan pulled himself weakly to his feet, fighting for breath and mentally cursing the little bitch for everything she was worth. Or wasn\u2019t at that moment. Damn her. He was going to tan her hide. He jerked his jeans from the ground, intent on stepping into them when he heard her scream. Terror filled the sound. He dropped his pants and with more than a little pain, sprinted after her, fury rising inside him once again. He\u2019d kill whoever scared her. Then by God, she would pay for this little stunt.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>Dayan had her. He wasn\u2019t touching her, but he didn\u2019t have to. His face was a mask of fury, his lips pulled back in a snarl, his incisors showing as he growled out another warning at her. His eyes seemed to glow, his body tense and ready for attack. Merinus was on the ground again, scooting back desperately as he advanced on her.</p><p>\u201cCallan,\u201d her scream ricocheted around the clearing as Dayan reached for her. Callan acted on instinct. He saw the intent in Dayan\u2019s face, the twisted fury and hunger that raged in the other man. He launched himself at him, a savage snarl erupting from his throat as he tackled the other man.</p><p>Callan had known killing rage only one time before. The haze of blood before his eyes, the need for death in his tense muscles as he threw Dayan away from Merinus, the savage snarl of fury should have been enough to warn the other man. Instead, Dayan rolled to his feet, facing the proclaimed head of the pride, snarling in defiance.</p><p>Callan narrowed his eyes, seeing the blood in Dayan\u2019s eyes, and knew the time had come to reassert his supremacy within the Pride they had established.</p><p>Merinus watched in growing horror as the other man challenged Callan. He was younger, both men were in superb condition and ready to fight.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d she whispered, coming to her feet, backing away slowly.</p><p>\u201cTaber,\u201d Callan called out, never taking his eyes from Dayan. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking touch her.\u201d</p><p>Merinus looked around desperately. The quiet, black haired Taber emerged from the trees, his jade green eyes concerned as he watched the other two men.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me touch you, Merinus,\u201d he warned her as she turned to run in the opposite direction. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be pleasant for either of us.\u201d</p><p>A scream of fury echoed through the clearing. Merinus swung around just in time to see Dayan go flying over Callan\u2019s shoulder to hit the ground hard. He came up quickly though, launching himself at Callan once again. Callan stepped aside at the last second, a smooth, gliding motion that put him out of touch, and he smiled when Dayan hit the ground once again.</p><p>Dayan shook his head this time, appearing rattled by the fall.</p><p>\u201cIf you had touched my woman, Dayan, I would have had to kill you,\u201d Callan warned him as the other man came to his feet. \u201cI will have no one\u2019s scent upon her other than my own.\u201d</p><p>Merinus rolled her eyes. What was it with him and scents?</p><p>\u201cYou are his mate, Merinus.\u201d Taber must have caught the reaction. He stood close to her, but not touching as he watched the fight progress.</p><p>They were throwing punches now, though few of Dayan\u2019s wild swings actually connected. The man was working himself into a froth of fury. Growling, spittle flying as Callan faced him calmly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking mate,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth. Even Sherra and Dawn do not handle such language,\u201d he told her with a frown, then winced as Callan threw Dayan to the dirt once again.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Merinus muttered as both men were suddenly on the ground, teeth bared, fists flying. Callan\u2019s blows were harsh, hard. Merinus heard his fists connecting with Dayan\u2019s flesh, heard the other man\u2019s grunts of pain, his snarls of rage. She had never seen anything so vicious as the blood and blows that rained between them. Until finally Dayan fell back, nearly unconscious as Callan jumped to his feet. Savage, glittering amber eyes shot to Merinus. She watched, her throat dry, eyes widening as his cock slowly hardened as he advanced on her.</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here,\u201d his voice was a harsh rasp as he grabbed Merinus\u2019 arm. \u201cGet back to the house. I\u2019ll deal with him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already dealt with him,\u201d Merinus protested as he began to drag her back to the stream. His hand was hard on her arm, almost bruising as he forced her behind him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with him further,\u201d he bit out, male fury crackling in the air. \u201cBut you I will deal with here.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her to the grass, moving quickly between her thighs before she could strike out with her feet. He gripped her fists in one hand, stretching her back, anchoring her along his body as his cock pressed the jersey material of her shorts against the soaked entrance to her vagina.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d She hated the fear that tinged her voice.</p><p>He was too angry, too intense. She didn\u2019t know how to handle the animalistic, savage side of his nature. He ripped her shorts from her body, tearing them from her and leaving them in shreds.</p><p>\u201cI warned you I would rip them from your body.\u201d The shirt went next. Her furious struggles didn\u2019t deter him in the least. He held her still, watching her body as she writhed against him. Merinus was breathing hard, her skin sensitive, the rasp of the fine hairs on his body caressing her was nearly driving her mad. They were downy soft, stroking against her. The hair on his</p><p>legs rasped her inner thighs, the tip of his cock nudged at her tender entrance. Merinus felt the blood thundering through her veins. She wanted him. Oh, she wanted him so bad it was about to kill her. Inside her, deep and hard, making her scream in her need.</p><p>\u201cYou ran from me,\u201d he growled, sinking a bare inch of his erection into her. Merinus felt the tiny thrust, her muscles clenching around it, weeping for more. Her clit throbbed, her breasts ached, the sensitive nipples so hard and hot she wondered if they would burst.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you\u2014\u201d She shook her head, her back arching as another inch sank into her.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d his vow was low and rough.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d She was crying from need now. Her drenched cunt begging for more of him. \u201cI won\u2019t let you do this to me. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He pushed in a bit more. Merinus held her breath, feeling the tight stretch of her muscles as they conformed to his width. She pulsed around him, feeling more of her juices easing around his flesh. She was slick, frothing with lust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he ordered her, his voice dark, rough. \u201cTell me you are mine, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, his eyes bright, intense as he held her securely while pushing inside her by slow, torturous degrees. She was shamefully aware of the pulse of her inner flesh as it milked him, caressed him. She was drowning in her own lusts, her own needs.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she begged shamelessly, her breasts pressing against his chest. \u201cPlease, Callan, touch me.\u201d</p> <p>His tongue licked over her breasts. Rough, rasping her flesh, she arched against him, needing more.</p><p>\u201cTell me, and I will give you what you need,\u201d he told her tautly. \u201cSay the words, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, her hips twisting as she fought to get closer to him, to drive that steel hard flesh deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou will tell me,\u201d he groaned, his hand gripping her hip while the other held her hands anchored to the ground.</p><p>She looked up at him, seeing the savage lines of his face, the determination in his eyes. His body was hard, so hot against hers it nearly scorched her. She had to fight to keep the words he wanted from pouring from her mouth. He wanted surrender. He wanted to dominate and possess and she refused to allow it. She couldn\u2019t let him. If he did it now, there would be no stopping him from doing it later.</p> <p>\u201cAre you mine?\u201d she asked him instead, her muscles clenching on the few scant inches of hard flesh flexing inside her. \u201cWho do you belong to, Callan?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cMy brothers will be here soon,\u201d she told him, panting, fighting to keep her sanity. \u201cThey\u2019ll take me home then. Whose will I be then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he bit out, his hips pulling back, then easing his erection inside her again, no further though, than it had been before.</p><p>\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t mine?\u201d she whispered, gasping as his teeth nipped at her breast, his tongue stroking over her nipple.</p><p>Oh, how she wanted to give in.</p> <p>\u201cYou will not leave,\u201d he growled, nipping her again, then licking the wound. His teeth were hard, sharp, the little flashes of heated sensation speared to her womb, causing it to clench hard, deep.</p><p>\u201cHow will you stop me?\u201d she whispered, staring up at him, straining to get closer, to get him deeper inside her.</p><p>He breathed in hard. Rough.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine. Mine, Merinus.\u201d His hips plunged hard, driving his cock deep inside her, causing her body to scream with pleasure, with an overload of sensation that made her cry out as her teeth sank into his shoulder.</p><p>There was no stopping him then. He moaned, harsh and wild into her neck as he began to pound into her. He filled her cunt, stretching the sensitive tissue deliciously, stroking it as a million bolts of erotic electricity sizzled along her channel. Deep, driving thrusts that had her screaming, begging for release. She felt his cock throb, then along the soft tissue of the roof of her vagina it began. At first, just a soft nuance of change. A stroke, like a whisper of sensation. A separate pulse, a heated prong of pleasure she couldn\u2019t stand. It raked against nerve endings she never knew existed, made her twist, fight for more.</p><p>\u201cMerinus,\u201d he groaned her name as it began happening, his voice fraught with unbearable pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Her head twisted as it became firmer, stroking her harder, driving her higher. \u201cOh God, Callan. I can\u2019t stand\u2014\u201d</p><p>She screamed with what little breath she had left. She felt it extend, pulsing as it lodged in the ultra sensitive muscles in the depths of her flesh as Callan\u2019s release began bursting inside her. She couldn\u2019t stop her own climax. It tore through her body to the pulse of that nubbin stroking the exact center of her sensations. Her legs tightened around his hips, grinding her clit against him, feeling the hard beat of release there, as well as deep inside her womb. She was pulsing, erupting, begging for breath as the pleasure seemed never ending, until she collapsed against him.</p> <p>His arms were tight around her. She never knew when he released her hands. His head was buried in her neck, his own breath heaving from his chest as he fought for air. His body was tense and hard, dominating.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he whispered again into her neck.</p><p>Merinus felt tears come to her eyes. She was naked, stretched out on the grass in the middle of a damned forest with a man she didn\u2019t even really know still lodged inside her body. Her flesh still shuddered from her orgasm, her vagina clasped around his erection, unwilling to let him go, and she was</p><p>suddenly terrified.</p><p>\u201cLet me up,\u201d she whispered, pushing at his shoulders, fighting the weariness and the fear rising inside her. She felt his lips at her neck once again. Warm, the caress sent tingles of sensation over her body. Her nipples beaded once again and she felt the fluttering need in her womb as her body responded to it. Her breath hitched, she felt her tears as they fell from her eyes and rolled down the sides of her face.</p><p>\u201cMerinus?\u201d His voice was soft, low, a husky purr of satiation as he levered himself above her. She turned her face from him, shifting her back, suddenly aware of the rough ground on her flesh. He moved from her, and she could barely control her sobs as she felt the firm length of his cock slowly draw from her inner flesh.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d He eased her up, his hands gentle as they ran over her body, his expression somber, remorseful.</p><p>Merinus shook her head, fighting her tears. She was damp with sweat, his semen and her juices leaked from between her thighs, a warm reminder of the fiery orgasm that had gripped her moments before. She heard him sigh wearily as he moved away from her, then he was drawing his shirt over her head, tucking her arms into it, covering her body. He moved away from her then, jerking his jeans from the forest floor and pulling them on. His moccasins came next, his movements graceful, fluid, despite the anger she could feel pulsing from him.</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019ll get your shoes,\u201d he ordered her.</p><p>Merinus nodded, staring at her bare feet, the red polish that needed replacing on her toenails, the dirt on her feet and legs.</p><p>A broad, male hand moved to her chin, turning her face to him. She jerked away, hiding her face, her tears. His hand gripped her chin, pulling her face up as he stared down at her, his expression brooding.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to push me,\u201d he reminded her, his tone harsh. \u201cNow will you stay here, or must I drag you with me to find your damned shoes?\u201d</p><p>She nearly choked on her sobs as she fought to contain them. She nodded jerkily. She couldn\u2019t speak, if she did, she was terrified she would lose the control she was fighting so desperately for. He released her, demanding nothing more, then turned and stalked away. Merinus wrapped her arms around her waist, biting her lip as she tried to stem the tears that fell from her eyes. She was suddenly so frightened she could only shudder with it. What in God\u2019s name had she gotten herself into?</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Callan knelt at her feet. With gentle hands he put her shoes on, then tied them quickly. Rather than moving when he finished, he continued to kneel there, his head lowered, his fingers caressing her ankle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice was edged with frustration. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>His head raised, his eyes dark with concern and bemusement. As though he too were treading in waters</p><p>so unfamiliar the threat of drowning was imminent.</p><p>\u201cKane will come for me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have to let me go, Callan.\u201d</p><p>His lips twisted bitterly. \u201cI know,\u201d he agreed, his hand lifting, his thumb wiping her tears from beneath one eye. \u201cBut to take you, Merinus, he\u2019ll have to kill me.\u201d</p><p>The finality in his voice terrified her. The resounding echo in her heart shattered her last hope that she would ever be free of him.</p><p>\u201cYou said you could walk away,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cThat even if it hurt you could walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd an hour later I found you gone and lost my sanity,\u201d he told her bleakly. She shook her head. This couldn\u2019t be happening. Not like this. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.</p><p>\u201cKane won\u2019t let you keep me,\u201d she said, desperate for him to understand, to let her go. Desperate to make herself believe, despite the agony throbbing inside her. She didn\u2019t want to be free of him, and that frightened her more than anything.</p><p>\u201cAs I would refuse to let any man hold Sherra or Dawn against their will,\u201d he answered her, his expression drawn into lines of acceptance. \u201cThis will be up to you to solve, Merinus. One of us will die if you try to leave with him. I won\u2019t let him take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said the doctor would find a cure.\u201d Her fists clenched as she rejected his brutal statement. \u201cYou said he would make it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while you were running, I learned he cannot.\u201d Callan reached up, pulling her hair back from her face as he watched her. \u201cIt will have to ease on its own, and he believes it will. But he believes it will never go away completely. This need, Merinus, whatever it is, could be something neither of us will be free of. Something I\u2019m not certain I want to be free of.\u201d</p><p>She heard the curious note of vulnerability in his voice. A bemusement that he felt that way.</p><p>\u201cI have to call my brothers. They have to know I\u2019m safe.\u201d She knew Kane was going crazy with worry. He wasn\u2019t safe to be around when he did that.</p><p>Callan sighed wearily, rising to his feet.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go back to the cabin. We\u2019ll discuss it there.\u201d He held his hand out to her. Merinus stared up at him, anger and pain shattering her.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t let me call them, will you? You won\u2019t let them help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let them take you,\u201d he corrected her. \u201cAnd if they can find you, they will try to take you, Merinus. They will convince themselves you can be cured. That the need can be taken away. I don\u2019t believe it can. I believe nature is having its last laugh on those crazy bastards who created me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She shook her head, even more confused than before.</p><p>\u201cThe hormone releasing from my body to yours counteracts the contraception injection the doctor\u2019s been giving you,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cWe were created to be unable to breed, our semen incompatible with normal humans. But that hormone is changing that, slowly. Reversing the DNA coded into us. We\u2019re mated. Nature will allow us no other choice.\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt her world tilt. Her hands pressed to her stomach, she had to fight for air.</p><p>\u201cAm I\u2014?\u201d She swallowed tightly.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he assured her. \u201cBut eventually you will be. There\u2019s nothing we can do but see how this anomaly intends to work itself out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Desperate, pleading, she came to her feet, her hands gripping his arms. \u201cNo, Callan, you have to do something to stop this. Wear a condom. That would protect me.\u201d</p><p>Mockery slashed across his face. \u201cWhat, Merinus, unwilling to breed with an animal after all?\u201d</p><p>Shock held her immobile for only a moment.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d she lashed out at him. \u201cI\u2019m unwilling to be an experiment for you. You don\u2019t love me, Callan. I\u2019m nothing to you but a bodily function. I refuse to have a child under those circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA condom will not work anyway,\u201d he told her bitterly. \u201cThat part of me that gives you such pleasure, that swells and throbs within your flesh would not allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d She shook his arm, her nails biting into his flesh. \u201cA condom would work, Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA condom would split when the barb swells from my cock, Merinus. At full erection, it fills the back of your tight little cunt, locking it into your flesh. It doesn\u2019t hurt you, because it\u2019s blunt-tipped, but it\u2019s too large for a condom to sustain.\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt the blood drain from her face. Her knees weakened, her heart beating sluggishly within her breast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBarb?\u201d Her voice was strangled now as she fought the rising nausea erupting in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI told you I was an animal, Merinus,\u201d he bit out. \u201cDo you not remember me warning you, that day at the station?\u201d His gaze was hard, cold as he watched her now. Merinus felt the chill of it running over her body. \u201cYou should have believed me.\u201d</p><p>Merinus let go of his arm, fighting to breathe past the panic filling her.</p><p>\u201cThen we just fight it,\u201d she said, her lungs fighting to draw air past the constriction in her throat. \u201cWe don\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t\u2014\u201d She waved her hand at the erection showing beneath his jeans.</p><p>\u201cFuck?\u201d he questioned her sarcastically, arching a golden brow in inquiry. Merinus shook her head, her temples throbbing, her pulse rocketing through her body.</p><p>\u201cWithdrawal is just that.\u201d She fought to breathe evenly. \u201cWe\u2019ll get over it. We just abstain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou can abstain all you want. I\u2019m not so willing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head, moving away from him. \u201cYou have to, Callan. You have to. We can\u2019t bring a baby into this. Please. Babies are innocent. They don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>She was crying again. Her stomach was rioting with nerves, her chest tight with pain. She could feel panic overwhelming her, hysteria rising inside her. She couldn\u2019t have a baby. She wasn\u2019t ready for a baby.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we need to get home.\u201d His arm went around her waist. Merinus jumped back from him. Terror was freezing the blood in her veins. She shook her head, holding her hands up, backing away from him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t touch me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this happen, Callan. We can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let you do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerinus, let\u2019s go home. We\u2019ll settle it there,\u201d he told her, his voice pitched to a soothing level.</p><p>\u201cDamn right we\u2019ll settle it,\u201d she gasped, determination hardening her voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll settle it in different rooms, Callan. On different sides of the house. This is over. I refuse to have a child, now or in the near future. Especially with a man determined to risk everything he is for pride. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll trust you to protect our child, when you don\u2019t even take measures to protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>She watched the anger settle in his face, in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will allow no child of mine to be tested or taken from me, Merinus,\u201d he informed her coldly. \u201cYou can count on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how the hell do you think you can ensure that?\u201d Incredulity sped through her.</p><p>\u201cI will ensure it,\u201d he bit out, gripping her arm and moving her steadily along the path back to the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cThe conversion hasn\u2019t been completed yet. When it has been, we\u2019ll deal with it. Until then, I will not let you go. Brother or no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me forever.\u201d She stumbled against him, shivering as the soft, ultra soft hairs of his chest caressed her arms. Damn him. He didn\u2019t have to feel so good. He didn\u2019t have to do this to her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>Callan half dragged Merinus into the house, his expression stony, his eyes glittering with renewed anger. That was just fine, Merinus thought, because she was none too calm herself. Anger pulsed through her body as hot and pure as the desire did.</p><p>\u201cI need a shower,\u201d she bit out, jerking away from him as he slammed the door behind them. The whole gang was assembled now, she thought sarcastically as she watched the interested expressions of the six other people in the room. Even Dr. Martin was there, calmly sipping his coffee as he eyed them.</p> <p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Callan bit out. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done, you get your ass to the bedroom where you can\u2019t get into any trouble.\u201d</p><p>She cast him a mocking glance.</p><p>\u201cI remember Kane saying that one. He learned better, too.\u201d</p><p>Several snickers and varied coughs sounded through the room. Merinus didn\u2019t wait around to see who did what, or Callan\u2019s reaction to it. Checking to be certain his large T-shirt covered her rear sufficiently, she swept through the house, heading for the bedroom and a hot bath.</p><p>\u201cShe called her brother.\u201d Callan watched Merinus disappear into the hallway. \u201cI expect the full brood to descend on us. It\u2019s time to make plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she was trouble,\u201d Dayan growled, his eyes glittering with hot anger beneath the bruises that marred it.</p><p>Callan stared at the man, seeing a fury that worried him.</p><p>\u201cI would refrain from such comments until I forget the fact that you were ready to attack her,\u201d Callan ordered him tightly. He would never forget the sight of Dayan ready to spring and attack. Dayan\u2019s lips curled, and Callan nearly lost his control again.</p><p>\u201cGet outside and patrol the house if you can\u2019t contribute something to this conversation.\u201d Callan stalked to the coffee pot, pouring a large mug and fighting for composure. He heard a chair scrape eerily over the wood floor. Seconds later, the back door slammed with window rattling force.</p><p>\u201cAnyone else?\u201d he asked without turning around. Silence greeted the question.</p><p>He turned back to them, seeing the concern on their faces.</p><p>\u201cKane\u2019s Special Forces,\u201d Taber informed him quietly. \u201cA higher quality than those buffoons the Council keeps sending out. His brothers aren\u2019t slouches either. He\u2019s trained them. They\u2019ll find the house. They\u2019ll come in loaded to hell and back to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that already,\u201d Callan snarled.</p><p>He knew everything there was to find out about the family. Seven brothers and her father, each man confident, strong. They were arrogant and commanding forces to be reckoned with alone. Together, they would be a small army.</p><p>\u201cIf he takes her, or if he kills you, she\u2019ll suffer,\u201d Dr. Martin spoke up. \u201cThe withdrawal won\u2019t go away according to my tests, Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your theory on conception?\u201d Callan quizzed him sharply. Dr. Martin shrugged. \u201cThe hormone produced only during pregnancy slows it down, but little else. What worries me is the effect your hormones are having on her contraceptives. It counteracts them. And somehow, someway, a minute amount of your sperm has become perfectly normal. There\u2019s a chance, albeit slim, that she could conceive at any time.\u201d</p><p>Callan rubbed at his neck wearily. More complications, more test results that did little to help them.</p><p>\u201cWe need to meet with her brothers before this goes any further,\u201d Taber said worriedly. \u201cWe can\u2019t take a chance with you, Callan. Or with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her call them, Cal,\u201d Sherra advised on the end of Taber\u2019s statement. \u201cThey have to be terrified for her. She\u2019s their baby sister. John\u2019s child. Maria would have hated this.\u201d</p><p>The reminder of his surrogate mother and her devotion to John Tyler pierced at him.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to let her call,\u201d Taber agreed. \u201cLet her arrange for them to meet with Doc before they come in like the damned Marines. Merinus won\u2019t thank you if you hurt one of them.\u201d</p><p>She would likely try to kill him herself, he grimaced.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMaybe it would calm her down some. She\u2019s like a damned volcano ready to erupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when she does, it\u2019s your ass that\u2019s gonna get burned,\u201d Sherra told him with little sympathy. \u201cYour attitude with her sucks.\u201d</p><p>Callan frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d Doc grinned. \u201cThe mating ritual of all animals. The males fight for dominance over their females. Human males have lost the fight in the past generations with feminism and equal rights and getting in touch with their sensitive sides,\u201d he snickered. \u201cCallan\u2019s DNA refuses to allow him the choice in dominating her. It\u2019s part of his genetic code.\u201d</p><p>Callan snarled. Just what he needed, a fucking scientific explanation of the problem.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Taber muttered. \u201cJust what we needed to know.\u201d</p><p>And the need to dominate was growing worse. Callan\u2019s fight with his needs, his sexual desires, was a constant battle now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need more samples from Merinus after your next, um, association.\u201d The doctor cleared his throat, ignoring Callan\u2019s look of amazement at his choice of words. \u201cAs her body reacts so violently to any touch but yours, I suggest you come with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m here for the night again then,\u201d Sherra yawned, stretching tiredly. \u201cSo I\u2019m heading on to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Dawn, the most silent of the group, rose from her seat. She carried her cup to the sink, rinsed it, then set it in the basin.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Tanner.\u201d Taber was on his feet, slapping Tanner on the back as he rose. \u201cTime to go to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, work,\u201d Tanner grumbled, but there was no hesitation in his movements. \u201cMan, remind me when I get all dominant to find a woman that doesn\u2019t argue. You could hear Merinus cursing Callan all through that forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d Callan ordered darkly.</p><p>Tanner grinned, lifted his hand in a friendly salute and followed Taber out the kitchen door. The house was silent now, emptied of the Pride and their worries, concerns and affections. It left Callan feeling tense, almost alone. The feeling left him longing for Merinus. Not just sexually, but for her companionship, the measure of understanding he had found in her, despite her anger. He rose to his feet and paced into the living room. He turned the television on low, hoping to fill the silence that had never bothered him before. As he lowered himself wearily to the chair, a small vibration in his jeans had him frowning in surprise. Merinus\u2019 cell phone. He pulled the device from his pocket, stared at it a moment, then flipped it open.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>There was silence over the line.</p><p>\u201cI want you to give this phone to Merinus.\u201d The command in the male voice had Callan\u2019s brows lowering, his possessive instincts towards Merinus flaring.</p><p>\u201cAnd may I ask who\u2019s calling?\u201d Callan smirked. As though he didn\u2019t know. The silence again. The echo of quiet rage.</p><p>\u201cIs she alive?\u201d Had he been a lesser man, a shiver would have worked down his spine, Callan thought.</p><p>\u201cOf course she\u2019s alive,\u201d he bit out. \u201cKilling innocent young women is next year\u2019s job. This year I\u2019m just</p><p>stalking asshole soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have enough of them following after your ass,\u201d the voice snapped. \u201cI sent my sister there with an offer of help, not so you could abuse her.\u201d</p><p>Callan came to his feet.</p><p>\u201cI have not abused her,\u201d he growled furiously. \u201cIf anything, that woman has, at every opportunity done her best to foil my best attempts to keep her from my problems. I blame you, Mr. Tyler, as her older brother, for her willfulness and her total disregard for authority. Your sister is a menace.\u201d</p><p>Frustration edged a deeper growl from his throat as he allowed his frustrations rein on the man who had most likely caused Merinus to develop such traits.</p><p>\u201cThen you will have no problem giving her this phone so I can make arrangements to collect my willful sister,\u201d Kane remarked smoothly, suspiciously. \u201cI\u2019ll be landing at the airport in a matter of hours. I expect her to be waiting for me.\u201d</p><p>Callan stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, Tyler.\u201d He kept his voice smooth, calm. \u201cRegrettably, your influence on her has been detrimental. She is a stubborn, determined woman, but she is now my woman.\u201d</p><p>Silence again. Callan imagined the man was fighting for control himself, a way to ease his sister from whatever danger he believed she was in.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me come in and take her,\u201d Kane warned silkily. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like it, Lyons.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd your sister would not survive it,\u201d Callan answered him quietly. \u201cDo not make that mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarm her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could no more harm her than I could harm myself,\u201d Callan bit out. \u201cYour sister is not in any danger from me. But she can\u2019t leave me now, for her own safety, it\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in more danger with you.\u201d Kane bit out.</p><p>\u201cShe is tied to me now, Tyler, in ways you do not understand,\u201d Callan sighed. \u201cYou may see your sister. You may speak with her, but at a time that is of my choosing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to calmly accept your decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, knowing Merinus must have learned her willfulness from somewhere, I would suspect I had better be watching over my shoulder for a while now.\u201d Callan grimaced. \u201cBut never fear, Mr. Tyler, I have grown quite used to that habit anyway, so it will be no hardship.\u201d</p><p>Callan happened to glance up at that moment, Merinus\u2019 scent drawing him, heating his blood. She stood in the doorway, her arms folded across her breasts, a frown marring her expression</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time,\u201d she told him patiently. \u201cIf that\u2019s Kane on the phone, then you won\u2019t convince him of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says I wish to convince him at all?\u201d he asked her, allowing a smug smile to tip his lips. \u201cI merely</p><p>grew bored with my own company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to her, Lyons.\u201d Tyler\u2019s voice was suddenly imperative, coldly furious at his ear. Merinus stood patiently in front of him, her hazel eyes suspicious, hopeful. He sighed roughly. He should have never answered the damned phone.</p><p>He covered the mouthpiece carefully, watching her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t mention the others,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t let him talk to me, he\u2019ll become dangerous, Callan. I don\u2019t want you or my brothers hurt. And you can bet Kane\u2019s not alone.\u201d</p> <p>Callan snarled softly. A complication they of course did not need.</p><p>\u201cTalk to him, but Merinus, remember. My Pride would give their life for yours. Don\u2019t betray them.\u201d He didn\u2019t think she would, but they hadn\u2019t survived this long on faith alone. She came to him slowly, her slender arm reaching out for the small phone. Callan handed it to her, watching her, assessing her soft expression as she brought it to her ear. He listened to her talk to her brother. He heard the tremble in her voice, her unwavering faith in Kane as she talked to him. Argued with him. Assured him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple, Kane. I can\u2019t leave him,\u201d she finally said softly. \u201cI know you don\u2019t understand, but I\u2019ll explain it all when I understand it myself.\u201d</p><p>Callan reached out, his fingers gripping her other arm lightly.</p><p>\u201cTell him we will meet with him. You and I and Dr. Martin. Alone, Merinus. I will not have your whole tribe breathing down my neck.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cAs though I don\u2019t know he has your whole family in that plane with him.\u201d He grunted. He listened to her relay the message. She was silent for long moments, sadness filling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou and Dad only, Kane,\u201d she finally said firmly. \u201cOr I can\u2019t do it. You know I wouldn\u2019t ask if there were any other way.\u201d She was silent for long moments, then came back with a sharp edge to her voice.</p> <p>\u201cListen, asshole, this isn\u2019t your decision. Stop playing He-Man on me, you know it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>Callan winced. At least the brother didn\u2019t have to deal with the Lion-O crack. Then she started arguing with Kane. Furiously, her tone steel hard, her smartass cracks causing him to wince in sympathy. Long moments later, it appeared she had won, though.</p><p>\u201cYou can set the details with Callan. If you two can manage to talk civilly?\u201d She arched a dark brow at Callan.</p><p>\u201cI am always civil,\u201d he informed her archly.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, extending the phone to him. \u201cTry to be a little more civil then. Because your version</p><p>of it definitely leaves something to be desired.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the phone from her, watching as she then turned her back on him and stalked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI see you are as successful in getting your way with her as I have been,\u201d he said snidely into the receiver. \u201cI hope you train your lovers better than you have trained your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Cat Boy,\u201d Kane bit out, furious, no longer able to hide his ire. \u201cSlowly. Painfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may wish to,\u201d Callan agreed, his tone pure sarcastic implication. \u201cBut I doubt she will give you her permission.\u201d</p><p>He could hear teeth gnashing over the line. He knew his assumption that Merinus controlled the strong men of her family was correct. She was like a tiny general, directing their movements where she was concerned at all times.</p><p>\u201cWhen you land, there will be a woman awaiting you. She has natural, pure white blond hair and light gray eyes. Her name is Sherra. She will know who you are, and approach you herself. She will give you the details of the meeting. Will you abide by this?\u201d</p><p>A strange, tense silence filled the line. As though Kane were holding his breath, or his surprise.</p><p>\u201cSherra,\u201d he whispered the name on a sigh that had Callan frowning in confusion. \u201cI\u2019ll watch for her.\u201d</p><p>Callan sighed. The brother was no easier to deal with than was the sister.</p><p>\u201cBe certain you do,\u201d Callan sighed. \u201cFor the sake of your sister\u2019s sanity, Tyler, hold your rage at a simmer long enough to hear the problems surrounding her. Perhaps you will draw a bit more sympathy for my position by then.\u201d</p><p>The phone disconnected. Callan grinned mirthlessly. He well understood Kane\u2019s problem. Just as Callan felt sympathy for his plight as Merinus\u2019 brother, unwillingly of course, so too did Kane feel sympathy for Callan. Though Kane was furious at the suspicions he had regarding the relationship between Merinus and Callan.</p><p>\u201cYou two finish consoling yourselves?\u201d The scent of her hit him like a fist to his loins. She stood in the entrance way once again, a sandwich in one hand, a glass of milk in the other. She walked over to the couch, her movements graceful, her body tempting in the soft jersey shorts and light sleeveless T-shirt she wore. Her nipples were hard little points beneath the material; her eyes were dark with the lust building in her body. And she seemed determined to ignore it, and him as well. She lifted the remote from the coffee table, scanned the channels quickly, then settled on a blood thirsty action adventure that set his teeth on edge. He sighed restlessly, dragged his fingers though his hair then stalked from the room. He would be damned if he would sit there, her scent making him crazy for her, while she watched television. If she wanted to ignore it, and him, then by God let her have her way. He</p><p>would see which of them came crawling first.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>Merinus watched Callan stalk the house as she ate. When she lay down on the couch, her thighs clenched tightly together to try to finish watching the movie, he growled and stalked back to the bedrooms. She sighed wearily. Her cunt was so hot it felt on fire. She could feel the dampness on her panties, the slick juices coating her bare cunt flesh.</p><p>She was miserable. Empty. So empty she wanted to scream at him to take her, to fill her, to ride her hard and deep like he had in the forest. That dominance, the rougher sex, the utter loss of control he displayed only spurred her lust higher. She shivered, remembering his teeth locking onto the sensitive skin between neck and shoulder, the sharp incisors barely piercing the skin, the sensual pain edging her pleasure higher. She hated that. Hated knowing that she was so depraved she would enjoy it; that she needed it again, only hours later.</p><p>She shifted her position on the couch, her head cushioned on the pillowed armrest, her thighs pulled up to her abdomen. Oh God, she hurt. The muscles of her vagina clenched, spasmed. It wept slowly in hot, pulsing arousal. She bit her lip, her eyes going to where Callan stomped into the kitchen. The refrigerator opened, a lid popped. He stalked back to the doorway, his gaze heavy lidded, dangerous as he watched her. He lifted the bottle to his lips and took a long drink.</p><p>\u201cI can smell your scent all through this house,\u201d he growled as he lowered the bottle, now only half full.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to prove by denying us both?\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt drowsy, sensual as his eyes went over her. She wanted to roll to her back, spread her legs and plead. She fought the desire, her muscles tightening as she stared at him, denying herself and him. He looked so damned sexy standing there. Tall and broad and aroused. His face was tense, his body taut. The muscles in his abdomen were tight, drawing her gaze to his thighs. Oh man, he was like a perfect sculpture of some sex god.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take the chance,\u201d she whispered, turning her gaze back to a show she had little interest in. \u201cI won\u2019t conceive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is little chance of that as of yet.\u201d Callan shook his head. \u201cYou are grasping at excuses, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>She was, she knew. She was terrified, not of Callan, but of herself. She was terrified of the building needs, the utter lack of mercy her lust had on her emotions. She couldn\u2019t separate emotional need from sexual need anymore. Not since this morning. Not since he had taken her, hard and dominating, controlling her body, her responses. Not since he had held her those minutes afterwards, his tongue rasping gently over the small wound on her neck.</p><p>The mark was still there. She could feel it throbbing, pulsing in time to her heartbeat, begging for his kiss, his caress. The sharp little pain of his teeth clenching it.</p><p>\u201cI have to control it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her brothers would be here soon. They would have an answer. She knew them, but she would have to be careful. They would take her from Callan and she couldn\u2019t allow that. She barely controlled her whimper of emotional pain, not just sexual. Her body ached for him, but her heart hurt. She didn\u2019t want to leave. Not yet. She just wanted this \u2018thing\u2019 tormenting them to ease. She wanted to lie in his arms, without the sexual heat building. She wanted to be held by him, touched, cared for. And she was terribly afraid it was nothing but the chemical lust for him. He seemed to have none of these needs. His cock was hard. It strained against the soft material of his sweat pants, tenting the cloth, drawing her gaze and holding it. She swallowed tightly, licking her dry lips as she wondered how he would taste. In the heat of the frenzy of lust in the last days, it was an experience she had not been given time for. She realized now that she wanted it. She wanted to run her tongue over the bulging head of his cock, feel it jerk against her lips, discover the difference in it that occurred as his orgasm neared. She closed her eyes, fighting the need. Fighting not just his desire, but also her own.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, this will not work,\u201d he warned her, his voice hardening. The latent male dominance that lurked just beneath the soft growl had her trembling.</p><p>His voice was rough when he took her, too. When he climaxed, his chest rumbled with an animalistic grumble that made her shiver to think about it. He was the ultimate male animal, sexual, arrogant in his prowess and his abilities. Muscular, strong, every bone and muscle in his body in perfect shape. She wanted to taste the skin stretched over those hard planes and angles. She wanted to lick him, nibble at his flesh and hear him groan her name. She wanted to stretch over him, rub against him, find some relief for her aching nipples against his hot flesh.</p><p>She opened her eyes, focusing on the flames and explosions playing out on the television. It was safer than staring at the hard cock threatening to burst through Callan\u2019s pants, but it provided little distraction from the flesh between her thighs pulsing and screaming out its demand.</p><p>\u201cI can make it work. I\u2019m incredibly stubborn, ask my brothers,\u201d she told him, her voice sounding much more determined than she felt.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask your brothers nothing,\u201d he bit out forcefully, his voice beginning to rumble. Oh, she loved that sound. Even though it did feel as though the vibrations of it echoed in her womb. \u201cYou are the most aggravating female I\u2019ve ever met in my life.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Merinus shrugged. The movement caused her T-shirt to shift against her hard nipples. She almost groaned at the pleasure. Damn. She wished he would just go away. Go away or take the decision out of</p><p>her hands and pound into her until she was screaming out her orgasm. That was what she wanted. She wanted what she had earlier, Callan\u2019s hands rough on her body, in her hair, driving her to heights she had never known existed. And yet she didn\u2019t want it. It equally drew her and terrified her.</p><p>\u201cI could ease you in other ways, Merinus,\u201d he bit out. He still hadn\u2019t moved from the doorway. She glanced up at him. He watched her intently, waiting for any sign of weakness. She steeled her resolve. She could do this. She could make her body do as she wanted it to. Not the other way around. Merinus swallowed tightly. \u201cNo. I\u2019d beg you to complete it, Callan. It doesn\u2019t ease until you come inside me.\u201d</p> <p>The fiery wash of his seed, blasting hard and hot inside her cunt was the only relief from the building pressure. No matter how many times she climaxed, how many different ways, it was only that final action that allowed her body to cool down from a boil to a simmer.</p><p>\u201cYou risk my self control this way,\u201d he told her softly. \u201cAs your need builds, so does mine. Just as it happened this morning. You tempt the beast taking you, rather than the man, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his face. The beer bottle was empty, though he still gripped it tightly. His face was drawn in a mask of concern, of desire. His amber eyes almost glowed, hot and demanding. Her pussy heated further. Oh, she wanted him. She could fuck him for hours and never get enough.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t a beast,\u201d she told him, her voice soft as she glimpsed the regret in his eyes. It bothered him, she knew, these needs, the domination he fought to keep from exerting over her, the control he fought to hang onto. He didn\u2019t like the instincts raging at him, any more than she liked those raging at her.</p><p>\u201cBut I am, Merinus,\u201d he sighed, looking down at the bottle he held for long moments. When he looked at her again, there was remorse, and acceptance. \u201cI don\u2019t deny what I am. To do so would risk my sanity. And you can\u2019t either. You can never forget that the animal is there, lurking beneath the surface. It\u2019s dangerous to do otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>The problem was, the beast within him didn\u2019t frighten her nearly as much as it seemed to bother him. She felt her inner muscles tighten, her womb clench with the heated memory of his loss of control. How much more dominant could he become, she wondered, then shivered at the thought.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, don\u2019t do this,\u201d he told her, his voice tormented now. \u201cYou are denying yourself and me. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She heard the plea in his voice. She wanted to give in, she wanted to turn to him, to ease the fire ripping through her body, but she couldn\u2019t. Not now. Not yet. It wasn\u2019t a need to tempt him, or even her curiosity in the face of the lack of control he warned her about. She no longer controlled her own body, and she knew this was the root of her problem. She needed that control. She needed to dictate when she wanted to fuck and when she wanted to cuddle, not her body or this chemical reaction driving her insane.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She closed her eyes, fighting her tears, fighting her body. It was her body, dammit. It had a mind of its own lately and it was killing her.</p><p>Callan watched her a moment longer, then with a sizzling curse stalked from the room again. Merinus sighed, her breathing rough now that he was no longer in the room. She couldn\u2019t control the soft whimper that escaped her lips. She was only thankful the television masked the sound. She was breathing hard, fighting to draw air into her lungs as her inner flesh clenched, demanded relief. Her clit actually throbbed and her nipples were torturously hard, aching for the warmth of his mouth. Her hand moved, her fingers running over the hard points lightly, her body trembling at the incredible pleasure the action brought her.</p><p>Her head ground into the pillowed headrest. She felt her juices pool between her thighs. Suppressing her groan, she sat up on the couch, bracing her elbows on her knees as she raked her fingers through her hair. Her fingers dug into her scalp. She shivered again. Even that tiny pain was exciting. She could control this. She took a deep breath, reining in the madness that threatened to whip through her. She could make it. Self-control, that was all it took. If a person could get through drug withdrawal, surely she could get through Callan withdrawal. It was just a matter of controlling the urge. That was all. She nodded firmly. The action shifted her shirt again, raking her sensitive nipples and she bit her lip to hold back her moan.</p> <p>Something cold to drink. One of Callan\u2019s beers. Hell, he had a whole fridge full. She stood to her feet, a shudder working over her body as her panties pressed against her clit. Oh God, she was going to come from thong friction alone. She was pitiful.</p><p>Stepping carefully, she moved into the kitchen and jerked one of the beers out of the refrigerator. She twisted the cap, hearing the faint hiss. She turned the bottle up to her mouth, taking a long, cold drink. Then she held the frosted bottle between her breasts, taking a deep breath as she leaned against the appliance for support. This was bad. Really bad.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Callan?\u201d Sherra stepped into the kitchen, her eyes narrowed as she watched Merinus drink from the beer.</p><p>\u201cIn bed.\u201d She would have shrugged if she could have handled the sensation of cloth rasping over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cHow long since he fucked you?\u201d Sherra asked bluntly.</p><p>Merinus rolled her eyes. \u201cLong enough to suit me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Right. Not in this lifetime.</p><p>Sherra\u2019s lips firmed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to deny this when it\u2019s so strong, Merinus. You know how bad it gets.\u201d Sherra moved to the sink, pouring herself a glass of water and drinking it quickly.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d she bit out. \u201cI don\u2019t see you crawling all over some man trying to get off.\u201d</p><p>Sherra looked away, her expression cool, but a glimpse of tormented eyes filled Merinus with remorse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean that, Sherra. But it\u2019s my body, my decision,\u201d Merinus bit out, then tipped the</p><p>bottle up and finished the beer. It wasn\u2019t enough. She needed something to chill her out now. She opened the refrigerator and grabbed another.</p><p>She popped the lid quickly and took a long drink.</p><p>\u201cDangerous, Merinus.\u201d Sherra walked toward her, frowning at the drink. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how alcohol will mix with this chemical reaction between you and Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019re about to find out then.\u201d Merinus laid the bottle along her temple. It was cool and comforting against her flushed skin. \u201cCan you turn the a/c down a little further, Sherra?\u201d She asked. \u201cIt\u2019s hot in here.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, the appliance now supporting her as she breathed heavily. It was stifling, and only growing warmer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the a/c, Merinus,\u201d Sherra told her, her voice quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s the reaction. The withdrawal. You need to go to Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can control this,\u201d Merinus said, more to convince herself than Sherra. \u201cIt will just take time.\u201d</p><p>She took another drink of the beer, finally feeling the effects of it beginning to penetrate the haze of lust. Mating frenzy, what a hell of a name to call it, she thought. She had never seen her damned cats act this way. They screamed and squalled and got it on and then were done with each other. This was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, the alcohol could have severe affects\u2014\u201d Sherra began to caution her.</p><p>\u201cSo could sex with Callan,\u201d she argued. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Sherra, his little soldiers are counteracting the contraceptive you keep poking in my arm. His sperm is changing and becoming normal, and only God knows when I\u2019ll start ovulating, if I\u2019m not doing so on a daily basis. I do not want to end up pregnant by a man who doesn\u2019t love me or need me other than to scratch some fucking chemical itch that\u2019s developed between us. Why can\u2019t you guys understand that?\u201d</p><p>Merinus could feel the anger raging inside her now. It did this before. She remembered that. That day in the lab, when Sherra and the doctor wouldn\u2019t stop touching her, poking at her. She eased over to the table and sat down. The pain had come next. Great blinding waves of erotic pain that left her weak and gasping. Then Callan had kissed her. The taste of him, male and spicy, so hot, had made her crazy to beg him to fuck her. But it had eased the terrible craving. Maybe all she needed was a kiss?</p><p>She could handle a kiss. His lips rough and hot, his tongue plunging into her mouth, caressing hers, mimicking the movements his cock would make later, driving her insane for more. Or his tongue plunging between her legs. That\u2019s where she wanted it. Lapping at her, fucking into her needy pussy as he growled against the folds of skin. She finished the beer quickly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go lay down.\u201d She stood up, sagged momentarily, but gathered her strength and toddled to the couch. Damn, a few beers had never affected her this way before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sit here with you for a while,\u201d Sherra sighed, following close behind her. \u201cYou should let me help you into bed at least, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I am not getting within three rooms of Callan. Damn him. A whole house isn\u2019t enough space right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be if you would stop fighting it,\u201d Sherra suggested. Merinus collapsed on the couch. She tucked herself against the back, folding her body tight, feeling the waves of aroused pain beginning to build.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d Merinus muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t need this right now.\u201d</p><p>The first wave rocked her body. Merinus closed her eyes, fighting to relax against the heat, the hard slam of rushing demand that washed over her. She breathed deeply, feeling her vagina spasm in a harsh wave, and her juices ease from her body. Her panties would be soaked in no time, she thought with a depressed sigh.</p><p>This was unlike anything she had ever known could exist. They should bottle whatever it was Callan had that did this. It could make a fortune. An aphrodisiac unlike any other. Sherra didn\u2019t leave. Merinus was aware of her sitting quietly beside her on the couch, watching her closely. Like a damned germ under a microscope, Merinus thought snidely. That was how she was beginning to feel. Minutes later she was aware of Sherra rushing from the room. It didn\u2019t take her long to return. Of course, she had her little basket of goodies with her.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Merinus groaned, but did as she was asked. A swab stroked over her dry mouth. What good it was going to do them, Merinus had no idea. Then she clenched her teeth, trying not to fight the next wave of lustful demand. It was harder than the last, pulling at her womb, tightening her cunt. Damn, she would strangle Callan\u2019s cock if he got inside her now.</p><p>\u201cVaginal sample.\u201d Sherra moved towards her.</p><p>\u201cTry it and I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Merinus gasped. \u201cLeave my damned pussy alone. It has enough problems right now.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t fight when the swab eased quickly past the leg of her shorts and swiped through the juices at her vaginal entrance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking sex experiment,\u201d Merinus groaned.</p><p>\u201cI really need a blood sample now,\u201d Sherra worried. \u201cIt\u2019s really important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys should have been vampires,\u201d Merinus bitched, but she held her arm out as Sherra pushed the coffee table close to the couch for her to rest it upon.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t touch you unless I have to,\u201d Sherra promised</p><p>\u201cDamned good thing. But wait just a minute,\u201d Merinus gasped. A shiver began in her womb, slowly working over her body, building, almost like a climax until Merinus was gasping for breath, her fists clenching as her body was rocked by a demand that took her breath. She heard Sherra curse violently as she moved back from her.</p><p>Merinus wasn\u2019t certain how long it lasted, how long she fought to breathe. Her eyes were wide, her vision fuzzy as the waves of pulsing lust swept over her again and again. It was going to kill her. She knew it now, she would die, a slow, miserable horny death right here and now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>\u201cFucking stubborn woman,\u201d Callan\u2019s curse seemed to echo in her head. She was jerked from the couch into his arms, her breasts crushed to his chest, her thighs clenching around his hips. His lips covered hers, his tongue sweeping into her mouth as his flesh seared her. Her arms went around his shoulders, her hands spearing into his hair, fisting there, pulling him closer, unconcerned with any pain she would cause him. She wanted it to hurt. She wanted him to know what he was doing to her, wanted him to feel the violence rising inside her, the need, so sharp and agonizing it was like death.</p><p>He carried her through the house, his lips hard on hers, grinding her lips against her teeth, his tongue a dominating force as it tangled with hers, licked at it, stroked her lips. His erection was hot, uncovered, pressing against the fragile barrier of shorts and panties as he stalked through the house. It was driving her crazy. She wanted his cock inside her, now.</p><p>She arched against him, her hands still pulling at his hair as he dragged his lips from hers, stroked them down her neck as he bore her into the dark bedroom. His teeth nipped at her. His tongue rasped over her skin, the faint roughness making her press herself tighter against him, grind harder against his cock.</p><p>\u201cStubborn bitch,\u201d he cursed her breathless, his voice an animalistic rumble as his hand caught in her hair now, pulling her head back, making tingles of pain shoot through her head. Damn, that felt good. Too good.</p><p>Then he released her. He tossed her on the bed, watching through narrowed eyes as she came to her knees. She faced him, breathing hard, heavy.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gentle,\u201d he warned her, his voice rough.</p><p>\u201cNeither will I.\u201d She whipped the shirt over her head.</p><p>Watching him, she licked her lips as her hands smoothed over her stomach, moved up, then cupped her breasts in her palms, groaning at the sensation, at the startled wildness in his expression. Her hands didn\u2019t ease the desperate need for calloused warmth, but the expression on his face eased the terrible emptiness that had been building in her soul. He wanted her, craved her as desperately as she craved him. He could be tempted, teased as well as she could. He could be pushed to the limits of his lust, and she intended to push him.</p><p>Her hands moved to her shorts, pushing beneath the waistband, stripping them and her panties off quickly. She tossed them to the floor, her eyes never leaving his face. She wasn\u2019t willing to lay down submissively, a sacrifice to the reactions tearing her body apart. She wanted him, all of him. The man and the beast. She wanted to take him instead of leaving the control of their passion to him alone.</p><p>\u201cHow wild are you?\u201d she asked him, amazed at the low, husky sound of her voice. The fingers of one hand ran in a slow, teasing stroke from between her breasts, over her stomach, then between her thighs. His eyes flared, his face flushed as her fingers dipped into the heat and dampness glistening over the inner lips. His lips parted, his breathing rough and harsh.</p><p>\u201cToo wild for what you are attempting, baby,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t submit.\u201d She smiled teasingly as she brought her fingers to her lips, tasting herself as a hard growl slipped from his chest. \u201cIf you want it, you have to take it.\u201d</p><p>She extended her fingers to his lips then. They parted, the heat of his mouth sucking the taste of her body from them. He moaned, his fists clenching as he watched her. She arched her neck, allowing her hair to cascade down her back, her swollen breasts to tempt him as she brought her hands to them, her fingers raking over her nipples.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d he asked her, his tone dark, wildly sexy.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it bad enough to take it?\u201d She went on all fours, staring up at him, her mouth now level with the straining length of his erection. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerinus, don\u2019t make me hurt you,\u201d he whispered, though instead of pleading, his tone was warning.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me hurt you, Callan.\u201d Her tongue stroked the bulbous head of his cock. A warning hiss erupted from his throat. Merinus smiled in satisfaction, her lips parting, one hand gripping the base of his wide cock, her mouth easing over the head, her lips raking the hot flesh as she swiped over it with hot little licks. She had read enough about oral sex, heard enough, that she knew the basics. She thought she could improvise the rest. Her lips closed on him and she began a deep suckling motion that milked at his cock, her tongue swiping over it lazily. Evidently she was doing something right. Callan\u2019s hands tightened in her hair, his hips thrusting against her mouth jerkily. Her tongue probed beneath the head, feeling a curious pulse, a hard, harsh throb at the bottom of the head, beneath the smooth, sensitive skin. His cock jerked, pulsed harder.</p><p>\u201cGod, Merinus,\u201d he cried out her name, half growl, half beseeching groan. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t control the need.\u201d</p><p>Her hand gripped the base of his cock, the other cupped his tight scrotum, her grip massaging, caressing</p><p>as she began to move her mouth up and down the bursting flesh, caressing with lips and tongue, glorying in his strangled growls as he fought to keep from impaling her mouth with his flesh.</p><p>Callan\u2019s fingers were tight in her hair, pulling at it, rubbing the silken strands over his abdomen as he fucked her mouth. It was exquisite, the moist heat caressing him, her tongue stroking over him, caressing the hidden barb that would emerge when his orgasm neared. He could feel it throbbing now, fighting to override his control, eroding his need to worship, demanding that he dominate. That he fuck her mouth hard, as he would her cunt, hold her to him, shoot his semen into her mouth in the most intimate of orgasm. He had never done that. Never allowed a woman to suck him to climax. He wanted Merinus to. Needed it. Had to know that she was his in every way. He was tortured in that need, to take her, possess her in every way that a man could possess a woman.</p> <p>That need had only been growing over the past days. He fought it. Each time he saw her bend over, or watched her tongue lick her lips. He fought the visions of taking her, of fucking her mouth, her ass. That tight little forbidden hole beckoned him, just as her lips did. She was sucking at him now, drawing his balls tight against his body, his barb throbbed. He shook his head, sweat pouring from his body. Heat wrapped around him, stroked by his lust, fueled by her touch.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, enough, baby.\u201d He couldn\u2019t drag her from his erection, from her sucking pleasure. He didn\u2019t have the control needed, and she was ignoring him quite well. She slurped on the hard, thick cock, drawing it to her throat, then back to her lips, and back again to her throat. Her tongue raked, caressed, drawing his climax nearer with each stroke. He couldn\u2019t control it. He couldn\u2019t fight the need, the hot rushing demand. He felt the flesh swell, the barb emerge, harden, tighten. She groaned over his flesh as her tongue raked it, her lips sucked it. His teeth clenched, his hands gripped her head. He couldn\u2019t fight it, couldn\u2019t fight her. God save him, he was the beast those bastards had created. His balls tightened, his cock jerked, then he cried out, holding her head still as he buried himself as deep, as hard as the hand wrapped around the base of his swollen flesh would allow before he erupted.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her pull back, but she didn\u2019t try to. Her lips were clamped on his thrusting cock, her tongue like a lash of fire over the bursting head. He felt his semen explode from the tip, splash into her mouth. Long, thick streams that ripped his insides apart with pleasure as a hiss of completion, then a hard, male growl echoed through the room.</p><p>He was fighting for breath, his chest heaving, his body tight as he drew back from her, shaking as her lips drew snugly over his flesh when he pulled from her. She stared up at him, her lips damp, her eyes dark and glittering with sensuality.</p><p>She was the most beautiful creature on the face of the earth. Inordinately graceful, even in her lust. Her hair was tangled around her flushed face, her lips parted as her tongue ran over them slowly, as though savoring his taste.</p><p>He was still hard. His climax had eased the most pressing demand, but he needed more. He needed the taste of her, sweet and hot filling his mouth. Before she could fight him, he had her on her back, coming</p><p>over her, his eyes locked with hers as he lowered his head, taking her lips in a kiss so hot it singed his toenails.</p><p>His hands cupped her breasts, his fingers gripping the hard points of her nipples and pinching them gently. She arched tight against him, her hands in his hair again, wrapping the strands around her fingers as she held him to her.</p><p>No, tonight she was no willing sacrifice to their frenzy. She was in no way submissive. She met each kiss with a greed of her own, stroking her body against his, moaning, crying out at each touch.</p><p>\u201cYou will burn me alive,\u201d he whispered at her neck, his mouth rasping over the mark he had left on her earlier that day. She shivered at the caress.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll burn each other then.\u201d Her voice was husky, filled with wonder as her teeth scraped his shoulder in retaliation after his scraped her neck.</p><p>He liked the feel of her teeth on his flesh, raking, feasting on him. Her tongue was like a stroke of silk across his skin. Hot, moist silk that made him mad for more. He moved lower on her body, his mouth moving to her breasts. He loved the sound of her breathless scream as he sucked the hard little tips of her nipples. The way her hands gripped his hair, holding him close. The way she rode the thigh he tucked in close to her wet cunt. He was starving for her. He couldn\u2019t wait much longer to move lower, to lick down the narrow, closed slit, to plunge his tongue deep into the tight depths of her vagina as he drew all her silky cream into his mouth. There was nothing so intoxicating as the taste of his woman\u2019s pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to eat you alive,\u201d he growled against the swollen curve of her breast as he began his downward trek. \u201cShall I show you the torture you showed me, baby?\u201d</p><p>She moaned, the sound low and pleading as his lips skimmed her flat abdomen. His hands moved to her thighs, moving over the warmth of her skin, parting them wide as he lowered himself between them. He could smell her heat. It was unlike anything he had ever known. Sweet, just a hint of cinnamon, wild and elusive. He was a man dying for a taste of ambrosia, and she held the only source between those slender thighs. His head lowered, his tongue moving slowly through the slick essence that coated the soft inner lips.</p><p>The touch of his tongue was like a bolt of electricity searing her womb. Merinus gasped at the sensation, her body tightening, drowning in the pleasure that washed over her. There had been nothing like it in all her life. She bucked against his mouth, feeling his tongue circle her aching clit, his lips suckle at it. His hand parted the folds, his finger running through the juices that wept from her body, caressing a path from her hidden entrance then lower, shockingly lower, to the tight pucker of her anus. She jerked. He growled warningly into her flesh, sending vibrations of ecstasy echoing over her body. She arched. His tongue stabbed into her vagina, his finger slid a forbidden inch into the lower entrance.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Callan.\u201d</p><p>She gripped his shoulders, her nails digging into the muscles as her vagina tightened, desperate to hold his tongue in place as she marveled at the feel of his finger lodged just past the entrance of her ass. It didn\u2019t hurt. She would have thought it would. He moved it, pulling free of her body\u2019s grip, his fingers moistening themselves in the juice that ran from her cunt, then returning to slide into the tight hole once again. All the while, his tongue thrust hard and fast inside her, driving her closer to completion, as his finger drove her closer to insanity.</p><p>She tossed, bucking against him, her hands in his hair again, pulling him close as she felt the bite of sensual pain in her ass, the thrust and drag of his rough tongue in her vagina. Torturous need clawed at her insides, burning her alive as he fucked his tongue hard and fast inside her gripping channel. She was going to come so hard she knew she would die with the sensations of it. She gasped, burning, reaching, she screamed out at the agonizing pleasure and exploded into his mouth as his finger forged deep inside her ass an instant before her muscles clamped tight in orgasm. Fiery fingers of electricity sizzled her insides, as her hands anchored in his hair and he eased his finger free of her anus, before rising quickly over her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His cock slammed inside her vagina. Stretching her, filling her as they both cried out at the clawing, greedy lust that had taken control of their bodies. There was no time to ease into their race for completion. Their bodies were frenzied, locked together in a dance of agonized pleasure. His hips drove his erection deep, thrusting hard and fast. She felt the small thumb of flesh that began to grow tautly erect on it just under the head of his cock. It raked the gripping muscles that milked his shaft until with one last heavy thrust it fully emerged, locking him in deep, jerking, pulsing against the sensual trigger deep within her body as his sperm erupted from the head of his cock.</p><p>Merinus saw stars. Her climax was like a ravaging beast as it ripped through her body this time. She couldn\u2019t breathe, she could only convulse against him as his teeth bit into the skin between her neck and shoulder, just enough pain, just enough edge to drive her into madness. It was long moments later before she felt Callan collapse to the bed beside her, drawing her tight against his heaving chest as he dragged the blankets over their cooling bodies. He held her close to his heat, his hand pressing her face into his chest, his body wrapping protectively around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, his voice agonized. \u201cOh God, Merinus, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled back from his chest, staring into the tortured depths of his golden eyes. She was sated, relaxed. Her body no longer throbbed, lust no longer clawed at her insides.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Her hand lifted weakly to caress the hard line of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you.\u201d He laid his hand over hers, pressing it close. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she murmured. \u201cHurt me again some more next time then. You must have found a cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was shocked.</p> <p>\u201cI can sleep now.\u201d She closed her eyes to do just that. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, Callan.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against his chest, feeling his arms come around her with a hesitancy that brought tears to her eyes. She kissed his chest weakly, then let the darkness and the incredible warmth of his body lull her</p><p>into peace. For the first time since seeing his picture on her father\u2019s desk weeks ago, Merinus was at peace.</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>It was barely dawn when Callan brought Merinus quickly awake. With his hand over her mouth, his voice a quiet hiss in her ear, he warned her to silence. Staring up at him in surprise, Merinus nodded her head, barely recognizing the savage standing before her.</p><p>His expression was hard, frightening in the dim light of the room. What was even more terrifying was the fact that he was dressed in dark fatigues, his hair tied back, his amber eyes glowing with an eerie light within the darkness of the room.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d He jerked her shirt over her head as he pushed her shorts into her hands. \u201cDress quickly.\u201d</p><p>He was already dressed. As she dragged her shorts nervously over her hips, he handed her socks and her hiking boots.</p><p>\u201cHurry,\u201d he urged her as she pulled the socks and boots on and laced them with trembling fingers. As she rushed to dress, Callan was stuffing small boxes in a backpack, his movements hurried but controlled. Muscles bunched beneath the clothing, tight and hard, his body tense in preparation for danger. This was not a relaxing wake up call.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Confusion filled her voice, though she fought to keep it at a low whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe have company. Soldiers.\u201d He grabbed her hand when she tied off her boot and drew her quickly to the door.</p><p>It was then Merinus saw the dull glint of the gun he carried in his hand. Small and lethal, the silver black color gleamed subtly in the darkness, reminding her of the death that always surrounded him. She took a deep, steadying breath, following him as he drew her from the bed. Keeping his other hand wrapped carefully around her wrist, he pulled her from the bedroom, heading cautiously down the dark hallway. Merinus couldn\u2019t hear anything. She strained to detect any sound out of the ordinary, but all she heard</p><p>was total silence, and the dull thud of her own heartbeat. They moved carefully along the hallway, staying flat against the wall as he drew her towards the kitchen. Drawing her down to a crouch, Callan moved her into the kitchen and over to the door that led into the garage. There, he turned the doorknob silently, standing alert as he inhaled slowly.</p><p>He jerked the door opened and rushed her across the concrete floor to the hidden door. It opened before they could reach it. Sherra waved them in quickly, dressed in fatigues as well, a gun in her hand.</p> <p>\u201cGet her dressed.\u201d Callan pushed Merinus towards Sherra as he headed to where the doctor was packing equipment in desperate haste.</p><p>\u201cLeave anything you don\u2019t have to have. Samples and notes only, Doc.\u201d Callan grabbed several cases of just that and rushed them to a waiting jeep parked at the end of the cavernous room. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time for the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow close are they?\u201d Sherra pushed pants and a T-shirt at Merinus as she glanced back.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be through the security system in a matter of minutes. It will take them no time to find the hidden door,\u201d Callan barked. \u201cGet your shit together and let\u2019s get out of here. Taber and Tanner are keeping track of them and they\u2019re working on the doors now.\u201d</p><p>Merinus hurriedly took her boots off, jerked her shorts over her legs, then her T-shirt over her head. As she struggled to put the boots back on then, she glanced up. Only then did she see the small earphone and mic that he had over his head. He talked quietly into it for a second as he loaded another box into the jeep.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dayan?\u201d Sherra questioned him as Merinus jerked on the pants and pulled her boots back on.</p><p>\u201cOut of contact.\u201d Callan\u2019s voice was hard, cold.</p><p>\u201cHe ran again?\u201d Sherra questioned in amazement, anger pulsing in her voice. Evidently it wasn\u2019t unusual for Dayan to be out of the line of fire when trouble arose.</p><p>\u201cPacked.\u201d Callan ignored her question. \u201cSherra, you and Dawn get the doc the hell out of here. Get to the safe house and wait for me there. You know what to do if you don\u2019t hear from me.\u201d</p><p>Merinus felt fear crawling through her body. What would they do? What about Kane? Sherra was supposed to meet with them that morning, she knew.</p><p>\u201cYou promised Sherra would meet Kane.\u201d She stared across the room at Callan\u2019s cold expression.</p><p>\u201cAnd we weren\u2019t attacked until I talked to that cutthroat brother of yours,\u201d he bit out. \u201cUntil I know if he\u2019s the one who betrayed us, then he can cool his heels where he\u2019s at. This isn\u2019t a team, Merinus, like before. This is a full assault, over a dozen soldiers. They aren\u2019t taking chances this time.\u201d</p><p>Merinus shook her head at the accusation in his tone.</p><p>\u201cKane didn\u2019t do it. He didn\u2019t know where we were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane is a soldier, Merinus,\u201d he growled. \u201cHe could have had a trace on that fucking cell and pinpointed</p><p>us within minutes. Had I not been so concerned with your worry and fears, I would have thought of that. I\u2019ve risked us all with my own ignorance.\u201d</p><p>Merinus bit her lip as he strode quickly to her, pulling a large backpack over his shoulders and carrying the smaller on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe have to go.\u201d He grabbed her wrist, pulling her along behind him as Sherra and the doctor rushed to the jeep. \u201cHopefully, the soldiers will see the signs of the jeep and follow it as far as they can. Sherra and the doctor will have no problems when they emerge outside, because the area is heavily used by hunters and the road into here is unknown. There\u2019s a smaller, hidden corridor on up here that takes us out into the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will that help us?\u201d She fought to keep up with him as he rushed through the narrowing tunnel that led through the mountain they were currently in.</p><p>\u201cBecause I know the fucking area and they don\u2019t,\u201d he bit out. \u201cWe\u2019re not safe anywhere else, Merinus. Only here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Kane,\u201d she gasped when he pulled her into a shadowed crevice. He pushed a large rock out of the way, drew her into the dark corridor, then rolled it closed once again. Seconds later, a small beam of light lit the way.</p><p>Merinus could feel nerves and panic washing over her. Callan thought Kane had betrayed him, she knew he did, and she couldn\u2019t think of a way to convince him otherwise. She knew her brother would have never, ever put her in a position that could get her seriously hurt. Bruised a little, but never hurt.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t soldiers.\u201d She struggled for breath as he loped along the narrow passageway, pulling her behind him, forcing her to keep up. \u201cMaybe it was Kane and my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they came in the wrong way,\u201d he bit out. \u201cWhoever was out there was packing weapons, Merinus, and plenty of them. It was the first thing I smelled. They were outside our bedroom window right before I woke you. If it were your brothers, they should have fucking knocked. And Taber would have recognized your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane wouldn\u2019t try to hurt you,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Merinus, the bastard has enough sense to know that an animal is fucking his baby sister. He was furious on the phone. If it were me, I would have already killed him.\u201d</p><p>She flushed at the knowledge. Of course Kane would know, but still, she couldn\u2019t see him rushing in and doing anything so impulsive without assessing the situation first. It just wasn\u2019t like him. But she didn\u2019t have the breath to argue further with him. He was moving them quickly through the passageway, his steps silent as she fought to keep her own movements just as quiet. Her boots were soft-soled, but still there was a shuffle, a scrape of leather over stone that seemed to echo around her. It seemed they strode though endless miles of weathered stone before he slowed the fast walk they were in. He began to move slower, easing her through the corridor, his head tilted as he listened carefully.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to move out of the tunnel. I want you to stay quiet, Merinus and stay right behind me,\u201d he warned her as he stopped and laid his mouth at her ear to speak. \u201cNo matter what I tell you to</p><p>do, you do it, and do it quickly. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>His voice was quiet again, that throb of savagery in it making her heart beat out of control. She nodded her head quickly as he glanced back at her. His eyes glittered in the darkness, a dull gold, furious, cold. He extinguished the penlight and eased around a corner, moving silently toward the dim light ahead. He stilled, his fingers going to her lips as his head tilted, listening intently. He pushed her against the wall, indicating she should stay there, stay silent.</p><p>He was going on without her. Merinus shook her head violently, her fingers gripping his arms. Then she heard a sound, a shuffle of feet, a light scrape against stone. Her eyes widened, terror flooding through her. Callan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he pushed her tighter into the stone, a warning in his expression as he pulled the gun from his belt and began to move away from her. Merinus took a deep, silent breath. She fought to keep her breathing normal, her heart rate slower. She couldn\u2019t hear anything past the desperate drum of blood rushing through her body. She was terrified. Her own fear was like a separate entity choking her, strangling the breath in her throat as Callan moved silently away from her. She watched his face, seeing the cold threat in his expression. This wasn\u2019t the lover she had known in the past days, or the teasing, elusive prey she had stalked the weeks before. Callan was now the creature those damned scientists had created. Cold, hard, his body primed and ready to fight.</p><p>Stay! He mouthed silently.</p><p>She nodded, unwilling to worry him. Kane had warned her many times of the danger of a soldier allowing his concentration to fracture under fire. He had to be able to fight without the baggage of internal or emotional conflict. She pressed herself tighter against the stone, watching him desperately, praying he knew she would stay put as he warned her to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled softly, approvingly, then disappeared from sight as a tear fell from her eye.</p><p>Callan could smell them despite the camouflaging scent they stupidly thought would mask their presence from him. There was no way to hide the stink of sweat and the desire to kill. They were good, he gave them that. Had it not been for the smell, he would have never known they were there before he heard the shuffle of feet. And that would have been masked by his own rush through the corridor. The men sent after him were well trained and determined. A hazard.</p><p>Taber and Tanner were still on the other side of the caves ensuring Sherra and Doc Martin\u2019s escape. There would be no help there. Only God knew where Dayan was. As usual, he had disappeared when trouble came calling. There were three of the soldiers waiting for him in the small cave where the corridor emptied out. The good thing was that they seemed to think they would hear him in time to react. They weren\u2019t hidden, rather in plain sight.</p> <p>Callan slid a hunting knife from the sheath at his thigh, palmed it carefully, then stepped into view. The weapon went flying into the shoulder of the man whose weapon came up first. He dropped to the ground as Callan turned his gun on the other two, another knife whipping from sheath to hand and flying to the arm of another.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you bastards, but I will,\u201d he announced softly, his gun trained on the injured, more than surprised soldiers. He looked to the last one left standing, watching coldly as the man held his hands carefully at shoulder height.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here to kill you, Lyons. We just want the girl.\u201d The surprising statement had Callan growling low, dangerous.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want the girl?\u201d he asked him softly.</p><p>The soldier shrugged. \u201cCouncil orders. They didn\u2019t give a shit about you on this one.\u201d</p> <p>Could the Council know? How could they have known unless Kane had relayed the call to them?</p><p>\u201cThrow me the restraints.\u201d Callan indicated the plastic ties the soldier carried in his belt. He moved carefully. Callan saw the bunch of his muscles, the intent in his eyes. He pulled the last knife, aiming it as the soldier stilled.</p><p>\u201cThe next bastard who tries gets it in the heart,\u201d he warned them. \u201cNow do as I said, real damn careful.\u201d</p><p>The restraints landed at his feet. He threw two back to the standing soldier.</p><p>\u201cTake care of your buddies.\u201d He watched impassively as the ties were placed over the soldiers\u2019 wrists then jerked tight, but not tight enough to restrict blood flow. \u201cSit down. Hands behind your back.\u201d Callan waved the gun at him, indicating the floor.</p><p>They sighed and did as he ordered.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do they want the girl?\u201d He repeated the question as he restrained the soldier, then placed the straps on the feet of all three men. \u201cAnd answer me this time or you\u2019ll shed blood, too.\u201d</p><p>He could hear the gnash of teeth. They had been taken out efficiently, easily. It wouldn\u2019t look good on their records.</p><p>\u201cAll I have are the orders.\u201d The soldier shrugged, his weather beaten face resigned. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why they want her. Just that she\u2019s your woman, and they now consider her Council property.\u201d</p><p>Rage burned in Callan\u2019s stomach. Council property. Disposable merchandise. If they knew Merinus was his woman then her life was in more danger than his was at the moment. He moved around the men, pulling lethal knives from hidden sheaths and boot straps. Little daggers came from under shirt collars and shoved in sheaths beneath shirtsleeves. There were a million places to hide a weapon and he could only hope he found those the soldiers carried.</p><p>\u201cWhen did the order go through?\u201d Callan asked him, his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cLate last night. We were rushed in on a Council jet and brought here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you rushed from?\u201d</p><p>The soldiers grunted. \u201cNow, Callan, you know better than that shit.\u201d</p> <p>They wouldn\u2019t tell, they never did.</p><p>\u201cYou made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, you did when you killed the last team,\u201d the soldier told him quietly. \u201cThey reported your rescue of the girl, when they showed up dead, you proved she was more than just a nosy journalist. You should have known better, man.\u201d</p><p>Callan took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t know this soldier, but he was like all those he had known. They knew what he was, who created him. They knew the main goal was capture, but the Council would accept his death if there was no other way. And now, they knew about Merinus.</p><p>\u201cTell the Council and your buddies, playtime is over,\u201d Callan told him quietly as he moved back to the corridor entrance. \u201cI won\u2019t be playing anymore. I\u2019ll be killing.\u201d</p><p>He paused, listening carefully. He could smell Merinus\u2019 fear, and the beginning lust in her body. Damn, he wasn\u2019t moving fast enough. He had to get her to safety, fast.</p><p>\u201cMerinus,\u201d he called out to her softly.</p><p>She rushed to him, her hands reaching out to the broad palm he extended to her. He wrapped his arm around her, watching the soldier carefully. The man\u2019s eyes went immediately to the mark on Merinus\u2019</p><p>neck.</p><p>\u201cShit, you mated her.\u201d The soldier shook his head as he watched Callan wrap his arm around her body, censure lining his voice. \u201cYou may as well kill her now, man. She\u2019ll never survive the tests those bastards force on her when they catch her.\u201d</p><p>Callan felt Merinus jerk in fear.</p><p>\u201cShh, say nothing,\u201d he warned her, his breath at her ear. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He moved her through the cavern, careful to skirt around the soldiers. They were well trained and still more than dangerous, even restrained. If they got their hands on Merinus, they could easily use her to force his compliance in any area and he knew it.</p><p>Dawn was barely peeking over the ridge as he moved her through the forest. The soft chirps of morning, the sounds of animals awakening, feeding, moving about freely assured him that the danger had yet to stalk them too close. He had to get her out of the area and to the jeep he kept carefully hidden. Even the others had no idea of some of the safeguards he had in place. That jeep, carefully hidden and packed for emergencies, would get them far enough away for him to ensure Merinus\u2019 safety and to pay her brother back for his betrayal of her.</p><p>He had to get her to one of the safe houses though. Already her body was heating, needing his, just as he was beginning to need her. Even in the danger of the moment, he could feel his need for her pulsing in his blood.</p><p>\u201cHow did they know about the mating?\u201d she questioned him as they moved through the thick growth of forest, following what appeared to be little more than an animal trail.</p><p>\u201cMy ignorance,\u201d he bit out. His mistakes were going to end up costing him the life of the woman who was beginning to mean everything to him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she argued breathlessly, but she still kept up with his fast pace. He had to get her as far from the damned cavern as possible before those soldiers got free and managed to call their buddies.</p><p>\u201cThe mark on your neck, the fact that I touched you. Pulled you into my arms,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI rarely touch, and only during the actual fuck do I embrace a woman. They know this. The soldiers know everything about my DNA, my training, my habits. I gave us away.\u201d</p><p>He was filled with self-disgust and impotent anger. He had made his first mistake in killing the soldiers. He had never gone searching for them, and only killed when given no other choice. He should have known the bastards had reported Merinus and her probing questions to the Council. He should have thought, dammit, rather than letting fury guide his actions. The animalistic urge to protect and shelter, to retaliate against any danger to his woman had rode him hard, even then. It was getting worse. It had been all he could do to keep from killing those men in the cave. Only his knowledge of Merinus\u2019 reaction to it had swayed him from doing it. Her emotional connection to him wouldn\u2019t have survived the bloodshed.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>Sherra stood silently in the shadows of the motel, watching carefully, her eyes narrowed as the nine men parted company and went to their respective rooms. They were furious, but one was coldly dangerous. She had watched them at the airport after dropping Doc off at the safe house, then followed them to Sandy Hook and watched as they checked in.</p><p>Kane didn\u2019t remind her of Merinus in any way. He was darker haired, the color nearly black, with intense, cold blue eyes. His strong jaw and high cheekbones gave a hint to Native American ancestry, his hard, graceful body hinted at extensive military training. She knew the look, the way a killer moved. She had grown up among them, been raped by them more than once. But this one, she knew personally. This man had brought her pleasure. Despite her pleas, despite her wishes to the contrary, he had taken her beneath the unfeeling eye of a camera, riding her from one climax to the next, his lust fueled by hers, and hers by his touch.</p><p>Had it only been seven years ago? Sweet heaven, that night tormented her, even now, as though it had happened only yesterday. The dark soldier who had sworn to help her, to rescue her. He had come to her, holding freedom in one hand, her heart in the other, and spent the night teaching her the pleasures of her woman\u2019s body. When he left, he never returned. But the doctors had. With the video, snickering, jeering at the things Kane Tyler had done to her, that she had done to him, all in the name of science. Rape had not impregnated her. They had wondered if pleasure would. Her hands clenched into fists of rage as he lingered outside his room, lazily finishing a cigarette he had lit moments earlier. She wanted to kill him now. She had sworn she would kill him if she ever found him again. Sworn she would see to it that he paid for every moment of pain she suffered all those years ago. She had sworn he would pay for lying to her, and for doing it so easily without her knowledge. He had betrayed her, just as he had betrayed his sister.</p><p>His expression hardened when the last door finally closed and he was left alone with her.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Merinus?\u201d His voice was savage, pulsating with a fury that sent a fission of unease down her body. \u201cAnd why the fuck weren\u2019t we met at the airport as promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a better question,\u201d she said from the safety of the shadows. \u201cWhy would a brother betray a sister he swears to love on the eve of promised help?\u201d</p><p>He turned around slowly, casually, until he was facing her. She saw hard purpose in his face, and surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA full team of soldiers swept over Callan\u2019s house. A dozen men. All I know for sure is that they didn\u2019t get him or Merinus. But I know they want her. They know about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what, for God\u2019s sake?\u201d He raked his fingers through his hair, his voice quiet but rough with fury.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would they attack now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know your sister has mated with Callan,\u201d she told him carefully. \u201cJust as you knew.\u201d</p><p>Or had he? She watched his face pale alarmingly, his blue eyes widening.</p><p>\u201cThat bastard touched her?\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she drawled mockingly. \u201cHe mated with her. Surely you remember the concept? And now the Council no longer cares if they take him alive or dead. They want the woman and any child she carries. But you already knew that, didn\u2019t you, Mr. Tyler? Why else would they attack mere hours after talking to you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cI never betrayed my sister. I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d His voice sent a chill over her spine. Sherra frowned.</p><p>\u201cI came to kill you, Kane Tyler,\u201d she said carefully.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem surprised now. His mouth edged with mockery.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could delay that little attempt long enough for me to save my sister\u2019s ass,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this mating shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she bit out. \u201cNow is not the time for explanations. Now is the time for you to tell me how the Council learned of the mating, if Merinus didn\u2019t tell you of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Sherra was nearly certain he hadn\u2019t known. He was a liar, but in this one instance, he was telling the truth. Her gifts had grown through the years, with maturity and desperation. She could now smell a lie as others could diseased trash.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d His voice sizzled. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to have to be a little more forthcoming than you are, woman. I can\u2019t help Merinus or Callan with so little information.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Sherra stepped from the shadows. She watched his eyes widen, saw the suspicion turn to knowledge.</p> <p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t killed,\u201d he whispered, blinking, trying to assure himself she was there. Bitterness filled her with a wave of pain so intense, she threatened to drown beneath it.</p><p>\u201cNo, lover, I wasn\u2019t killed. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have much longer to live.\u201d</p><p>And Sherra faced her past as she never had before. Nightmares and broken hopes fragmented around her, drawing her soul into a bleak, dark void she feared she could never escape. She felt the surging lust, the need, just as Callan and Merinus knew it, thundering through her blood, through her very being. Before her stood the man who had betrayed her years before. In a bleak, cold lab, his body laboring over her, throwing her into pleasure despite every barrier she put up against it. Her mate. The father of the child she had lost. The one man she had sworn to kill.</p><p>It was dark before Callan made it to the hidden jeep. The precautions he insisted on taking and the rough terrain they were going through had turned a half-day\u2019s hike into a full day\u2019s. He pushed Merinus into it, cranked the engine with a prayer, then a sigh of relief when it turned over easily. Pulling out of the small, deserted shed at the edge of a logging camp he started down the road at an easy pace. Merinus was lying in the back seat, tired, drained from the run and the drugged lust raging through her body. Callan had quickly replaced his camouflaged T-shirt with a plain white cotton shirt. His hair was pushed beneath a baseball cap, and his gun lay in easy reach. The drive to the next town wasn\u2019t far and if he stayed on the main road, well away from the paths he was known to take, then he might get out of this relatively unscathed.</p><p>His safe house was tucked away several hours from his home. On the edge of a large town, unassuming, with only a few neighbors and it was fully stocked. He could hide there long enough to figure out what the hell had happened.</p> <p>He pulled into the garage hours later, sighing wearily as the garage door closed automatically behind</p><p>them. Merinus had slipped into a restless sleep earlier. She whimpered occasionally, shifted around, but the weariness dragging at her body had been too much.</p><p>\u201cAre we there?\u201d She rose slowly from the seat, her voice drowsy, aroused. God, he wanted her. She was ready for him, her body wet for him. He took a steadying breath. He had to get her in the house first.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He jumped from the jeep then helped her out, lifting her carefully into his arms and stalking to the door.</p><p>\u201cI can walk,\u201d she protested, but she pressed herself closer, her mouth finding the warm skin of his neck as he fit the key into the lock.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can carry you,\u201d he told her, feeling something in his chest tighten as he held her close. The house was dark, silent. He flipped on low lights as he walked into the kitchen, inhaling carefully to be certain no surprises awaited. All he detected was the closed scent of the house and hot, wet woman.</p> <p>\u201cHungry?\u201d He stepped into the living room, placing her on the couch as he stepped back. She raked her fingers through her hair as she stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And a shower. I need a shower bad,\u201d she sighed. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther side of Ashland,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cCome on, I\u2019ll show you where the shower\u2019s at so you can bathe. I\u2019ll use the other one and get dinner together when I\u2019m finished. It won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the master bedroom. The heavy wood furniture and spotless appearance gave it an impersonal feel. He never cared much for the place, but the very fact that it was the opposite of what he would have personally chosen made it that much safer.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d He nodded to the large master bath and its garden tub. \u201cI\u2019ll lay a shirt out for you to wear. I\u2019ll use the other bathroom.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him, her eyes heavy lidded, weariness dragging at her, and she was still the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes on. He lifted his hand to smooth his fingers over her cheek, staring down at her, longing for her. Only the fact that she was worn to the bone, tired and hungry, kept him from putting her on that big, unused bed and pounding into her.</p><p>She pressed her cheek to his fingers, a smile lifting the corners of that pouting mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time.\u201d Callan bent to her, his lips whispering over hers in a gentle kiss. \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and start supper after my shower. I\u2019ll come up for you when it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Callan.\u201d</p><p>His heart broke. He felt it shatter, the pieces slamming into his soul as she stared up at him, her eyes slumberous, her body filled with need, her life in more danger than she could know, and still she whispered those words to him.</p><p>He closed his eyes, wanting to block the site of it from his mind, from the beast that howled out in misery.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, shaking his head. They were already bound, forever tied together in their need for each other, in the danger that stalked them. This burden he could not face. She felt his fingers on her lips. They trembled. He opened his eyes and saw the tear that fell from one eye. It eased over her cheek, bleak and lonely as it made a track through the dust and grime on her face from their run through the mountain.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her voice shook as she fought more tears.</p><p>He wanted to scream out at the injustice of it. At the laugh fate was having on him. In one hand lay all his dreams. In the other lay his death.</p><p>He pulled her to him, crushing her against his chest as he fought his own tears, the cries of the beast suffering within him.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to know, Callan, even before the mating, I loved you. When you were just a picture, a story, a man I couldn\u2019t stop dreaming about.\u201d Her words pierced his heart. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to die without you knowing that I love you. That I loved you even before you touched me.\u201d</p><p>Callan shuddered. His arms tightened around her, his face burying in her neck. His lips pressed to the small wound there where his teeth kept going during the height of their passion.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first saw you, you were standing in that greasy parking lot of the station, wearing those damned jeans and that shirt that flashed your stomach,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cMy cock damned near came out of my jeans, and my heart bled. Because I was looking at the woman I would have taken for my own, if my life were my own.\u201d</p><p>His life wasn\u2019t his own, but she was. Nature had taken the choice from him. And it would kill him if he failed to protect her. Callan knew the chances of protecting her were growing slimmer by the day. The Council knew about her now. They knew about the mating.</p><p>He pulled back, unable to bear their touch any longer, unable to bear the uncertain future staring him in the face. Damn their souls to hell, Merinus was better off dead then risking her life this way. She didn\u2019t have a chance. Eventually, they would get her. Just as they always captured him. Eventually. He turned from her, heading for the bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cBathe,\u201d he whispered, his voice tight, the ache in his soul nearly strangling him. \u201cI\u2019ll have something to eat soon.\u201d</p><p>He heard her sigh behind him. A lost, aching sigh that speared through him, hurting him more than he was already hurting. She was so innocent. Too damned innocent for the horrors awaiting them. How could he assure her safety? What could he do to keep the degradation and pain he knew she would suffer from her future?</p><p>Go in as she asked? That question haunted him. He could bear the humiliation, the tabloid stories and the judgments against him. He could risk the chance he would be branded sub-human for her safety. If it brought her safety. If her brother had been the one to betray her, then it wouldn\u2019t. But, if his other suspicions held true, then it wasn\u2019t her brother at all.</p><p>Weariness pulled at him, hopelessness beat a discordant note in his brain. It had been there in the cave with those soldiers. An elusive scent nearly hidden by the stink of men of evil. He hadn\u2019t noticed it at first, and only later, after Merinus fell asleep in the jeep had it come to him. There had been the smell of another, a man who wasn\u2019t with the soldiers, a man Callan knew well. His chest tightened with that knowledge, despite his need to deny it.</p><p>That sheltered cave was not used for a reason. It was barely known, even to the residents of that area of the mountains. And none knew of the linking caverns, for Callan had closed them off years before. He stripped quickly, adjusting the water and stepping beneath the spray. He wanted to wash away the memories of horror and pain, but it wasn\u2019t possible. He wanted to wash away the evil of his conception, the stench of the crime against humanity that they had used him to commit, but once again, he could not. All he could do was wash away the grime of yet another desperate flight to safety, and pray to God he was wrong about his betrayer. Enough blood stained his hands and his soul, he didn\u2019t want to compound his past sins with the sin of killing one of the few people he loved.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d He jerked in surprise as a silhouette appeared outside the glass door. Shapely, small and fragile, Merinus stood outside the steamy chamber, her voice hesitant, beckoning. He opened the door, sliding it across the tracks until he could see her. She was radiantly naked, hope and need glistening in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMerinus,\u201d he sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI need someone to wash my back.\u201d She held up her washcloth, her expression hopeful, her body aroused.</p><p>Would he ever be able to deny the scent of her need? Callan knew he couldn\u2019t. He never would. It was as intoxicating to him as his taste was to her. He stood beneath the water, feeling it caress his skin with its heat, and knowing it was nothing compared to the heat to be found within her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>She smiled sadly, stepping into the cubicle with him, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her hands went to his chest, smoothing over his skin, her fingertips testing the muscle beneath. Taking the washrag from her, he dropped it carelessly on the small shower shelf beside him. He watched as her eyes closed, the water cascading over her hair, her pale face. She luxuriated in the heat of the water, moving her head to allow it to soak every strand.</p><p>\u201cLet me wash you then, beauty,\u201d he told her, his voice soft. Too soft for his own peace of mind. How he wanted her. His body ached with his need, both physical and emotional. Into his cupped palm he deposited a generous amount of shampoo and began to work it into her hair. His fingertips caressed her scalp, drawing the wet silk through them, stroking the tender skin of her head. She moaned in pleasure, her body brushing against his as she leaned into his chest, her tongue washing over his flat male nipple with slow sensuality.</p><p>His body tightened, growing hotter by the second. He moved her beneath the spray once again,</p><p>watching as suds rinsed from her hair, rolled slowly over her shoulders, her full breasts. Caressing her as he wanted to caress her. Kissing her skin with satin softness, hiding the hardness of her rosy nipples for the briefest second. When the last of the suds had washed away, he retrieved the soap from the shelf. He left the washrag. He wanted nothing but the smooth slide of suds between his hands and her flesh. He worked the soap between his hands as he stared down at her. Her eyes were passion glazed, her body trembling with weariness and passion.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re eating before you go to sleep,\u201d he told her softly, an involuntary smile edging his mouth. The smile disappeared when he touched her. She gasped, arching against the hands that cupped her breasts, the fingers that gripped her nipples. Slowly, inch-by-inch he covered her body with creamy lather until he was kneeling at her feet, pressing her legs apart, his fingers running over the slick flesh of her smooth pussy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love the way you touch me,\u201d she gasped as his fingers began to stroke her, wash her. Suds rolled down her thighs, mixed with the heady scent of her feminine need. Callan laid his head against her abdomen, one arm wrapping around her upper thighs as he held her steady, the other parting her legs further. He had to taste her. He could wait no longer. His tongue swiped through the satiny folds, then curled around her swollen clit. She shuddered in his grasp. Her hands dug into his hair, holding onto him as he teased the little bud with soft strokes, careful to keep the rougher portion of his tongue well away from it. With only the tip he stroked around her clit, feeling her shudder, her stomach contract. He sucked it into his mouth then, applying just enough pressure to have her grinding her hips against him, her needy moans filling the shower stall as he teased her.</p><p>\u201cCallan, please.\u201d She bucked against his mouth as he pressed her against the wall, then lifted her thigh to his shoulder.</p><p>She screamed out as his tongue speared into her. Deep, hard, spreading the muscles of her vagina as he sought the addicting taste of her desire. The fingers of one hand continued the teasing strokes against her clit as he ignored her demand for instant gratification. He didn\u2019t want to rush this, he wanted to savor the taste and the touch of her.</p> <p>He licked at her gently then, moaning as her juices coated his tongue and his lips. So ready for him. She wept for him, pleaded with him, her muscles clenching on his invading tongue as she reached for the release she would only ever attain with him.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he groaned against the folds of flesh, licking in swifter, firmer strokes.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she cried out, her hands clenching in his hair, her voice wild with her need to climax. \u201cAlways mine.\u201d</p><p>And he was. Hers. She was his. He came to his feet, lifting her to him, pushing between her thighs, his cock plunging inside her in one quick stroke that took him to the hilt. Callan gritted his teeth at the fiery pleasure that washed over his body. She was tight, gripping him in a silken fist so damned hot it took his breath.</p><p>A wail of pleasure sounded from her lips. She tightened, rocked against him. He pulled back and thrust</p> <p>hard again. She climaxed instantly, her release raining over his erection, destroying his self-control. He held her close in his arms, his hips powering into her then as he fought to get deeper, closer. God help him, she was all that mattered to him now. Being inside her, heart, soul, body. This was all he dreamed of and more than he had ever believed possible.</p><p>Stroking desperately inside her, he heard her building moans of renewed need, felt the emergence of the barb and knew ecstasy was only seconds away. He held her tighter, thrust harder, faster. Merinus tightened in his arms once again and as his cock lodged deep, his seed spurted into her, he heard her scream and felt her climax rush over her for the second time. And in her arms, for those few endless seconds, he found peace.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>They stayed buried in the house for two days while Callan paced the floors and checked the hidden email account he had. Everyone had checked in. They were secure but two of the messages had his instincts raring in self-defense. The first from Dayan, swearing Kane and the Tyler men were seen meeting with the soldiers, coordinating a search for Callan that covered every inch of the mountains. The other from Sherra, informing him that she and a relative were desperately searching for them to relay information. He cursed violently when that email came through. He told her to stay put, to put off the meeting with Kane Tyler. Why had she taken this into her own hands? And who was lying? Sherra or Dayan? For the first time since their births Callan began to question the loyalty of the Pride.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Merinus stood between the kitchen and the living room, watching him in concern. Her hair was tangled around her face, drowsiness still flushed her skin. He had left her sleeping in the bed hours before after another bout of sex that damned near left him drained. She was dressed in one of his T-shirts. The hem of the blue cotton covered her thighs and hung on her slender shoulders. The intimacy of her wearing his clothing left a gut punch of desire that he couldn\u2019t deny. Possession, raw and hot flared in him. His woman.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d he assured her quietly, unwilling to worry her further. He saw the concern in her eyes though, and knew he hadn\u2019t fooled her. Their lives were hanging by a thread now, the dangers inherent in the situation terrified him. Merinus had no scope of the evil that</p> <p>inhabited the Council and he prayed she never learned.</p><p>\u201cWe need to contact Kane, Callan,\u201d she broached the one subject he wasn\u2019t willing to discuss yet.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be worried out of his mind. That\u2019s not a good thing, either.\u201d</p><p>He could see her absolute belief in her brother reflected in her expression. She thought of her family before she thought of herself. She trusted them when she could trust no one else, especially that damned soldier brother of hers.</p><p>\u201cI have to be certain he didn\u2019t betray us first, Merinus.\u201d He shook his head, staring back at Sherra\u2019s email.</p><p>He could assume the betrayal came from Kane, or from one of his own. Which was more likely to want to see him and Merinus captured or dead?</p><p>\u201cKane wouldn\u2019t betray me, Callan,\u201d she told him quietly.</p><p>There was no anger in her tone, no doubt. She trusted her brother implicitly.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you be so certain, Merinus?\u201d He sighed roughly. \u201cThe attack came hours after your call to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know because I know Kane.\u201d She shook her head, moving further into the room. She went to the couch near him, sat down and regarded him solemnly.</p><p>\u201cKane went ape shit when Dad showed him the box your mother had sent to him on her death,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I know he was hurt. Hurt and angry, but not at you. He spent months gathering evidence, working to reveal the Council members. He has a list from your shoulder to your elbow and a stack of proof against them that would terrify you.\u201d</p><p>Callan narrowed his eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this before?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell you, but you never wanted to hear it.\u201d She rolled her eyes at his abrupt question. \u201cI told you we had everything taken care of. Did you think I would lie to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell if I knew what to think then, or now,\u201d he grunted, shutting down the email program and pacing the floor. \u201cI know we\u2019ve been betrayed by someone close to us, and accusing your brother is a hell of a lot easier than the alternative.\u201d Better than believing that one of his own would do it. He couldn\u2019t get the thought out of his head that one of his own had betrayed him, or the memory of that scent in the caves, lingering on the flesh of the soldier.</p><p>\u201cWho is the alternative?\u201d Merinus asked him carefully. \u201cCallan, Kane didn\u2019t know we had mated, or whatever this is. He wasn\u2019t even certain we were having sex. He suspected it, but he didn\u2019t know it was anything deeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would have known.\u201d Callan frowned. He knew Kane had at least suspected that his sister was too emotionally involved with her lover to leave. The Council would have suspected the rest based on that.</p><p>Merinus sighed. \u201cMaybe he would have, but he wouldn\u2019t have betrayed me or you. He\u2019s put too much into this, taken too many risks himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Callan snapped. \u201cWhy would he do this, just for a story? He didn\u2019t need anything more than the proof Maria had to run it.\u201d</p><p>Merinus bit her lip thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she finally admitted. \u201cAll I know is that he did. And I know he\u2019s been very upset since this came about, almost obsessed with it. He wouldn\u2019t betray you, not just because of the risk to myself, but because of whatever is driving him as well.\u201d</p><p>Callan growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cThat is such a sexy sound.\u201d He turned in surprise at the aroused amusement in her voice. She was watching him, her body relaxed for a change, her head tilted thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d he asked her carefully.</p><p>\u201cThat growl in your voice,\u201d she said, watching him with heavy lidded desire. \u201cIt makes me shiver, makes my body want to rub over all yours.\u201d</p><p>Her heat wasn\u2019t upon her yet. He smelled the air carefully. The scent of warm, willing woman was there, but not the desperate lust he was used to smelling when she wanted him. Callan watched her carefully, seeing nothing in her expression that would indicate that the chemically induced needs were riding her. There was no smell of it on the air, no desperation or tense muscles showing that would hint at her need. There was something elusive, though. Like the faintest fragrance of spring. He admitted to being more than a little confused now.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d She pushed her fingers through her hair, attempting to restore it to order. She still looked sexy and tousled though, warm and beckoning.</p><p>\u201cYou want me.\u201d He was more than a little amazed by that fact.</p><p>\u201cWell, duh,\u201d she gave him a look that suggested she was beginning to suspect his intelligence. \u201cJust figure that one out, Sherlock?\u201d</p><p>Callan frowned.</p><p>\u201cWoman, you are a snide creature.\u201d He allowed the rumble in his chest to echo in his voice. Her face flushed, but her expression showed her knowledge that he was tempting her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bitch.\u201d She was clearly laughing at him. \u201cAsk Kane, he\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>The mention of her brother sobered him. He tucked his hands in the pockets of his jeans and paced to the window that he kept covered with heavy curtains. He didn\u2019t look out, there was no need to. There was enough wildlife in the area that if he were being stalked here, he would know it. The birds would</p><p>stop singing, the frogs would ease their early evening serenade.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a way of contacting him, other than the cell phone?\u201d he asked her. She sighed, sobering. She was filled with laughter and hope, despite their circumstances. Her innocence amazed and terrified him.</p><p>\u201cNo, not really.\u201d He glanced back as she shrugged. \u201cKane secured the phones we were using before I left so the calls couldn\u2019t be hacked or traced. Both units have an indicator on them, in case the impossible happens and someone locks onto the channel. He took every precaution with them.\u201d</p><p>Merinus\u2019 unit was tucked in his pack. He had felt the vibration of it earlier in the morning when he had dug out the ammunition for his pistol.</p><p>\u201cEither your brother or mine has betrayed us,\u201d he told her, watching her face go blank with shock.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble here, Merinus. The Council knows I\u2019ve mated with you; they will stop at nothing to take you now. They did everything to breed us while we were in captivity, thinking our children would be easier to control than we were. If they take you, then they have me willingly, and they know that.\u201d</p><p>He watched the fear that washed over her face. She swallowed tightly, her hands gripping the material of the shirt at her waist, her fingers turning white with the tension that invaded her body.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He breathed out roughly. \u201cI have two choices, neither are secure. We could leave the country and disappear, but that\u2019s not a guarantee they won\u2019t find us. We\u2019ll never be truly safe and neither will our children be safe. Or I could trust your family and do as you came to ask me to do, but still, no guarantee. Both choices are rife with danger, Merinus. There will be no peace for us, whichever way we go.\u201d</p><p>Hope filled her expression. She had such belief in her brothers and her father that she thought they could solve any problem. He wondered what it would have been like to be raised in such a secure, protective environment. To have such faith in someone other than yourself.</p><p>\u201cKane knows what he\u2019s doing, so do the others, Callan,\u201d she promised him desperately. \u201cI have seven brothers, each one of them has been working on this for over six months now. Gray is with the FBI, Caleb is a private investigator, Kane has all kinds of contacts in the C.I.A. and across seas. They have boxes of proof, but need you to back it up. You can do this, Callan. We can do it together.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her expression was beseeching, her eyes wide and so filled with confidence. This time in him. She watched him as though he could solve this problem by his will alone. He wanted to curse her innocence, but found himself desperate to believe in it as well. Surely, it couldn\u2019t be so simple. After years of running, decades of doubt and hopelessness, could it really be so easy? Of course it couldn\u2019t, but what choice did he have left?</p><p>\u201cWe will wait one more day,\u201d he finally sighed, glancing back at the computer, the emails he had received bothering him more than he wanted to admit. Tanner and Taber had done a copy of theirs to each of the others of the Pride. Sherra had not. The email had come singly and carefully coded. She trusted no one now, except Kane Tyler and himself.</p><p>\u201cI believe Dayan has betrayed me,\u201d he finally told her softly. \u201cHis scent was in the cave and on the soldiers within it. He knew of the mating and has been furious over it. His instability may have driven him</p> <p>over the edge.\u201d</p><p>He hid his rage, his pain. If Dayan had betrayed the Pride, then it would fall to Callan to kill him. Dayan would become the hunted, something Callan swore the others would never be again.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d Merinus came to her feet, her expression bleak, filled with pain for him. He shook his head, moving away from her. He didn\u2019t want her tenderness right now, not while he was filled with this rage.</p><p>\u201cI took them out and covered their escapes with the deaths of scientists, soldiers and doctors,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThe screams of the dying still echo in my ears, the deaths of the babes incubating in their tubes still tear at my conscience.\u201d He dragged his hands through his hair, fighting the years-old horror and regret.</p><p>\u201cYou did what you had to do, Callan.\u201d She gave him total acceptance, when he didn\u2019t even have that for himself.</p> <p>\u201cI swore they would never be hunted again,\u201d he whispered, fighting the ragged wound opening up in his soul. \u201cI would not like to hunt my brother, Merinus. To know that the beast overcame him does not give hope for the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Incredulous anger colored her tone. He turned to her in surprise. Her hands were propped on her hips, her brows drawn into a frown as she stared at him as though he had lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d he asked her carefully. Damn, she could be mercurial.</p><p>\u201cThe beast overcoming him?\u201d She snorted in a less than ladylike fashion. He could likely blame Kane for that habit. \u201cMore likely his human nature coming out. Dammit, Callan, animals do not betray each other. Check out the Discovery Channel a little more often. You need to research, hon. Only humans sell each other out, only humans kill for no reason. It would say that perhaps Dayan got a little more human coding than the rest of you did.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her breasts, staring him down as though he were a child in need of a lecture. Where was this woman\u2019s fear? Her respect? Even the scientists had shown him greater fear. He lifted a brow at her. She didn\u2019t understand what the scientists had created, how they had attempted to train them. He could forgive her the ignorance, he decided.</p><p>\u201cOh, look at that brow arching,\u201d she said mockingly. \u201cLion-O thinks he knows better.\u201d</p> <p>Callan clenched his teeth.</p><p>Merinus threw her hands up in defeat.</p><p>\u201cFine, believe what you want to,\u201d she bit out. \u201cJust like a man, you will anyway. But I\u2019m telling you right now, and you\u2019ll find out I\u2019m right, Callan Lyons, Dayan is a typical psychopath. It\u2019s there in those beady little eyes of his. I never did trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is such a thing as a typical psychopath? Did you see this on the Discovery Channel as well, darling?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened at the little dig, her head tilting, considering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it aired and I\u2019m certain I\u2019m right. I have a brother that\u2019s into pop psychology, he would know all about it and I\u2019m sure he would agree with me.\u201d</p><p>Figured. Was there anything those brothers of hers didn\u2019t do? And did they ever disagree with the little imp standing across from him? It occurred to him that she might be just a bit spoiled by those brothers of hers.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d There went those hands on those slender hips again. Her breasts pushed out against the T-shirt, the hard nipples like a beacon to his eyes. How was a man supposed to think when confronted with such a sight?</p> <p>\u201cI told you, I will decide by tomorrow,\u201d he growled, fighting a lust that had nothing to do with any scent of need coming from her body. For a change, the lava hot scent was barely present. What he detected now though, was much more destructive. A woman irritated, angry, and just plain, pure aroused. His cock throbbed.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what I think. Now I\u2019m going to go take a bath and you can sit here and brood all you want to. Then I\u2019ll fix dinner. I make a great pasta salad.\u201d</p><p>She swept from the room before he could snarl. Pasta salad? He didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>Merinus made her pasta salad to accompany Callan\u2019s steaks and baked potatoes. They ate silently, then cleaned the kitchen together. Pouring her a glass of wine, Callan led her back to the living room. His silence wasn\u2019t nerve wracking. Merinus could tell he was thinking, weighing the options they had. Not that she saw many options. Kane was going to have to be called, whether he liked it or not. Her family was their only hope.</p><p>She sat on the couch while he paced the room and ignored the heat building between her thighs. She more than admitted that the normal desire she felt for him was bad enough, but this building tension, this wildness that seemed to get worse with each fucking was making her crazy.</p><p>\u201cTake off the shirt.\u201d His voice was strained, rough with his demanding sexuality. Merinus glanced up in surprise as he stalked toward her. His movements slow and graceful, the jeans hugging the bulge between his thighs that seemed to grow larger as he came closer. His expression was intent, almost feral. His eyes were bright, glowing in the deep tan of his face. Merinus felt her heart beat quickly, her breathing becoming deep and rough as she licked her lips in anticipation. This would be a mating. The times before had been sheer lust, an easing of the burning fire that raged between them. But this time would be different, she could feel it. She crossed her arms over her chest, drawing the shirt over her head with a languid movement as she lifted her legs to the couch, leaving them slightly bent, closed. She wouldn\u2019t submit to him easily. For a moment, it worried her, the feeling that rushed over her body. She felt almost animalistic, the need for him going beyond simple desire, her determination to hold her own with him rising as hot as her lust. He stopped at her feet, his eyes narrowing as his hand went to the snaps of his jeans. Merinus\u2019 hands went to her breasts; she cupped them slowly, her fingers teasing her nipples as she arched her breasts towards him. A move meant to tease, to entice. He growled low and deep, his lip lifting in a mild snarl. Merinus smiled at him, her eyelids lowering as she licked her lips with her damp tongue, watching as the thick, proud length of his cock emerged from the opening of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cOpen your thighs,\u201d he ordered her, the grumble of his voice a sensual rasp over her nerve endings. Merinus rose to her feet instead. She wouldn\u2019t give him anything willingly this time. If he wanted her, if he wanted to take her, make her his, then he would have to fight for it. Where the wildness came from, she didn\u2019t know. What made it rise like a demand in her body, she wasn\u2019t certain. But it was there and refused to be denied.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t undressed yet,\u201d she said a bit coyly. \u201cWould you take me still dressed, with your cock the only bare skin touching me?\u201d</p><p>His eyes followed her movements carefully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the edge, Merinus,\u201d he warned her, his voice dark. \u201cThis demon has risen too quickly, too hard inside me. Lie down and don\u2019t fight me. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She tossed him a look over her shoulder as she skirted a wide path around him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re the one who will end up hurt,\u201d she suggested, her voice low, pulsing with the arousal of this new and intriguing desire rising inside her. \u201cWhy should I submit? You lie down, and allow me to have my way with you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand smoothed over her buttock as she passed by him, well out of arm\u2019s reach. The sensation of her own hand against her buttocks sent a tingle of pure heat rushing over her body. As she watched him over her shoulder, she drew her nails across her skin, knowing she left the soft blush of the abrasion.</p><p>His face flushed, his eyes glittered. He moved without rushing, stripping his jeans from his body, the powerful muscles of his legs and thighs tense and hard as he tossed the material to the couch.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be easy, Merinus,\u201d he promised her, moving around behind her, stalking her, his intent clear in his expression.</p><p>\u201cNeither will I,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>She knew before he pounced. She watched the muscles of his chest bunch. An instant before he moved she was streaking for the stairs. She felt her heart pounding harsh and loud in her chest, her blood raging through her body, desire wrapping around them, urging them into a desperate game of domination. He caught her halfway up the stairs. The heat of his body blanketed hers as he snagged her around the waist, bringing her to a stop, bending her to her knees. Merinus bucked against him. She felt his erection slide between the cheeks of her ass, heating the narrow crevice with his incredible heat. He was thick and hard, and it would be so tempting to tilt her hips and allow him to thrust into the wet, needy channel he sought.</p><p>She allowed him to believe that was her intention. She relaxed, moving against him, and when his arms lifted to clasp her hips, she scrambled up the steps. Of course, he only let her go, she wasn\u2019t fool enough to believe she had actually escaped.</p><p>Merinus glanced back from the landing, watching as he came up the steps behind her. He was moving fast, his expression savage. She sprinted for the bedroom, intent on slamming the door behind her, locking him from her, leaving him only the scent of her incredible lust to beckon him. She made it as far as pushing the door halfway closed, then he was there, pushing past it, slamming it closed behind them.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to try hiding under the bed?\u201d he suggested silkily as she backed up from him.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to try my knee in your nuts again?\u201d She smiled, watching him almost wince. His face definitely tightened.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he accused her with no heat. \u201cI can see your juices gleaming on your cunt.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, running her tongue over them slow and easy as his eyes flared at the action.</p><p>\u201cSo take it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cIf you can.\u201d</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou think it will be easy again, Merinus?\u201d he asked her, his voice low and dangerous. \u201cYou think it will merely be another hard, fast fuck before my barb anchors me inside you?\u201d</p><p>Her vagina clenched in anticipation. But he only shook his head at her.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d he warned her. \u201cThis time, I will make you submit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you intend to do this?\u201d she questioned him archly. His hand went to the thrusting flesh of his cock. He stroked it slowly, his movements unhurried.</p><p>\u201cWhen I am done, Merinus, there is not an entrance in that sweet body of yours that I will not have taken.\u201d He edged closer as she backed away from him, watching him warily now.</p><p>\u201cI will have you on your knees, your lips wrapped around my cock until I cum inside your hot mouth. I\u2019ll fuck your lips like I\u2019ve dreamed of doing since the other night when you stole my control. And when I\u2019ve given you my first load there, I\u2019ll lay you on your stomach, stretch your ass and fuck it until I\u2019m anchored there, filling you with more of my seed. And we both know I\u2019ll still be hard when I\u2019m finished.\u201d He ignored her widening eyes. She couldn\u2019t even imagine him fitting there. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll raise your hips and I\u2019ll fuck that hot little pussy until you\u2019re hoarse from screaming, your body pulsing with so many orgasms you\u2019ll beg me to stop.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuite an itinerary,\u201d she told him sweetly. \u201cYou were doing fine until you brought up the anal thing, Callan. We both know it won\u2019t fit, so don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>He smiled a second before he rushed her. Merinus had time to squeak out a cry of alarm before he had her on her knees before him. His hands anchored her shoulders, holding her fast despite her struggles. His cock was poised at her lips as one hand left her shoulder to grip her jaw, holding her still.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>The head of his erection pressed against her damp lips, his fingers opened her mouth until he slid home with a low cry. She would suck him, Merinus knew, but his climax would not be easily attained. Not with her. Not yet.</p><p>She refused to tighten her lips on him. Her tongue caressed him with slow, easy strokes, her body tightening as his flesh jerked within her mouth. A low, sexy growl filled the silence as he held her head still, his hips pushing against her, then pulling back as he sought relief in the humid depths of her mouth. The thick shaft stretched her lips, seared her with its heat. She drew on it with a slow, lazy sucking motion of her lips, staring up at him, watching his face contort in pleasure. His hands were in her hair, kneading her scalp; his short nails scraping the skin erotically. Merinus moaned in rising excitement, then felt the shiver that worked over Callan\u2019s body at the vibrations against his erection. The mounting tension and excitement was burning her alive.</p><p>Merinus felt poised on the edge of an arousal unlike any she had known before. The feel of his thick shaft stroking in shallow thrusts in her mouth, her position, the dominance in him combined to edge the passion higher. His scrotum tightened against the base of his cock and a rough groan of sheer delight whispered over her ears. She licked him like candy, from base to tip. Her lips caressed and stroked, spreading the moisture of her mouth over the heavy veined cock as she sucked it with light moisture. She refused to tighten her lips. She wanted to tempt and tease. She wanted him wild and hot, wilder than he had ever been before. Her fingers encased the taut sac beneath his throbbing erection, her nails scraping the crease of his thighs, her tongue painting intricate patterns over the flesh of his cock as she ignored his near desperate moans.</p><p>\u201cSuck it, Merinus,\u201d he growled at her, his hands clenching in her hair. \u201cDamn you, suck it.\u201d</p><p>She watched him from beneath her lowered lips, tempting him to make her, daring him to punish her. The sexual game was heating up in a new and dangerous way. She felt a measure of nerves at her own actions, but the overriding demand inside her refused to let her give in easily. She circled the head of his cock with her tongue, then stroked the soft, incredibly sensitive area where the barb pulsed just under the</p><p>skin, threatening to emerge, pleading for the desperate stroke of her mouth to bring it to life.</p><p>\u201cThis is a dangerous game, baby,\u201d he whispered as she smiled up at him. Merinus felt her uterus contract, felt the slow slide of her juices leak from her cunt. She was wet and burning. Her own orgasm would be only a few strokes away if he were to impale her with the thick, rose-headed weapon she held in her mouth. And what a sensual torture tool it was. Placing her tongue flat along the rising stiffness, she encased it snugly in her mouth and drew on it again. Slowly. She refused to give into his heated moans.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, baby, you\u2019re killing me,\u201d he panted as her fingers joined the play, caressing and teasing his scrotum with light strokes and gentle rasps of her nails.</p><p>His hands kept her in place, refusing now to allow her to draw back, to continue the torture of her tongue swiping over his erection. His thighs were rock hard now, planted wide apart, his hips arching into her suddenly slack mouth.</p><p>\u201cDamn you,\u201d he growled hoarsely. \u201cYou will pay for this, Merinus. Suck my fucking cock.\u201d</p><p>He pressed the length of his flesh into her mouth, nearly touching her tonsils before she clamped down on it, her teeth rasping the silk encased steel, her mouth enclosing it tight and hot as he began to fuck her with shallow strokes.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Yeah. Like that,\u201d he whispered, his voice hard, sounding tortured with pleasure. He was watching her, his gaze intent as he stroked in and out of her mouth. His eyes were heavy lidded, his face sensually flushed, his lips parted and full as he breathed hard and deep, a growl whispering past his chest every so often. Merinus wrapped her hands around the base of the thrusting weapon, moaning in rising need as she felt the beginning erection of the barb. She would have loosened the pressure then, but Callan\u2019s hands were suddenly cupping her cheeks, her jaw.</p><p>\u201cNo more teasing,\u201d he snarled down at her erotically as he pushed his cock dangerously close to her throat.</p><p>The threat only incited her desperate lust. She began to suckle him deeper, her tongue caressing it with quick strokes as he began to stroke harder into her mouth. He was wild now, savage in his sexual intensity. The hard angles of his face were pulled into desperate lines as his teeth gritted with the rising need for orgasm. Merinus felt his cock pulse, the barb emerging, stretching the bit of looser skin over it as it began to come fully erect.</p><p>The need was on her now. She wanted the taste of him. She wanted to hear his desperate cries as he pulsed and spurted his seed into the waiting depths of her mouth. She wanted to taste him, love him. She wanted to show him, prove to him that she accepted him, all of him, every desire, every act he would have with her.</p><p>\u201cMerinus.\u201d He was pumping harder, faster, only her hands braced at the base of his thrusting erection kept him from driving it down her throat.</p><p>A low, agonized growl tore from his throat as his breathing became harsh and deep. Perspiration dotted his forehead, his hands were back in her hair, clenching in the silken strands. Merinus felt the full erection</p><p>of the barb, at least half an inch in length, stiff, pulsing. She curled her tongue around him, her body tightening at his animalistic cry as she caressed it, raked it with her tongue. He pushed against her desperately now, his body trembling, lust overtaking him. He was so wild, so desperate for release that when she felt the first hard blast of his semen spurt into her mouth, she heard the loud, feline cry of pulsing satisfaction that was torn from his chest. He climaxed long and hard, filling her mouth with the hard jets of his release.</p><p>Merinus still refused to ease the soft strokes of her tongue. His body shuddered each time she licked the head, the throbbing barb, small pulses of his cum tearing from his body with each stroke, for long moments. Finally, the small appendage withdrew once again, but the hard state of his cock remained. He pulled back from her, his eyes wild, his expression savage as he reached down and pulled her quickly to her feet.</p> <p>\u201cMine.\u201d His voice was rough, demanding in his possession.</p><p>She smiled slow, tempting.</p><p>\u201cSo prove it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>CHAPTER</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>The beast in Callan roared at the challenge that whispered past her lips. He snarled down at her, now past the point where he could be shocked at his own actions. The beast inside him was in control and no matter how hard he tried to fight it now, he could no longer rein it in. And Merinus was tempting it. Deliberately, systematically destroying the control he fought to keep. He pulled her up, his hands no longer gentle, though he fought to keep from hurting her. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her. He didn\u2019t want to bruise her delicate skin, but he knew his grip was too harsh as he dragged her against his chest.</p><p>Her nipples poked at his flesh. They were hard, hot, tempting. He lowered his head, his lips going for the seductress\u2019 smile on hers. He growled when she refused to open to him. His teeth nipped at her. He felt</p><p>her nails bite into his shoulders, but still she refused him entrance.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, do not do this,\u201d he pleaded with her, his last reserves of restraint slowly slipping from his grasp as she continued to tease him.</p><p>Her lips curved into a small smile, her dark eyes glittering from beneath her lowered lashes as she licked her lips. His hands tightened on her arms. The beast clawed for freedom, raking his loins with a demand he could no longer deny. He jerked her closer, his teeth rougher as he nipped at her lips again, drawing a surprised cry of pleasure from her. That sound gained him entrance. He slanted his head, grinding his lips on hers as he speared into her mouth. He could feel the glands along his tongue, swollen, the intoxicating hormone of his race ready to release into her system. He stroked her tongue and she refused to play. As with his cock, she refused to draw on him, taking the release into her. She struggled against him, her nails raking his shoulders, though her hips thrust desperately against his shaft as it pressed against her lower stomach. He drew her tongue into his mouth, his mouth drawing on hers in example, then sent his spearing into her mouth again. A tempting sound of laughter vibrated against his lips as she refused yet again. One hand went to her hair, fisting in the strands, jerking her head back. He knew the light pain warned her of his intent, yet still she refused to draw on his tongue. His savage growl shocked him, as did his actions, but he no longer had even a measure of control to ease his way. He backed her quickly into the wall, jerking her against him, moving his cock until it raked the tender folds of her soaked pussy. She was so slick and creamy, so hot and tempting he couldn\u2019t stop the aroused snarl of pleasure that pulsed through his body. His hands gripped her buttocks, his fingers smearing through the lubricating cream before he eased a finger inside her tight anus.</p><p>\u201cDo as I want,\u201d he ordered her savagely as she cried out, arching at the small penetration.</p><p>\u201cMake me,\u201d she dared him again, a siren, a seductress out to destroy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Merinus.\u201d His finger slid deeper inside her ass, his cock jerking at the tight, heated depths of that channel. \u201cI know more about forcing what I want than you could ever dream. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She nipped his lips, her lips curving, her gaze beckoning.</p><p>\u201cI want all of you. Man and beast,\u201d she whispered when he jerked back in surprise from her rough caress. \u201cI won\u2019t submit to you any longer.\u201d</p><p>The beast howled in joy, the man trembled in pleasure.</p><p>How long had it been since his passions had been given free rein? He knew it hadn\u2019t been since the labs, where the women brought to him were well versed in all manner of painful sexual acts. The beast had raged then, when his sexuality had first been emerging. But not since his escape had he allowed it free again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d His finger drew back, drawing more moisture, then plunging its full length up her ass once again.</p><p>Her body arched, her mouth opening on a low scream as she shuddered with the pleasure/pain he</p><p>brought her.</p><p>\u201cYou will do as I want, Merinus,\u201d he commanded her, his voice a graveled rumble now as man and beast merged. \u201cDo as I wish. Suck my tongue into your mouth.\u201d</p><p>His tongue throbbed with the need to release its essence into her body. The aphrodisiac would fill both their bodies then, spurring their lusts, releasing the beast from the last fragile bond that held it.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried out, her head tossing, her body jerking against him as she fought to accustom herself to the impalement.</p><p>\u201cThen I will stop.\u201d He eased his finger free of her.</p><p>\u201cNo. No. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d She fought to follow the slow retreat, to keep his finger buried within her.</p><p>\u201cDo as I ask, Merinus,\u201d he ordered against her lips, then his tongue stroked over them, the rough rasp more pronounced now with the hormonal need surging through his body. \u201cDo it, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>Her head tossed as he rubbed his cock against her clit. He could feel the little pearl trembling against him, swollen, desperate for release.</p><p>Her lips ground against his, her mouth accepting his tongue, drawing on it slowly, sensually. The taste of spice filled his senses as she drew the drugging hormone from his tongue. She cried out, her nails piercing his back, her legs tightening around his hips as he plunged his tongue in and out of the silken lips encasing it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the glands no longer pulsed, he jerked back from her. She was breathing hard, her breasts rising and falling in hard breaths, her nipples raking his chest, her hips squirming against his as she fought to force his cock inside her hot pussy. She stared up at him, her cheeks flushing as the potency of the hormone began to invade her system. His. She was his woman. His mate. This proved it.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he growled again, his hands clenching on the cheeks of her ass as he ground her against the torturously hot shaft that screamed out for relief. \u201cSay it. Tell me you are mine.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. That smile had his heart nearly bursting from his chest. The mix of tenderness and challenge was nearly more than he could bear.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cYou will say the words before this night ends, Merinus,\u201d he swore. \u201cYou will scream them to me and beg for me to hear you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will scream them for me.\u201d Sultry, her voice low and husky, her body hot and wild as she raked her nails down his chest, watching him through half closed eyes. She was smiling that smile again. The one that had the beast raging, growling low and deep. She licked her lips, spreading the taste of her over them. She wanted to tempt and tease. She wanted to push the beast and shred the control the man had fought for years to attain. So be it. The beast was free. It snarled down at her, not in violence, not in rage. In demand.</p><p>He moved then, rubbing her silky, slick folds of skin over his erection as he moved her to the bed. He watched her eyes dilate, her face flush as his hot cock stroked her clit. He heard her breath catch and gloried in it. When he reached the bed he dropped her to it, staring down at her for a long moment. He knew the ways to achieve what he wanted. He could throw her into pleasure so intense, so burning and deep that she would beg him for his possession, beg him to allow her to belong to him. He would show her this night who was master of their bed.</p><p>He moved to the nightstand and opened it slowly. He didn\u2019t have all the sensual devices in this house as he did at his home, but he always kept on hand a large tube of lubricating jelly. He pulled it out and came back to her.</p><p>She glanced at the tube, then at Callan. He returned her stare, moving carefully onto the mattress beside her. Then he flipped her over. He threw one leg over her thighs to hold her in place, his upper body kept her shoulders against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI could tie you down,\u201d he whispered, nipping at her neck as she struggled against him. \u201cRestraints can drive the pleasure higher, Merinus. Would you prefer this? Or would you prefer to give me what I wish?\u201d</p><p>She was breathing hard and heavy, and just under the scent of her arousal, he could smell her trepidation. She was breathing hard and rough, her body tense as he held her carefully in place for the touch to come. She jerked when his hand smoothed over her buttocks. The rounded pale globes enticed him to caress, to fill his hands with their warmth, and he did just that. Then his fingers traveled through the narrow crease. He smiled in tight anticipation as her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take your ass now, Merinus,\u201d he breathed against her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to prepare you carefully and show you how much pleasure the pain of that possession can be. Whenever you are ready to submit, darling, just say the words.\u201d</p><p>Her protest was a strangled groan as his fingers found the tight little entrance. She was feeling the effects of his kiss now. He could feel her muscles relaxing, despite her attempts to keep it from happening. Flipping open the cap of the lubrication he moved his hand back, spreading the gel in a thick line over his fingers.</p><p>\u201cCallan?\u201d Her voice was filled with nerves when his slickened fingers found the tight entrance once again. Callan lay with his head between her shoulder blades, parting the cheeks of her ass with one hand as his fingers began their sensual invasion. The first finger slid in easily. He heard her moan vibrating at her back as he slid in and out in easy strokes for long moments. Then a second finger joined in the play. She stretched easily for him, her body bucking against him, her skin dampening with perspiration as he held her still. When the third finger joined the first two long moments later, she jerked at the tight fit, the pull of the tender muscles, the burning pleasure he knew that was beginning to invade the tight channel.</p><p>\u201cRelax for it, Merinus,\u201d he soothed her. \u201cFeel how readily your body accepts it. How easily my fingers slide into you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back, then returned with a swift, deep penetration. She nearly screamed with the sensation, pushing back on his fingers, her body trembling with need.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand it,\u201d she cried out, bucking against him.</p><p>\u201cTell me what I want to hear then,\u201d he told her gently, though he knew nothing could save her from the possession to come. It had been more than a decade since he had taken a woman in such a way. He remembered the tight heat, the heady sensation of the forbidden suddenly attainable. Watching his cock sink in, female flesh stretching to take him, accepting this ultimate intimacy. Merinus was no whore purchased merely for his pleasure, though. She was not practiced, nor well versed in the pleasures and the pain of lust. She was new to this touch and her womanly hesitations only spurred his need higher.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She tossed her head in denial.</p><p>\u201cYou will not orgasm until I have what I want, Merinus,\u201d he promised her, filling her slowly once again.</p><p>\u201cI know a thousand ways to make you scream for ease. Give in to me now.\u201d</p> <p>He had to have her submission.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her hips followed his fingers back as he retreated.</p><p>The beast snarled out in impatience, the man moved quickly, his fingers retreating, his body moving to straddle her thighs, his cock lodging in the crease of her ass. She gasped at the move, her body tensing in expectation.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Merinus?\u201d he crooned, his voice gentle despite the sandpapery roughness of the tone.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to take me there?\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hard flesh along the crease, watching the tight globes part until he found the little pink hole he sought. She jerked against him as he moved between her thighs then, separating them quickly, his hands jerking her hips to the proper position.</p><p>She tried to move away from him then. With a lithe, graceful movement, she was nearly out of his arms, rolling to her back and attempting to roll from the bed. Callan laughed in victory as he caught her, dragging her back to the center of the bed, staring into her dilated eyes as he moved between her thighs once again.</p><p>\u201cWe can do it this way as well,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>He gripped her ankles, then pulled them to one shoulder, angling her hips to the side. As one hand held them there the other re-positioned his cock. Merinus was breathing hard and heavy, watching him with wide eyes filled with a combination of fear and anticipation. Waiting no longer, he tested the readiness, the slick preparation of the tiny hole then placed the head of his cock at the entrance.</p><p>\u201cSubmit to me,\u201d he ordered her, his body tightening at the thought of the bliss to come.</p><p>\u201cCallan,\u201d she cried out as his hips lodged the broad head into the tender opening.</p><p>\u201cSubmit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou submit,\u201d her cry was a plea for mercy.</p><p>He pushed against her, feeling her muscles part, stretch as her trembling moan turned into a low, long cry of building pleasure/pain. Callan clenched his teeth, fighting his overwhelming desire to drive into her</p><p>flesh. He stroked in slowly instead, watching her eyes widen, feeling her ass clench on his flesh, then he stroked through the tight, resistant ring of muscle that was his last hurdle.</p><p>Merinus couldn\u2019t scream. She could only stare up at Callan as she fought for breath, feeling the thick length of his cock as it impaled her ass. The pain blended with the pleasure, making her hips buck against him, driving him deeper, keeping her poised on the edge of orgasm as he stretched her, stroking nerve endings she never knew she had.</p><p>Her fists were clenched in the blankets, her head tossed as she fought to deny him further.</p><p>\u201cGive in,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t give in. Not until he did. Not until he was taking her as she knew he wanted to. Not until all control was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou give in,\u201d she pleaded as he began to stroke slowly inside her. She couldn\u2019t stand it. The sensations were terrifying. The mix of pleasure and pain would kill her. Callan held her legs to his shoulders, parting them, his eyes going to where he invaded her. His face was contorted with absolute animal pleasure. His eyes glowed with it. His hips moved slow and easy, stroking his cock in and out of her, his scrotum slapping at the cheeks of her ass with every downward stroke. Merinus clenched on him, hearing him growl. She pushed back to him, almost insane now with the need for a deeper, harder stroke.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she finally cried out. \u201cPlease, Callan, harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSubmit to me.\u201d She was more than shocked when his large, broad hand struck the cheek of her ass from the side.</p><p>Her eyes widened at the burning pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she denied him again.</p><p>He thrust against her harder, deeper, his hand striking her smooth flesh once again. Merinus cried out, driven nearly to the brink of orgasm with each powerful stroke in her ass, each small slap to her buttocks. She jerked against him, fighting for more, harder. She needed desperately to climax. Her fingers went to her clit, intending to stroke it to release, but Callan laughed. He laughed at her as he gripped her hand, pushing it away.</p><p>A groan of frustration tore from her lips. Her head tossed as the pleasurable pain was being stroked in her lower channel, she was crying out on every stroke, almost begging.</p><p>\u201cSubmit to me,\u201d he ordered her again.</p><p>His fingers glanced her clit and she bucked. They circled the little pearl, pumping it with easy strokes, but never enough to bring her release. The caress only threw her deeper into the morass of insane arousal.</p><p>She could feel her cunt clenching, weeping. Her muscles straining for release, her body pleading for it. She shook her head, unable to speak now as she fought for climax.</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d His fingers moved as his erection continued to impale her anus. He spread the lips of her cunt, his eyes narrowed as he kept her legs raised to his shoulders. Then two diabolical fingers plunged inside her.</p><p>So close. Her body tightened, orgasm a breath away, and still he wouldn\u2019t let her have it. He merely stretched her vagina, filling it, his fingers twisting inside her as she bit her lip and fought her body\u2019s demands that she give into him. Give into him now, her body screamed out the demand.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he told her again, his eyes narrowed, wild. His face savage as he watched her, teeth clenched on a snarl as he allowed one more thrust of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYours,\u201d she screamed out to him, desperate now, her body assaulted by so many sensations she knew they would drive her insane. \u201cYou\u2019re...oh God, Callan, let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers pumped into her hard and fast in a rhythm that matched the cock buried in her ass. She felt the smaller erection emerge, his barb stretching her ass further with a burning pain that tipped her over the edge as she heard him growling in his own release. A second later, she felt the hard blast of his semen spurting inside her, she exploded in such mind consuming pleasure she wondered if she would survive. Over and over again, her cries weak and strained as she clenched on his flesh, on his fingers, her body shuddering violently with the wild release that quaked over her. And Callan was by no means immune. The beast was loose. He threw back his head and roared his victory over her as the last pulse of his seed shot into her behind. He was lodged deep inside her, his cock jerking, the barb pulsing as it held him locked to her. His hair was damp, his facial expression tight as his body arched into her once again, trembling in the aftershocks of his release. Long moments later, she felt him slide from her, still hard, still throbbing, only the barb had lost its erection. His cock was still engorged, thick and heavy with his lust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was too weak to open her eyes to see where he was going, but moments later she heard water running in the bathroom. When he returned, he turned her to her stomach gently. She couldn\u2019t protest, whatever he wanted he could have. She was boneless, mindless with satiation. But it was the warm roughness of a cloth between her thighs that she felt. First over the saturated lips of her cunt, then through the narrow cleft of her ass.</p><p>He cleaned her gently, his hands slow, the strokes thorough.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her finally, his voice soft, hesitant.</p> <p>\u201cMm.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to use breathing energy on actually speaking. He was quiet behind her then. His hand was warm on her buttocks; his silence though, was filled with tension.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She could barely hear the apology.</p><p>Merinus took a deep, strengthening breath. Damn, men and their phobias. She turned on her back staring up at him drowsily.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Callan frowned.</p> <p>\u201cI lost control\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d She yawned. Damn, she was tired now. \u201cI wanted you too. Now lay down here and cuddle me, dammit. A woman is supposed to be cuddled after mind blowing sex, not attempting to make sense of some man\u2019s psyche.\u201d</p><p>Uh oh. She watched that expression of male offense cross his face. Now, how the hell had she managed to wound his poor little ego?</p><p>\u201cMy psyche is not the problem,\u201d he informed her with an overload of pride. Merinus rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u2018Then what is?\u201d She pulled weakly at the other side of the comforter as a chill began to replace the warmth of her body.</p><p>\u201cI lost control,\u201d he said again.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I said: So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Merinus looked up at him. He was perfectly in control again, if still a little horny. He sat beside her, his amber eyes glittering with regret.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she argued. \u201cI liked everything you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Merinus, I smacked you,\u201d he bit out, dragging his hand roughly through his hair. \u201cI do not hit women.\u201d</p><p>Merinus smiled. She remembered well the pleasure of that particular little spanking.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she sighed in contentment. \u201cCuddle me for a while and you can do it again.\u201d</p><p>The shock on his face would have been comical if she had the energy to laugh.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted that?\u201d He seemed confused by it.</p><p>Merinus sighed. \u201cCallan, I want all of you. I want you wild and growling, purring and contented, and even roaring in release. I don\u2019t just want a small part of you. I love you. The whole package.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as though to deny her claim.</p><p>\u201cBut you are mine, too,\u201d she told him firmly. \u201cRemember that. Or I really will neuter you. Or I\u2019ll have Kane do it. And I bet he won\u2019t use anesthesia.\u201d</p><p>He winced. Good. Then he brought his hand to her face, his expression filling with tenderness. Damn, he better not make her cry. She really didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>\u201cYou humble me,\u201d he told her roughly.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you make me cry, I\u2019ll smack you.\u201d She kissed his palm though, and sighed peacefully before whining. \u201cNow please get me warm and comfy so I can sleep. I\u2019m killed here.\u201d</p><p>Callan moved hesitantly, pulling the blankets from beneath her and getting in beside her. Merinus moved against him instantly, his extra body heat a balm to her cooling body. His arms went around her, holding her close to his chest, his chin resting atop her head. He was thinking, she could tell. She didn\u2019t consider that a good thing, considering it was the incredible sex of moments before that he was thinking so hard about.</p><p>\u201cI did it deliberately, you know,\u201d she finally said in exasperation as he reached over to switch the lamp out.</p><p>\u201cI know you did.\u201d He wrapped his arms around her once again.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you so damned put out over it?\u201d She frowned.</p><p>\u201cI could have hurt you, Merinus,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI know how. I was beyond all control with you. That\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently not.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cCallan, I\u2019m not your enemy, nor am I threatening your life. Get over it. You did an amazing job of making me submit and I\u2019ll be eternally grateful. Maybe later we can even play again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will drive me insane.\u201d His voice was resigned.</p><p>Merinus was quiet for long moments. Funny, her father and brothers used the same tone of voice and the same words often. What the hell did she do?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d She would figure it out later. \u201cMen are just too confusing for me to figure out right now.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard him chuckle, but it could have just been the vibrations of the soft purr she could hear beneath her cheek. Definitely more soothing than snoring.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>Callan held Merinus for a long while after she fell into a deep sleep. Her body curved close to his, soft and tempting. His hands smoothed over the curve of her back, his eyes closing in pain. He should have walked away from her the moment she came into town. He should have packed and disappeared as he meant to do. Instead, he had given into the temptation of brown eyes filled with laughter, and a temptingly curved body that hardened his cock in seconds. And then, he had thrown her life into chaos. He grimaced, knowing the past week had been more than hard on her. The demands her body was making on her had to be confusing, frightening, but she never gave into it. She had still laughed, she had still fought with him, tempted him. She had given him her body willingly, even during moments when the</p><p>\u2018frenzy\u2019 was not upon her. Her passion burned him alive then. What had happened less than an hour before terrified him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t find a reason why he had suddenly demanded her submission. The scent of her lust had struck him like a bat to heat, triggering some primal instinct inside him. It had become imperative that she submit and accept that she was his, and she had refused. He had to hear her admit she belonged to him, and she had refused. For a while. And her refusal had broken his control. He grimaced, remembering the exhilaration, the pleasure of releasing the beast inside him. It pounded through his blood, his cock, his heart and soul. The climax had been so intense he thought his head would explode as well as his cock. And she had loved every minute of it. There was no mistaking the mask of ecstasy that had covered her face. Her pleas for more. Her desperate, strangled screams of release. Damn her. She had bound him to her. Taken his will to walk away from her. He was tied to her now, with no hope of escape, and no hope of safety. He couldn\u2019t run far enough, or hide long enough now to keep the Council from taking her eventually. There was only one choice, one chance to save what he had found with her.</p><p>He moved away from Merinus carefully, tucking the blankets around her, touching her hair regretfully. It would never be as easy as she wanted it to be. He could never give her peace, or true safety. Pulling on a pair of shorts, Callan left the bedroom and returned downstairs. The computer was still running, his mail program logging his messages in. He saw he had the reply from Sherra that he had been expecting. She was still with Kane and his family. An army themselves, she assured him. She trusted them. But she didn\u2019t trust Dayan. Callan rubbed his hands over his face. The truth was finally sinking in and he hated it. Sherra was waiting with Kane for a call from him. As Merinus had said, the cells were secured and Kane would know if they were being hacked.</p><p>He had slipped the phone out of his pack earlier. It lay on his desk now. He glanced at it, sighing wearily. Picking up, he keyed a secured number in, watching the indicator at the back. It stayed green, positive for a secure line.</p><p>\u201cMerinus?\u201d The line was answered quickly by a very irate brother.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d Callan wanted this first conversation just between the two of them. \u201cWhere is Sherra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d Kane answered. \u201cTell us where to meet you, Callan. The shit is getting deep now, we have to get you to D.C. fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Sherra first. Then I\u2019ll talk with you.\u201d Callan would know by her voice if the man was to be trusted.</p><p>There was a pause, the sound of a low feminine voice.</p><p>\u201cCallan,\u201d she spoke quietly. \u201cKane isn\u2019t lying to you. We have major problems here.\u201d</p><p>Callan breathed roughly, both in relief and in aggravation. At least she was safe.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dayan?\u201d Callan asked her coldly.</p><p>There was silence.</p><p>\u201cSherra?\u201d he asked her carefully.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s disappeared, Callan. Taber and Tanner are tracking him, but he\u2019s staying just out of reach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Something had, Callan knew, or the others wouldn\u2019t be after him.</p><p>\u201cHe attacked Dawn.\u201d</p><p>Callan was silent, feeling rage work through him, over him. After the horrors Sherra and Dawn had both faced, he had dared to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is she?\u201d he asked her carefully, fighting his fury.</p><p>\u201cBad enough. But she\u2019ll live through it,\u201d Sherra sighed. \u201cWe have her in the safe house with Doc now. He\u2019ll take care of her. Taber and Tanner will take care of Dayan. We have to get you and Merinus to New York. Kane\u2019s setup is as secure as it gets, Callan. He has all the evidence in place, all we have to do is get you to the Senate meetings this week on genetic engineering in D.C.\u201d</p><p>Callan grimaced. He would have to stand before the world and claim he wasn\u2019t quite human, not quite animal. Sickness burned in his stomach. The only thing worse would be what would happen to Merinus if they got hold of her.</p><p>\u201cAre you at the location I gave you?\u201d he asked her, referring to his coded directions in the email he sent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, as are Merinus\u2019 brothers and her father. Tell us what to do, Callan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Kane on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you want to do this, Lyons?\u201d Kane\u2019s voice was set and determined.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an airfield about four miles from you. A small one. Very private and deserted. Have a private plane there at noon tomorrow. Merinus and I will meet with you where you are now, and go to the airport together. When we get there, your pilot will vacate the craft and I\u2019ll fly us to an undisclosed location outside D.C. If I can still trust you that far, then we\u2019ll go ahead with your plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrusting bastard, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Kane bit out.</p><p>\u201cKane, if the Council gets your sister, they will destroy her, painfully. There will be nothing left of her, alive or dead when they are finished. I refuse to take a chance on that. And don\u2019t think the Council isn\u2019t watching you, too. They know about Merinus and they know who she is, and if Dayan has betrayed us, the plans your family has made as well. There\u2019s no safety for us, or for you and your family until this is finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what the Council is, Callan, and I have my own safeguards in place,\u201d Kane assured him. \u201cMy sister is everything to myself and the rest of her family. You can count on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I can. Remember, noon tomorrow.\u201d Callan disconnected, then flipped the phone to the desk.</p><p>He breathed in roughly. Terrified to trust even someone Sherra was backing. He trusted no one but himself and Merinus now. Especially now when the danger was so much closer. He rose to his feet and paced the room slowly. The motel Kane and Sherra were staying in was one of the best and he knew she would have taken precautions in checking in and disguising herself. They would be aware that the Council had been watching them, their soldiers trying to track them. That was no guarantee they had taken enough measures, though. There was no foolproof answer. His muscles bunched with the tension that knowledge sent through him. The roads between here and D.C weren\u2019t any safer. There would be hidden Council operatives all along the line, if there weren\u2019t already. Son of a bitch. He snarled with anger. He could have escaped on his own, but not with Merinus\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCallan?\u201d She stood in the doorway, dressed in his shirt again, concern etched across her face. He breathed out roughly, turning to her, opening his arms for her. She came to him as naturally as breathing. Her arms going around his waist as he held her close to his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cHow do I protect you, Merinus?\u201d he whispered roughly against her hair. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of losing you. Terrified I can\u2019t get you to D.C. safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you do it if I weren\u2019t with you?\u201d she asked him, raising her head to meet his gaze. \u201cI can keep up, Callan. I\u2019m not weak and I\u2019ll try like hell not to slow you down. Do what you would do if you had only yourself to deal with while getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is safety in numbers,\u201d he sighed. \u201cYour family knows this, that\u2019s why they are gathered together for you now. I just hope the Council isn\u2019t willing to risk everything to stop them. A public massacre would only give credence to the proof your brother has and would serve them no purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we need to keep this public,\u201d she said with a frown. \u201cWhy try to sneak to D.C.? I\u2019m certain Kane can arrange a public statement, and then Uncle Brian can arrange an escort to D.C. Why be covert about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014\u201d Callan could go no further.</p><p>He stared down at her, tilting his head, her idea turning over in his head. Why hide? That only gave the</p><p>Council the opportunity to try to take them. He had hid for so long, fought covertly for so long, that he knew nothing else. Knew no other way to fight.</p><p>He grabbed the phone from the desk and hit Kane\u2019s number. The light indicator flashed green.</p><p>\u201cCallan?\u201d Kane\u2019s voice was questioning.</p><p>\u201cDo you have contacts with the television stations around here?\u201d Callan asked him quickly.</p><p>\u201cSeveral are affiliated,\u201d Kane answered him cautiously.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any of the proof you gathered easily accessible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of it.\u201d Once again, the voice was cautious.</p><p>Quickly, Callan outlined the plan forming in his head. The bastards couldn\u2019t touch them if the whole nation was watching their trip to D.C. It would be perfect.</p><p>\u201cThat would work,\u201d Kane told him, his voice edging into excitement. \u201cIt will take a while to set up. I\u2019ll call you back with the details. If you can bring yourself to answer the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer it,\u201d Callan growled. \u201cGet it set up. Have the reporters standing by for the location to meet us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallan, what about the others?\u201d Kane\u2019s voice was guttural now. \u201cSherra, Dawn, and the two men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are three other men,\u201d Callan reminded him.</p><p>\u201cNot for much longer, if I know as much about you as I think I do,\u201d Kane bit out. \u201cWill you reveal them as well?\u201d</p><p>Callan took a deep breath. \u201cThis will be their decision. Have Sherra contact the others. They can stand with me, or I will do all I can to continue to hide them. Whatever they decide.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense silence across the line.</p> <p>\u201cIs Merinus doing okay?\u201d Kane finally asked.</p><p>Callan glanced at Merinus, seeing her worried expression.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. But I want to get off this line before you\u2019re hacked. We\u2019ve talked too long this evening already. Contact me when you have this set up and we\u2019ll give you our location.\u201d</p><p>Callan disconnected the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really going to do this?\u201d Merinus whispered hopefully. \u201cYou\u2019ll really come forward and make them pay?\u201d</p><p>Callan grunted. He had no illusions about this. The Council would never truly pay.</p><p>\u201cI am going to go forward. I will submit to their questions and ultimately their exams, for a while,\u201d he</p><p>promised her. \u201cBut the danger will never be over, Merinus, you must understand this. We\u2019ll have to always be careful, always be within the Pride. Our strength is within our numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if the others don\u2019t come forward?\u201d Merinus asked.</p><p>\u201cThey will.\u201d He knew them all well. They would stand beside him, no matter what. He pulled Merinus into his arms once again, holding onto her, praying for a miracle he didn\u2019t really expect. Peace would be too much to ask for. So he prayed only for her safety with everything in his heart and soul. He prayed just for that.</p><p>Kane disconnected the phone then checked the indicator light carefully. It was still green. He breathed a long, tired sigh, then looked up at the others in the room. Sherra he found immediately. She was sitting in a far corner, lounging in one of the comfortable chairs that the suite afforded. His brothers were watching him expectantly, his father\u2019s face, lined with worry and pain, was confident though.</p><p>\u201cWe set up a news conference. Caleb,\u201d he addressed the second oldest brother. \u201cGet on your line and pull in reporters from D.C. and New York. We want top names down here. I don\u2019t want a shoddy affair.\u201d He turned to Sherra then threw the phone he carried at her. She caught it gracefully, her lithe body never tensing or jerking in surprise. As though she had been expecting it all along. \u201cCall your brothers and Doctor Martin. Get the others here where we\u2019re all together. Callan wants the search for Dayan dropped. He also wants each of you to decide if you\u2019re willing to reveal yourselves, or if you prefer to stay hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we notify our Council contact?\u201d Gray, the youngest brother, and the one that resembled Merinus the most, asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, let it come from their moles in the newspapers and stations.\u201d Kane shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll have enough fish to fry here. My unit is ready to move to provide security and protection to Callan and his family. Now let\u2019s get things moving.\u201d</p><p>The twelve-man group of ex-special forces followed Kane to each job he took, personal or business related. They were at present bunked in each room surrounding the two Kane and his family had taken.</p><p>\u201cHow much trouble do you expect?\u201d John Tyler, Patriarch of the Tyler clan questioned him sternly. Kane breathed out roughly.</p><p>\u201cI expect at least one attempt on them during the news conference,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI want Merinus in armor and all angles accessible to them covered. I\u2019ll have my men take care of that. It could go easy, but I never expect easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council will want them dead if possible. If not, they\u2019ll try damage control instead.\u201d Sherra came to her feet as they turned to face her. \u201cThey won\u2019t expect the proof Kane has on them, so we may all be safer than we think.\u201d</p><p>That was what Kane was praying for. When the shit hit the fan it would smear more than one</p><p>government figure in several countries, as well as a handful of billionaires. Damage control wouldn\u2019t be easy to provide by then.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get everything ready,\u201d John said tensely. \u201cI want this taken care of and I want my daughter home. Get moving.\u201d</p><p>And of course they did. No one ignored John Tyler, or disobeyed him. They got moving. Everyone but Sherra. She had made her call, did her part, and Kane watched her as she moved restlessly around the room. She had been like this all day. Almost nervous, unwilling to stay in one place for long. Not that he expected her tension was the same as his own. Every muscle in his body was tight with arousal, and had been since she had stepped from the shadows the other night. He couldn\u2019t forget the touch of her. The taste of her silken skin, those damned throaty growls she made while he pounded into her body. She liked her sex rough, her teeth to nip, hands to grip. She was no shrinking violet or weak-kneed virgin, even when she had been a virgin. She had been a temptress, a seductress, her body conforming to him, urging him on in heated demand. He wanted to fuck her again so badly he could barely stand it. Feel that hot pussy stretching around him, her cream soaking his cock and balls. Damn her. He hadn\u2019t been this horny since his time at the labs. And that was why she hated him now. She never understood why he was there. And she wouldn\u2019t listen when he tried to tell her why he hadn\u2019t come back for her as he swore he would. Hard to rescue someone when you were half buried in a pit, fertilizing it with your blood. Bastards had known what he was up to somehow and nearly killed him for his efforts. The only thing that saved him was the fact that, at the time, they had no idea who he was. And by the time he healed, he had been forgotten. Only the scientists and lab soldiers had seen his face, and Kane was careful to stay out of any limelight, any public appearances. He had been working on this for ten years and he would, by God, see every bastard behind it destroyed. Just as they had destroyed.</p><p>He looked at Sherra again, pain striking his chest, guilt eating him alive. What had they done to her?</p><p>Callan had rescued her not long after the attempt made on Kane\u2019s life. He had taken her out, saved her, but something else had marked her. It was there in her expression, the careful shift away from him when he got too close, the secrets that swirled in the shadows of those dark green eyes. She no longer trusted him and he couldn\u2019t really blame her. She had waited for him, believed in him, and he had failed. It didn\u2019t matter why.</p><p>\u201cSherra, what did your people say?\u201d He moved closer to her, trying to control his anger as she backed away.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here in a matter of hours. Taber and Tanner were already on their way to Dawn. Dayan slipped away from them.\u201d</p><p>He saw her fists clench. She had been enraged when they learned Taber had barely made it to the other girl in time to save her from the man\u2019s brutal rape.</p><p>\u201cWill they stand with him?\u201d Kane questioned her, knowing that the group would make more of an impact than one man.</p><p>\u201cWe have always stood behind Callan. Just as he has always protected us.\u201d She shot him a feral look. Another cut at him. Before she was finished he would be lying in figurative shreds at her feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I needed to know.\u201d He nodded, rather than trying to spar with her in front of the others. He turned to Caleb. \u201cCaleb, we have a possible group, not just one. Let\u2019s keep the information sketchy but impossible to resist.\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded as he made another call.</p><p>The Tyler men moved about the room performing their various assignments. Sherra watched it all with a half snarl on her lips.</p><p>\u201cChill out, baby, we\u2019ll take care of everything,\u201d he told her softly. Her eyes darkened, her expression tightened with fury.</p><p>\u201cI am not your baby,\u201d she sneered. \u201cSo stop with the cutesy shit, Kane. I know you and I know what you are, so stop trying to suck up to me.\u201d</p><p>Kane felt his control begin to erode. Eight surprised expressions turned to them, watching the byplay carefully. His eyes narrowed on her, his fists clenching at the urge to jerk her into the next room and give her something to fight about.</p><p>\u201cBaby, when I start sucking it won\u2019t be an attempt,\u201d he bit out in disgust, turning away from her. \u201cFuck it, I\u2019ll deal with you later when I have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not deal with me period.\u201d She brushed past him, heading for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d He grabbed her arm as she headed for the exit, swinging her around to face him.</p><p>Fury outlined her body as she looked down at the hand gripping her arm, then looked up at him as though the touch sickened her.</p><p>\u201cTake your hands off me.\u201d Her voice vibrated with anger, but he was damned if he didn\u2019t see need flaring in her eyes as well.</p><p>He jerked her across the room, pushing her roughly back into the chair. When she went to push her way back to her feet, he slammed his hands on the arms of the seat, forcing her back.</p><p>\u201cYou are not going anywhere,\u201d he bit out furiously, watching her face flush now. \u201cYou can sit your ass here or you can run and hide in the bedroom, but you will not leave this suite. Do you fucking understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d His father\u2019s sharp voice protested behind him. For the first time in his life, Kane ignored his father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you hear me, Sherra?\u201d he bit out again, never breaking their stare. Her lips thinned, their little pout almost tempting him to possess them with a strength of a desire nearly tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she literally growled at him, her eyes shooting sparks of fury as she drew back as far as possible from him. \u201cBut your sister is right, you\u2019re an asshole.\u201d</p><p>Kane\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, then he frowned in irritation.</p> <p>\u201cDoes she fucking telling everyone I\u2019m an asshole?\u201d He heard his voice rise in incredulity, then turned to look at his family for an answer.</p><p>They were staring at him with a mixture of surprise and disbelief.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she likes warning the world of the potential,\u201d Sherra sneered. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy to miss.\u201d</p><p>He swung around to her again.</p><p>\u201cKane.\u201d The order in his father\u2019s voice was impossible to deny. \u201cLeave that girl alone, she said she wouldn\u2019t go anywhere. Get the hell out of here and make sure you\u2019re ready so we can all get some rest before morning. Which is only a few more hours away.\u201d</p> <p>John faced him, a scowl on his face as he watched his oldest son with no small amount of confusion.</p><p>\u201cSherra, you leave this room and I swear I\u2019ll hunt you down,\u201d he told her fiercely, staring into her eyes as they widened in shock. \u201cAnd I promise you, you won\u2019t like it much when I find you.\u201d</p><p>She snarled silently, revealing the longer than normal canines at the side of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cBe a good kitty, baby.\u201d He smiled mockingly. He turned and left the room before she had a chance to retaliate, but her furious curse followed him into the hall. He breathed out harshly then, running his hands over his short black hair and stomping to the next room. Dammit. He had no desire to fight with Sherra. He didn\u2019t want her mad. He wanted her hot and horny and begging him. And eventually, he would have it.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>Callan lay beside Merinus smelling her need, her heat. The scent had changed, and he felt his chest tighten with that knowledge. He lay still, not touching her, staring at the darkened ceiling in misery. The</p> <p>\u2018mating frenzy\u2019 was completing its cycle, Merinus was ovulating.</p><p>She tossed against the mattress, still sleeping, despite the arousal beginning to rage within her body. She would awaken soon, and when she did, she would need his passion, his seed. The desperate lusts would ease then, according to Dr. Martin and become more normal, but she would carry his child. That was in the email Callan hadn\u2019t shown her. The conclusions of the tests the scientist had been running had come through late last night. The uncertainty over the pregnancy hormone easing the frenzy was now certain. Despite the earlier indications it wouldn\u2019t, the test samples had finally shown proof that the frenzy was nature\u2019s way of ensuring breeding within the Pride.</p><p>His fist clenched at that knowledge. Equal parts hope and rage surged through his body. Like any man, he dreamed of having a child with the woman who had stolen his heart. A child filled with laughter, with happiness. But could a child of his ever have a life that carefree? A child whose DNA was infected by its father, a child they would call a freak of science?</p><p>Merinus rolled against him, her silken hand found his abdomen. He grimaced at the rising heat in his own body, the pleasure he found in her touch. He could feel his tongue throbbing again, the glands along his tongue enlarging. A fucking aphrodisiac, to ensure the \u2018frenzy\u2019. Nature was having the last laugh on them all. Somehow, she had found something worthy in the Breeds science had created and was determined to keep them around.</p><p>He ignored the burning moisture in his eyes, his hand smoothing over her slender arm, loving the feel of her. The warmth of her. He had found acceptance from her, but he knew she would be terrified when he revealed the truth to her. A truth he was praying was a mistake. But his sense of smell didn\u2019t lie. How he knew what the scent was, he was uncertain, but he knew. It was the smell of rebirth, as light and elusive as spring.</p><p>Merinus moaned low and deep, her hand moving lower, dangerously close to the erection throbbing between his thighs. He was harder than he could ever remember being. Throbbing, desperate to sink inside her, to bury his cock as deeply inside her as possible before spilling his seed.</p><p>\u201cMerinus,\u201d he whispered her name, turning to her, his hand going to her cheek as he awoke her. Her eyes blinked open, a sensual smile shaping her lips as she moved closer to him.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he whispered, holding her still. \u201cWe must talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater.\u201d She rubbed her breasts against his chest, her hard nipples burning his flesh.</p><p>\u201cNo, darling,\u201d he denied her. \u201cWe talk first. You have to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>He saw her frown in the predawn shadows of the room.</p><p>\u201cSo talk. But hurry.\u201d Her leg caressed his as she moved against him, her breathing becoming deep, laborious.</p><p>\u201cMerinus, if I take you, you\u2019ll conceive tonight.\u201d He stared down at her intently, watching her eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him nervously. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but he smelled her growing hotter. The spicy scent was an aphrodisiac all its own.</p><p>As though the thought of carrying his child wasn\u2019t as abhorrent as it should be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain, Merinus.\u201d He allowed his hand to smooth over her cheek, his thumb to trace her lips. \u201cThe need you\u2019re feeling will only grow worse, more painful without my sperm coming inside you. But you must know what will happen when it does. I cannot stop it, Merinus. I cannot protect you from this.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to howl with his rage, his pain for what he was putting her through.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t to blame, Callan.\u201d Her smile trembled, her eyes glistened with tears. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>Her lack of anger towards him cracked his soul. How could she be so accepting, so loving to a man who had all but destroyed her life?</p><p>\u201cI love you, Merinus. I want you to know this now,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou are my soul and you are my life. I could not survive without you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d A tear fell from her eye. \u201cI know Callan, because it\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p><p>He laid his forehead against hers, breathing roughly, staring down at her as he fought to come to grips with what this night would bring. A child. He had never thought to know that joy, that fear.</p><p>\u201cI will protect you and our babe as best I can,\u201d he told her roughly. \u201cWith my life, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>Her hand was shaking as it moved to cup his cheek. He could feel her fear now, her uncertainty. Suddenly the complications were growing with each second. It was no longer just their lives at risk, but the life of an innocent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really bad this time.\u201d She breathed in hard as her body shuddered with the heat. \u201cI\u2019m scared, Callan.\u201d</p><p>He moved her to her back, looming over her, wishing there was some way to take her fears from her.</p><p>\u201cWe will make it okay, love,\u201d he swore to her, though he had no idea how. \u201cSomehow, someway, we will keep our child safe.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his head, his lips whispering over hers as he fought the need to plunge his tongue deep into her mouth. To possess her in every way, to make her take the hormone that would drive her need higher, make her body burn, make her release tear through her body and drive her quicker to fertility. Dr. Martin had been certain that this was the reason for the hormone. All tests when combined together fused to produce a single result. A child.</p><p>Wanting this night to be remembered, not just for the fear of conception, but for the beauty of their pleasure, Callan began to tease her lips. He didn\u2019t want to tempt with the crazed needs of long love play. He didn\u2019t want her mindless. He wanted to pleasure her, love her. His kissed her gently with only his lips, sipping at hers; staring into her wide eyes as his hands caressed her swollen breasts, her hard nipples. Then his tongue brushed her lips, slipped inside and allowed the effects of science and nature to begin. She accepted the invasion, her eyes closing with a groan as the taste of spice filled both their mouths. It would begin now. And he feared where it would end. But he didn\u2019t stop kissing her. He couldn\u2019t. He wanted the contact to last, to linger forever in his mind. That when he gave her his child, he loved her, worshipped her.</p><p>Within minutes their breathing increased, perspiration coated their bodies, lust rippled through them. Callan groaned as his hand lowered, testing the rich cream that prepared her for him. She was slick and hot, ready for him. He moved between her spread thighs, lowering himself against her, positioning his erection for the first hard thrust. He knew what she liked, and he would be certain that every stroke was made to gain her ultimate pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Merinus,\u201d he groaned against her lips as he thrust deep and hard inside her.</p><p>Merinus felt the shock of his entrance, the sudden stretching of her vagina, the pleasure/pain that drove all other thoughts from her head. Heat seared her body, spasmed her womb. Her muscles clenched on his cock as he whispered his words of love against her lips. She climaxed on the second stroke, but still the heat built. She bucked against him, her hips thrusting her cunt harder against the invading erection that pumped hard and fast inside her. Callan was moaning, his head lowering to her breasts, his rough tongue licking at her nipples as his mouth suckled each in turn. His cock kept a smooth, hard rhythm as he thrust in and out of her. Each stroke stretched her, filled her. Her head tossed, her body shuddered.</p><p>Then he was moving faster, harder. His mouth went to her neck, to the little wound that never seemed to heal, his teeth locking on it, his tongue stroking as she began to feel the final phase of his possession. The hardening of the barb that would lock him inside her seconds before his ejaculation. The firm, stiff flesh that would allow no withdrawal and would ensure the conception that nature intended. She cried out as the firm thumb began to stiffen, raking her flesh erotically as he began to pound inside her mercilessly. She could feel the heat building in her stomach, knotting her muscles. Her vagina clamped down on his cock, milking it, demanding his release as she felt a harder, stronger orgasm building inside her own body. Her nails bit into his back as the deep strokes had her crying out for ease. He was growling low, her cries echoed through the room The barb lengthened then, and on the last hard stroke locked into her sensitive flesh and sent her into an explosion so hard, so deep she screamed out his name as she felt his seed erupt inside her.</p><p>His arms trembled beneath her shoulders as he gasped for breath. Merinus lay there, trying to catch her breath and frowned. Heated moisture dripped against her shoulder. Not much, a few fragile drops. She felt tears build in her eyes, her arms tightened about him, and she wished she knew what to say, knew some way to ease the pain inside this strong man.</p><p>\u201cYou humble me,\u201d he whispered, his face hidden in her neck, his voice husky. \u201cYou amaze me, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do I do this?\u201d she asked him gently, her hands threading through the tawny strands of his hair. He shook his head. \u201cYour love. Your acceptance.\u201d</p><p>His voice strengthened, the hoarseness of his emotion leaving it slowly. He shook his head, took a hard breath and lifted himself from her. She felt him ease his cock from her body and sighed in regret. She would keep him there forever if she could.</p><p>He moved away from her, sitting on the side of the bed, gazing into the dim light of the room as morning slowly made its way toward them. She watched him, seeing the strength in his body, the way he straightened his shoulders, ready to face the new battle coming their way as surely as daylight was edging through the sky.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be easy.\u201d He stared toward the window and the thick curtains covering it. \u201cI can\u2019t make any promises, other than I\u2019ll always love you. I won\u2019t leave you. I\u2019ll do what I can to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could ask more of you, Callan,\u201d she told him, her voice soft. \u201cI don\u2019t expect more of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should.\u201d He breathed roughly, dragging his fingers through his hair. \u201cYou should have run from me screaming when you first realized you desired me, Merinus.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, remembering the day she had watched him masturbate on his back deck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that was possible,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI was too busy admiring your gorgeous body.\u201d</p> <p>He flashed her a quick, embarrassed look, then frowned at her sternly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being serious,\u201d he chided her.</p><p>\u201cSo am I, Callan.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not weak, nor am I so timid I can\u2019t face whatever life throws at me. We\u2019re together for a reason. We\u2019ll face whatever life brings us as best we can.\u201d</p><p>She sat up, curling her legs beneath her as she leaned against his shoulder, staring up at him as he stared back at her. She let her lips caress his muscular shoulder, her hand smoothing over his back. Callan took a deep breath. \u201cI never expected you.\u201d He shook his head with an edge of amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou are a dangerous woman, Merinus Tyler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw, just a determined woman.\u201d She grinned against his shoulder. \u201cI know a good thing when I see it jacking off.\u201d</p><p>He flushed. Shooting her a look of mingled confusion and exasperation, he shook his head as he turned and pulled her into his arms. He held her tight against his body, relishing her warmth, the way she relaxed against him, looked up at him so trustingly.</p><p>\u201cWe should shower and begin to prepare for what\u2019s ahead of us,\u201d he told her softly, thinking of the news conference to come, the days ahead that would be filled with endless tests, questions and danger. He prayed Merinus\u2019 brother knew what the hell he was doing, because if anything happened to her, then Callan knew his rage would be satisfied with nothing less than blood.</p><p>\u201cYou never did return the favor as you promised,\u201d he reminded her, his brow arching suggestively.</p><p>\u201cWhen we come together again, you will have to make this up to me.\u201d</p><p>Merinus flushed then. She felt the heat along her cheeks, but a flame of desire between her thighs. That tingle of lust reminded her, though of the possible conception this night may have wrought. She couldn\u2019t say she was comfortable with the idea of it happening so soon. She would have preferred to wait, to know they were reasonably safe before bringing a child into the lives they would share for the first few years.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do you for ya, sugar,\u201d she drawled, imitating the slow southern drawl she had finally grown accustomed to hearing.</p><p>\u201cWell, you just do that, fine thing,\u201d he mocked her, and Merinus had to admit he sounded a hell of a lot more authentic than she did.</p><p>They were silent then. Holding each other, watching the light slowly filter into the room as the day eased ahead.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let go of tonight,\u201d she finally whispered regretfully. \u201cI wish we could just stay like this, forever.\u201d</p><p>Callan sighed slowly, his hands smoothing over her shoulders, her back. He kissed her forehead, a soft caress of regret and longing.</p><p>\u201cCome on, we\u2019ll shower and get breakfast. Then I need to contact the others. It will be over soon, Merinus. Then perhaps we can make a life for ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Merinus swallowed tightly, battling her fears and her regrets. She hadn\u2019t had enough time with him. The time she needed to store her memories in case the worst should happen. She wasn\u2019t a fool; she knew the danger that lay ahead of them. She had known the dangers that faced Callan from the beginning. He rose from the bed, pulling her up beside him as he kissed the top of her head once again.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and shower, I\u2019ll use the other one or I won\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you.\u201d He pushed her towards the bathroom. \u201cGo. I\u2019ll start breakfast when you come down.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I beat you?\u201d she asked him archly.</p><p>He gave her a look that clearly doubted that was possible. Merinus narrowed her eyes at him. She would show him. She shrugged rather than saying anything and went on into the bathroom, followed by his indulgent male chuckle.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>She beat him. Merinus snickered as she scampered past the spare bathroom, hearing Callan still involved in his shower. He must have been delayed getting in, which meant he had been up to something before he started. She frowned. He was going to have to learn to be a little more forthcoming than she had a feeling he was.</p><p>Dressed in a pair of sweat pants and one of his big shirts she headed for the kitchen. She could at least get breakfast on. She was starved, and morning was starting to shine brightly outside the heavy curtains that covered all the windows.</p><p>A second of panic filled her at the thought of the coming day. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, letting Callan stand before the world to announce who and what he was. She knew how he treasured the solitude of his life, the peace he found when he wasn\u2019t being hunted. He would never know that again. She flipped the light on as she entered the kitchen to dispel the deep shadows of the room, then came to an abrupt halt. Her heart jumped in fear at the man standing before her. But what terrified her most was the gun aimed at her stomach, and burning rage that seemed to flicker with dark flames in his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cI knew he would bring you here,\u201d Dayan smirked, his handsome face twisted with horrific fury as he approached her. \u201cHe thinks no one knows about this place, but I did. I know he comes here to hide, and I knew he would bring you here.\u201d</p><p>Merinus watched him approach, backing away from him until they entered the connecting living room, praying she could get him into a position where Callan could jump him when he came downstairs.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to die, cunt?\u201d he sneered.</p><p>She shook her head desperately, watching the gun nervously.</p><p>\u201cAre you breeding yet? Gut wounds hurt real bad whore, and they would kill the abomination you\u2019re likely carrying by now.\u201d</p><p>Merinus covered her stomach with her hands, an instinctive reaction she wasn\u2019t able to halt as his eyes followed the action knowingly.</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Dayan. Callan will kill you for it.\u201d</p><p>Dayan sneered. \u201cMy dear, Callan is going to die as well. I won\u2019t let him destroy everything I\u2019ve worked for since we escaped those labs.\u201d</p><p>Merinus swallowed tightly. She could feel fear drumming through her veins in time to the harsh beat of her heart. Her chest tightened as she fought to breathe past her panic, to find a way to think clearly and help Callan. God, this would kill him. Dayan was his family.</p><p>\u201cCallan risked his life to save you, to keep you and the others hidden,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHow could you betray him like this?\u201d</p><p>Merinus couldn\u2019t understand the depth of evil that it took for Dayan to do this.</p><p>\u201cBecause he betrayed us.\u201d Dayan\u2019s voice rose in fury, and he wasn\u2019t even aware of it. Merinus prayed Callan heard it. \u201cHe\u2019s going public, and the others will follow him like the mindless children they still are.</p><p>Like he\u2019s King. Like he is the last word. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. I told that stupid bitch Maria and she wouldn\u2019t listen. So she had to die for it. She almost convinced him last year. I won\u2019t let him do it. I won\u2019t let him destroy everything like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suggest he do then, Dayan? The Council won\u2019t stop.\u201d She edged around the room, moving carefully beside the dubious protection of a chair. If only she could protect her stomach, protect the child that may or not be forming even now.</p><p>\u201cHe should have gone back for us,\u201d Dayan raged. \u201cI could have led the Pride. It was my right. I suffered the most for them. I should have led and he should have let them capture him.\u201d</p><p>The furious words made Merinus sick. She remembered the reports she had read of the labs. The barbaric tests, the training to condition Callan to kill, to be no more than a disposable weapon. The women that were brought to him to breed, then killed when he refused. The horrendous pain he suffered in their punishments when he refused their orders. Only a twisted, evil mind could even consider that he should have gone back. Only a monster could have killed the woman who helped raise him for trying to secure their safety, such as Dayan had done to Maria.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t strong enough to lead, evidently,\u201d Merinus bit out. \u201cOnly an animal would have suggested he do such a thing. How did they create you, Dayan? How did they manage to finally succeed in the creature they were after? Perhaps Callan should have sent you back.\u201d</p><p>Pain and fury vibrated through her body. Callan had nearly given his life countless times for this bastard, only to have him turn on him, betray and deceive him.</p><p>\u201cOh, they succeeded beyond their wildest imaginations,\u201d Dayan laughed. \u201cOnly, they have no idea how well they did succeed. I\u2019m their dream child, Merinus, and once the Pride is under my control, Sherra and Dawn breeding my cubs, then I\u2019ll let them know. They will agree to my every demand in exchange for the services I can provide for them.\u201d</p><p>Merinus stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cDayan, what makes you think you can do this? The breeding isn\u2019t voluntary; you know that from Callan and me. It\u2019s hormonal. If Dawn or Sherra were your mates, you would know it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, a maniacal smile crossing his face. \u201cSee, I know something you don\u2019t. The women don\u2019t go into heat like you did, Merinus. They don\u2019t mate like Callan mated you. When they ovulate any bastard can breed them, your brother and Sherra proved that.\u201d</p><p>Merinus blinked. \u201cWhat the hell does my brother have to do with this? Which brother? Dammit, I have seven of them and every one of them will skin your ass alive and tack your hide on their wall for a trophy if you don\u2019t stop this shit. That is if Callan leaves anything left of you.\u201d</p><p>He smirked at her, the gun never wavering.</p><p>\u201cBrother Kane was a soldier at the labs, Merinus. He was chosen to rape her when she went into heat the first time, and he did an admirable job. Even planted a cub inside her. I, of course, had to rid her of it. I can\u2019t tolerate another man\u2019s offspring within my Pride.\u201d</p><p>Merinus wavered in shock. She felt her knees go weak.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d she gasped. \u201cKane wouldn\u2019t do that. He would never hurt an innocent woman.\u201d</p><p>Dayan shook his head in pity.</p><p>\u201cBut he did Merinus. Didn\u2019t you ever wonder how Kane knew about a supposedly Top Secret experiment before your father received Maria\u2019s box of evidence? How he knew when everyone associated with that lab was dead? He survived my attack somehow. Survived my rage. But he\u2019ll pay for it soon enough, for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d She believed Kane might have been there, but not for the reasons Dayan said, and sure as hell wouldn\u2019t believe he had raped anyone. She knew her brother too well for that. He frowned at her darkly. \u201cI have no reason to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have every reason to lie,\u201d she told him angrily. \u201cYou\u2019re a traitor to your own people, Dayan, there\u2019s no honor in you. You couldn\u2019t be trusted to give the weather accurately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a smart mouth, bitch,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIf I weren\u2019t already determined to kill you, I\u2019d kill you for that alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a fucking prick with some real faulty illusions of grandeur.\u201d She glimpsed Callan\u2019s shadow moving slowly along the steps from the corner of her eye. \u201cThe others will take you apart themselves. You won\u2019t be able to hide the scent of Callan\u2019s blood on your hands. Their senses will pick it up, Dayan. They\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>She saw the glimmer of uncertainty enter his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t know,\u201d he bit out, but his protest wasn\u2019t as strong as it should have been.</p><p>\u201cThey can smell blood. They know the scent of their own, their DNA ensures it. Do you think you can wash away the scent of their deaths from your body? Do you really think they won\u2019t know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly Sherra and Dawn will be left.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Taber and Tanner myself.\u201d</p><p>Merinus laughed at him, shaking her head as Callan moved closer. She had to keep his attention on her.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get within a mile of any of them,\u201d she told him mockingly. \u201cThey\u2019re smarter than you are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallan wasn\u2019t,\u201d he denied. \u201cI caught his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d she asked, jerking back, falling to the floor as Callan\u2019s roar sounded through the room. She scrambled around the chair as she heard the scream that erupted from Dayan\u2019s throat. The gun went flying when Callan tackled him. Merinus grimaced as it flew in the opposite direction of the chair. Breathing roughly, watching the struggling men carefully, she began to crawl around the room. Feral growls filled the room, crashing furniture, flying fists. Dayan was like a savage animal, but Callan more so. With feet kicking out, fists hammering into flesh, the two men fought around the room, vying for supremacy. As Merinus reached the gun, she heard a scream of resounding pain that sent a chill down her back.</p><p>Callan had managed to tackle Dayan, maneuvering the other man in front of him, his arms locked around his neck. As Merinus\u2019 eyes widened in horror, Callan gave a final, savage wrench. The sound of the other man\u2019s neck breaking had bile rising from her stomach. Dayan\u2019s eyes were wide with surprise and defeat, horror washed over his dying expression as Callan allowed him to drop slowly to the floor. Merinus raised shocked eyes to her lover. He stared at her, his expression cold, brutal. He never blinked, he offered no apology, but she saw the misery and grief in the glitter of unshed tears in his eyes. He was covered in blood. His bare chest marked with the scratches of Dayan\u2019s longer, sharper nails. He wore only a pair of blood splattered sweat shorts. His feet were bare, his legs marred with ugly cuts and bruises, splayed apart, the muscles still tight, taut with the danger that pulsed in his body. Merinus was breathing harshly, her heart pounding in her chest, her hands clutching the forgotten gun.</p><p>\u201cFuck, you need another shower now,\u201d she whispered as she swallowed tightly, then grimaced at the inane comment. \u201cOh God, Callan\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hand went over her mouth as she fought the sickness rising in her throat. Dayan stared at her, his eyes vacant, wide in that last second of horror as he stared at her. She dropped the gun, her body shaking so hard she could feel her bones trying to rattle.</p><p>\u201cMerinus.\u201d Suddenly he was kneeling beside her, not touching her, his voice broken with his grief, his regret. \u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head desperately, fighting her tears.</p><p>\u201cOh God, how do I help you?\u201d She turned to him, heedless of the blood that marred his body. His blood and Dayan\u2019s.</p><p>His arms came around her hesitantly as she threw herself in his arms.</p><p>\u201cHelp me?\u201d he whispered, his voice rough as he touched her hair, her back, as though frightened to embrace her. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, Merinus. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against his chest, the tears finally falling from her eyes, humiliating her with her weakness in the face of danger. She was such a wimp, she thought. He had saved both their lives, scarred his soul with the necessity of taking his brother\u2019s life, and she needed his comfort. She should be comforting him instead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she gasped through her tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so weak, Callan. I\u2019m so weak.\u201d</p><p>She clutched at his shoulders, too weak to stand, fear still echoing through her system, the horror of the violence quaking through her system. As Callan tightened his arms around her, the sharp sound of the front door splintering tore them apart.</p><p>Merinus screamed as the door flew inward. Callan shoved her towards the chair, his sharp order lost amid his growl of rage as he dove for the gun Merinus had dropped.</p><p>\u201cMerinus. Callan.\u201d The harsh voice of her brother had her swinging around in time to watch Callan come up in a lithe, graceful move to his knees, the pistol gripped in both hands, his face a mask of rage.</p><p>\u201cCallan.\u201d She fell toward him; terrified he wouldn\u2019t stop in time. He was ahead of her. The gun went up, his finger falling quickly back from the trigger. Dazed, breathing hard from shock and reaction she watched the way he crouched as the room began to fill with the presence of others. Her brothers and father, even her uncle, Senator Samuel Tyler was there, along with the vaguely familiar near dozen men who followed Kane. Taber and Tanner, Sherra and Dawn and Dr. Martin brought up the rear. Everyone but the Senator and the good scientists were armed to the gills, weapons showing, bodies taut and ready.</p><p>\u201cGod. Talk about fucking testosterone overload,\u201d Merinus groaned as she collapsed on her ass, staring around as her brothers and Kane\u2019s military group swept through the room, upstairs, making certain of security, she assumed. Shit, she didn\u2019t know what the hell those black clad strangers with hard cold eyes were doing, let alone her brothers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch her.\u201d Suddenly Callan turned furious, feral eyes on whoever had dared to move behind her.</p><p>Merinus glanced up in time to see Kane raise his hands and step away quietly. Callan moved across the space of only a few feet and jerked Merinus in his arms. His body was blazing with heat, his muscles tight with tension.</p> <p>\u201cGive him a few minutes to cool off.\u201d Dr. Martin moved among the men commandingly. \u201cGet away from them. Get Dayan\u2019s body to another room away from him now. Let him settle down or he\u2019ll never find his control.\u201d</p><p>Merinus looked back at Callan. His face was flushed, his eyes closed as he held her close.</p><p>\u201cCallan?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI could have lost you,\u201d he answered, his voice ragged, harsh. \u201cIf it had been Council soldiers, if it had been anyone else, I would have lost you.\u201d</p><p>His hold tightened as he fought for breath. \u201cGod help me, Merinus, I can\u2019t lose you.\u201d</p><p>Merinus breathed out deeply. She struggled to turn in his arms, finally succeeding as he loosened his grip only marginally. Her arms went around his shoulders, her head cushioned on his heaving chest. Around them, people moved, spoke, asked questions and demanded answers.</p><p>\u201cHow were we found?\u201d Callan suddenly jerked his head up, his eyes blazing in suspicion as he looked at those around them.</p><p>\u201cKane had a tracker on Merinus\u2019 cell,\u201d Sherra answered him coolly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know, Callan, until this morning when he tried to call and his readout indicated the phone had been destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Vaguely, Merinus remembered seeing the broken remnants of the phone on Callan\u2019s desk. Dayan must have destroyed it, thinking he would keep them from calling for help. Callan had no phones in the house. No way to track any communications he made.</p><p>Callan took a deep, steadying breath. Merinus felt his control slowly reassert itself. His body relaxed marginally.</p><p>\u201cCallan, you need to get cleaned up.\u201d Kane stood several feet from them, staring down at them broodingly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to call the police in on this one, do some damage control. Uncle Sam,\u201d he nodded to the Senator, \u201ccame out here on the midnight flight to personally escort you back to the Senate hearings on genetic altering and DNA engineering. We have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>Callan rose slowly to his feet. His arm wrapped around Merinus, refusing to let her go.</p><p>\u201cMerinus can stay here with us,\u201d Kane told him forcefully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Merinus didn\u2019t trust the cold smile Callan sent her brother. \u201cMerinus stays with me, Kane. Period. You can talk to her after we both clean up.\u201d</p><p>Merinus rose to her feet alongside Callan, watching the two men stare each other down, both intent on having his way. They were like two pit bulls getting ready to fight over the same bone, but for different reasons. Kane wanted to hoard her, keep her a child, his innocent sister forever. Callan wanted the woman he had made and he was damned determined to keep her. Kane opened his mouth to speak. Merinus knew whatever came out of it would only make the situation worse.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start, asshole,\u201d she bit out, seeing the mockery that flashed across his eyes, an indication that something stupid was getting ready to come out of his mouth. He flashed her a dark look. Merinus took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI need another shower, anyway, and so does Callan. Do whatever you guys have to do to get things ready to go. I can\u2019t deal with it right now.\u201d</p><p>Her mind was too dazed, shock and fear and fury still running through her veins. Adrenaline overload was turning into a bitch.</p><p>\u201cAt least try to hurry.\u201d Kane raked his fingers though his short hair, impatience tightening his body. \u201cWe have to get a story together and get things started here, Merinus. I need you for that.\u201d</p><p>He speared her with a commanding look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait,\u201d she told him, accepting the arm Callan wrapped around her as her legs trembled beneath her. \u201cI can\u2019t right now, Kane. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of the concerned, worried looks on the faces of her family. She should have been more eager to reassure them then she was to find a moment alone with Callan, to soothe the beast that still fought for release.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Callan turned without addressing the other man again and drew her from the room. When they reached the stairs, he didn\u2019t make her climb them herself. He picked her up in his arms and carried her to the big bathroom off their bedroom. He didn\u2019t speak, his expression didn\u2019t soften. But he was hard. His cock was like a poker, steely and hot against her hip. His eyes blazed with lust. He locked the bedroom door behind them, then with a simple jerk at her pants, bared her from the waist down.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201d He backed her up to the wall, lifting her, pushing her pants free with one foot. He spread her legs then plunged his cock deep. Merinus gasped, unaware how ready she had been for him. Her vagina clasped his erection with a hot, slick grip as tight as a fist as he buried himself inside her. Her head fell back against the wall, her hands gripping his scratched bloody shoulders as he bent, buried his head in her neck and began to pound into her. He was groaning with hoarse pleasure with each thrust. His erection was hard, scalding hot, driving her into a passion as natural and as deep as love itself. Heat and fire seared her body, pleasure rushed over her in a tidal wave of sensation, sweeping away any doubt, any residual fears left in her. His hands gripped her hips, her thighs clasped his and his cock buried itself over and over inside her. Stretching her, he filled her, burned her with his need. This was no hormonal demand, no kiss to encourage the heat, no preliminaries, just hard, honest passion. His teeth bit at her neck in the place he had marked as his own. His rough tongue stroked her. Callan grunted harshly as Merinus\u2019 moans rose in intensity. She could feel her climax building, gathering inside her, the explosion only moments away.</p><p>Fighting for breath Callan increased the pace of his thrusts. Wet flesh slapped together, her cunt made suckling sounds as his cock slid easily inside her over and over again. Then she trembled, shook, she fought her scream, and managed to keep it down to a loud cry when she felt the barb emerge, lengthen, harden until it locked him deep inside her. That hot caress sent her careening over the edge. Her orgasm struck hard and deep, tightening her body as she felt him spurting his release inside her, distantly wincing as his satisfied roar echoed around them. Boy, Kane would definitely have problems with this.</p><p>Below, Callan\u2019s sexual roar was clearly heard. Sherra grimaced as eight men flushed with anger, glancing at the stairs, their bodies stiffening with outrage.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a child,\u201d she informed them all. \u201cYou may as well get used to it now.\u201d</p><p>John Tyler turned to her with a fierce frown.</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, that is my child,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cNo sir, right now she\u2019s Callan\u2019s mate,\u201d she argued tightly. \u201cHer life was nearly lost and his DNA demands he reassert his claim. Get used to it, get over it before he gets down here, because if all of you crowd him, with your male pride all upset, you will merely force his instincts to the forefront. He\u2019s just claimed her, let him get used to that before he has to deal with your possessiveness.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sherra ignored Kane\u2019s sneer.

Four hours till the press shows, we have plenty of work to do.\u201d</p> <p>EPILOGUE</p><p>\u201cWayne Dubrow, reporting from Washington at the Senate hearings on DNA engineering and research. Callan Lyons, the alleged Breed, created by a group of scientists working in genetic reengineering appeared before the Senate committee this afternoon on genetic research. Accompanying him is his fianc\u00e9, Merinus Tyler, daughter of John Tyler of the National Forum. Also accompanying him are a dozen doctors, scientists and DNA specialists brought in weeks before to verify his claim. Mr. Lyons, and four other members of his family, also experiments in these horrific tests, gave their stirring testimony before members of the Senate and the press.\u201d</p><p>The reporter stood stately, somberly before the Senate Building, his voice rough, emotionally charged as he detailed the testimonies given, especially those of the two young women. The world was held spellbound by the beauty of the quiet blonde, the shy, fearful frailty of the golden brunette. But it was the men, their faces perfection in male curves and angles that struck them with the truth of the story being told.</p><p>Callan Lyons, the head of the family, proud and striking, his amber eyes direct and straightforward as he informed the Senators and various lawmakers of the horrors he had endured. The deaths, the cruelties, the identities of mercenaries, soldiers, billionaire, political and public figures involved. Those political figures were noticeably absent from the hearings.</p><p>Scientists spoke, among them, Dr. Martin, the DNA specialist who had treated each member since birth and followed after their daring escape and the death of his own family. The Tyler\u2019s weren\u2019t unarmed themselves. Years of research and evidence had been gathered. No stone left unturned. The story was horrific, moving, garnering international sympathy and support for the proud members who had fought their lives for peace.</p> <p>Deep in the African jungle, a satellite link pulling in the story, a couple sat silently watching. The male, an older version of Callan by several years, was quiet, tense. The woman, a small dark haired doctor wept silently. Their story was being told. This male, Callan Lyons, had been victorious where they had not. They clasped hands, and the male, Leo Vanderale, knew that they would be making their own journey soon, and with them would go the son they had borne thirty years before. Perhaps their son would finally be free of the past then, and the danger they had hidden from him for so long.</p><p>Deep in the mountains of Mexico a different scenario was taking place. Mexican and U.S. agents were swarming a hidden lab, fire erupted as scientists attempted to destroy evidence and lives as they were overtaken. Babies cried, their mewling sounds both human and animal, adult members of the experiments snatched their children in the commotion and ran for cover. Fighting their way through smoke and ash to avoid the agents attempting to round them up, the soldiers attempting to kill them. Hard gray eyes surveyed the scene as half a dozen men and women, and four children escaped the mass destruction. He followed them quickly, his Pack could hide for as long as needed. He would be damned if he would let them be rounded up like animals.</p><p>General Morris Goveny stood over the still form of his security officer. Agents covered him, guns trained on him, the hard eyes of Mexican and American officials condemning him. He was the pride of the Genetics Council, his lab supposedly the most secret, the wolf hybrids they had bred the most exceptional specimens yet. And it was all falling down around his ears. His security officer had been shot by the bastards storming the labs, his head doctor had deserted the labs at the first round of gunfire. The General considered himself much smarter. He raised his hands above his shoulders, staring back at the condemning expressions of those who had come for him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re animals. Tools and nothing more,\u201d he muttered as the television droned behind him, the reporter listing the traits of what he called Human Genetic Hybrids. \u201cThey aren\u2019t human. Not really.\u201d</p><p>Not humans, animals, created to serve, to obey dictates of their masters. His eyes narrowed on the bank of monitors by the television as he glimpsed the jeeps racing from the compound. Of course, they had escaped. His creations, his pets. For the moment he was defeated, but he swore the day would come when they would pay.</p><p>\u201cGeneral Goveny, you are under arrest.\u201d A tall American official stepped forward decisively. Goveny\u2019s lips twisted as he sneered at the censure he glimpsed in the other man\u2019s gaze.</p> <p>\u201cYou will learn, they are not society\u2019s pets,\u201d he bit out. \u201cThey are animals. Savage, inhuman. They must be trained, confined...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, Sir, will be the one confined.\u201d Cuffs snapped over his wrists. \u201cDue to your criminal disregard and insane orders, the Labs are destroyed, as well as everyone in them. Your breeds are dead, but I promise you, you\u2019ll pay for the crime of their birth.\u201d</p><p>He hid his smile. He hid his plans. They weren\u2019t dead. But he promised himself that they would soon wish they were. </p> </body></html>"]
