Ylito and Hannever stood above Victoria\u2019s head, frozen and watchful. She knew from the pattern on the stone walls behind them that she was in the Consilium, the secret, subterranean space belonging to the Venators. The vampire hunters\u2014of which she was the leader.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Her head felt soupy and her eyelids heavy, and suddenly she remembered. \u201cBeauregard!\u201d</p><p>As memory sliced through the fuzziness, she tried to pull up, but her ankles and one of her wrists were caught fast. Someone\u2019s\u2014Max\u2019s\u2014fingers tightened around her left arm, keeping it pinned onto the bed beneath her, and before she could react with the anger and confusion erupting inside her, a splash of water caught her over the face.</p><p>The cold seeped down into her hair and over the warm skin of her neck, and she jerked beneath her restraints. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she said, glaring up at Ylito, who\u2019d tipped the vial over her face. She raised her free arm, near Sebastian, to brush some of the water from her eye.</p><p>No one answered . . . yet, something in the room had changed. Eased. Sebastian glanced at Wayren, who was looking at Ylito over Victoria.</p><p>\u201cIs it possible?\u201d asked the ringlet-haired man.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how it can be, Ylito,\u201d Wayren replied.</p><p>The tightness in her dear friend\u2019s face had softened, and her countenance had taken on more of that serene look Victoria was used to seeing.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>And then the recognition of a searing pain in her neck, and the memory flash of shadows and blood and long, sleek fangs brought it all back to her. Beauregard . . . she\u2019d been with Beauregard, the master vampire . . . his cold and warm mouth on hers, his teeth sliding into her flesh . . . the brush of skin against skin . . . the rusty taste of blood . . . on her lips. Pooling, rich and heavy, on her tongue. Filling her throat. His hands, smooth and sure . . . everywhere. . . .</p><p>He\u2019d bitten her, fed on her. Had she drunk his blood? Oh . . . God . . .</p><p>Her heart was racing now, and she wanted to struggle, to whip off Max\u2019s firm hold on her arm, to sit up and demand to know what had happened. But the others were talking, above her, around her, as if she wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p>For a moment, Victoria was afraid to know.</p><p>And then, Wayren was touching her, smoothing her hands down over Victoria\u2019s face, her wounded throat. Light and warm and sure, the pressure was soothing, spreading relief through her body. As she touched her, Wayren hummed a chantlike prayer deep in the back of her throat, and Victoria felt the vibrations coming through Wayren\u2019s fingertips, rippling through her body.</p><p>\u201cThe two vis bullae.\u201d Max\u2019s quiet voice broke into the charged silence. He stepped back, releasing Victoria\u2019s wrist and, she noticed for the first time, the stake that rested on the table next to him.</p><p>Dear God, he\u2019d been ready to stake her. She understood in an instant: they\u2019d feared Beauregard had turned her.</p><p>Her mouth dried and she swiveled her face to look toward him, but Max was looking intently at Wayren. \u201cShe wears two of them, does she not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>And then she realized what had happened, even as they discussed the situation above her head, above her prone body: it was only because of the two holy strength amulets that she wore, the badges of her Venator calling to hunt vampires, that she\u2019d been saved from becoming one of the very undead that she vowed to destroy.</p><p>A chill wave rushed over her and Victoria closed her eyes, the conversation around her becoming a distorted buzz. When she looked again, she found herself caught by Sebastian\u2019s dark amber gaze. He was looking down at her, a frozen expression on his handsome face.</p><p>It took her a moment to remember what had happened, and for the anger at his betrayal to bubble up inside her aching body: he\u2019d stolen from the Consilium, from the Venators.</p> <p>Her sometime lover, sometime enemy had deceived her in even more ways than she had expected.</p><p>He was a Venator. Born of the Gardella family tree.</p><p>A Venator who had disdained his calling for years because of loyalty to his great-great-great-grandfather, Beauregard. One of the most powerful of vampires.</p><p>Her fury abated slightly as another scrap of memory slipped into place: Sebastian, thrusting himself between her and Beauregard, shouting at her to leave, even as she shoved a stake meant for Beauregard into Sebastian\u2019s shoulder . . . and the blood, blood that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. . . . She saw the crusty bloom even now on his sweat-stained shirt.</p><p>And then another memory consumed her. A dark, liquid one, of heavy, deep pleasure . . . lush shadows and dangerous pleasure and heat . . . hands, and lips, and tongue . . . And Sebastian, again, his face pale and desperate, pleading with Beauregard for her release.</p><p>And her own laugh, welling up from deep inside her, husky and low. Derisive. Dismissive.</p><p>And then the handsome face of Sebastian\u2019s grandfather bending to hers, his fangs sleek and lethal, his lips warm and cold.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Beauregard?\u201d she said suddenly, her voice commanding their attention. She sat up and the room hardly dipped at all.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d Max said flatly, his face still in shadow.</p><p>A modicum of relief seeped through her body, and she looked at Sebastian. From the expression on his face, she realized he\u2019d done the impossible: he\u2019d killed the six-hundred-year-old vampire who had been his grandfather.</p><p>She reached for his hand and his fingers closed around hers. She squeezed them: in thanks and apology. \u201cWill you join us again, now?\u201d she asked in the strong, demanding voice of Illa Gardella, the leader of the Venators.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And then, with belated horror, she remembered: Max.</p><p>Victoria turned to look at him and their eyes met. The studiously flat expression there told her all she needed to know. Sebastian might be taking his rightful place within the ranks of the Venators, but Max no longer could. He\u2019d given up his Venator powers in order to destroy the thrall Lilith the Dark, Queen of the Vampires, had held over him.</p><p>One</p><p>Two Dogs Circling</p><p>\u201cLilith won\u2019t know I\u2019ve severed her hold on me until she tries to exert it,\u201d Max said. Exhaustion trembled in his muscles, and he swore he could feel his eyes sinking more deeply into their sockets.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d felt so bruised and empty had been after the battle with Nedas, Lilith\u2019s son, last fall. Max had been forced to execute Eustacia, his mentor and Victoria\u2019s great-aunt. Eustacia was one of the most powerful Venators who had ever lived. She\u2019d ordered Max to sacrifice her so that he could get close enough to Nedas to destroy him and the powerful, demonic obelisk in his possession.</p><p>It had been the hardest thing he\u2019d ever done.</p><p>Now, here he was, ready to leave the Venators permanently.</p><p>Only an hour had passed since Victoria had awakened from her ordeal, and he and Wayren had slipped away to her library here in the Consilium, the subterranean head-quarters of the Venators, in order to discuss his future. They\u2019d left Sebastian Vioget simpering over a pale-visaged, hollow-cheeked Victoria.</p><p>It was just as well, for that was quite obviously the way the wind blew. Although Max had had a moment of perverse satisfaction when he realized Vioget hadn\u2019t known that Victoria wore two vis bullae.</p><p>\u201cBut once Lilith realizes I\u2019m free, she\u2019ll consider it a betrayal,\u201d he said, returning to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cAnd she won\u2019t rest until she finds you,\u201d Wayren replied in her even voice. She looked at him with her cool blue-gray eyes, reality shining there. \u201cHer fury will know no bounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow fortunate I am to be the object of such passion.\u201d Max tasted bitterness.</p><p>At that moment, there was a knock at the door and then Vioget came in, uninvited.</p><p>Max glanced up, not bothering to hide the flash of animosity in his face. Still flecked with blood, dirt, and debris from his battle to rescue Victoria from Beauregard\u2019s lair, Vioget looked weary and uncharacteristically out of sorts. Max supposed that was only to be expected, after having been stabbed in the shoulder by the stake meant for a vampire. And by his lover, too.</p><p>Max\u2019s lips twitched. Victoria with one vis bulla was stronger than any man\u2014but wearing two, her strength would be superhuman. Vioget had to be in pain, even being a Venator.</p><p>Despite the fact that Vioget had called Beauregard \u201cGrandfather,\u201d the man was also a born Venator. Vioget\u2019s father had descended from Beauregard\u2019s mortal son, many generations after the vampire had been turned undead. And his mother had apparently carried some measure of Gardella blood in her, which had passed on to Vioget in an ironic turn: the grandson of a vampire was called to be a slayer of the undead.</p><p>\u201cSo sorry to interrupt,\u201d Sebastian said in dulcet tones that didn\u2019t match his disheveled appearance. He barely glanced at Max, turning pointedly to Wayren.</p><p>She sat not behind her desk, but in a cushioned chair, dressed, as always, like a medieval chatelaine in a long, loose gown with pointed sleeves that brushed the floor. This night, the bulk of her pale blonde hair hung in two thick braids, with two finger-slim ones hanging from her temples. She wore no jewelry or adornment except for the braided leather girdle at her waist, upon which hung a ring of keys.</p><p>\u201cI have a matter of some urgency which I must discuss with you,\u201d Vioget continued.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you do. Beauregard\u2019s death at your hand probably won\u2019t be well received by his undead compatriots,\u201d Max replied pleasantly. \u201cEspecially since for the last decade you\u2019ve fairly lived among them. You may actually need to bestir yourself to slay a few more in order to protect your hide.\u201d</p><p>He and Vioget had known each other for more than fifteen years, long before either even knew that vampires existed. The animosity between them had been put aside for the few hours it took to rescue Victoria, but Max saw no reason to hide his antipathy for Vioget and his years of denying his calling as a Venator. Cowardice or selfishness\u2014Max wasn\u2019t sure which one had driven the man\u2014but it didn\u2019t matter to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>People had been mauled, killed, and Vioget had done nothing to help them.</p><p>Until Victoria came along.</p><p>And, as far as he was concerned, it was Vioget\u2019s fault that Max had had to carry a bloody, unconscious Victoria from Beauregard\u2019s bedchamber. If Vioget hadn\u2019t been balancing both sides of his loyalty\u2014to the Venators and his grandfather\u2014for years, Victoria would never have been caught between him and Beauregard.</p> <p>The other man elected to ignore Max\u2019s comment, focusing his attention on Wayren. \u201cThe two vis bullae seem to have saved her from being turned,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA miraculous occurrence,\u201d she replied. \u201cCompletely unexpected. But, since I\u2019ve never known of a Venator to wear two, there was no way to predict such a recovery. And who\u2019s to say another such event would have the same result. At least some of her recovery must be attributed to her own strength and determination. Who she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But . . . how did she come to have two of them? I am fully aware of their rarity\u2014that each vis is cast of precious silver from the Holy Land, and blessed only for its recipient,\u201d Vioget continued. \u201cVictoria\u2019s was lost during the battle with Nedas last November, and I was able to retrieve Eustacia\u2019s and send it to Victoria to replace hers. . . . But where did the second one come from?\u201d</p><p>Max settled back in his chair and bared his teeth in a condescending smile. \u201cIt\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>He was a bit annoyed it had taken him so long to figure it out, for, after all, it was imperially logical. He\u2019d given his vis bulla to Victoria after the battle with Nedas, when he thought he was leaving the Venators for good. The irony was that, unbeknownst to Victoria, he had recovered the vis bulla that she\u2019d lost when Nedas\u2019s creatures had torn it from her navel.</p> <p>And it was her amulet that hung, now useless to him, from his areola. Max\u2019s moment of satisfaction evaporated.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Vioget\u2019s jaw shifted, and he turned once again to Wayren. \u201cThen may I assume you\u2019ve already discussed the situation? Is it possible it\u2019s merely a residual effect?\u201d</p><p>Wayren looked at him with a slight frown. \u201cSituation? I\u2019m not certain what you mean, Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Victoria awoke, she didn\u2019t react to the holy water splashed on her face, as any vampire would. She seems completely normal. Except . . .\u201d Vioget looked at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel it? The vampire chill at the back of your neck, or however you sense the presence of the undead?\u201d</p><p>Vioget didn\u2019t know about him? Max shrugged off his surprise in order to focus on Sebastian\u2019s disturbing question. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still feel cold at the back of my neck in Victoria\u2019s presence.\u201d Venators could sense the presence of the undead by a chill that prickled the napes of their necks.</p> <p>For the first time since he\u2019d seen her sprawled on Beauregard\u2019s bed, blood trickling from her lips, Max was unable to breathe. Yet he kept his reply cool. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>Vioget looked relieved. \u201cWell, that\u2019s promising. Perhaps it\u2019s only because Beauregard attempted to turn her, and I knew him so well, that I continue to sense his presence. After all, she did ingest his blood. It must be some residual effect.\u201d He looked as though he was ready to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand me,\u201d Max was compelled to say. He would have rather let Sebastian go, let everything go, and accept the simple explanation. But. \u201cI cannot feel anything. Any longer.\u201d</p><p>Vioget turned, his hand on the door. \u201cDid you ever, Pesaro? Feel anything?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s jaw tightened, but he plunged on. It had to be said. \u201cI am no longer a Venator.\u201d But he was damned if he\u2019d give Vioget the whole story, the reasons and the trials and the burdens. The fact that he\u2019d had no choice but to give up his powers\u2014not in order to be freed from Lilith; no, he would have continued to bear that burden as long as he had to. But because, in order to kill the demon Akvan, who\u2019d threatened to take over the city of Roma, he\u2019d had to become merely a man once again.</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYesterday.\u201d</p><p>Vioget\u2019s gaze sharpened with calculation. \u201cThat was why you were leaving the Consilium, when I came to ask you for help with Victoria.\u201d Max inclined his head, and Vioget looked startled, and grudgingly impressed. \u201cYou came with us unprotected by the vis bulla.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did what had to be done,\u201d Max replied. Unlike you. He left the words unspoken, but from the tightening of Vioget\u2019s expression, he knew they were understood.</p><p>In clear dismissal, the blond man turned his attention to Wayren, who\u2019d remained silent throughout their exchange. Her smooth brow was furrowed and her eyes worried as he asked, \u201cWhat do you think? Can it merely be a residual effect of the near turning?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her shoulders gracefully. \u201cI do not know. As you\u2019re aware, I cannot sense the presence of an undead as you can, nor could Ylito or Hannever, as they aren\u2019t Venators themselves. There was no one else in the room with us, and . . . methinks it would accomplish no good at this time if the other Venators were to be told what happened. Perhaps\u201d\u2014she glanced at Max\u2014\u201cthe effect will subside as she grows stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus, the most prudent thing,\u201d Vioget said, his voice smooth, \u201cwould be to stay very close to Victoria and keep her under observation. And protected.\u201d</p><p>Max smothered a snort. Victoria, protected? She\u2019d sooner cut off her hands and give up the vis bulla than allow someone else to protect her.</p><p>\u201cApparently, that task is going to fall to me,\u201d Vioget continued in his rich tone. \u201cNever fear, Wayren . . . I will make certain to stick very close to her. Day and night.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Wherein the Stench of Sewage Is Preferred to Lily of the Valley</p><p>Victoria hadn\u2019t missed London in the least.</p><p>It held too many unpleasant memories. Beyond the sewage-lined streets and odiferous air, the swell of carriages and their nonstop clatter, there simmered the rest of it: Regents Park, where she\u2019d ridden with Phillip, the Marquess of Rockley, and where he\u2019d first kissed her. The grand residences, where she\u2019d danced with him, fallen in love with him. The theater near Covent Garden, into which she\u2019d sent him to fetch her supposedly lost shawl\u2014so she could secretly stake a vampire.</p><p>The Silver Chalice, a pub patronized by the undead and owned by Sebastian, into which Phillip had followed her. And where, after they\u2019d married, he had been captured by vampires.</p><p>St. Heath\u2019s Row, the grand London Town estate of the Marquess and Marchioness of Rockley, where she and Phillip had lived in marital harmony for little more than four weeks before he made that fateful visit to the Silver Chalice.</p><p>And where, in her bedchamber, she\u2019d slain the vampire he\u2019d become.</p><p>No. Victoria had not missed London at all.</p><p>Yet, she was back at St. Heath\u2019s Row after more than six months spent in Rome, for it was time for her to remove all of her belongings from the residence. The Rockley heir had been found at last, in a place called Kentucky, and he would soon take over the properties, leaving Victoria to return permanently to Rome\u2014or wherever else the Venators needed her.</p><p>Thus, eighteen months after Phillip\u2019s death, here she sat: surrounded by his essence, stifled by the memories\u2014 and awash in thick, cream-colored, engraved invitations that she cared not a blasted fig for.</p><p>\u201cBut what do you expect, Victoria dear? You hadn\u2019t even come fully out of mourning for Rockley when you left for Venice,\u201d said her mother, Lady Melisande Grantworth. There was clear reproach in her voice even as the calculating gleam in her eyes boded no good for Victoria\u2019s solitude. She\u2019d been rifling through the invitations as if they were her own, and her daughter still an unwed miss ready to debut into Society. \u201cThe ton is holding its collective breath, waiting to see who will be the first to host the Marchioness of Rockley in a year and a half. After the romantic tragedy of your short-lived marriage and Rockley dying at sea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Victoria said sharply. She caught herself, pulled back on the deep-seated anger that always seemed to be with her now, and closed her eyes. \u201cMother, I am not here to reenter Society in any manner. Except for Gwendolyn\u2019s wedding, I intend to make as few appearances as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said between gritted teeth. Her head pounded and her fingers ached from being curled so tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve only just arrived yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look how quickly all of the invitations have begun to pour in.\u201d</p><p>Victoria opened her eyes to see Lady Melly looking at her. The gleam had ebbed from her gaze, yet she didn\u2019t appear affronted by her daughter\u2019s edgy voice.</p><p>\u201cI know that Winnie would dearly love to be the one to introduce you back into Society before Miss Starcasset\u2019s wedding. Please do think about how happy it would make her if you were to attend her fete on Friday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Barely a week later, Victoria found herself slogging through ankle-deep sewage deep beneath London. Stake in hand, she ducked to keep from scraping her head on a low dip of the tunnel ceiling. What had once been a small river tributary flowing south to the Thames had been enclosed by the City\u2019s construction during the last six centuries. The sluggish water now oozed with sewage, and only God and the toshers knew what else.</p><p>She considered herself quite hardened to repugnant images by now, but even she didn\u2019t particularly relish the thought of what her boots were crushing as she stepped through the muck.</p><p>Victoria knew that she could have been dancing at the Bridgertons\u2019 soiree, in a less damp\u2014but just as odiferous\u2014environment if she\u2019d listened to her mother instead of Sebastian. (Lady Bridgerton was known for her exceedingly strong lily of the valley eau de toilette.) She hadn\u2019t yet concluded which was the better choice, although despite the obvious drawbacks, she was leaning toward vampire hunting in the sewers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least here she could eliminate any creature that accostedher with the slam of a stake. It wouldn\u2019t be quite that easy to dissuade the gossipmongers and fortune-hunting bachelors of the ton.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sense any undead,\u201d she told Sebastian as she stepped on something horribly squishy. A rank odor squelched afresh into the air, and with her next step she felt something hard and cylindrical roll beneath her boot. A bone. Hopefully a canine one.</p><p>\u201cDo you not?\u201d he asked, his voice smooth and echoing over the quiet splashing made by their stout leather boots. \u201cPerhaps there are no vampires about, then. Only the harmless toshermen, which we may come upon if they venture this far.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr perhaps you lured me down here for another reason.\u201d</p><p>She could see the wickedness of his smile in the torch\u2019s uneasy light. \u201cWhy should I ruin a perfectly good pair of breeches\u2014not to mention boots\u2014by coaxing you here, when I\u2019d much prefer to have you . . . elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>His frank words caused a sudden swirl of pleasure in her belly, and Victoria gave an unladylike snort to diffuse the warm feeling\u2014which had the added result of filling her nostrils with putrid stench. She wondered how the toshers could make a living, working down here day after day, collecting copper, bones, rags, and anything else of value to sell on the streets above. And how vampires could stand to live among the odor when the mere smell of garlic took them aback.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Sebastian continued, \u201cit\u2019s not as if you\u2019ll be clutching at me and crying for protection, even in a place as revolting as this. Much to my great regret.\u201d He brandished a torch that cast sporadic shadows to break the darkness, but Victoria found that she could see surprisingly well even outside the glow.</p><p>She was just about to make a wry rejoinder when she became aware of a new sound\u2014that of rushing or falling water. Then she felt a faint prickle at the back of her neck. Her disgust with the dark, viscous environment slid away, replaced by the familiar rush of readiness and a cold smile.</p> <p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, cocking his head as if to hear better. \u201cAt last. Just when I thought we were well and truly lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone,\u201d Victoria murmured, the prickle flushing into a full-blown chill.</p><p>\u201cUndead?\u201d His voice dropped to match hers.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cDo you not sense them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now that you say it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s no surprise, as we\u2019re near the place I was looking for.\u201d</p><p>A sudden splash behind them had Victoria spinning to meet the red-eyed vampire who\u2019d come from nowhere. Presumably, he\u2019d been expecting a slow-moving, malnourished tosherman, for the half demon had taken a moment to roll up the sleeves of his dull shirt, and that attention to grooming was his undoing.</p> <p>\u201cYou should have worn cuff links,\u201d Victoria said conversationally the instant before she staked him into undead dust. She blew off the tip of her stake and turned back to Sebastian, who was watching her with an odd sort of smile.</p><p>But before she could wonder what it meant, his expression smoothed and he lifted the torch higher. \u201cTake care,\u201d he said, gesturing ahead of them.</p><p>When she stepped further in the sloshing damp, she saw why. The filthy water fell away, only a few paces ahead of them, cascading into nothingness. A wall loomed beyond the falls, a clear dead end. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He gestured with the torch, and she saw a crude ledge slanting up from the sludge.</p><p>Carved into the wall, it was easily wide enough for a man to ascend into . . . \u201cIs that an entrance?\u201d Victoria peered up at the dark wall rising in front of them.</p><p>\u201cYou can see it from here?\u201d Sebastian raised the torch, illuminating it more clearly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201d Victoria had already started to hike up the inclining ledge, keeping her stake at the ready. Water dripped from her boots at every step, splattering quietly on the rock beneath.</p><p>\u201cSomething that I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll be fascinated to see,\u201d he said from behind her, suddenly very close. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll even wish to reward me for showing you.\u201d His breath was warm on the side of her neck, which was exposed by the long, single braid she wore tucked into her coat.</p> <p>\u201cUnless it\u2019s Lilith\u2019s dust, I highly doubt that,\u201d she replied. Her heart beat a bit off as he moved behind her. \u201cBut you can certainly continue to hope.\u201d</p><p>Since they\u2019d left Rome, Sebastian had made it abundantly clear that he\u2019d be delighted to return to her bed\u2014 not that he\u2019d really ever been there, for they\u2019d only been intimate twice, and neither occasion had been in anyone\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t quite ready to let him, for a variety of reasons\u2014not least of which was that she still wasn\u2019t quite comfortable with the idea of trusting him.</p><p>At the top of the ledge, which was perhaps six feet above the tumbling waterfall, Victoria reached the opening. The entrance, camouflaged by the shiny darkness of the damp walls, and difficult to breach due to its position over the falls, was also at an angle. No one would notice it in this unpleasant, inky environment unless they were looking for it, or unless it was a vampire who could see in the dark.</p><p>Victoria wasn\u2019t certain what she was expecting when she stepped through the crevice, but it wasn\u2019t the narrow space she beheld. After her initial survey to ensure no one was waiting for them in the darkness\u2014no chill at the back of her neck heralding the undead, nor the faint, putrid death-smell of a demon, nor even the presence of another human\u2014she stepped in and looked around.</p><p>With its stone walls and single flickering torch, the chamber reminded her immediately of the Consilium, the subterranean warren of chambers and corridors in Rome that served as the center of knowledge, history, and communication for the Venators. Created among the catacombs of the old city, where the first Venator had been called to serve in the fight against the undead, its location had been kept secret for centuries. This place, though much darker and colder, was similar in that it was obviously man-made, and not a natural cavern. And somehow, even the stench of the sewage below was filtered out. Or perhaps Victoria was simply becoming used to the smell.</p><p>Sebastian stepped in behind her, and then brushed past as he started further into the darkness where Victoria could see an archway of stone and the outline of a door. \u201cAs you can see, this was built long ago, around the time my gran\u2014Beauregard was turned undead. It was originally beneath a Carmelite abbey, if you can believe the irony\u2014although monks never actually lived down here. That\u2019s a story in itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I\u2019m certain your grandfather told you as he dandled you in your leading strings on his knee. What a terrible choice for bedtime storytelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedtime story? Now that you mention it, I have a few I\u2019d like to share with you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria heard his soft chuckle as she followed him across the small antechamber, her lips twitching in spite of herself. At a solid stone door, he paused. Although his body blocked her view, she heard the faint clunks of something tumbling into place. \u201cYou know the way to unlock the door to a vampire lair. It is a vampire lair, I presume. Why should that not surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, dash it all. My plan to fascinate and mystify you into a more accommodating mood is obviously not working. And yes, it is a vampire lair. One of the oldest in England.\u201d He turned to look at her, their faces close in the small yellow light. His eyes glowed like a hungry cat\u2019s. \u201cNo vampires around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone that I can feel,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Before she could wonder why he had to ask, he grasped her by the shoulders, pushing her back against the rough wall. He followed the momentum of her movement, lining his warm body against hers as he lowered his face.</p><p>She met his mouth, her body pressed between Sebastian and the wall as their kiss eased into a long, loose tangle of lips and tongue. Heat seeped through her clothing, into breasts and belly and thighs as he pressed against her, just as the cold ooze from behind chilled her. She closed her eyes, let her knees give a little. It was good . . . good to be held, good to feel the spiral of desire curling through her, good to know that she was still alive. Still human and able to feel her own heartbeat lift and pound.</p><p>But the kiss dug up memories, frightening and dark images that threatened to overwhelm the pleasure of the moment . . . of needle-sharp fangs piercing her skin, the chill and warmth of the undead\u2019s lips as they mauled at her flesh, seducing and culling her consciousness . . . luring her into a funnel of malevolence and darkness. . . .</p><p>She nudged the unpleasant images away and delved more fiercely into the taste of Sebastian, reveling in his smoky, lemony smell and the heat\u2014heat, uninterrupted by chill or pain.</p><p>He pulled away, tugging her lower lip gently between his teeth in a little nick of surprise, then surging back to fully cover her mouth again, leaving her breathless. And then he eased back, releasing her from the kiss. She felt the curve of his lips as he smiled faintly against her, and the soft whisk of his clove-scented breath.</p><p>\u201cAh, then,\u201d he murmured, loosening his hold on her shoulders. \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Her voice was too husky, and, by God, her knees felt much too unsteady. She straightened them and stepped away from the supporting wall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d begun to wonder.\u201d He moved back, looked down at her. She hadn\u2019t even noticed when he slid the torch into a holder near the door, and now its light embraced them and their uneven breaths. His smile was crooked and his eyes burned amber, leaving no mistake about what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s behind the door?\u201d she asked briskly, to break the mood. \u201cWhat are you looking for? Although it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to learn I was wrong, I\u2019m fairly certain you didn\u2019t bring me here merely for seduction purposes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, but I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity. You\u2019ve kept me at such arm\u2019s length these last two months, since . . . since you woke up.\u201d His voice faltered in a rather un-Sebastian-like manner. She felt him draw in a breath and then he cautiously pushed the door inward. \u201cAnd you\u2019re right, of course\u2014I am looking for something,\u201d he said over his shoulder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you needed me to help you.\u201d She followed him, shifting out of his way when he reached to close the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWell, it might get a bit messy, and you know how I deplore drawing blood or exploding ash.\u201d</p><p>Her lips quirked in a smile as she looked around the room. There were no torches in here but she was able to discern more than shadows and shapes in the darkness before a tiny light flared to life in Sebastian\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u201cUsing the little light sticks Miro created, I see,\u201d she commented. \u201cDo you carry them in your boot heel as Max did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had,\u201d he replied, lighting a sconce near the door, \u201cthey\u2019d be wet and sloppy after slogging through that mess. I did have the foresight to keep them in a dry place, my dear Victoria. Much as it might surprise you that I think ahead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s no doubt that you think ahead, Sebastian\u2014 usually about where to disappear to when things get dangerous.\u201d And that was why, even though she knew he was a Venator, Victoria couldn\u2019t quite trust him. He\u2019d been too unreliable in the past.</p><p>As Victoria scanned the dark chamber, she saw the influence of the monks in the simplicity of what must have been some sort of main hall. The floor was uneven beneath her feet, and she could see some old furnishings\u2014 broken chairs, an upended table\u2014near one end, as though they\u2019d been tossed there during a bout of cleaning. Other than that, the room was empty but for a few tattered tapestries hanging from the wall, and a dozen scattered stones. The walls were the same charcoal and black shade as the sewer tunnel, slate discolored by years of dirt and smoke. There were, of course, no windows, and only a small fireplace that must have some sort of chimney. There was only a single door, this one made of stout wood, beyond the one through which they\u2019d come.</p><p>She followed him as he made his way across the abandoned room toward the door. And just then, the ruffle of a chill slipped over the back of her neck. Victoria readied her stake. Perhaps the place wasn\u2019t as abandoned as it appeared.</p> <p>Sebastian didn\u2019t have to unlock this door and, when it cracked open, Victoria wasn\u2019t surprised to see a warm glow of light bleeding through. The chill on her neck had intensified slightly, yet she didn\u2019t think the undead\u2014 perhaps one or two of them\u2014were in close proximity.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what you\u2019re looking for before the vampires appear?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. It may take a few moments. I\u2019m not sure exactly . . .\u201d Sebastian said this as he prodded the door open further, and Victoria saw a much more inviting setting than the chamber behind them. Though it might not be as comfortable as a parlor in St. James, with its upright chairs, tables covered with a variety of objects, and several torches, this smaller space was obviously occupied. Or had been recently, if the bundles of clothing and blankets littering the room were any indication.</p><p>Victoria followed Sebastian in, closing the door behind her to act as a warning for new arrivals\u2014undead or mortal\u2014as much as to keep the warmth and light contained within. Now that she had stepped inside, the first thing that struck her about the chamber was the smell permeating the air.</p><p>Blood.</p><p>Sharp, thick. Like iron.</p> <p>Something hitched at the back of her throat, and her stomach lurched as she remembered being inundated with it\u2014the taste, the odor, the heaviness on her tongue, the thick slide down her throat. Victoria gagged; yet even as she did so, her nostrils flared as though to drag in the smell, and saliva pooled in her mouth.</p><p>Her vision blurred, and a rosy haze filtered over the room as she forced herself to draw in a deep, blood-scented breath. Closing her eyes, she exhaled long and slow, pushing the smell away, then pulled in another breath, deep and easy. By this time, the sharp smell had softened and the nausea ebbed.</p><p>She opened her eyes. The red tinge was gone, and she stood steadier. The brush of chill at the back of her neck hadn\u2019t changed, indicating the vampires weren\u2019t yet in near vicinity. Looking over at Sebastian, she was gratified that he was too busy to have noticed her lapse. Or whatever it had been.</p><p>What had it been?</p><p>Tightening fingers that felt weak, she gripped her stake as if it were a talisman and walked toward Sebastian as he knelt at the base of a large stone chair in the center of one wall. With its dusty, torn cushions and white marble arms, it put her in mind of a masonry throne. Its white and red marble gleamed coolly in the light.</p><p>When she got close enough, she planted herself next to Sebastian, shiny muck still clinging to her boots. She looked down at the back of his thick, curling hair, watching the flex of shoulders beneath his coat as he worked. It wasn\u2019t until she stepped aside that she saw he was unbolting the chair\u2019s two front feet from the floor.</p><p>They weren\u2019t really bolts, she realized when he handed them up to her, but more like thick stone plugs that had been fitted through the clawlike curls of the marble feet and down into the stone-and-dirt floor. Cleverly designed caps on the bolts, when sunk into place, camouflaged them as part of the chair\u2019s design.</p><p>\u201cThe chair must hide something Beauregard told you about,\u201d Victoria said, rolling the finger-width cylinders in her palm. As they bumped together with a dull clunk, she realized the heavy bloodscent was threatening her again. She shook her head sharply, and concentrated on breathing steadily as the feeling passed.</p> <p>\u201cAs usual,\u201d he muttered as he pulled gracefully to his feet, \u201cyou surprise me with your insight. If I thought we had the time, I\u2019d kiss you senseless right here. Or perhaps\u201d\u2014he grinned lasciviously, glancing at the behemoth chair\u2014\u201cwe could find other uses for this.\u201d</p><p>Victoria stepped back as though to put herself out of his reach, then felt ridiculous for doing so. He noticed, and although his smile remained fixed, the jest faded from his eyes. \u201cWell then, since that\u2019s not your preference, let us see what lies behind this bloody thing.\u201d</p><p>Despite the great weight of the stone chair, it was easy for Sebastian, who of course wore the vis bulla, to move on his own. With a dull, gritty scrape, he shoved it aside so that he could approach the wall against which it had stood. Victoria heard his small sound of satisfaction just as the chill on the back of her neck exploded into a blast of cold.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming,\u201d she said, spinning around to face the door from which they\u2019d entered. \u201cTwo or three, I think. I\u2019ll take care\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her words strangled in her throat as Sebastian leaped into place beside her, stake in hand.</p><p>An odd thing. So odd, after their debates time and again about the finality of sending a vampire to his death\u2014to eternal damnation\u2014and how Sebastian refused to be the one to pass such judgment on the creatures. So odd to see him holding a stake, ready to use it, instead of running the other way.</p><p>It was almost like being with Max.</p><p>The chill intensified and was now accompanied by deep, guttural voices just beyond the door. Sebastian whispered, \u201cGet them before they see that the chair is moved.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was only too happy to oblige. She was waiting when the first undead stepped through the door, and the element of surprise along with the fact that he was turning to speak to someone behind him made it easy to turn him into a pile of ash.</p><p>His companions, a woman with long blonde hair and a man sporting a shiny head and a red beard, weren\u2019t quite as easily dispatched. However, the element of surprise and Victoria\u2019s quick decision to push between the two undead, back into the previous, darker chamber, at least brought the battle out of sight of the dismantled throne.</p><p>When she turned back to face the vampires, who had whirled after her, Victoria saw Sebastian emerge from the entrance behind them. The creatures rushed at her, fangs bared and eyes gleaming red, fairly glowing in this dark room.</p><p>She ducked and rammed her shoulder into the abdomen of the male in one smooth move, causing him to tumble over her spine and land with a thud on the floor. But his hand snaked out and grasped her ankle, tripping her as she slammed her stake at the female\u2019s chest. The stake drove into the vampire\u2019s shoulder instead of sliding easily into her heart, sending a shock along Victoria\u2019s arm.</p><p>Just as she began scrambling to her feet, a soft poof sent the bald vampire into an explosion of ash. She glanced over at Sebastian in surprise\u2014until now, she hadn\u2019t been sure he\u2019d really do it. She\u2019d never actually seen him stake a vampire; when he killed Beauregard, she\u2019d been too far gone to notice anything.</p><p>That left the female, and she began to back away, fear in her pale, gaunt face. But Victoria was too quick for her. Upright now, she started after her, following when the undead began to run. She had the extra moment when the creature had to pause to open the stone door leading to the small antechamber, and Victoria used it, leaping toward her.</p><p>They tumbled to the dirty floor, the vampire\u2019s long, blonde hair tangling about them like a greasy net. Victoria rolled on top and raised her stake, but the undead grasped her wrist in midstrike and flipped them both over so that she had the upper position. Her fangs were extended, digging into the full flesh of her lower lip as she struggled to force Victoria\u2019s hands to the ground behind her.</p><p>The odd rosy haze was beginning to feed into the corners of her vision when a shadow loomed above. The vampire jerked, and then the pressure on her wrists was released. A cloud of ash showered over Victoria, sprinkling her mouth and nose with the dusty, decayed smell.</p><p>Victoria jumped to her feet, shooting a glance at Sebastian. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve decided to slay vampires, you\u2019ve really committed to it,\u201d she said, not quite successful in keeping all of the annoyance from her voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t need your assistance.\u201d She spit out a mouthful of dust as she brushed the rest of it from her face and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOho, so that\u2019s how it is. Shall I never please you? For months, you disparage my disinclination to slay vampires . . . and now that I\u2019m doing so, you rebuff me. Tsk, tsk, Victoria. I thought that you, of all women, would not be fickle.\u201d He turned and walked back toward the comfortable room.</p><p>Victoria resisted the urge to tell him that it wasn\u2019t that he was staking the vampires; it was that he\u2019d interfered when she hadn\u2019t needed him to. Max would have stood and watched, criticizing her technique all the while, but only stepping in if things got out of hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And she wasn\u2019t quite sure, as she stood there looking after Sebastian, which type she preferred.</p><p>The temperature at the back of her neck had returned to normal, indicating that there weren\u2019t any other undead in the vicinity, so Victoria decided she ought to examine the parlorlike chamber a bit more closely.</p><p>The oldest vampire lair in England, he\u2019d said. Clearly, Beauregard had been busy educating his great-great-great- (some number of greats)-grandson about his demonic heritage.</p> <p>Victoria pursed her lips as she looked over at Sebastian, who\u2019d opened a small door that had been revealed with the movement of the throne. It would be best if she tried to find out what he was after, even though he was obviously not inclined to tell her.</p><p>She started toward him, but her attention was caught by what she had originally thought were bundles of clothing or blankets. But from this angle . . .</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>She was at the side of the bodies in an instant, Sebastian and his cubbyhole forgotten for the moment.</p><p>He looked over. \u201cWhat is\u2014oh. Damnation.\u201d</p> <p>There were three of them in heaps on the floor, tossed near the wall like trash. Blood\u2014dried, congealed, pooled\u2014was on their ravaged faces and hands, on the floor, spattered low on the wall. The stench filled her nose, and her fingers closed into each of her palms as she fought to stay steady, keep her breathing even.</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d Sebastian was there, his face suddenly close to hers.</p><p>She grabbed in a deep breath and shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He knelt beside the bodies, heaped on top of each other haphazardly, and gently moved them so that their faces were revealed\u2014or what was left of them. They were all men, and their clothing was in shreds. The vampires hadn\u2019t merely fed on them, they\u2019d mauled and destroyed them. Even tortured them, if the rawness of the wrists was any sign.</p><p>\u201cThis is what you allowed to walk free when you turned your back on the Venators,\u201d Victoria said, her voice cold. \u201cHow many innocents have suffered like this when they could have been saved?\u201d The fury burned through her, and her fingers were shaking. The haze colored her vision and she felt rage surging through her like a team of horses gone wild.</p><p>And then she turned over the last body, and saw the familiar face.</p> <p>Three</p><p>Wherein Our Heroine Succumbs to a Maternal Threat</p><p>There was nothing to wrap the corpse in but her coat, and Sebastian\u2019s too, which Victoria immediately demanded. Although the body was cold, he couldn\u2019t have been dead for long, as the pools of blood around him had not yet completely dried. Oddly enough, neither bugs nor other vermin had yet discovered the destroyed flesh.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Sebastian asked. His sensual voice was clipped, no doubt by anger at her sharp accusation. It wouldn\u2019t be guilt. Not Sebastian.</p><p>Victoria cared little for his sensitivities. She had said what needed to be said, even though it angered him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Briyani, Max\u2019s Comitator,\u201d she told him. \u201cKritanu\u2019s nephew.\u201d</p><p>Victoria carefully wrapped up the young man, who\u2019d been perhaps only five years older than her own two decades. He\u2019d been a smart, sharp fighter, brave and skilled. It had been he, along with his uncle, who had helped her and Max escape from Lilith during a terrible fire.</p><p>Not a Venator, no, but Briyani had been just as important in the fight against the undead. He had been Max\u2019s Comitator\u2014his assistant, valet, and an expert who trained him in the Indian martial art of kalaripayattu.</p> <p>Truth be told, both Max and Briyani had learned their skills at the hands of Kritanu, who had been Eustacia\u2019s companion and trainer for fifty years. But Briyani, who had been training since he was ten, had been working with Max to keep his skills honed for more than eight years.</p><p>And now he was gone.</p><p>She hoisted Briyani\u2019s body over her shoulder, frowning when Sebastian made a move to assist, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do it. Heaven forbid you should get blood on your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exceedingly appreciative of your consideration,\u201d he replied. But the usual self-deprecating tone was missing. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a moment.\u201d He loped back over to the throne and began to put it all back the way it had been.</p><p>The burden heavy on her shoulder, Victoria walked slowly toward the exit as thoughts tumbled through her mind. She could find out later from Sebastian what he\u2019d found behind the throne\u2014if anything. But for now, she had other worries.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen Briyani, he\u2019d been in Rome. How had he come to be in London? Was he with Max? Did that mean Max was here? Why would he come to London when he hated England?</p><p>Did Max know Briyani was missing?</p><p>How was she to let him know about his trusted friend and companion if he was in hiding from Lilith? And she had to tell Kritanu, as well.</p><p>Tears welled at the corner of her eyes. She used her free hand to swipe angrily at them. This was part of her life, part of her choice. It would never get easier.</p><p>While the London ton danced and ate and copulated and gossiped, this evil happened. All the time, beneath their silken slippers and buffed boots.</p><p>Sebastian returned to her side, silent and grave.</p><p>\u201cDid you get what you came for?\u201d she asked, unable to keep a fringe of disgust from her voice.</p><p>He gave a brief nod and, to her surprise, held up a ring between his thumb and forefinger. She caught his gaze, one of those rich topaz eyes framed almost perfectly by the ring, which was thick and made of copper. She\u2019d seen one exactly like it, braided with twisted copper strands, hidden away at the Consilium.</p><p>\u201cOne of Lilith\u2019s rings,\u201d Victoria breathed. There were only five in existence, and the Venators were in possession of one of them\u2014now, two.</p><p>\u201cI shall accept your gratitude later, once we\u2019re quit of this place.\u201d Head high, shoulders straight, he led the way from the underground chamber, back out into the foul sewers.</p><p>\u201cI daresay, Victoria, I\u2019ve asked thrice for your opinion on this lace.\u201d Gwendolyn Starcasset\u2019s voice at last penetrated Victoria\u2019s reverie. \u201cYou look exhausted, dearest. Are you certain you\u2019re feeling well?\u201d</p><p>What could have been a petulant tone was as gentle and concerned as that of a young mother, drawing Victoria back to the gilded, laced, and overstuffed private sitting room of the Starcasset residence like a remonstrated child. An untouched tea service sat on the small walnut piecrust table next to the rose-upholstered divan on which she sat. Lemon biscuits and poppyseed scones, along with chestnut cakes, decorated a small, delicate platter. Despite her particular fondness for lemons and chestnuts, Victoria was unmoved.</p><p>Gwendolyn, one of the few young women Victoria had befriended during the Season during which she\u2019d met and married Phillip, sat across from her in a wide-armed chair. Her spring green day dress and cornflower ribbons made her appear young and fresh in contrast to the maturity and weariness that seemed to weigh upon Victoria. Gwen\u2019s pale blonde hair was twisted high at the back of her head, with two generous locks rolled into sagging curls on either side of her face.</p><p>Victoria never had to worry about sagging curls, for her mane was composed of thick, springy ones, yet she knew that her coiffure wasn\u2019t nearly as elegant as her friend\u2019s. At one time, long ago, it would have been a task labored over with great care. But now, she barely allowed her maid to pin it into a chignon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Gwen,\u201d she said. \u201cI must confess, I am a bit tired and still recovering from the headache that kept me away from the Bridgerton soiree last night.\u201d Not to mention the task of taking care of the corpse she\u2019d brought home. She couldn\u2019t exactly walk across the front threshold of St. Heath\u2019s Row carrying Briyani\u2019s mauled body. With Sebastian\u2019s help, she\u2019d managed to get it into the small chapel on the grounds, unseen. This morning she\u2019d sent word to Kritanu, who was living at the town house Aunt Eustacia had bequeathed to Victoria. She didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d have the chance to talk with Kritanu, but at least he could be with his nephew.</p><p>The only thing that had been simple about last evening\u2019s events was bidding Sebastian good night; she\u2019d expected him to attempt to make his case for why\u2014and how\u2014she should thank him for finding the ring.</p><p>He must still have been angry with her for her cutting comments when she found Briyani\u2019s body, for he hadn\u2019t even tried to steal a kiss when he let her off. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time they were together that he hadn\u2019t attempted to tease or coax her into some sort of intimacy, even when she was angry or annoyed with him. Even earlier that evening, in the sewers, he\u2019d made an attempt.</p><p>\u201cWe missed you, and of course everyone was asking everyone else if they\u2019d called on you, or had seen you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria discarded all thought of Sebastian and smiled. \u201cI hope you told them a great tale.\u201d</p><p>Gwen smiled back, showing deep, delicious dimples. She looked a bit weary too, or perhaps it was merely the stress of her upcoming nuptials. \u201cOf course\u2014I told them that you were remaining in seclusion until my wedding. Now, everyone will be even more eager to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if marrying the Earl of Brodebaugh isn\u2019t enough of a reason to entice the entire ton and half the king\u2019s court to attend. His style and flair is superb, and his family is certain to spend hugely on the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Victoria may have been in Italy for nearly a year, but her mother had made certain she\u2019d not fallen behind in Society gossip. And now that the Prince Regent would be crowned George IV in a matter of weeks, there was even more to gossip about\u2014such as his wife, Queen Caroline, who\u2019d recently returned from years of self-exile in Italy. Despite the scandal that had surrounded her over the affair she\u2019d conducted with her Italian servant, Bartolomo Pergami, the queen had been welcomed back to England by the masses\u2014purely because George was so unpopular, and he hated her.</p><p>Victoria dutifully pushed away her grief and weariness, and her potent dislike for nearly everything related to her old life of balls and fetes and musicales, and leaned closer to Gwen. \u201cThe lace is very fine, and I think it will be lovely on a wedding gown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wished she really did give more than a fig about these things, but it was difficult to worry over tatting and trims when Briyani lay dead and she hadn\u2019t been able to see Kritanu yet. He was staying at the home he\u2019d shared with Aunt Eustacia here in London; the place where Victoria would move upon leaving St. Heath\u2019s Row\u2014which was yet another thing she needed to attend to.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, Victoria,\u201d her friend sighed in mock annoyance. \u201cBut you haven\u2019t been listening to a word I\u2019ve said, have you? This lace, this beautiful Brussels lace, isn\u2019t meant for my wedding gown . . . but for my wedding night. That is why I invited you here, to the private parlor. Why, see, I\u2019ve even had the drapes drawn!\u201d Her eyes sparkled with mischief.</p><p>\u201cAhh!\u201d Victoria picked up the lace again. It was quite lovely\u2014an eggshell white, shot through with shiny, glittering silver thread, tatted into the most intricate miniatures of loops and knots and scallops. \u201cThe earl will no doubt find himself speechless with delight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do hope so.\u201d Gwen beamed, and for a moment, in the glare of her happiness, Victoria was shocked by pure, unadulterated envy.</p><p>It shot through her like a bolt of lightning: envy that she\u2019d never have an ignorant life with a man she loved, and who loved her (for it was clearly a love match between Miss Starcasset and her wealthy earl, despite the fact that he was more than two decades older than she). The ugly feeling roiled inside her, threatening to burst free in the form of snide remarks and accusations that she didn\u2019t really mean.</p><p>Victoria dropped the lace when she realized her fingers had crumpled it, and a sting of tears surprised her. She forced herself to take a deep breath, to smile, to look at her friend\u2019s beaming face and ask herself: Why shouldn\u2019t she be happy? Some of us have to be. I\u2019ve more than enough angst for both of us.</p><p>\u201cAnd George may soon follow\u2014as you can imagine, my mother has been nagging at him for years now,\u201d Gwendolyn was rattling on. Miraculously, she hadn\u2019t noticed or recognized Victoria\u2019s lapse, saving her from another explanation that would likely make no sense.</p><p>But Gwen\u2019s words served also to catch Victoria\u2019s attention, snatching her back to their conversation. \u201cGeorge? Your brother has returned to London?\u201d She lifted her teacup.</p> <p>The last time she\u2019d seen George Starcasset had been in Rome, when he had imprisoned Victoria, Max, and Sebastian\u2014capturing them for the demon Akvan. Victoria didn\u2019t know when or how George had become involved with the Tutela, the secret society of mortals that protected and served vampires, but he had become a nuisance. When he wasn\u2019t trying to seduce her, he was handing her over to the undead or a demon. And not doing it very capably.</p><p>When Max had taken on the task of destroying Akvan, George had disappeared during the melee that followed, and was presumed dead.</p><p>Apparently, that was not the case, if he was planning to attend Gwendolyn\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Mother and I hadn\u2019t had any letters from him for more than a month, then about three weeks ago he returned from his Grand Tour of the Continent. Then he spent a week at Claythorne Manor before arriving here in Town. I hope you don\u2019t mind my saying so,\u201d Gwen continued, \u201cbut I confess, I always harbored the hope that you and George might form an attachment, Victoria.\u201d She held up her hands as if to ward off any response her friend might make, adding, \u201cNot now, of course, for it\u2019s not even been two years since Rockley died, but . . . well, he seemed quite smitten with you during the house party at Claythorne, and you didn\u2019t seem put off by him at all. And then he followed you to Italy, and I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d Victoria replied politely, thinking that the only off-putting thing about Mr. Starcasset was that he\u2019d sneaked into her bedchamber during that very same house party\u2014after inviting vampires to the estate. Oh, and that he\u2019d planned to ravish her at gunpoint when they met up in Rome. No. She didn\u2019t find him terribly off-putting at all. More like an annoying gnat.</p><p>\u201cBut, alas, it appears my fondest wishes will never come to fruition . . . unless . . . you can distract him from that Italian woman he seems to have developed a tendre for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cItalian woman?\u201d There was only one person that could be. Victoria set her tea down\u2014it was cold, and she\u2019d put too much sugar in it.</p><p>\u201cSignorina Sarafina Regalado,\u201d said Gwen. \u201cAside from the fact that she is disrupting my plans to have you as a sister-in-law, I rather like her myself. For all her English leaves much to be desired, her sense of fashion is quite good. She\u2019s been a blessing as I prepare my trousseau.\u201d If that was a veiled criticism of Victoria\u2019s inattention, it was belied by the sparkle in her friend\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Victoria raised her brows and reached for a lemon biscuit. \u201cBlessing\u201d was not quite the word she\u2019d use to describe Sara Regalado. But Gwen was indeed right\u2014Sara had a deep love for fashion, and debates about which lace to adorn which gown, new fabrics, and how long a hem should be dominated her every conversation. And the woman seemed to collect fianc\u00e9s even more quickly than shoes. Less than a year ago, she and Max had been engaged.</p><p>Supposedly.</p><p>Victoria had never been able to get a straight answer from Max as to whether he had arranged the betrothal in order for him to be accepted by the Tutela, or a real engagement. It had been vital for him to pretend to be wholly loyal to the Tutela, as well as Nedas, in order to get into the inner circle of vampires and close enough to destroy the demonic obelisk. He\u2019d even had to do the unthinkable in order to be accepted: execute Aunt Eustacia. Knowing that, it shouldn\u2019t surprise Victoria that he\u2019d go so far as to get engaged to a woman who was part of the Tutela . . . but how much further would he have gone?</p><p>The one time she\u2019d pressed him about whether he really would have married Sara, Max had replied, \u201cIf it was necessary, I would have.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had never actually asked Max if he\u2019d loved his fianc\u00e9e\u2014for if he had, he must have been devastated by the fact that Sara\u2019s father, the leader of the Tutela, had been turned to a vampire.</p><p>Not to mention the fact that the lady in question seemed to enjoy being around and fed upon by vampires. Victoria had staked the newly undead Conte Regalado herself several months ago when he turned his attentions to wooing Lady Melly. But she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sarafina had taken her father\u2019s place\u2014either as the leader of the Tutela, or as a vampire herself.</p> <p>And now, Sara had arrived in London, ostensibly as George Starcasset\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>And Briyani had been found in a hidden vampire lair. In London.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be a coincidence.</p><p>Because of her late nights patrolling streets where the undead might be found, Victoria wasn\u2019t often about during the day. Normally, she spent much of sunlight\u2019s hours catching up on her sleep, practicing her fighting skills with Kritanu, and avoiding her mother. But today she had to make an appearance.</p><p>Ironically, the cream of London Society lived much the same schedule as a Venator\u2014sleeping late in the day, often till noon, then rising and dressing for afternoon calls. Late in the afternoon, they returned home to dress for the evening\u2019s events, which could include the theater, a dinner party, or a ball, wherein they ate and danced and gossiped until the early hours of morning.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s visit to Gwendolyn today had been made rather earlier than usual. They\u2019d had luncheon together in the private parlor strewn with bolts of lace, silk, and ribbons.</p><p>After leaving the Starcasset residence, Victoria fulfilled her mother\u2019s demand to join her for her own afternoon calls. Lady Melly was no longer content to wait for her daughter to make her own entr\u00e9e back into Society, and she\u2019d threatened to bring droves of her friends down upon St. Heath\u2019s Row if her daughter didn\u2019t cooperate. Thus, she sat Victoria on the least comfortable chair\u2014 which also happened to be the focal point of a room over-filled with parlor chairs, twittering ladies, eaux de toilette of the most sweet scents, and poorly hidden nosiness.</p><p>\u201cWe are so pleased you\u2019ve returned from your journey to Italy,\u201d crooned Lady Winnie, the Duchess of Farnham and one of Lady Melly\u2019s two cronies. She enveloped Victoria in a smothering hug against her shelflike bosom, her plump arms stronger than they looked. \u201cWe had a lovely time visiting you there, but the ton was calling, and of course, we had to return.\u201d When she released Victoria, she moved smoothly to scoop up three little ginger biscuits and a lemon scone.</p><p>Victoria smothered a smile. Fortunately, Lady Winnie wasn\u2019t able to recall just how much fun they\u2019d had visiting her, thanks to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s special golden disk. With Wayren\u2019s help, Victoria had been able to eliminate any memories the ladies might have had about their attempt to hunt down and stake the Conte Regalado. Lady Winnie herself had carried a wooden pike as thick as her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite exciting to be in Rome\u2014or shall I say Roma?\u201d added Lady Petronilla, rolling her R enthusiastically. Lady Nilly was one of Lady Melly\u2019s closest friends, and a surrogate aunt to Victoria. \u201cThe Carnivale was astonishing, but I daresay the King\u2019s coronation will be even more of an event. I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s spending upward of forty-four thousand pounds . . . on his robe alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never had the chance to give you my condolences personally, Lady Rockley,\u201d said Mrs. Winkledon, wedging herself between Ladies Melly and Nilly on the sofa. \u201cAbout the loss of your dear Rockley. A love match it was, was it not?\u201d Her sharp eyes matched her sharp nose, which nearly quivered with curiosity, as if she expected Victoria to admit that she hadn\u2019t actually loved Phillip. Not that it should matter, for few ton marriages were love matches. In fact, it was almost considered pass\u00e9 to love one\u2019s spouse.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Winkledon,\u201d Victoria replied. \u201cI do miss Phillip terribly.\u201d That was at least the truth.</p><p>\u201cAn accident on a ship?\u201d asked Lady Breadlington, leaning in with a smile. Her teeth, flat instead of curved across the front of her mouth, looked as though they\u2019d been kicked in by a horse. \u201cHow terrible that he perished in the cold sea, on his way to\u2014where was it? Spain? His body was never found, was it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, indeed,\u201d Victoria replied. Unless you counted the pile of ash that had poofed all over her bedchamber. She kept a bit of it in a small container on her dressing table. \u201cBut we had a burial service anyway . . . and, forgive me, but I cannot recall if you were in attendance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m so sorry, my dear lady, but we had already repaired to the Country by then. Grouse season.\u201d Lady Breadlington had the grace to look abashed, which had exactly been Victoria\u2019s intention.</p><p>Most of the twenty or so women who crowded the Grantworth parlor were not close friends of Victoria\u2019s mother. They were here because they couldn\u2019t stand not to be the first to see the infamous Lady Rockley, who\u2019d married, shockingly, for love, and whose husband had died tragically little more than a month after their wedding. And who hadn\u2019t been seen in Society since, even after her year of mourning.</p> <p>\u201cOdd,\u201d grumbled elderly Lady Thurling, her shiny, knobby fingers closed over the top of her walking stick, \u201clast time I saw Lord Rockley, he claimed he would attend my granddaughter\u2019s wedding in four days, and yet two days later\u201d\u2014she paused to catch a wheezing breath\u2014\u201csets off on a voyage without his new wife. And never comes back.\u201d She glared at Victoria with watery blue eyes gleaming with satisfaction.</p><p>She\u2019d said exactly what had been on everyone\u2019s mind.</p><p>Victoria made what she hoped was a sad smile. \u201cYes, indeed, it was tragic. He was called away and hardly had the time to say good-bye, and I . . . well\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought at the time Victoria was in no condition,\u201d Lady Melly interrupted with a properly sad smile of her own, \u201cto go with him.\u201d</p><p>There was a small chorus of sympathetic gasps, and then eyes became rounder and hands began to grasp at and pat Victoria\u2019s, and even a nose or two\u2014the pointiest ones\u2014tinged a bit red on the tips.</p> <p>Nothing could have been further from the truth, except that it had been Lady Melly\u2019s baseless hope, but Victoria was delighted to have the conversation rerouted. She glanced surreptitiously at the watch pinned to Lady Thurlington\u2019s dress. It was the only one large enough to read from across the tea table, but it was fastened upside down so that the elderly lady could look down and easily read it.</p><p>Half past three. She\u2019d been here only an hour.</p><p>Victoria endured another twenty minutes of sly queries and sympathy coated more thickly than the iced basil cakes before the opportunity for escape presented itself.</p><p>\u201cA turn around the park?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, Mr. and Miss Needleton, I should greatly enjoy that.\u201d She was up and out of her seat before her mother could protest.</p><p>Mr. and Miss Needleton\u2014a brother and sister\u2014and their other companion, Miss Durfingdale, were the only visitors who had not been overly inquisitive, and were also in close proximity to Victoria\u2019s own age of twenty.</p><p>When Lady Melly opened her mouth\u2014surely to argue\u2014Victoria surged forward to hug her, effectively smothering anything she might have said. Her nostrils filled with the sweet yet comforting milk rose scent her mother always wore, she whispered, \u201cI heard Mr. Needleton has more than forty thousand a year.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Melly stiffened under her hands, but when she pulled away, Victoria saw that her mother had a most calculating look on her face as she examined the unfortunate Mr. Needleton, whose squashed nose resembled anything but his name. Even though Victoria had inherited a generous income from both her husband and aunt, Lady Melly was of the mind that one could never have too much money. \u201cHave a lovely time, my dear.\u201d</p><p>As Victoria left the room, the last thing she heard was, \u201c\u2014so glad to see her get out with young people her own age. It\u2019s been far too long, and\u2014\u201d The door closed, and she was with her new companions.</p><p>Victoria would have preferred driving her own curricle alongside the Needleton carriage, enabling her to divest herself of their company as soon as was polite. But Miss Needleton was to have none of it.</p><p>She was no more than a wisp of a girl, with flyaway hair of a nondescript brown, and soulful brown eyes. In addition, she had an excuse that made it impossible for Victoria to decline her request that she ride in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cI knew Rockley when he was a young boy,\u201d Miss Needleton said. \u201cPerhaps if you sit next to me, I could tell you some stories about him.\u201d</p><p>Curiosity won out, of course. Victoria climbed into the carriage with the help of Mr. Needleton, whose pale cheeks flushed with pleasure as their gloved hands skidded against each other. Smiling at him, and settling her day dress skirts so that they didn\u2019t infringe upon his sister\u2019s or Miss Durfingdale\u2019s, she realized how easy it could be for her to slip back into this world. Perhaps too easy.</p><p>If her mother had her way, Victoria would be intent on finding a new husband in order to provide Lady Melly with grandchildren (and an heir to the Grantworth estates). Instead all she could think about was what that copper ring meant to Sebastian, and whether he meant to give it to the Venators, or keep it for some other reason. And how to find Max to tell him about Briyani. And what George Starcasset was doing here in London with Sarafina. And how she felt about Sebastian.</p><p>How she really felt about Sebastian. A warm flush spread through her. Whatever her feelings, it was clear that he made her skin tingle and her head light\u2014even when he wasn\u2019t around.</p> <p>Victoria realized with a start that her hands had clasped tightly together, and that Mr. Needleton\u2014ignoring his sister\u2019s agenda for conversation\u2014had been expounding quite profusely about the merits of a certain filly at the Derby, and why he expected she should take the cup.</p><p>The oaks and cottonwoods were thick and stately as the carriage turned past the stucco villas and into the Outer Circle of Regent\u2019s Park. When Victoria and Phillip had driven through here, John Nash had just begun the park\u2019s redesign. Though it wasn\u2019t near completion, the park already showed his influence, with its sweeping pathways and havens for waterfowl.</p><p>\u201cMiss Needleton,\u201d Victoria said when the young woman\u2019s brother stopped for a breath of air, \u201cdid you say that you were acquainted with my husband as a young boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d she replied. \u201cHis mother was a friend of my mother\u2019s, and we spent two summers together when I was seven and he was perhaps thirteen. He was frightfully fond of raspberries, though his mother forbade him to eat any, for they gave him a terrible rash. I recall how he convinced me to go berry picking with him one day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her story was interrupted as the carriage approached that of another high-strung vehicle. As was expected, the Needletons stopped in order to greet the others. It was Gwendolyn and her earl, Brodebaugh. He seemed vaguely attentive to his adoring fianc\u00e9e, but kind enough to agree with her when she pressed him for his thoughts on the weather. This was the first time Victoria recalled meeting him\u2014although, according to Gwendolyn, he\u2019d attended the Straithwaite musical the summer of their debut. They exchanged pleasantries for a short time. When the Needleton carriage was ready to move on, another conveyance had approached, and the conversation was extended. Victoria waved to Gwendolyn as Brodebaugh drove away, wishing she\u2019d invited herself to ride back with them, for she didn\u2019t anticipate extricating herself any time soon.</p><p>For now that word had spread from carriage to rider to curricle that the Marchioness of Rockley was in the Needleton vehicle, everyone seemed to converge on their path.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth was tired of smiling and her palms were sore from the score of her nails biting through her cotton gloves. She was just about to suggest that they return to the Grantworth home when someone screamed.</p><p>They all turned to look toward the terrified cry, which had been cut off in a sort of bubbling way. It had come from the direction of a far distant clump of thick bushes and grass that had not yet been subjected to Mr. Nash\u2019s attentions. Victoria bolted to her feet, causing the carriage to sway\u2014but she caught herself before she hurtled out of the vehicle like a madwoman. Miss Needleton looked up at her in astonishment, for apparently it had never occurred to her that she might be of assistance.</p><p>Of course it wouldn\u2019t. Women of the ton let everything be done for and about them. Victoria remained standing, however, as Mr. Needleton and several other men leaped from their vehicles, dashing toward the cry of distress.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Miss Durfingdale squeaked rather belatedly, and Victoria, who had nearly forgotten her existence, looked at her in surprise. Was she knocked for six by the scream, or the equally amazing speed at which the men had moved?</p><p>\u201cPerhaps they may need assistance,\u201d Victoria said, lifting her skirts to climb carefully down from the carriage\u2014 an unusual feat for a woman, but one that she was well accustomed to performing. \u201cIf she is in distress.\u201d</p><p>Miss Needleton\u2019s mild protestations ringing in her ears, Victoria hurried as quickly as she could through the tall grasses in the wake of the men. As soon as she was out of sight of the carriage, she thrashed through the brush, heedless of her new muslin day dress, and found herself running down a small incline. At the bottom, a creek trickled beneath scattered trees. Ahead of her, she heard the men running and calling to each other, but she remained silent as she ran pell-mell down the creek bank. There\u2019d been no other cries from the victim, and at last Victoria came to a rushing halt when she reached the small stream.</p><p>Panting, she looked around for some sign of trouble, but saw nothing but dappled sunlight over the smooth stones scattered in the creek. Just then, a splash of pink caught her attention behind a massive, felled tree trunk.</p><p>It took her only a moment to reach the crumpled figure, and when she did, Victoria gasped in shock. Blood spattered the grass around her, staining the pink gown that had caught her attention. When she turned the young woman over, Victoria stared down at the horror.</p><p>The victim\u2019s bodice had been torn away, and the flesh of her chest and over her collarbones was marked with three large Xs, gouged into her skin. Fresh blood seeped through the fabric and oozed from her wounds. But what caught Victoria\u2019s attention were the four small marks on the girl\u2019s blue-white neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vampire bites. Fresh ones.</p><p>In the middle of the day.</p><p>Four</p> <p>Wherein a Bellpull Is Out of Commission</p><p>Despite the horrible fate of Miss Belvadine Forrest (as the victim\u2019s name was revealed to be), it turned out to be morbidly beneficial to Victoria. For, as a result of the traumatic discovery, she simply did not feel up to attending the Burlington-Frigate dinner party that night.</p><p>Lady Melly accepted the excuse with watery eyes and a tremulous smile. Armed with yet another fresh topic on which she would be the ultimate source, she took herself off to the dinner party in full regalia.</p><p>Victoria, meanwhile, took herself gratefully back to St. Heath\u2019s Row.</p><p>As the carriage pulled past the iron gates into the generous Rockley house, she glanced past the stables to the small family chapel cloaked by a cluster of maples. Almost two years ago, she\u2019d hidden the Book of Antwartha there to keep it safe from Lilith, and now Briyani reposed in the same building until he was buried.</p> <p>Vampires couldn\u2019t scale the stone walls surrounding the house, for the stone was stamped with crosses in honor of St. Heath, who, apparently, had died upon one (although the story was rather muddied, and no one other than her husband\u2019s family, the de Lacys, had ever heard of St. Heath, so there was no way to verify its accuracy). Another, larger, cross sat at the top of the iron gateway, splitting only when the gate was opened. And then of course, there was the fact that the chapel itself was too holy for any undead to enter.</p><p>Her groom helped her alight from the carriage, and Victoria hurried up the sweep of steps to the tall double doors. Her first order of business would be to send a message by pigeon to Wayren, in hopes of finding a way to notify Max about Briyani\u2019s death, and also to let her know about the events at the park today. The reality of a vampire attack in daylight gave Victoria a heavy, rolling feeling in her stomach. Vampires just weren\u2019t able to move about in the sunlight. Their flesh burned instantly, peeling away. Even a powerful vampire like Lilith the Dark couldn\u2019t stand pure sunlight.</p><p>And that reminded her of the copper ring Sebastian had retrieved. He hadn\u2019t offered it to her, nor had he indicated what he planned to use it for. But either way, she would feel much more comfortable if it were placed somewhere in the Consilium for safekeeping. After all, he\u2019d teased her with the fact that she should show him gratitude for locating it\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d intoned her very proper butler, Lettender, as Victoria crossed the threshold into the vast foyer, \u201cthe master awaits you in the parlor.\u201d</p><p>His words brought her to a surprised halt. \u201cPardon me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe master has arrived. He awaits you in the parlor,\u201d replied Lettender with agonizingly even tones, as though he regularly made such an announcement.</p> <p>Her mouth suddenly dry and her palms springing moisture, Victoria pivoted slowly toward the twin doors of the sitting room. Absurdly, she\u2019d never noticed before, but a wooden lotus blossom had been stamped in the center of each panel, its design a simple relief in an otherwise austere expanse of creamy white.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t be that much of a shock; she\u2019d known her husband\u2019s heir would arrive someday soon. She just . . . it had been a very long, trying day.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t quite ready, yet, to meet the man who would take Phillip\u2019s place.</p><p>Victoria drew in a long, slow breath and reached for the glass doorknob. It was cool, even through her gloves, and she turned it.</p><p>Stepping in, she turned so as to ensure her skirts had made it completely through, and closed the door. She wanted no witnesses to this meeting.</p><p>She looked over.</p><p>He must have seen her carriage arrive moments ago, for he stood at one of the tall, narrow windows that faced the half-circle drive. His back was to her; perhaps he hadn\u2019t heard the door open and close . . . or perhaps he was merely preparing them both for the inevitable.</p><p>But Victoria shook that off. What would he have to prepare for? He, a poor American relation, had just inherited a title and estates that would propel him to wealth, status, and a seat in the House of Lords. He had nothing for which to prepare when meeting the woman who was now the Dowager Marchioness of Rockley.</p> <p>He turned, the sunlight behind sending his face and features into shadow. At first, her impression was one of a tall puff of hair and angular shoulders, but then he stepped away from the window, closer to her.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Rockley,\u201d he said in long, easy accents. \u201cI am happy to meet you. I am James Lacy, and it is my pleasure to live with you under this roof.\u201d</p><p>The whole package\u2014his drawling speech, the pure joy in his face, the sag of his ill-fitting clothing\u2014was so different from Phillip that immediately Victoria felt a combination of relief and regret. And then his words sunk in.</p><p>Apparently they penetrated his consciousness at the same moment, for his tanned cheeks tightened and his eyes widened. \u201cOh, forgive me, Mrs. Rockley. I didn\u2019t mean what I said. I meant\u201d\u2014by now he was beginning to smile, and so was she\u2014\u201cthat you are welcome to stay here with me as long as you wish. That you don\u2019t have to rush to move out,\u201d he amended hastily. \u201cI\u2019ve had my things put in a guest chamber.\u201d</p><p>And at that moment, Victoria felt her fears slip away. Not because he\u2019d offered to let her stay, but because this man was so unlike Phillip, so far removed from the genteel, proper man she\u2019d loved, that his taking over the title would never be as difficult and painful as she\u2019d expected it to be.</p><p>He must be a very distant relation of the de Lacys, for, at least initially, she saw nothing reminiscent of her husband in the man\u2019s physical appearance. Where Phillip\u2019s hair had been the color of walnuts, this man\u2019s high sweep of hair was the color of deer hide. His brown eyes crinkled deeply at the corners, suggesting either frequent smiles, or much time squinting against the sun. Since his skin was tanned and weather-beaten, she presumed it was the latter. James Lacy, as he\u2019d called himself, now Rockley to one and all in England, was perhaps five years younger than Phillip would have been had he lived. Victoria placed his age at about twenty-three.</p><p>If Lady Melly were there to see his attire, she would have been appalled. Although he wore pantaloons, a shirtwaist, and a coat like any other English gentleman, his clothing gave clear indication that he\u2019d never sat for a tailor fitting. The pantaloons bagged at the knees and even above them, and his coat was too short for his long arms.</p><p>Her examination completed in an instant, Victoria now made a curtsy to him. \u201cLord Rockley, I am delighted to make your acquaintance, and I\u2019d like to welcome you to St. Heath\u2019s Row.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mrs. Rockley.\u201d Then he looked abashed, and smiled sheepishly. \u201cOr is it Mrs. de Lacy? I trust you\u2019ll help me to sort out all of the things I must learn about society here\u2014the titles, the manners, and whatever that heavy thing is that seems to be so important. I\u2019ve only disembarked from my ship three hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavy thing?\u201d Victoria repeated as she tapped back a bit of panic. The last thing she needed was another task to add to her list. Despite the charm of his openly self-deprecating tone and his informal amiability, she had no desire to tutor him into his place in Society. Surely he didn\u2019t truly expect it of her. \u201cForgive me, but I\u2019m not at all certain to what you\u2019re referring. And, the proper way to address me would be Lady Rockley, or my lady. And you will now simply be called Rockley, as you have thus taken on the title of the Marquess of Rockley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in the eyes of London, I\u2019m no longer James Lacy, Kentuckian?\u201d He had a bemused expression on his face, as though he could barely conceive of losing his identity. \u201cI become no one but a title?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly your intimates would call you James,\u201d Victoria explained. \u201cYour name will change so that all might attribute your title and estate to you, but you will still be yourself, James Lacy, the Kentuckian\u2014whoever that might be.\u201d Just as she was still Victoria Gardella Grantworth de Lacy\u2014yet also a born Venator.</p><p>He looked at her for a moment, long enough that she felt the urge to blush. \u201cSo perhaps my wife might call me by my given name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I believe that is quite common . . . particularly in more private settings.\u201d Feeling as though the conversation had quite gotten out of her control, Victoria gave another little curtsy designed to be a farewell. \u201cI will excuse myself now, my lord, and begin to make arrangements to give over the master\u2019s chambers now that you have arrived. I apologize for not having already done so, immediately upon my return here from Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, reaching for her\u2014and then stopping, as if realizing he\u2019d overstepped. \u201cNo, Mrs.\u2014my lady. Please don\u2019t get your dander up over my account. I\u2019m well used to a much smaller, less fancy abode than this. I\u2019d feel very ungentlemanly if I felt as though I\u2019d displaced you. There will be time enough for that later. There must be some other place that I could put my things.\u201d Whenever he said \u201cI\u201d it sounded as if he was suddenly comprehending something. It came out sounding like \u201cah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is very kind of you,\u201d Victoria replied, unsure of how she felt about his protestations. Part of her had wanted an excuse to move from the chambers that belonged to the lady of the house, which attached to the master\u2019s rooms. And the other part of her wasn\u2019t quite ready to let them, along with their bittersweet memories, go. \u201cAnd there are many very comfortable chambers available for your pleasure. I\u2019ll express your wishes to the staff if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be greatly appreciated. I must confess my ear is not used to hearin\u2019 the accents, and I have had a terrible time understandin\u2019 the butler\u2014is that who he is? The one whose eyebrows stick out further than his nose?\u201d At Victoria\u2019s surprised smile and nod, he continued in his own oddly accented voice, \u201cIt took me three times to understand that I should let the groom take my horse, and that I couldn\u2019t have tea until three o\u2019clock\u2014although he did offer me some other food, something he called \u2018repast.\u2019 In Kentucky, we don\u2019t drink a lot of tea, but when we do, it\u2019s whenever the urge strikes us. Not at three.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria couldn\u2019t contain the little amused smile that escaped, and immediately she bit her lip. The last thing she wanted to do was to offend him. His humor and charm were refreshing, absurd enough to make her forget that the rest of her life was too bloody dark. He would have the ladies in the ton eating out of his hand in no time. And then she realized what he\u2019d meant earlier. \u201cOh, the heavy thing. Do you mean the ton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s it. Where do we find the ton? And what do we do with it?\u201d</p><p>Stifling another smile, Victoria explained that the haute ton was the nickname for the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of London Society\u2014and that he was now a member of \u201cthe heavy thing.\u201d By the time she was finished, they were both chuckling. Their conversation ended with James, as he\u2019d insisted she call him\u2014\u201cfor if you don\u2019t, I won\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to!\u201d\u2014extracting a promise that she would join him for dinner that evening in the main dining room.</p> <p>She would make a visit to Kritanu, who was with Briyani\u2019s body in the chapel, then have time to dress for dinner.</p><p>Despite the time it would take away from other matters, Victoria had a suspicion that the meal would likely be the most enjoyable part of her day.</p><p>That night, it was well past eleven by the time Victoria excused herself from James Lacy and his newfound enjoyment of a French brandy from Armagnac. Apparently he was used to something they drank in Kentucky called rotgut, which sounded as horrible as he claimed it tasted. She herself had had two glasses of sherry\u2014one more than usual\u2014and she was feeling more than a little loose-limbed.</p><p>Yet, as she climbed the stairs, it all came back to her: less than twenty-four hours earlier, she and Sebastian had been slogging through an underground river of sewage. And the rest of the day\u2019s events had left her even more worried, confused, and grieving.</p><p>Inside her chamber, she pulled the cord to summon her maid, Verbena, to assist her in preparing for bed. Or perhaps not. . . .</p> <p>A lamp had been left burning low on her dressing table, and Victoria refrained from turning it brighter. Instead, she walked over to the tall window that gave her a view of the moonlit gardens below. Behind her, the room was lit with a bare glow, enabling her to see through the pane. There was only a quarter moon and clouds obscured many of the stars, so the grounds were painted mostly in heavy shades of black and dark blue. A pale sweep of gray designated a pea gravel path, and a cluster of lilac bushes rose in dark relief next to a glowing white bench that happened to catch the glare of the moonbeams.</p><p>She touched the cool glass, considering. Perhaps she should be on the streets tonight, trying to find out what she could about a vampire that attacked in the daylight.</p><p>Or perhaps it would be best to get a solid night\u2019s sleep and allow her mind to clear of sherry, as well as the reality of the problems she faced.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>Despite the fact that Sebastian was here in London with her, he came and went as he pleased, and Victoria felt utterly alone. She was without her Venator companions, far from the people who understood her and what her life was.</p><p>Max was gone, somewhere, God knew where. Wayren was in Rome, along with the other Venators Victoria had come to know and like\u2014Brim, and Michalas, and others.</p> <p>Aunt Eustacia was dead. Kritanu, though here, was grieving his nephew, and still reeling from the loss of Aunt Eustacia.</p><p>She also felt the loss of kind, gentle Zavier, a Venator who had made his desire to court Victoria quite clear. He had died at the hands of Beauregard.</p><p>She heard the faint snick of a door as Verbena came in behind her, entering through the sitting room that sat between the marquess\u2019s chamber and that of the marchioness. Still trying to decide whether to have her maid dress her in a night rail or in men\u2019s trousers, Victoria continued staring out the window.</p><p>She realized a fraction of a second later that Verbena was never so quiet, no matter what time it was or how tired she might be. Victoria\u2019s heart gave a little bump and the hair on her arms lifted.</p><p>Just as she started to whirl away from the window, a shadow moved behind her\u2014a blurred reflection in the pane, and then it shifted out of sight. Strong hands closed over her shoulders, halting her in midpivot. Although he wasn\u2019t standing so as to reflect in the window, she recognized him now\u2014by the way he touched her, the familiar scent that lingered on his fingers, the way his body brushed against hers. Her edgy nerves settled.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Verbena?\u201d she demanded. She didn\u2019t attempt to turn toward him.</p><p>\u201cSleeping quite soundly, I believe,\u201d he said. \u201cA comely girl, but repose is definitely not her most attractive state. Her snores are like to rattle the windows from their frames, and would be fairly off-putting to a gentleman who might wish to . . . er . . . lie . . . with her . . . though I\u2019d venture to say that the poor beleaguered Oliver would seize the opportunity if offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rang for her. She\u2019ll be here any moment now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken.\u201d In the window\u2019s reflection, his arm lifted from her shoulder and she saw that he was holding a slender rope.</p><p>\u201cYou cut the bellpull?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin your reputation, Lady Rockley,\u201d he said in a low purr. \u201cAt least here.\u201d He moved closer, brushing up against the back of her from shoulder blade to bum to heel. His proximity brought warmth to her bare shoulders. \u201cEspecially now that the new marquess has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have served you right, Sebastian, if you\u2019d sneaked into the wrong chamber. What if I\u2019d had my belongings moved to a different one, as would be expected?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, his breath ruffling her hair. His hands had closed over the tops of her shoulders and began to rub them, gently moving the narrow bands of sleeves up and down over the curve. \u201cWhy do you think Verbena is sleeping so soundly? She had no qualms about chatting with me over a little turn of brandy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014into which you no doubt slipped a bit of salvi, to help your cause. No wonder she\u2019s snoring.\u201d Victoria would have died before admitting it, but the gentle caresses over her arms lulled her from annoyance and edginess to . . . comfort. Perhaps something more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing if not prepared\u2014and resourceful.\u201d</p><p>Victoria pulled gently away and turned. \u201cAs much as I\u2019m enjoying your attempts at seduction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are?\u201d His sensual lips widened into a delicious smile. \u201cAnd here I thought I\u2019d lost\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014I must presume you have another reason for arranging this assignation.\u201d They were standing very close, slippers and boots staggered against each other. Her hem brushed the tops of his feet, and her full skirt edged between his ankles. He was looking down at her, his golden-brown hair a thick and wavy nimbus in the lamplight.</p><p>\u201cYou must? How . . . devastating.\u201d He tugged her into his arms at the same moment, pulling her close, so close that she could see his eyelashes, even in the low light.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were quite angry with me this morning,\u201d she whispered, suddenly glad that he seemed to be no longer. Her heart was thudding in her chest, and the room felt very close and warm. Something seemed to have clicked inside her, opened, loosened. And she didn\u2019t think it was just due to the sherry.</p><p>\u201cI was. And most likely still am,\u201d he replied, his breath warm on her face. \u201cBut right at this moment . . . I don\u2019t quite recall why.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she did either.</p><p>Victoria stepped closer, her foot sliding between his large booted ones as she met his mouth. Warmth flooded through her as though it had been released from some strict reservoir, and she sagged against him. His body was lean and solid, and as their mouths melded together, she moved her hands to touch his chest. It was warm under the linen shirt he wore, and she felt the curve of the muscle flexing there.</p><p>Before she could protest, Sebastian was pulling at the buttons at the back of her gown. \u201cPerhaps I could take Verbena\u2019s place this evening,\u201d he said after a particularly long, delving kiss.</p><p>Victoria snickered against his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you,\u201d she murmured, tugging away his neck cloth. \u201cI thought you were more original. I imagine there must be dozens of eager lovers all over London offering to act as ladies\u2019 maids on any given day.\u201d</p><p>He huffed a small laugh against her neck, close enough to the sensitive part near her ear that she quivered. \u201cIf I\u2019ve lost my rapier wit, it\u2019s only because of you, Victoria.\u201d She felt him draw in a breath, his chest expanding beneath her hands. He covered her lips again, drawing her sharply against him, plunging and twisting his tongue deeply into her mouth.</p><p>She allowed herself to taste him, the slick, sensual warmth flavored with brandy and clove, to let him coax and tease and seduce her with his mouth.</p><p>And then she pulled easily away, firmly stepping back. \u201cI have something to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled crookedly at her. \u201cAh, well, I knew it couldn\u2019t last. And, alas, I have things to tell you as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t come here expressly to seduce me.\u201d She stepped away from the window and gestured to one of the two wingback chairs. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d care to take a seat.\u201d Then she turned the lamp brighter.</p><p>\u201cAh, civility rears its ugly head,\u201d he sighed, taking her suggestion. \u201cWould you consider me uncouth if I mentioned how much, at this moment, I despise civility?\u201d</p><p>Victoria chose to ignore him. \u201cAre you going to give me the copper ring? You took yourself off so quickly this morning that I didn\u2019t have a chance to ask\u2014purposely, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly have the sound of your aunt in your tone, now that you\u2019ve taken her place as Illa Gardella.\u201d He sat with one ankle positioned over his knee, lounging back into the depths of the chair.</p><p>\u201cNo prevarications, Sebastian. I take my role as the leader of the Venators\u2014of which you are one\u2014as seriously as she did. What do you plan to do with the ring?\u201d She sat in the other wingback chair and faced him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe ring is one of the five Rings of Jubai that Lilith had made for her most trusted Guardian vampires,\u201d Sebastian explained. Guardians were undead who had eyes that glowed ruby pink when they were angry. They were part of the vampire queen\u2019s elite guard, and had the particular ability to easily enthrall mortals. They were very hard to kill. Beauregard had been a Guardian vampire. \u201cUnfortunately, though you might expect otherwise, my grandfather was not one of the recipients of the five rings.\u201d</p><p>Victoria gave a little laugh. \u201cTo the contrary. Knowing Beauregard as I did, I\u2019m not at all surprised Lilith didn\u2019t count him as one of her most trusted Guardians. Not only did there seem to be no love lost between them, but he also was clearly a creature concerned only with himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll allow your disparaging comment about my grandfather to pass for now,\u201d Sebastian said in a cooler voice. \u201cI\u2019m not ignorant of his faults, but he was still my grandfather and he never caused me any harm. What he did to you\u2014tried to do\u2014was unacceptable, and I reacted accordingly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do have my gratitude for that,\u201d Victoria replied, fervently meaning it.</p><p>\u201cYour gratitude? Ah, what a wealthy man am I,\u201d he said dryly. Then his flippancy evaporated and a serious expression took over. \u201cBefore we talk further, there\u2019s somethingI must tell you. I\u2019ll get back to the Rings of Jubai in a moment, but first . . . Victoria, do you feel all of a piece? Since you . . . woke up, do you feel different?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him and recognized something desperate in his face, and stopped her reflexive \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d response. \u201cMost of the time, I feel . . . the same. But there are moments when I do not.\u201d Like when she was angry, her vision threatened to tinge red\u2014literally. And earlier today, when Gwendolyn had been prattling on about her happiness and her wedding . . . how that surge of envy had caught Victoria by surprise, making her cold and angry. She\u2019d been a lot more angry lately, come to think of it.</p><p>Or . . . when she\u2019d smelled the blood in the underground abbey . . .</p><p>Now that she put it together, it made horrible, awful sense. She felt her face drain of color and feeling. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p> <p>He seemed to understand, and reached for her arm. His slender fingers closed gently over the top of her hand. \u201cVictoria, I\u2019m certain you\u2019re not a vampire . . . but I do fear that you still carry some residue of Beauregard\u2019s attempt to turn you. I still . . . I feel the presence of an undead when I\u2019m near you.\u201d</p><p>She stared for a moment without seeing as the pieces clunked into place. \u201cThat was why you didn\u2019t seem to notice the vampires down in the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>He nodded ruefully. \u201cYour presence makes it difficult for me to sense other\u2014er, the undead.\u201d</p><p>Victoria thought for a moment. \u201cDoes Wayren know? How about Max? And Ylito?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWayren knows, and I\u2019m certain she\u2019s told Ylito and Hannever, for if there\u2019s any hope of an antidote, they would help. As for Pesaro\u2014well, he is aware of the situation. But . . . of course, he has his own concerns.\u201d</p><p>Yes, indeed he did. But she felt hollow anyway.</p> <p>Sebastian remained silent for a moment as if to allow her thoughts to sink in, then he spoke. \u201cThe reason I wanted to find the underground abbey was not just to retrieve the ring, but also some old documents. The monks wrote not only holy pieces, apparently, but unholy ones as well\u2014some vampiric history, as well as other information\u2014and according to Beauregard, they might be of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf interest to whom\u2014the undead or the Venators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither one.\u201d He smiled ruefully. \u201cI thought perhaps there might be information in them about another Venator who was nearly turned undead, and it might be relevant to . . . your situation.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had heard of the four Venators who had been turned to vampires over the ages. Only four . . . but still. Their vis bullae hadn\u2019t saved them . . . although each had been wearing only a single one. \u201cDid you find the documents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They weren\u2019t there with the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to go back?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. As you are aware, I generally prefer not to step into the lair of the lion, and it\u2019s quite obvious that the undead have been making use of the place. After you drove Lilith from London two years ago, the number of undead decreased greatly. But it seems they might be resettling here once again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a vampire who moves about and attacks in daylight?\u201d Victoria asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe only way that could happen is if the vampire drank of the special potion.\u201d</p><p>Victoria narrowed her eyes. \u201cThe recipe we found behindthe Door of Alchemy in Rome? The one that you stole from the Consilium?\u201d She tasted bitterness at the reminder of his betrayal.</p><p>Two months ago in Rome, she and Max had raced against the vampires and Tutela to find the keys that opened the door to an alchemical laboratory that had been locked for more than a century. They\u2019d succeeded in being there first, and had retrieved the notes and papers hidden behind the door, but Sebastian had stolen one of the pages to give to his grandfather Beauregard.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only one I know of,\u201d he replied evenly, meeting her eyes without shame. \u201cYou can stop stabbing me with your eyes. You\u2019ve already left a scar on my shoulder,\u201d he said, gesturing to where she\u2019d stabbed him with the stake meant for Beauregard.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gotten in my way.\u201d</p><p>His mobile lips thinned; obviously, he read the double meaning there. \u201cSpeaking of prevarication\u2014Victoria, are you saying you\u2019ve seen a vampire in the daylight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot directly, but I saw the fresh remains of his\u2014or her\u2014attack on a mortal. During midday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it would appear that somehow, either you were mistaken\u2014which of course is unlikely\u2014or that the formula for the potion has fallen into the very hands from which you and Pesaro tried to keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently. And if you hadn\u2019t taken it from the Consilium at the behest of your grandfather, it might still be there, safely ensconced. What did you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you not recall? Beauregard showed it to you when you were in his chambers,\u201d Sebastian returned, his voice softening slightly. \u201cI meant to return to retrieve it, but when I did so, it was gone. Someone else found it first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why did I not sense the presence of the undead in the park today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that is the other important benefit of the potion. It gives the undead a mortal-like aura that keeps us from recognizing them, and allows them to move about as one of us.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt a chill over her that had nothing to do with the presence of vampires. \u201cThat could be devastating to us,\u201d she murmured, standing abruptly. \u201cIf they can move about, and we can\u2019t sense them . . .\u201d She paced over to her dressing table, where the lamp had begun to gutter in its low kerosene. \u201cThey could move about, anywhere, anytime . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a pleasant thought, indeed,\u201d Sebastian said. His voice was closer, and she heard the faint creak of a floorboard as he moved from his chair.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where Max is?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She felt him become still, and she turned back toward him. \u201cRunning from Lilith, I believe.\u201d His laugh had an odd note to it. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the chap myself . . . if I\u2019d been caught by that vile creature, and finally broke free, I\u2019d do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to know about Briyani. I\u2019ve sent a message to Wayren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m certain she\u2019ll find a way to notify Pesaro. It seems to me you have other concerns now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian, why did you do it?\u201d Victoria asked, suddenly feeling the pain of loneliness and betrayal. \u201cWhy did you steal from us? Why did you try to help Beauregard?\u201d</p><p>He had the grace to look abashed\u2014a decidedly unfamiliar expression on his face. \u201cI acted irresponsibly and foolishly. I listened to him\u2014he had the ability to enthrall me to some extent, even though I was usually aware of it and could control it. And he convinced me that it would be helpful in getting vampires and mortals to coexist.\u201d</p><p>Victoria gave an unladylike snort. \u201cAnd you believed him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove can be blinding sometimes, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a moment. It felt as though something in the air had shifted, broken . . . settled. \u201cIt can.\u201d She drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly. She\u2019d made her own mistakes for love\u2014marrying a mortal who had no idea about her secret life. And then lying to him, drugging him with salvi so that she could hunt vampires, thus endangering him and others that she loved.</p><p>Love was most certainly blinding.</p><p>Somehow, he must have understood what was in her face, for the next thing she knew, Sebastian was there again, drawing her into his arms. He lowered his mouth to hers, softly, as if in question.</p><p>She closed her eyes, kissed him back. She drew in his essence, his presence, pushed back the loneliness that had threatened her this day, these last weeks and months.</p><p>For this moment, this was comfort. This was Sebastian.</p><p>The kiss left her breathless, and suddenly Victoria felt the hip-high bed behind her, its edge pressing into the small of her back as Sebastian pressed into her front. Her gown gapped freely in the bodice due to his nimble fingers at the buttons along her spine. When he tipped her onto the bed, the coverlet was cool against her bare back.</p><p>His hands shifted smoothly to pull the fabric away as she looked up, dazed and desirous. It had been a long time. . . . The bed hangings were open, and beyond the heavy maple canopy frame, she saw the painting of Circe and Odysseus.</p><p>The fog of sherry and pleasure dissipated, and Victoriacame back to herself. She sat up abruptly, nearly striking him on the chin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, looking around the room, remembering where she was. A chill raced over her, raising unpleasant goose pimples as she realized\u2014oh, a myriad of reasons why she couldn\u2019t do this. \u201cSebastian . . . not here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not where she and Phillip had made love, only a few precious times during their short marriage.</p><p>Not here, where she\u2019d kissed him for the last time, felt his hands on her body and the length of him next to her . . . just before she drove a lethal stake into his heart.</p><p>Not on this bed, or in this room . . . or in this house.</p> <p>Five</p><p>In Which a Painting Is Criticized</p><p>Max moved with the shadows, alternating his quiet footsteps with the call of a night animal or the sift of wind through the trees.</p><p>The last time he\u2019d been here at St. Heath\u2019s Row, slipping silently across the trimmed lawn and between the well-tended yew hedges, was nearly two years ago. That time he\u2019d had no trouble gaining access to the residence, for Victoria had dismissed all of the servants for the evening.</p><p>She had been expecting the return of her husband as well.</p> <p>Max had followed Rockley through the house, unseen and unnoticed by the vampire who was driven purely by the need for his wife\u2019s blood. He could have staked the creature on more than one occasion\u2014just beyond the gates of the estate, as Rockley crossed the threshold of his own home, as he mounted the stairs, drawn by Victoria\u2019s scent and her heartbeat.</p><p>But Max had waited.</p><p>Instead, he\u2019d followed, listened, paused outside of the door Rockley had left open. The door leading to the chamber where she slept.</p><p>The sounds, the unmistakable ones of shifting bedclothes and sliding lips, of sighs, intimate murmurs, and ratcheting breathing at last forced him to peer into the room. The stake firm in his hand, Max tensed, tasting bitter disappointment . . . and a bit of self-righteousness. He had been right to come, for he was prepared to do what had to be done, what she was too bloody blind, too weak to do. . . .</p><p>Then he saw her arm raise high, an elegant, slender limb caught by moonlight above the rumpled coverlet. And she plunged the stake down into the dark.</p><p>He saw the small explosion of silvery ash, heard the faint sob of grief, and he lowered his stake.</p> <p>When at last she pulled herself up to sit, her rich, black curls had poured over her shoulders and gauzy white gown. That moment, that colorless image of pale skin, shadowed eyes, a streak of tears, was indelibly printed in his memory. He\u2019d never forget the glaze of moonlight over her features, haunted yet determined, when she turned to look at him.</p><p>At last, she truly understood.</p><p>And that was the moment everything changed.</p><p>Tonight, he had no need or desire to enter the house. His destination was the small chapel on the grounds, and it was this brick building that he approached after making his way beyond the looming house.</p><p>The wooden doors curved at the top, forming a gentle point, but they weren\u2019t locked. They made only a soft snuffing sound when Max eased through.</p><p>The space was small, barely larger than a parlor. Four rows of benches lined each side of the aisle, padded with red velvet cushions. Candles of varying heights and widths burned around the altar and on the floor. The body, bound in white cloth, lay on a table in the center of the dais. Frankincense burning in a shallow bowl mingled its scent with that of the musky balm applied to the corpse\u2019s wrappings.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Kritanu pulled smoothly to his feet. Despite his seven decades, he was as agile and strong as a man half his age. His jet-black hair had held no hint of gray until the death of Eustacia, only six months ago, when a wide streak of white had appeared overnight. His face also showed the depths of his grief: hollow mahogany cheeks, his skin so taut it shone, the squareness of his jaw more pronounced. \u201cYou should not have risked coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I must.\u201d Max strode up the aisle, his long legs making short work of the distance. He paused at the altar, facing the body of the man who\u2019d been his companion for eight years.</p> <p>Death was nothing new to him; in fact, he would eagerly accept it for himself. He\u2019d wished for it more than once. Eustacia had said that was part of the reason he was so skilled as a Venator.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t grieve for the loss of a friend.</p><p>After a moment of prayer and commendation, he turned to Kritanu. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Those words, very simple, said many things.</p><p>The elder man\u2019s eyes shone with the understanding of all of them, the pinpoint of candlelight reflecting in his black orbs. \u201cBriyani made his own choices, Max, just as you do. He fully understood the risk of staying with you. I\u2019m glad he did. You should not be alone.\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s lips pulled in a humorless smile. \u201cNor should you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou took a great chance in coming here tonight. I told you it wasn\u2019t necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see him. To say good-bye.\u201d As he hadn\u2019t been able to do with Eustacia. Or Father. Or his sister Giulia. \u201cI know how to move about unseen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Victoria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs apparently otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>Kritanu looked at him, something suspiciously like pity in his handsome face. \u201cAnd you shan\u2019t tell her you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to be ordered about, as she would be wont to do. To be at her beck and call. I\u2019m no longer a Venator, and can be of little use to her or to any of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why come to London? The world is vast, and there are many places to hide from Lilith that she would never suspect.\u201d</p><p>No one was more acutely aware of that fact than Max himself. But he\u2019d been compelled to come to London, foolish as it had been.</p><p>He bloody well could have gone on, knowing that it would be safer for everyone if he went to Spain or Denmark or America, or even the wilds of Africa. Lilith would never find him there. But Vioget had raised the concern about Victoria, leaving Max with little choice but to assure himself all was well.</p><p>And, apparently, Vioget was still taking his job as protector quite seriously.</p><p>At least Max could give him credit for that.</p><p>He realized Kritanu was still watching him and selected a slightly easier topic. \u201cBriyani and I were in Vauxhall, looking for vampires, when we got separated. I found some undead, but he never returned to our rooms. I returned to Vauxhall hours later and found no trace of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriyani wanted to be a Venator,\u201d Kritanu said. \u201cHe was a better Comitator than he would have been as a Venator, but he was preparing to attempt the trial for the vis bulla. I suspect he would not have succeeded, for although he was very brave, and a skillful combatant, he lacked many necessary attributes, including a cool head under pressure.\u201d</p><p>Max looked at the swaddled corpse. Grief stirred again, more deeply. \u201cI didn\u2019t know of his intentions.\u201d The flash of a memory of his own trial, where he knew the choice was either success or death, assaulted him. He\u2019d been more prepared for death than for success, for only five men over the centuries had ever achieved the vis bulla without the blood of the Gardellas in their veins.</p><p>Kritanu turned from his nephew and looked up at Max. \u201cHow does your training go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve neglected it as of late.\u201d Yet, his body desired it\u2014the quick, measured swipes with the kadhara knife, the kicks and leaps and thrusts of hand-to-hand kalaripayattu . . . and especially, the easy gliding of qinggong, where his body actually left the ground in long, sweeping arcs.</p><p>\u201cWhy should you do so? A lack of vis bulla does not eliminate what you have learned these years, Max.\u201d</p><p>A soft scuff drew their attention to the entrance to the chapel, and Max immediately began to slip into the shadowy alcove next to the altar. It was better for Victoria not to know he was here.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Victoria who moved toward them.</p><p>\u201cPesaro. Such an unexpected pleasure,\u201d Sebastian said as he drew near.</p><p>Max sensed an air of frustration about Vioget and saw no reason to let it pass. \u201cIt\u2019s rather early to be ending the evening, isn\u2019t it? I thought you\u2019d be engaged much longer.\u201d He scanned the other man\u2019s well-tailored coat and the white shirt that, though still tied at the throat, was missing a neck cloth.</p><p>Vioget\u2019s eyes narrowed, but then he smiled coolly. \u201cIf it\u2019s Victoria for whom you\u2019re concerned, allow me to assure you that she\u2019s happily ensconced in her bedchamber. With a smile on her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the painting of Circe and Odysseus in full view.\u201d He assumed the picture in its heavy gold frame hadn\u2019t been moved. \u201cNot the finest rendition, but an acceptable one nevertheless.\u201d</p><p>Vioget\u2019s expression darkened, validating Max\u2019s assumption, but then his features rearranged into another smile, laced with contempt. \u201cDoes Victoria know that you\u2019ve been skulking around London, unwilling to show your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree. She should know you\u2019re here, so that arrangements can be made to see to your protection. I\u2019ll be certain to advise her of your presence.\u201d Vioget fairly oozed condescension and confidence and Max felt a sharp pain shoot along his jaw as he ground his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m certain she\u2019ll want to see for herself that you\u2019re safe, particularly in light of poor Briyani\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would delight you no end, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Max was under no illusion. Vioget knew that he would show to his best advantage next to a weakened, vis bulla-less Max, who had been reduced to living on the run. Merely a man.</p><p>The other man\u2019s reply was nothing more than a bland smile.</p><p>Six</p><p>A Crowded Parlor</p><p>Victoria knew it would only be a matter of time before the news of James\u2019s arrival spread. But even she didn\u2019t account for the efficiency of the gossip trail spread by the house servants\u2014as evidenced by the presentation of Lady Melly in St. Heath\u2019s Row\u2019s parlor scarcely past noon the next day.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. She\u2019d brought reinforcements in the form of Ladies Nilly and Winnie . . . and a bulging portmanteau.</p><p>\u201cHello Mother,\u201d Victoria greeted her, trying to sound more glad than she felt. \u201cI thought you were going to the race today with Lord Jellington.\u201d Lady Melly\u2019s beau had nearly lost his position when she was in Rome, being wooed by a handsome vampire. A vampire who\u2019d turned out to be Sara Regalado\u2019s father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI thought it would be best if I\u2014we,\u201d she added, gesturing to Nilly and Winnie as if their presence might protect her from Victoria\u2019s annoyance, \u201cpaid a call to determine whether you\u2019d recovered from your fright yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d squeaked Lady Nilly, her pale, slender hands fluttering at her throat. \u201cI cannot even imagine how you must have felt after seeing that poor girl! Why, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d not sleep for a week, for fear of the nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, nightmares,\u201d inserted Lady Winnie in a rather carrying voice. Her hand hovered over the plate of cinnamon-iced almond biscuits that had been summoned at the instant of their arrival\u2014despite the fact that they were three hours early for afternoon calls. \u201cI know all about them, I do. Why, I daresay, that visit to Rome put me in a state, for I\u2019ve nary slept a wink since the trip. I spend all night tossing and turning, dreaming about vampires and other horrific things.\u201d She paused in her search for the perfect biscuit\u2014namely, the largest and with the thickest swirl of icing\u2014to pat her hand over the saucer-sized silver and gold cross she wore pinned to the side of her bodice. Its weight caused the blue floral muslin to sag slightly, pulling the scoop neckline off center just a bit.</p> <p>\u201cVampires!\u201d Nilly had no compunction about her selection. She slipped right in and swiped a most promising treat right from under the duchess\u2019s poised hand. \u201cI declare, I\u2019m certain we must have talked about this before and you\u2019re quite mistaken, Winnie. I\u2019m the one who has been dreaming about vampires ever since Rome! You\u2019ve only started since I told you about my dreams\u2014the dark, cunning men, swooping down in dark halls, cornering me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Victoria found it necessary to interrupt and, from long experience, knew that the best tactic was to completely change the subject. \u201cMother, I\u2019m feeling quite well today, after all. Thank you for your concern. I truly do appreciate it.\u201d She tried not to glance at the portmanteau. Perhaps if she didn\u2019t see it, it would leave with her mother without fuss.</p><p>Lady Melly leaned forward and patted her daughter\u2019s ungloved hand. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear it! Now, of course, since you\u2019ve recovered, you\u2019ll be able to attend the Twisdale\u2019s garden party tonight with me. I\u2019ll call Melvindale in\u2014she\u2019s waiting in the carriage with my trunks\u2014and she\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour trunks?\u201d Victoria was aware that the pitch of her voice was sharp as a roof\u2019s peak, but she didn\u2019t care. Her control of the situation\u2014along with the almond biscuits\u2014 was rapidly disappearing.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my dear. You simply cannot go on as you have, even though you are a widow. One night is fine, especially if no one knows about it\u2014which is possible, since I came as soon as I heard\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMother. Thank you.\u201d Victoria struggled to keep her composure in the face of the runaway curricle that was her maternal parent. \u201cI don\u2019t need a chaperone. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but Victoria, of course you do! You still must protect your reputation if you want to marry again,\u201d said Lady Nilly, spraying almond crumbs with abandon.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you might even catch the eye of one of the most eligible bachelors to grace our Society,\u201d added Lady Winnie with a familiar gleam in her eyes. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019ve already had the pleasure of meeting him, and it would be so much simpler\u2014\u201d</p><p>Whatever Victoria might have said to puncture the duchess\u2019s\u2014and, clearly, Lady Melly\u2019s\u2014outlandish hopes was forever lost as the tall white doors to the parlor opened.</p><p>\u201cThe Marquess of Rockley,\u201d intoned Lettender.</p><p>As one, the three older ladies surged to their feet and turned toward the new arrival. Victoria steadied the tea table, then turned to greet James.</p> <p>He looked rough and windblown this morning, just as unkempt as he\u2019d done yesterday with the exception of his clothing. Apparently the staff had seen to more than just gossip, for he was dressed from head to toe as befit his station.</p><p>Victoria refused to let herself look too closely, for fear that she might recognize some of the clothing as Phillip\u2019s . . . and it was just better not to. She still had his cloak and one of his tall hats stuffed in the back of her wardrobe, and she often used them when she went out at night dressed as a man. She fancied they still carried the scent of his lemon-rosemary pomade.</p><p>By the time Victoria rejoined the conversation, James and his American drawl had been fussed over by the three ladies, and he was on the sofa between Ladies Winnie and Melly. In other words, exactly where they wanted him.</p><p>\u201cSo you see, my lord,\u201d Lady Melly was saying, \u201cwe certainly will take advantage of your hospitality while my daughter sees to her personal affects being prepared for removal\u2014which I\u2019m certain will take several weeks to be done properly, of course\u2014but it simply isn\u2019t done for her to stay under your roof without a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to have you here,\u201d James was saying with what appeared to be complete sincerity. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to ruin Mrs.\u2014er, Lady Rockley\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd aside of that, the duchess and Lady Petronilla and I would be honored to help you sift through those\u201d\u2014 she gestured to a tray overflowing already with new invitations\u2014\u201cand determine which ones to accept, and which ones might be best ignored, if you follow my thinking,\u201d Lady Melly said with a knowing look. \u201cIn fact, we were just about to discuss our plans for this evening, which include a garden party at the Twisdale residence.\u201d</p><p>Victoria could sit back no longer. \u201cThank you very much, Lord Rockley\u201d\u2014how horribly odd it felt to say that to a stranger\u2014\u201cfor your hospitality, but I have already decided to move myself from St. Heath\u2019s Row, which I should have done immediately upon my return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria, I can hardly bear to tell you this, but . . . the roof at Grantworth House\u2014it\u2019s being repaired. A huge tree branch fell on it, just over the place where your chambers were, and it won\u2019t be habitable for weeks.\u201d Lady Melly looked over at James, who appeared to have the tiniest nag of a smile at the corner of his mouth. Thank God he seemed not to be as gullible as he appeared. \u201cSo there is no place for you to stay at Grantworth House\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear about the repairs. That\u2019s the first I knew of them,\u201d Victoria returned with an exaggerated sweetness in her voice. \u201cAnd what a sacrifice for you to offer to stay here when there is such a crisis at home. But, I meant to say that I have already begun to make arrangements to move to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s old town house. If you recall, she deeded it to me upon her death.\u201d</p><p>Lady Melly\u2019s face fell like a ruined souffl\u00e9, and Victoria could actually see the thoughts whirling about in her mind as she tried to extricate excuses and arguments. \u201cOh, dear, Victoria, but your aunt\u2019s town house is in such an unfashionable part of Town. Why, it would be much more convenient to stay here at St. Heath\u2019s Row. There\u2019s plenty of room\u2014\u201d</p><p>This time, it was Lady Melly\u2019s contentions that were cut off by the opening of the tall white doors.</p><p>\u201cMiss Gwendolyn Starcasset, Mr. George Starcasset, and Signorina Sarafina Regalado,\u201d said the butler in perfect pronunciation. He looked immensely pleased with himself.</p><p>Victoria realized her mouth had begun to sag open, and she snapped her jaws shut as she rose, along with the others, to greet these wholly unexpected guests.</p><p>George Starcasset looked much the same as he had the last time she\u2019d seen him, when he\u2019d been pointing a firearm at her as he ushered her through the hallways of the Palombara Villa in Rome, where the demon Akvan had made his hideout.</p><p>George was older than his sister, but his face bore a trace of youth that gave him dimpled cheeks and a cleft chin. He wasn\u2019t an unattractive man, by any stretch, but his hair was a flat flaxen helmet that curled up at the ends, and his sideburns were too short. Overall, he merely made Victoria want to pat him on the head and send him off to play with his wooden blocks.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t an especially adept villain either, for the one time he\u2019d had Victoria alone and planned to ravage her at gunpoint, it had been much too simple to distract and disarm him. So much so that Victoria hardly credited herself with the escape.</p><p>But there was something different about him now . . . something harder and more confident as he swept his attention over her. There was a knowing look in his eyes, and a hint of challenge.</p><p>She had no worries that he might divulge the specifics of their last few meetings\u2014not only would no one believe it (well, no one except Lady Winnie and Lady Nilly), but those events would definitely not show him in the most esteemed light. Perhaps his self-assured air was because he knew his presence had taken her by surprise, or perhaps it was because of the lovely young woman on his arm, who was clearly managing the event.</p><p>Sara Regalado flounced across the parlor in her perfectly tailored butter yellow day dress. Even Victoria, who was not one to care much for style\u2014at least, not any longer\u2014took notice of the fine Alen\u00e7on lace dripping from the wrist-length sleeves, and the three rows of rosettes and lace decorating the hem of her skirt. The fabric alone was worth notice, for the design of bluebirds and spring green ivy wasn\u2019t stamped on it, but embroidered in painstaking detail.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d Gwen was whispering once all the introductions were made, pulling a chair closer to hers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to meet him! I heard he arrived yesterday, and he seems divine. His accent is so . . . rustic.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, Lady Melly wasn\u2019t the only one who had designs on reinstating Victoria as the Marchioness of Rockley rather than merely the Dowager Marchioness. And since George appeared otherwise engaged, Gwendolyn wasn\u2019t wasting any time.</p><p>\u201cLady Rockley, is splendido to see you again,\u201d said Sara in her accented English. She smiled prettily, but Victoria didn\u2019t trust the glint in her brown eyes. \u201cForse, we might do the shopping together, on Via Fleet, is it? Perhaps you and I and our mutual friend?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOur mutual friend?\u201d Victoria replied. She was damned if she was going to talk to her about Max\u2014let alone admit that she had no idea where he was hiding. For all she knew, Sara had aligned herself with Lilith and was looking for Max herself.</p><p>The thought\u2014absurd as it was, for how would Sara find Lilith? And why?\u2014made her blood run cold.</p><p>\u201cWhy, si, was it not . . . Mrs. Withers, ci credo. Mrs. Emmaline Withers?\u201d The glint turned to laughter in those brown doe eyes, hard and knowing. \u201cDid I not meet her in Roma? Is she not a friend of yours? The povero widow?\u201d</p> <p>Before Victoria could reply, her mother leaped into the fray. \u201cEmmaline Withers? Why, I don\u2019t know any Mrs. Withers, Victoria. What have you been keeping from us.\u201d It was quite pointedly not a question, but a statement. The crease between her eyebrows clearly told Victoria what her words did not.</p><p>But Lady Melly had nothing to fear, and Sara was well aware of it, for Mrs. Withers was merely the name Victoria had used during her visit to Rome. She had done so in order to keep her identity as Aunt Eustacia\u2019s great-niece, a Venator, secret.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, signorina,\u201d Victoria replied. \u201cMrs. Withers is no longer with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon me, I am so sorry for your loss,\u201d Sara replied in a voice as thick as the honey Lady Winnie liked to slop in her tea. \u201cI have suffered a recent loss myself.\u201d She lowered her face as if to hide a sudden tear, a flimsy lace handkerchief suddenly appearing in her hand.</p><p>Victoria had a sudden suspicion that she spoke of her father, the Conte Regalado, who had been wooing Lady Melly. But before she could divert the subject, Lady Nilly interrupted. \u201cOh, my dear, I\u2019m so sorry. Who was it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Sara replied, her face still obscured except for the hard, deadly look she lifted to Victoria. \u201cHe recently met his end because of a horrid woman who destroyed his heart. She is a murderess!\u201d</p><p>Namely, Victoria. The one who had driven the stake into Regalado\u2019s undead chest.</p><p>Well, at least she no longer had to wonder how Sara perceived her.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Lady Melly squeaked as if she\u2019d just seen a mouse. \u201cRegalado. Conte Regalado? Alberto Regalado?\u201d Her face had drained pale except for the spots of red in her cheeks. \u201cI feel rather . . . faint . . . could I . . . could it . . . he was . . .\u201d Another handkerchief fluttered, appearing, surprisingly, from the tanned hand of James Lacy.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s lips firmed. \u201cNonsense, Mother. I\u2019m quite certain you had nothing to do with his . . . er . . . broken heart. Any man\u2019s heart as fragile as dust is not worthy of your esteem. Now, shall I pour you some tea, Gwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Rockley,\u201d said George in his easy voice. \u201cUnderstand you had an unsettling experience in the park yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was horrid,\u201d Lady Nilly announced, her spoon clanking against the sides of her teacup. \u201cWhy, there was blood everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd markings on her chest!\u201d Lady Winnie added. \u201cThree Xs, and her clothes were torn everywhere . . . as if some animal had mauled her.\u201d</p><p>George\u2019s eyebrows rose in unadulterated surprise. \u201cYou were there as well? You saw this horrible sight? Daresay, a sight like that would send m\u2019mother to bed for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we weren\u2019t there, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a terrible sight,\u201d Victoria interrupted firmly. She didn\u2019t know what George and Sara were up to, but she suspected they were quite aware of the details of what she\u2019d seen. It was too much of a coincidence for them to arrive unannounced at her residence the day after she\u2019d seen the results of a vampire attack\u2014in the sunlight, no less. They were both members of the Tutela, and the only conclusion she could draw was that either they were well aware of the attack and wanted to see what Victoria had figured out, or they suspected there was vampire activity, and they were trying to confirm it. Either way, she was understandably disinclined to assist them.</p><p>But before she could respond by changing the subject, the parlor door opened again. \u201cMonsieur Sebastian Vioget,\u201d announced the butler, his nose lifted as though he smelled something a bit unpleasant. Lettender had not been fond of the French since his brother was killed at Waterloo.</p><p>Sebastian, a rakish grin on his face, and not one whit of surprise that the parlor was becoming overcrowded with members of two elite groups\u2014the ton and the Tutela\u2014strode easily into the room and went directly to Victoria\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cHello, my dear,\u201d he said, bending over to place a kiss that screamed intimacy on her cheek. \u201cYou look lovely today.\u201d</p> <p>She was tempted to pull away, just to showcase the effrontery of it, but the look on her mother\u2019s face was too much a work of art to destroy it. Lady Melly looked as though she\u2019d swallowed a biscuit whole, and Lady Winnie, who was swallowing gamely and trying not to cough, probably had.</p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d she said, giving him a sincerely melting smile. His was a friendly face, and at least she had no illusions about what he wanted from her.</p><p>She patted his properly gloved hand and gestured to a chair next to her. \u201cWould you care to join us for tea before we take our ride?\u201d Her voice was full of charm and invitation, but the look she sent him was pointed. They\u2019d made no plans for a ride, or any other activity, but he was sharp enough to follow her lead. \u201cI do realize it is a bit early for tea . . .\u201d</p><p>If he sat down instead of taking her subtle cue to leave, she\u2019d never kiss him again.</p><p>\u201cOf course I should. We can ride later,\u201d he said, sending her a disarming smile that, nevertheless, sent a little pang through her. Perhaps she should have let him coax her into bed last night. \u201cI can always enjoy tea. And with such esteemed company.\u201d He gave a little bow, then he turned to look at her, his eyebrows raised innocently. \u201cYou haven\u2019t announced our wonderful news yet, have you, dearest?\u201d</p><p>She was going to stake him again\u2014and this time in the heart, mortal or not. Lady Melly\u2019s breath was coming in short, wheezing pants, and her fingers had somehow curled around Victoria\u2019s wrist in a death grip.</p><p>Before Victoria could extricate herself from that conundrum, there was a knock at the parlor door. All heads turned. The door opened, and Lettender\u2019s long face appeared. \u201cMy lady, we have another visitor. He . . . er . . . wishes to speak with you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria tensed, then felt suddenly jittery. Max, of course. He was the only person missing from this odd arrangement. \u201cPlease, show him in,\u201d she said.</p><p>The butler stepped in and opened the door. The visitor followed him. \u201cMr. Bemis Goodwin. Of the Magistrate\u2019s Bow Street Runners.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin was tall and dark-haired. He had a face as sharp and angular as Max, but the arrangement of his features, though just as haughty, wasn\u2019t nearly as attractive. His chin and nose were matching jutting points, his cheekbones like slanted plateaus, and his lips thin and red. But his eyes: they were sharp and dark and darted about as if determined to miss nothing. They flitted around, skittering over the little gathering, and finally settled onto Victoria.</p><p>\u201cLady Rockley, I require a word with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThus, Lady Rockley, you were the one to find the remains of Miss Forrest,\u201d said Mr. Goodwin. For the third time.</p><p>\u201cAs I have explained now twice, sir, yes, I came upon her unfortunate remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there were others who had begun the search before you. They were, so to speak, ahead of you.\u201d His eyes were narrow and black. She fancied they gleamed like those of a snake, ready to strike. Yet, they were intelligent. \u201cSo how could you know just where to look if they had not found her?\u201d</p><p>Leaving the others in the parlor, Victoria had taken Mr. Goodwin to the marquess\u2019s study, thinking she was making an escape. But the demeanor which pervaded the whippetlike man and his questions annoyed and unsettled her. \u201cAre you suggesting that I somehow knew where Miss Forrest was before I discovered her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to locate her quite easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was beneath a tree, half hidden by a rock, near the creek. Anyone could have found her.\u201d Victoria settled back in her chair and forced her fingers to uncurl. Ridiculous that he should rouse her as he had. The man was just doing his job.</p><p>The Bow Street Runners were the only sort of police-detectives in London, for Victoria\u2019s countrymen had long been leery of giving up their freedoms by formalizing a police force. In fact, London was the only city in Europe without a formal police force. Certainly, there were the few members of the Night Watch, and a constable for every parish, but their responsibilities were only to report criminal activity if they witnessed it. The Runners were responsible for investigating any grievous crimes\u2014such as murder or rape\u2014and bringing the felons to the magistrate. They were also able to help victims of other crimes, such as fraud or robbery, to recover their losses\u2014at their discretion. Regardless, it was unfortunate the Runner would be unable to help in this particular instance.</p><p>Vampire crimes weren\u2019t recognized by the magistrate.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can help you with, Mr. Goodwin?\u201d Victoria asked, ready to end the conversation.</p><p>As if recognizing her change of demeanor, he stretched his lips in a smile. \u201cYou came upon the mauled and destroyed body, and you had the presence of mind to call for assistance, Lady Rockley. Immediately. Apparently the sight of her torn flesh and spilled blood had little effect on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a pleasant sight, but I am not one to be overcome by feminine vapors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened to Miss Forrest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain someone of your expertise would have come to the same conclusion as I: it appears that she was attacked by something bent on killing her.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Goodwin\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cA vampire, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Victoria caught herself in midbreath, then exhaled slowly and evenly. \u201cA vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe in vampires, Lady Rockley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how my belief\u2014or nonbelief\u2014in the supernatural is relevant to the investigation into Miss Forrest\u2019s death, Mr. Goodwin. I\u2019m certain you must investigate every aspect of the situation, which is why it doesn\u2019t follow that you\u2019re wasting my time and yours asking me such questions.\u201d The edge of her vision began to waver and she drew in an even breath through her nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mr. Goodwin stood. He took up his black hat with long fingers and placed it precisely on his scalp. \u201cThank you, Lady Rockley. I wish you a good day.\u201d He started to turn, and then slowly swiveled back to face Victoria, who had stood. \u201cWhat happened to your husband, Lady Rockley?\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart give an unpleasant little lurch. \u201cHe died at sea,\u201d she replied automatically.</p><p>\u201cThat is the story that\u2019s been given out.\u201d He nodded. \u201cWhat ship was he sailing on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour questions are not only becoming tiresome, but an outright waste of my time. These matters are of the public record. And, as they can have no relevance to your investigation regarding Miss Forrest, I believe we are done.\u201d Victoria looked pointedly at the study door, gesturing the man toward it. \u201cGood day, Mr. Goodwin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ship The Plentifulle, it was, or so has been reported. And your husband left his new wife less than a month after the return of your wedding holiday? Suddenly? Without notifying even the servants?\u201d</p><p>Victoria drew herself up in all haughtiness. \u201cMr. Goodwin, I\u2019m not certain how your household is run, but here at St. Heath\u2019s Row, the servants do not grant permission for the master\u2019s comings and goings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He pulled his hat brim even straighter, and gave a little bow. \u201cThank you very much for your assistance, Lady Rockley.\u201d</p><p>With loathing, Victoria watched the man go. Such a prig, and he had pulled on her strings enough to make her feel unsettled. She, a Venator of two years, who had faced demons and vampires and multiple undead, had been set off balance by a mere Bow Street Runner.</p> <p>But why on earth had he been asking her about vampires?</p><p>Seven</p><p>Of Stone-filled Wicker Baskets, Meeting at the Altar, and Confessions</p><p>After Mr. Bemis Goodwin, Bow Street Runner, made his exit, Victoria did not return to the parlor. She decided that it was more than fitting to leave Sebastian to face the ferocious Lady Melly and mop up the pieces of his little charade.</p><p>Of course, there was always the risk that he might complicate matters further . . . or that Lady Melly might be won over\u2014Sebastian, after all, was as charming as they came\u2014and leap heartily into planning the second wedding to which he had alluded.</p><p>But for now . . . Victoria had so many things to think about, to worry on, that she absolutely couldn\u2019t sit in that crowded parlor and pretend to be civil any longer.</p> <p>She\u2019d already given Verbena, her maid, the direction to pack some of her belongings and to have the footmen take them over to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s town house. She wouldn\u2019t sleep another night under James Lacy\u2019s roof, where Sebastian felt as though he could invade her chambers at will, with disregard for whoever might see him.</p><p>Taking care to stay away from any window that might reveal her location to those visiting in the parlor, Victoria took a pea-gravel path along the side of the mansion. She suspected that Kritanu was still in the chapel where she\u2019d left him yesterday afternoon, before joining James for dinner. She\u2019d meant to visit again last night, but the sherry, along with Sebastian\u2019s visit to her chamber, had sent her to bed earlier than she planned.</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d Kritanu greeted her as her shadow spilled into the chapel. She closed the door behind her and moved down the aisle toward her trainer.</p><p>He was on the altar arranged in one of his more complicated yoga positions: balanced on shoulders and chest with his arms extended along the floor and legs bent up around. His feet rested gently on the top of his head and his arms splayed strongly beneath his raised torso, extended on the ground in a stabilizing vee. As she watched, he moved slowly and smoothly out of what she recognized as the shalabha-asana.</p><p>Although Kritanu had taught her some of the positions, or asanas, of yoga in order to help her learn to concentrate and breathe more efficiently, Victoria had never been able to arrange her body thus. Neither had Aunt Eustacia.</p><p>\u201cI meant to come again last night,\u201d she began, but he was already shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve much to attend to, child. I know well how difficult it can be.\u201d</p><p>Indeed he would, for he had been Aunt Eustacia\u2019s trainer, companion, and\u2014as Victoria had recently learned\u2014her lover for more than fifty years.</p> <p>Victoria closed her fingers over his smooth, tea-colored hand and squeezed. \u201cWhen will you bury him?\u201d</p><p>Kritanu shook his head. \u201cWe do not bury our dead. His body, worn out like that of an old chariot, will be burned. I will take his ashes back to the Consilium, where he would want them to be.\u201d He straightened, and she saw that although grief still lived within his gaze, it had softened. \u201cBut I have wanted to talk with you about continuing your training. We\u2019ve done little in the last months, and I fear that you\u2019ll become weak and slow . . . and fall back into using predictable moves.\u201d</p><p>Victoria smiled, though for some reason she wanted to cry. \u201cI have made arrangements to move to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s house\u2014which I should have done immediately upon returning to London. It was foolish of me to stay here.\u201d</p><p>Kritanu nodded. \u201cI will take my nephew today, then, so you needn\u2019t worry on that. And I\u2019m glad that you\u2019ll be back with me. We\u2019ll hone your ankathari skills, for you must become more adept with a blade. It\u2019s a worthwhile skill for fighting Imperials.\u201d</p><p>Imperial vampires were the oldest of the half-demon race, often having been created more than a millennium ago. Their eyes burned red-violet, and they were faster and stronger than even the Guardians. They carried swords, and had the ability to glide through the air. Some of them could also shape-shift or pull the life force from a person with their mere gaze.</p><p>Victoria had fought Imperials only twice, and only with help. They were horrible, fearsome creatures.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I be ready to start qinggong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She\u2019d seen Max\u2019s graceful, gliding movements through the air, swooping and leaping as though he was bewinged. As a novice Venator, she\u2019d observed him use these skills in a battle he\u2019d fought against an Imperial vampire two years ago. Max\u2019s strength and skill were well matched to the vampire\u2019s, and the battle had been almost beautiful to behold as they matched blade to wooden pike, feet brushing the ground then rising again, swirling and sliding in great arcs through the night air.</p><p>Kritanu gave her a fatherly smile. \u201cIf you wish, we can begin tomorrow. But, I must warn you, it will take years, perhaps decades, for you to master it. Unlike other combat skills, qinggong is not enhanced by the vis bulla. It is mostly the strength and power of your mind that will make you successful with qinggong.\u201d</p><p>But Max had mastered it, and he couldn\u2019t have been doing so for more than a decade himself. Victoria knew she could learn it as well.</p><p>\u201cI see you are skeptical.\u201d Kritanu tipped his head in a gentle nod. \u201cQinggong is an art from China, not of the Venators. And you will begin, tomorrow if you wish, in the same manner of all who study qinggong.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had visions of leaping off chairs or tables, stake in hand, and her lips twitched at the thought of her mother witnessing such a sight. Of course, Lady Melly would faint dead away if she saw the manner in which her daughter already kicked and spun and rolled during her other combat.</p><p>\u201cWe will fill a large woven basket with rocks,\u201d Kritanu explained. There was a glint of humor in his eyes as if he knew what she\u2019d been thinking. \u201cYou\u2019ll walk around the rim of the basket, balancing on its narrow edge. Every day you\u2019ll do this until you can do it perfectly. Then we\u2019ll remove one stone. And you\u2019ll do it again until you can do it perfectly.</p><p>\u201cAnd then,\u201d he said, raising a finger as if to forestall any question about leaping off the sofa, \u201cwe\u2019ll remove another stone. And again you\u2019ll walk around it. We\u2019ll continue to do this until the basket is empty, and you can still walk around its rim.\u201d</p><p>Victoria stared at him as the force of his description sunk in. \u201cThat is how you trained Max?\u201d How could one walk around the rim of an empty woven basket without collapsing it, or tipping it?</p><p>His blue-black hair gleamed. \u201cIndeed. As I said, Victoria, it\u2019s the power of your mind . . . not your muscle or speed.\u201d</p><p>She gave a spare nod. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Light broke into the small room as the door opened. They both turned to see Sebastian standing at the other end of the aisle. Sunbeams shone over his golden hair from behind, and then he stepped into the darker room and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cI wondered where you\u2019d gone off to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only a bit of luck that I looked out one of the windows and saw the flutter of your skirt as you slipped in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say my mother allowed you to slip from her clutches.\u201d As Victoria watched him walk up the chapel aisle, she was struck by the memory of doing the same thing herself: to meet Phillip at the altar.</p><p>Her throat burned. She swallowed hard, and found herself needing to blink rapidly. Meeting her at the altar. Taking Phillip\u2019s place? He\u2019d made it clear he\u2019d like to. At least, in the bedchamber.</p><p>She realized with a start that Sebastian had reached her side. But unlike a meeting of his bride, he didn\u2019t reach for her hand and close warm fingers around it. Instead, he replied, \u201cIt was quite a feat, getting away from her\u2014but not because she was suddenly overcome with fondness for me. Rather, it was because she was determined to undermine me, and keep me from your side. She sent Rockley off in search of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm. I was rather hoping for a bit more torture,\u201d she replied, shaking off the discomfiting thoughts. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair, after that little performance you gave.\u201d</p><p>He settled his smile on her. \u201cTorture? But, ma ch\u00e8re, you needn\u2019t leave that to your mother. You have the skill well in hand.\u201d There was a gleam in his gaze that unsettled her . . . and made her stomach squeeze pleasantly. She still could not repress her physical attraction to Sebastian.</p><p>Victoria felt her cheeks warm and she shifted her attention toward Kritanu. As if her acknowledgement gave him the impetus to speak, he looked at Sebastian. \u201cYou and Victoria have more in common than simply being Venators born.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut of course.

The Gardella name is so far back in my family tree that you and I needn\u2019t worry about our branches crossing. We aren\u2019t closely related at all.\u201d His face lit with joviality, but his eyes . . . they were sharp with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cBut that is not what I meant,\u201d Kritanu said in his precise tones. \u201cI am speaking of Giulia.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>Victoria looked at Sebastian, whose face had settled into an odd expression of chagrin and annoyance. When he didn\u2019t speak, she turned to Kritanu. He, too, remained silent, watching Sebastian with an expectant look.</p><p>She folded her arms over her middle. \u201cAnother secret, Sebastian? Aren\u2019t you through with them?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment, then he spoke at last, in a low, tight voice. \u201cMax was a member of the Tutela, years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no secret to me.\u201d Although Max had shown Victoria the marking on his skin from his days with the Tutela, he\u2019d told her little else. She had had to get more information from Wayren, when Max had left the Venators after executing Aunt Eustacia.</p><p>\u201cHe exposed his father and sister to the Tutela,\u201d said Sebastian.</p> <p>\u201cI know about that . . . it was a terrible mistake, but he was trying to protect them\u2014they were sick, and his father was old, and dying,\u201d Victoria replied evenly. \u201cMax was young, and the Tutela was smart\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must know that the Tutela killed his father . . . and allowed the vampires to turn Giulia to an undead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiulia?\u201d Victoria felt as though the bottom of her stomach had opened and her insides were tumbling out.</p><p>\u201cGiulia,\u201d he continued in that tight voice, \u201cwas the first vampire I slew after receiving my vis bulla. She was my . . . I loved her. Max\u2019s sister.\u201d Then he looked steadily at her with empty golden eyes, his mouth angled into a humorless smile. \u201cSo you see, Victoria, Kritanu is right. You and I have much in common. We\u2019ve both had to send the one we loved most to Hell.\u201d</p><p>Eight</p><p>Wherein the Delights of a British Chef Are Discussed</p> <p>Victoria forced her lips into a polite smile and nodded to Lord Bentworth as he and his triple chins extolled the virtues of his new chef in comparison to the one here at the Hungreath residence.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t skimp on the salt, either,\u201d he said, emphasizing his pleasure with the slice of pheasant skewered on the tines of his fork. \u201cTold him not to, and listened from the first day. And the sauces. None of that Frenchy stuff\u2014 like this here\u2014told him that. Don\u2019t need the beef swimming in it, said.\u201d He slipped the fowl in his mouth, and his jaw ground furiously as he chewed, cheeks bulging.</p><p>Her mind distracted by other matters more pressing than an appropriate level of seasoning or the cultural influence thereof, Victoria glanced down the table. Sara Regalado was indeed watching her, sharp brown eyes and mysterious smirk all aimed in her direction. Victoria firmed her lips to let the other woman know she wasn\u2019t intimidated, then turned back to her own roast pheasant.</p><p>Although she could have manufactured an excuse for staying home tonight, Victoria had decided to attend the dinner party at the Hungreaths\u2019 for a variety of reasons. First, because Lady Hungreath was Gwendolyn\u2019s god-mother and was giving the party in honor of the happily affianced couple, and Gwen had extracted Victoria\u2019s promise to attend. Secondly, because George Starcasset and Sara were to be in attendance, and Victoria felt that it might be prudent to keep an eye on them. And finally, because it gave her a bit of space from Sebastian and his shocking revelations.</p><p>It was no wonder he and Max could barely stand to be in the same room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like green food, either,\u201d Bentworth said. He pushed away a bowl of soggy spinach in favor of stabbing a boiled potato bursting from its skin. He plopped it on his plate and beckoned the footman to bring the butter. Apparently Bentworth was a frequent guest at the Hungreaths\u2019, as the servant seemed well aware of the man\u2019s delight with the dairy confection, and apportioned a generous pale yellow slab onto the potato. \u201cDon\u2019t care for the sweets, and told him too. M\u2019wife has a sweet tooth, loves sugar biscuits, but don\u2019t care for \u2019em myself. Just meat and potatoes and bread. Stewed carrots, beets, onions. Can\u2019t abide hard or crunchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must be a versatile chef in order to prepare those items in an agreeable way,\u201d Victoria commented in a voice as bland as the food she was eating. Perhaps the Hungreaths ought to speak with Lord Bentworth about hiring a better chef. But she wasn\u2019t all that hungry, and, unlike in Italy, the food here was pale in color and mostly the same texture. And thankfully, as long as she kept nodding every so often and adding a comment once in a while, she could try to comb through her tangled thoughts.</p><p>It was no news to her that Max had been involved with the Tutela when he was younger. She\u2019d seen the secret society\u2019s mark on the back of his shoulder: a whiplike, sinuous dog curved in a writhing circle. As abhorrent as the society it represented, the tattoo was symbolic of the mortals who acted, as Kritanu had once said, like subservient bitches and whores for the undead.</p> <p>The Tutela coaxed and lured people of all ages into their alliance, preying on the mortal fear of death by promising a chance for immortality and protection from the undead. Max had been one of them for a time, but now she knew without a doubt that the experience, and his early, naive choices, had given him an unflinching and deeply rooted hatred of the undead and the Tutela.</p><p>Victoria realized with a start that the people around her seemed to be looking at her, waiting for something. \u201cPardon me,\u201d she said with a little smile, \u201cI seem to have been woolgathering. What was it you asked, Mrs. Cranwrathe?\u201d</p><p>The woman across the table cleared her throat in a grating, rough manner that sent Victoria reaching for her own wine. \u201cI was saying, Lady Rockley, how delightful it was for you to encourage the new marquess to join us this evening.\u201d There was a sparkle in her light eyes that made Victoria straighten up in her chair. \u201cI understand you are still in residence at St. Heath\u2019s Row? And he arrived yesterday?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down the table and saw that James, who\u2019d been seated clear at the other end near his hostess, was buffeted on both sides by eager mamas. The poor man. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re mistaken, Mrs. Cranwrathe. I\u2019m no longer in residence at St. Heath\u2019s Row, but have taken over the home of my mother\u2019s deceased aunt.\u201d</p><p>The footman slipped in between her and Lord Bentworthand removed their rose-patterned dishes: the man\u2019s fairly gleaming in its emptiness, and Victoria\u2019s roses still obliterated by blobs of potatoes, carrots, and a bit of stringy pheasant. Frivolous confections towering on small plates replaced them, and everyone\u2019s dessert was dispatched with great enthusiasm, except for Bentworth\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cShall we ladies repair to the parlor for sherry?\u201d said Lady Hungreath from her position further down the table. \u201cThere are sugar biscuits as well.\u201d</p><p>Victoria made her way between the other guests, slipping her arm around Gwendolyn, who\u2019d just returned from refreshing herself. As they walked to the parlor, she glanced out at the gardens behind the house. It was barely eight o\u2019clock, so the sun had slipped near the horizon, but was still at just the top of the trees in the distance. She would stay for another hour, perhaps ninety minutes, and then would make her excuses.</p><p>Once the flurry of skirts and crocheted wraps and reticules were settled, along with their owners, in the parlor, Victoria realized that Sara Regalado was missing. Drat and blast! She should have hung back and waited to enter the room until she was sure the other woman had joined them.</p><p>That faintly supercilious smile during the soup course had implied the Italian chit was up to no good. But now Victoria was in a fix. The men were in the study, enjoying their cigars and brandy, and until they came in to join the women in the parlor, she was going to be stuck here, playing whist or listening to wedding plans or gossip about who was fornicating with whom.</p><p>Or at least, if she weren\u2019t Victoria Gardella Grantworth de Lacy, she would be stuck in this green and gold parlor, playing the polite Society matron. But being Illa Gardella, and having other matters to deal with besides gossip and fashion, she would take matters into her own hands.</p><p>Victoria stood, excusing herself to freshen up.</p><p>And, as luck would have it, as she started out of the room, she glanced toward one of the hip-level square windows that faced the Hungreaths\u2019 enthusiastic gardens of pergolas flanked by clusters of lilies and hyacinth bushes, decorated with climbing roses. She saw the flutter of a rose-colored fabric as it passed behind the statue of a water-spouting cupid.</p><p>Sara had been wearing a rose-colored frock.</p><p>Moments later, Victoria was hurrying along the slate pathway, staying out of sight of the house windows as much as possible. Although she had to enter from the other side of the garden, she found the cupid fountain and started off in the direction in which the fluttering skirt had disappeared.</p><p>Victoria avoided dry sticks and rustling leaves, peering around trees and hedges before turning a corner. One arm of the path took her through the herb garden, where she passed clumps of silver-leafed sage, yellow hyssop, and miniature myrtle. She paused often to look through a filter of climbing rose vines and decorative wrought iron, or clusters of tall grasses and equally tall blooms.</p><p>Everything was still but the spray of water from the cupid\u2019s mouth, rumbling in the distance. A bird chirped a warning, then fluttered to its nest, sending a few dried leaves drifting down. The sun lowered, its orange ball blazing through the treetops in the distance, still clearly lighting the garden.</p><p>Victoria increased her pace, and found herself retracing her steps through the four large circular pathways of the garden, all of which intersected at the cupid fountain. There was no one about.</p><p>Frowning, she pivoted at last to return to the house, admitting defeat. Either she hadn\u2019t seen what she thought she had, or Sara had made her way back inside. Or she was hiding somewhere that Victoria couldn\u2019t find\u2014but there was really no place for her to do so. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Other than the small gardener\u2019s shed.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s heart rate kicked up as her attention landed on the small, well-kept building\u2014hardly larger than an old-fashioned outhouse. It was situated in the far left corner of the garden, next to the stone enclosure that bordered the grounds. Her skin prickling, she crept up to the small building, listening for any human sounds. What could Sara Regalado be doing out here?</p><p>But when Victoria came close enough to sidle alongside the small building, her mouth began to water and her heart started to thump hard. The scent of blood filtered through the air. Her vision clouded at the edges.</p> <p>No. Not again.</p><p>Easing her way around the corner of the shed to the front, she found the door. It was locked . . . but the aroma of thick, rich blood was stronger. It was as if it weighted the summer evening air, clogging the delicate essence of roses and lilies with rust. Her head pounding, Victoria blinked hard and moved along the front of the shed, following the smell and her instincts around the corner toward the back . . . and then she needed to go no further.</p><p>It was just as bloody a mess as the last one she\u2019d found, in the park. Her mouth salivating so that she had to swallow back, twice, Victoria bent shakily next to what remained of the body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Sara Regalado. Victoria didn\u2019t recognize her, but based on the simple worsted wool of her dress\u2014now bloodied and torn\u2014the victim appeared to be a chamber-maid or some other servant. The puncture wounds on her throat and claw marks on the top of her shoulders clearly indicated an attack by an undead.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s hand shook as she reached to close the woman\u2019s sightless eyes. Her lids were still warm, and Victoria let her fingers move gingerly over cheeks so pudgy they could belong to her own maid, Verbena. The vampire probably hadn\u2019t gone far.</p> <p>A sound behind her had the hair on the back of her arms prickling, and Victoria half turned as she looked automatically for something that could be used as a stake.</p><p>\u201cLady Rockley?\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked up into the face of Brodebaugh, Gwen\u2019s earl, who was flanked by Baron Hungreath and George Starcasset. She pulled to her feet and swallowed again. \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it appears.\u201d Hungreath was looking at her with something like apprehension tinged with suspicion. \u201cHow did you come to find her?\u201d</p><p>Victoria glanced at George, instinctively looking to see if he was somehow responsible for the trio discovering her and the mauled maid. His soft face was bland, but she saw a glint in his blue eyes that made her tighten her lips. And while the other two men were looking at the bloodied body with a combination of disgust and horror, George appeared unmoved.</p><p>As if recognizing her suspicions, he said, \u201cThe other women are in the parlor enjoying their sherry. When they said you\u2019d been gone for some time, and no one knew where you were, we thought it would be best to check the gardens.\u201d His deceptively sweet dimples appeared.</p> <p>Smoothing her skirt, which she realized now had streaks of blood on it, Victoria said, \u201cSomeone had best send for the magistrate. And perhaps the housekeeper, to see if she recognizes the poor thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ho,\u201d said George, bending toward a bush. When he stood, he was holding a long shawl, stained with blood. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>Victoria stared at it, feeling light of head. Her vision blushed with red as she recognized her own shawl. The one that she\u2019d left on a small table in the foyer, upon arrival this evening.</p><p>\u201cPoor gel,\u201d Brodebaugh said, with real sincerity in his voice as he looked down at the victim. Then he turned and offered Victoria his arm, cementing her affection for the man that her best friend was to wed. \u201cAnd for you, Lady Rockley, to have found her in such a state. Lean on my arm, and I\u2019ll assist you back to the house.\u201d</p><p>Victoria did as he suggested, not because she needed his support, of course . . . but because the expression on George Starcasset\u2019s face made her uneasy. When he\u2019d produced the shawl, there was an unmistakable smugness in his expression that suggested he knew that it was hers. Not that she would deny it of course, but she wondered how it had gotten there\u2014and who had moved it.</p><p>It was most certainly not beyond the realm of possibility\u2014and in fact, was likely\u2014that Sara had lured her into the gardens so that she would discover the remnants of another daylight vampire attack, and had planted the shawl nearby.</p><p>Which then begged the question: was it Sara or George who had turned undead?</p><p>Or someone else?</p> <p>Victoria came awake sharply.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, kept her breathing easy and regular, and slitted her eyes a crack. Someone or something was in the bedchamber with her.</p><p>The room was all shapes and shades of dark gray, any detail that might be discernable in the predawn light distorted by her narrow view. She\u2019d have to turn her head. . . .</p><p>\u201cGood God. You might as well open your eyes, Victoria. A gnat could do a better job feigning sleep than you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s eyes flew open. She sat up abruptly, her fingers tightening around a stake as she pulled it from beneath the coverlet. She hadn\u2019t slept without one since the night she\u2019d killed Phillip.</p><p>\u201cWell, Max. It\u2019s been quite some time since you\u2019ve visited my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>Her voice was rough with slumber, and she wasn\u2019t quite certain why she said such a provocative thing . . . unless it was because there was nothing else one could say to a man who sneaked into one\u2019s bedchamber in the hours just before dawn.</p><p>Particularly a man who\u2019d kissed one against the stone wall of a Roman villa, then had given up his role as a Venator and disappeared without saying good-bye.</p><p>Something fluttered deep in her stomach.</p><p>He was standing in a dark corner of the room, well in the shadows. It was only his voice that had given him away. None of the windows were open, nor was the door, to indicate how he\u2019d managed to enter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need that,\u201d he said, obviously noticing the stake. \u201cUnless it\u2019s become an addition to your nighttime bedchamber activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He stepped more fully into view. Max was taller than most men, looming over the bed, and he preferred black clothing. Neither factor did much to reveal the details of his form or countenance tonight; he remained an elegant shadow with only the bridge of his long, straight nose outlined by the pale light glazing the window. \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Victoria gave an impatient jerk of the stake against the coverlet\u2019s whitework embroidery. \u201cI mean, what are you doing in London? Of course you came to talk to me. What other reason would you have to be in my bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>Silence descended and stretched for a moment, then Max replied, his voice smooth, \u201cPerhaps your imagination is a bit stunted.\u201d He shifted, removing his hands from his pockets to cross them over his middle. Victoria realized her heart was thumping hard at the base of her throat. And she was remembering the way he\u2019d kissed her, against that cold, wet stone.</p><p>He continued, \u201cVioget informed me of your find in the park. The vampire attack during the daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve spoken to Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night, as a matter of fact. After he left you.\u201d Max shifted, spreading his long-fingered hands to emphasize his words. \u201cA bit of advice, Victoria. Keep away from the windows when entertaining in your bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t take you for a voyeur, Max. But perhaps watching is more to your liking than doing.\u201d</p><p>Now she saw the gleam of white teeth in a humorless smile. \u201cMmm . . . no.\u201d Then the smile faded. \u201cDo you mind covering up a bit? That\u2019s a ghastly-looking gown.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked down and saw that not only had the bedclothes drifted into her lap, but the growing light from the window seemed to shine directly on her and the lavender night rail she wore. The fine lawn material and deep lace trim of the plunging neckline\u2014one of her favorites\u2014hid none of the curves of her torso. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry to have offended your fashion sensibilities, Max. I didn\u2019t realize you had any.\u201d She shrugged, pulling the covers up. \u201cBut after all, I didn\u2019t invite you into my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite true. Please accept my deepest gratitude.\u201d He made an insolent bow, leaving her to wonder whether he was thanking her for pulling the bedclothes up to her collarbones, or for not inviting him into her room. \u201cI must also commend your efficiency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy efficiency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom dinner with the newly arrived marquess to . . . er . . . nocturnal entertainment in the marchioness\u2019s bedchamber the very same night, and then a move to another bedchamber in a different house the next day. Quite efficient, and much coming and going. Thus I felt it necessary to take precautions that Vioget would be otherwise occupied this evening.\u201d Now she saw a flash of white teeth in the dark. \u201cFar be it for me to cause an interruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very accommodating of you, Max. What did you do to Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t fear for the man\u2019s safety. He\u2019s merely on the tail of a woman who, from a distance, bears an astonishing resemblance to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is this woman doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite certain, but I do believe she\u2019s having an assignation in Vauxhall Gardens.\u201d His smile gleamed again. \u201cI don\u2019t think Vioget was pleased.\u201d</p><p>Victoria hid her own smile. It would serve Sebastian right to be following a false trail\u2014especially after his blithe announcement in the parlor today, chosen, of course, for timing and audience. \u201cPerhaps now might be a good time to reveal exactly why you\u2019ve made it a point to invade my chamber. But, truly, Max,\u201d she said, her voice softening from the haughty edge she\u2019d adopted. \u201cI am glad to see that you are safe and well. And . . . of course you must know about Briyani.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she saw his shoulders relax. \u201cI spoke with Kritanu last night as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKritanu too?\u201d Victoria felt a swell of annoyance again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be angry with him,\u201d Max said. \u201cI told him I\u2019d speak with you . . . and as you\u2019re aware, he\u2019s been otherwise distracted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI notice you don\u2019t defend Sebastian\u2019s lack of communication about your presence in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I\u2019m shocked that he didn\u2019t rush to inform you of it, knowing that it would annoy me. He threatened to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fianc\u00e9e is here as well. Did he tell you that?\u201d Even though Max\u2019s engagement to Sara had been a false one\u2014at least, Victoria thought it had been a false one\u2014 she\u2019d never been able to resist the urge to needle him about it.</p> <p>\u201cVioget didn\u2019t see fit to tell me that\u2014unless he wasn\u2019t aware.\u201d</p><p>Victoria shook her head. \u201cHe is fully aware, for she and George Starcasset were there when he fairly announced our engagement to my mother this afternoon. And I\u2019m terribly sorry, Max, but it appears you\u2019ve been replaced in her affections by Gwendolyn\u2019s brother George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to feel sorry for the woman, for you made her believe you loved her,\u201d Victoria chided.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d Max sounded amused.</p> <p>\u201cYou certainly appeared to be promoting such a conviction when I met you at the home of the Conte Regalado.\u201dShe\u2019d come upon a rumpled Max leaving an obvious t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Sara.</p><p>\u201cThat must certainly have made an impression on you, Victoria, for you bring that incident up nearly every time we talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked ridiculous, with your hair mussed and your neck cloth crooked. It was more than obvious what you\u2019d been doing. And will you please do sit down,\u201d Victoria said in exasperation. \u201cYour hovering is quite annoying, and if you don\u2019t, I shall be forced to stand myself\u2014and I daresay you don\u2019t want to be treated to the full sight of my ghastly nightgown.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound that could have been a strangled laugh or a cough; but in either case, he took her advice and sat\u2014in the chair farthest from the bed, placing himself back in the shadows. \u201cI daresay I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me, why are you in London when you should be running as far from Lilith as possible.\u201d</p><p>She actually felt the tension settle back in the room, chilling whatever lightness their banter had brought to bear. \u201cAh yes . . . my unfortunate circumstances. We needn\u2019t discuss the banalities of why I came back to this drafty, wet country\u2014but more to the purpose, how I might be of assistance in your current dilemma. The daylight vampire attack.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria nodded, focusing her attention on that instead of flinging one-sentence barbs back and forth. It did become wearying after awhile, and, truth to tell, she was relieved to see Max. If only he didn\u2019t have to be so prickly. And arrogant. And rude. \u201cThere was another one today.\u201d</p><p>She told him, and ended with her suspicions about Sara and George. \u201cBut it seems rather heavy-handed for them to taunt me so blatantly, if indeed one of them is the daylight vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tend to agree. Although Sara is not known for her subtlety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not pure chance that I was the one to discover both victims, within the space of two days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. And we must presume that they\u2019ve obtained the elixir that was described in the writings we found behind the Magic Door in Roma.\u201d He moved; she heard rather than saw it. \u201cThe formula Vioget stole from the Consilium.\u201d</p><p>Victoria pushed a long curl back over the crown of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve not forgotten that, Max. But he did take me to a secret abbey under London, where he retrieved one of the Rings of Jubai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t give you the ring, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he made no attempt to hide it.\u201d</p> <p>Max snorted. \u201cWell, one can always find a straw at which to grasp if one looks hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe killed Beauregard. That\u2019s done much to build my trust in him,\u201d Victoria said, ignoring the fact that she trusted Sebastian hardly at all.</p><p>\u201cHe had no choice,\u201d Max said flatly. \u201cAfter what he allowed to happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllowed?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo, Max. It wasn\u2019t Sebastian\u2014the fault lay with me. I followed him to Beauregard\u2019s lair, I went after him. Sebastian tried to stop me\u2014that was how he was injured, by me with my stake, and then by the other vampires. He knew what Beauregard wanted. He wanted me. And the only reason he succeeded in subduing me was because of the copper armband.\u201d</p><p>Copper was the only material that did not disintegrate when a vampire was killed. Everything else the creature was wearing exploded into ashes and dust, except for items made of copper. That was why Lilith had forged her Five Rings of Jubai from the soft metal, and why Beauregard\u2019s special armband had been imbued with the ability to sap the strength of a mortal. Even if the vampire was killed, the metal\u2014and any powers that had been bestowed upon it\u2014would survive.</p><p>\u201cAnd why did Beauregard want to turn you, Victoria? Because of Vioget. He gave his grandfather too much\u2014 too much freedom, too much loyalty, too much support.\u201d He moved again, and she saw that he\u2019d stood once more. \u201cI would have killed him myself if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauregard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVioget. And he was well aware of it. That was why he finally did the right thing by staking Beauregard. He made no move to do so until I came on the scene.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt a cool chill ripple over her. The animosity between the men was frightening; yet she\u2019d known them both for two years, and never, until now, had it been so overt. So dark, as though it were preparing to erupt. \u201cWhen you went with Sebastian to save me, you were . . . you no longer had the power of the vis bulla.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him, Max. You might have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>He shifted, and now the glowing sunrise illuminated half of his face, outlining a high, sculpted cheekbone and part of his sharp jaw. His dark hair brushed the underside of his chin, gleaming in thick waves where the light touched it. \u201cI\u2019m here to assist you, and then I\u2019ll move on to somewhere else where Lilith won\u2019t find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still stake a vampire, Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can,\u201d she replied tartly. \u201cBefore you took the vis bulla you killed many vampires\u2014a fact which you\u2019ve made certain to impress upon me more than once. But you\u2019ll be no match for Lilith if she finds you, and you can be certain she\u2019s looking for both of us. It\u2019s possible she\u2019s even here in London. One bite is all it would take to put you back under her thrall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo it wouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s more to the process than a mere bite from her\u2014or else everyone she feeds from would be so. And I certainly see no need to revisit those memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s more than one bite\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gratified by your concern,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have no intention of being entrapped by that creature again. I have my own protection.\u201d He lifted his hand, and in the dim light she saw that he wore a heavy silver ring.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to explain; she knew him well enough to understand. There was something in the ring that would send him to his death if need be. He seemed almost eager to put it to the test. \u201cPractical, practical Max.\u201d She felt her lips move in a false smile. \u201cSo, how do you anticipate being able to assist in our endeavors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. You and Vioget rely on the power of the vis bulla to sense the presence of a vampire, and to fight them. Perhaps too much, in this case. I no longer have that burden, and can instead rely only on intuition and senses\u2014skills that I used before I became a Venator. Simple observation, and other instincts, have worked well for me in the past.\u201d</p><p>Victoria had crossed her arms over her middle. Her hackles had begun to rise at the beginning of his speech, but by the end she was nodding in agreement. \u201cI\u2019m nothing if not practical myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond and she could only conclude that even Max couldn\u2019t think of a snide remark in this case. After all, she\u2019d agreed with him.</p><p>\u201cSo, do tell, Victoria. What prompted your move from the very comfortable home of the Marquess of Rockley to this smaller residence, in a most unfashionable part of town?\u201d he said, moving away from the window.</p><p>She drew in a deep breath, then released it slowly. Sadness settled over her. \u201cI no longer belong there. My life has changed completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sentiment I fully understand.\u201d His voice had lost its crispness.</p><p>Silence descended.</p><p>Victoria had often thought about what her life would be like\u2014how empty, different, bland it would be\u2014if she no longer wore the vis bulla. As horrible as that event would be for her, how much more difficult it must be for Max.</p><p>He had not only been stalking the undead for longer, but also had a penance to pay for giving his family to those immortal creatures. He\u2019d given up his Venatorial powers not only to break the hold Lilith had over him, but also in order to slay the demon Akvan. It had been prophesied that no Venator or demon should ever harm him\u2014 so Max had cast off his supernatural powers and become merely a man in order to destroy the creature.</p><p>But Max would never be merely a man.</p><p>\u201cHow is your hand?\u201d he asked suddenly, standing at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cMy hand?\u201d</p><p>A sudden, quiet snick, and then a tiny light flared in the room, cupped by one of his hands, held aloft by the other. \u201cMiro\u2019s light sticks are quite convenient,\u201d Max said with a little bow. \u201cYour right hand, Victoria. Let me see it.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood. Victoria hesitated, curling her fingers into her palm.</p><p>He was closer to the bed now, and she swung her feet out from beneath the coverings and sat on the edge as if that position would give her more stability\u2014yet her feet dangled nervously above the floor. Holding the flickering flame on a stick, he reached for her wrist.</p><p>\u201cOpen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She did, and the yellow glow illuminated the faint bluish cast over the plump parts of her palm, up along the inside of her thumb.</p><p>Their eyes met and she felt warmth billow through her, from her chest out into each of her limbs. The room pressed in around them.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t wash off.\u201d Her voice was soft.</p><p>\u201cI told you it would not.\u201d</p> <p>The blue tinge was from a shard of Akvan\u2019s Obelisk, the demonic stone that had been shattered by Max the previous November when they battled Nedas. Victoria had retrieved one of the pieces and brought it back to the Consilium, where, unbeknownst to her, the power of the obelisk had called Akvan back to earth\u2014and the power of the splinter directed his minions to the secret location of the Consilium.</p><p>When she\u2019d removed the shard from the hideaway, returning it to a safe place behind the Door of Alchemy, Max had been there as well.</p><p>That was when Victoria, influenced by the malevolent power of the piece of obelisk that she\u2019d held, had goaded him into kissing her.</p><p>The blue on her hand was indelibly connected to the memory of her fingers curling into the rough stone wall as Max fit his mouth to hers.</p><p>She closed her hand into a fist. It was a good thing she had to wear gloves in polite society.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered if that also contributed to the failure of Beauregard\u2019s blood to take root in you.\u201d He nodded brusquely at her hand as he released it, then moved slightly away.</p><p>She breathed a bit easier now, and stopped her leg against the edge of the bed. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that, but it\u2019s possible. Vampires and demons are immortal enemies. I obviously had been somewhat influenced by Akvan\u2019s power when I was holding the shard. Perhaps some essence of it remained.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat and your two vis bullae.\u201d His eyes focused on her, and even in the shadowy light, she could sense the sharpness of his gaze.</p><p>Her two strength amulets were not a topic on which she cared to speak. She didn\u2019t want to discuss or acknowledge the fact that one of them was his. It was simply too uncomfortable. Strange, to think about the intimacy of wearing an amulet pierced through her own skin that had once hung from his.</p><p>The silence snapped when he shifted away with spare, smooth movements. His hand closed over the doorknob, answering at least one of her questions: how he\u2019d entered the room. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d best get some sleep now, Victoria,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m certain Vioget will return soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t open access to my bedchamber,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cMuch as he might wish to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo I detect upheaval in paradise? A bit of a tension between two lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian isn\u2019t my lover.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cIndeed.\u201d He turned the knob, but refrained from opening the door. \u201cAnother word of advice, Victoria. For all of the enmity between Vioget and myself, I know that he means well by you. His greatest weakness is blind loyalty. He is a worthy match for you.\u201d His words were short and clipped. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . important that you think of the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou begin to sound like my mother,\u201d Victoria replied, feeling bewildered. Why was Max encouraging her toward a man he loathed?</p><p>\u201cWhereas your mother is concerned only with titles and wealth and grandchildren, my interest relates to the well-being of the Venators. You are the last of the direct line, and should consider what will happen if you die without issue. Or prematurely.\u201d</p><p>Victoria slid down from the edge of the bed, her feet landing on the soft woolen rug. The brush of silk from her nightgown shifted sleekly against her calves, swishing down from her thighs. \u201cThis from a man who, two years ago, was furious that I chose to wed? Make up your mind, Max.\u201d As she stood in front of him, she saw him draw back . . . subtly, almost imperceptibly putting distance between them.</p><p>\u201cMy mind has been made up. Don\u2019t be a fool, Victoria. Remember your duty.\u201d He pulled the door open, then paused halfway out of the room. \u201cI do hope you\u2019ll be considerate and keep any\u2014er\u2014activities in here from being too strident.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, enlightenment dawning as the urge to tamper with him disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re staying here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKritanu suggested it.\u201d His sardonic smile flashed again. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll disrupt things . . . I\u2019m staying in the servants\u2019 quarters.\u201d The door closed behind him with a firm click as he made his escape.</p><p>Nine</p><p>In Which Our Heroine Is Interrogated Yet Again</p><p>Victoria did not go back to sleep after Max left.</p><p>Instead, she found herself staring at the ceiling of the bedchamber that used to belong to Aunt Eustacia. As ceilings went, it was patently uninteresting\u2014there was nary a mural nor a small plafond to relieve its eggshell color. It was flat, unmarked, and without flaw.</p><p>Thus Victoria had nothing to distract her from her churning thoughts.</p><p>Max was somewhere in the house, a fact which alone made her feel odd. He was suggesting that she marry\u2014or at least have a long-term, child-bearing affair with\u2014a man he loathed. The man who\u2019d killed his sister, in fact, sending her, as an undead, to an eternal damnation that Max had caused. A man that Max had disparaged for his cowardice on more than one occasion, who had declined to accept the role of Venator, yet who had kept the knowledge and power of one for more than a decade.</p><p>A man that Victoria had been intimate with on more than one occasion, although, as she\u2019d informed Max, she didn\u2019t consider Sebastian her lover. Not really. Not in an ongoing or permanent way. Not as if she was ready to wed the man.</p><p>Since she\u2019d first met Sebastian, he\u2019d projected an aura of mystery and untrustworthiness. Yet, from their initial conversation at the Silver Chalice, there\u2019d been a connection between them, a flare of attraction on which he never wasted an opportunity to act. Or attempt to act.</p><p>And she\u2019d been willing. A few times.</p><p>She shivered, smiled, remembering.</p><p>In truth, he had made her feel when she\u2019d otherwise been numb. When she grieved, he soothed and awakened her. When she raged, he enraged her further, drawing forth that energy and massaging it into passion. His sense of the absurd, his ability to turn every situation into a prospect for seduction, his fit, golden body . . . the one, she remembered now, with a tinge of bitterness, that he\u2019d kept fairly hidden from her until two months ago, when she\u2019d discovered that he wore the vis bulla.</p><p>Nothing could change the fact that he\u2019d turned his back on the Venators. He\u2019d lived with a powerful vampire for years, protecting and serving him while watching the vampire hunters from a distance.</p><p>He\u2019d ignored his duty.</p><p>Yes, he\u2019d had to slay the woman he loved. Giulia had no longer been the girl he\u2019d known, just as Phillip had no longer been the man Victoria had wed. It had been the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done . . . but it had not drawn her from her responsibilities.</p><p>If anything, it had made her stronger and more determined to eradicate the undead.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. Victoria sat up, surprised that Verbena would bother her so early. It wasn\u2019t yet nine o\u2019clock. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Verbena\u2019s puff of wiry orange hair poked around the door. \u201cOh, thank\u2019od my lady, ye\u2019r awake. I\u2019m so sorry to bother ye, but there\u2019s a man on the front stoop who\u2019s demandin\u2019 to speak t\u2019ye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Victoria swung her legs out of the bed and slid to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, but says ye\u2019d want t\u2019talk to him. He says as he\u2019ll stay there all th\u2019day if\u2019n ye don\u2019 come down.\u201d Verbena came in the room, carrying a fine white chemise and Victoria\u2019s corset. \u201cThe nerve o\u2019 him an\u2019 his sharp-edged beak. I d\u2019clare, th\u2019 man looks like a ferret.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Victoria pulled her nightgown over her head as her maid ruffled quickly through the wardrobe for a frock that could easily be slipped over her corset and fastened quickly, without having to be pressed. Whoever it was, it must be important for him to call on her so early.</p><p>Many possibilities shot through her mind as Verbena helped her to dress quickly, then looped her thick, heavy hair into a loose knot at the back of her neck. Within minutes, Victoria hurried down the stairs.</p><p>To be sure, there wasn\u2019t another lady of the ton who could have been dressed so quickly, so early in the morning\u2014let alone already be awake when the summons came. And yet, when Victoria opened the front door to the stoop, she found her guest pacing the small space with an air of deep impatience.</p><p>She recognized the familiar, sharp-faced man right away, even as, without a bow or even the pretense of one, he said, \u201cLady Rockley. I understand you had another harrowing experience last evening. How dreadful for you.\u201d His tone, his countenance, and even his posture exposed his words as sarcastic. Instead, Mr. Bemis Goodwin\u2019s pale gray eyes appeared cold. \u201cAnd I\u2019m certain you\u2019d want this conversation to take place inside, rather than here on your front stoop.\u201d</p><p>Annoyance buffeted her, but she tasted a bit of apprehension as well. The look in his eyes held suspicion along with unfriendliness. She stepped away to allow him entrance, and gestured to the tiny parlor. \u201cWhat do you want, Mr. Goodwin?\u201d she asked, following him in and closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI have some questions to ask in regards to your discovery last evening, at the home of Baron Hungreath.\u201d He looked pointedly toward one of the chairs. Victoria ignored him. \u201cOf course, the magistrate is quite concerned.\u201d</p><p>Victoria, having been the one to suggest contacting the magistrate, felt like kicking herself. But she refrained, and instead replied, \u201cAs well he should be. Someone is attacking innocent women and leaving their mauled bodies for dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone? Or something?\u201d Mr. Goodwin\u2019s slender nose gleamed like the mother-of-pearl handle on a spoon.</p><p>\u201cIf you continue to make such vague statements, my butler will show you the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magistrate has sent me to ask you some questions, Lady Rockley. It will be best for you if you cooperate. I should hate for you to end up in Newgate, waiting for the noose, due to some . . . misunderstanding . . . in regards to your involvement. I understand it\u2019s quite a loathsome place, even for a prison.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you working for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, the magistrate, of course. Although Miss Forrest\u2019s family is, and quite rightly, devastated and determined to find out who or what is behind the horrible attack on their daughter.\u201d Victoria saw him glance toward the chair again, but perversely, she remained standing. \u201cYou came upon this young woman\u2019s body hidden behind a gardener\u2019s shed. Her name, incidentally, was Bertha Flowers.\u201d He looked at her as if to challenge whether she cared that the woman had a name.</p><p>\u201cYes, I found her behind the shed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you doing in the garden during a dinner party, Lady Rockley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had excused myself to get some air. The gardens were lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the other guests were playing cards. Why would you be so rude as to leave the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I saw one of the other ladies in the garden, and I went to join her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who was that? According to Lady Hungreath, all of the other ladies were in the parlor with the exception of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Sara Regalado, from Rome, was not in the parlor when I quit the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Regalado returned almost immediately after you disappeared. Lady Hungreath noted it especially as she thought it would be you, and was quite confused when you didn\u2019t return.\u201d</p><p>So that had not been Sara\u2019s pink gown, flashing behind the cupid statue? It was impossible for Sara to have returned to the parlor so quickly without Victoria seeing her.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know where to find the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I wasn\u2019t looking for a body,\u201d Victoria replied shortly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know where to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had blood on your skirt and hands when the gentlemen found you. And your shawl, covered in blood, was found at the scene as well, as if it had been . . . discarded. Nor, again, did you scream or make any other sound of distress\u2014according to the others. Who, certainly, should have heard you. It\u2019s almost as if you expected to find it, and knew where to look.\u201d He rocked back on his heels, as if delivering some great pronouncement.</p> <p>\u201cThere was blood everywhere, Mr. Goodwin. When I knelt next to the girl to ascertain whether she was dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Rockley, I saw the condition of her body. You must be foolish in the extreme to believe that she might have been alive. Regardless, no woman would have the constitution to come upon a person in that condition and not make any sound of distress.\u201d He didn\u2019t speak further, but exaggerated dubiousness was written on his face.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could desist from dancing about the Maypole and say whatever it is you mean,\u201d Victoria replied.</p><p>\u201cVery well, then, Lady Rockley. I believe that you are somehow involved in these attacks. Either you are the perpetrator, or are somehow involved with the person\u2014 or creature\u2014who is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Goodwin, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?\u201d Victoria found it easy to laugh, although an uncomfortable feeling had begun to settle in the back of her mind. \u201cHow would a woman such as I make those kinds of wounds on another person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman such as you?\u201d Mr. Goodwin\u2019s eyebrows turned into dark, inverted vees, drawing together above the bridge of his nose. \u201cI have a feeling that a woman such as you just might be able to.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth dried. Who was this man? The discomfort in her middle turned cold and heavy. Yet she responded coolly. \u201cAccusations toward me are merely a waste of your time and energy. The real monster who is doing this is escaping your notice while you point the finger at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you would say that, Lady Rockley. You are very clever, I do give you credit for that. After what happened with your husband, I would expect you to react in such a fashion.\u201d</p> <p>She must have frowned in question, but, in truth, her anxiety was turning to anger at the skinny man before her. Victoria\u2019s vision blurred and began to pinken. She felt her fingers close in on themselves, her nails scoring deeply into her palms.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d he continued in an unhurried voice. \u201cThe circumstances under which your husband disappeared are exceedingly odd, indeed. I shall not be overlooking them in my investigations. And do not think that your status will protect you, Lady Rockley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Lady Rockley.\u201d He started toward the door, moving as if he had all of the time in the world and as if Victoria wasn\u2019t ready to do something violent to his person. It must have showed in her face, despite the fact that she tried to control it. The anger bubbled and simmered and she felt it in the way her knees shook beneath the fall of her skirt, and her teeth ground down on themselves.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you recall the fate of Baron Clifton\u2019s heir? It wasn\u2019t even murder, Lady Rockley. He merely stole some jewelry.\u201d Mr. Goodwin smiled with great pleasure. \u201cStealing is still a hanging offense. As is assault, and accomplice to murder.\u201d</p><p>Now his hand was on the knob, and he turned it. Then he stopped, just like Max had earlier this morning. \u201cDid I mention that one of the servants at St. Heath\u2019s Row told me that Rockley had left the home days before you claim he left on The Plentifulle, after a great row between the two of you? And that the day you say he sailed on that ship, that same servant saw his master enter the house in the dead of night? The same night that you dismissed all of the servants?\u201d</p><p>He stepped through the door as Victoria\u2019s vision began to burn. She felt her heart beat and her breath increasing in speed, and herself wanting to move toward him . . . to stop him. Stop him from these snide remarks, these thinly covered accusations.</p><p>He had one more thing to say. \u201cI believe you had something to do with his disappearance, Lady Rockley. Just as you had something to do with the attacks on Miss Forrest and Miss Flowers. And a man left for dead in the Dials more than a year ago. He had been repeatedly stabbed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been awaiting your return from Italy for nearly a year now.\u201d He smiled and slammed his hat onto sleek, smooth hair, looking at her with the same insolence that Nedas, the vampire son of Lilith, had. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many of your class behind the bars of Newgate, Lady Rockley, and watched them on the scaffold. It\u2019s my opinion that you will soon join them, and then how long will your lush, dark beauty last?\u201d</p><p>And he closed the door so quietly it was ominous.</p><p>Despite the uneasiness from her meeting with Mr. Goodwin, Victoria was clearheaded enough to order Charley, Aunt Eustacia\u2019s trusted butler, to follow the odious man.</p><p>Once she was alone, standing in the foyer, Victoria shook off the foreboding and fury that had billowed through her during their meeting. Her vision cleared, and she looked down at her hands\u2014one scarred and creamy, the other faintly blue, as though she\u2019d been out in the cold for too long. They showed the marks of her nails, but none had drawn blood.</p><p>And her fingers no longer shook.</p><p>Despite his threats, she had no real fear of the Bow Street Runner. What could he do to her? Not only was she a member of the ton, but she was Illa Gardella. And most importantly, she\u2019d done nothing wrong. She\u2019d certainly not had anything to do with the deaths of Miss Forrest and Miss Flowers, and the situation with Phillip was utterly different.</p><p>But . . . there had been that incident in the Seven Dials neighborhood.</p><p>As she stood in the entrance of Aunt Eustacia\u2019s home, Victoria couldn\u2019t help but remember the night she\u2019d come into this very same space. Well past midnight, nearing the dawn, only a month after Phillip\u2019s death, she\u2019d eased through the front door, blood-spattered and insensitive.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t supposed to be blood.</p><p>That phrase rang through her memory again, just as it had done that night, over and over. Aunt Eustacia, roused by her niece\u2019s arrival, had listened with calm, dark eyes as Victoria described how she\u2019d come upon a large man attempting to ravish a young girl in the filthy, poverty-stricken, and mean streets of the Dials. It was her first night out hunting for undead after Phillip\u2019s death, and grief for him and hatred toward herself had burst forth as she attacked the man bare-handed.</p><p>When he turned on her, a dagger in his hand, she\u2019d wrested the unfamiliar weapon from him and used it against him\u2014plunging it into mortal flesh and bone in an awful parody of slaying an undead. A berserker had overtaken her.</p><p>The man had been breathing when she left him, but, nevertheless, Victoria had inflicted grave harm on a human. A mortal, of the very race she was bound to protect.</p><p>After that incident, she\u2019d removed her vis bulla and let it languish. She mourned Phillip for a year, struggling to contain and control her need to destroy and avenge. It was then that she realized how terrible and dangerous her Venatorial gifts were\u2014how they could be used to destroy those she was meant to save.</p><p>When she replaced the vis bulla, she did so with the full understanding of who she was, and what her limits were. And with the vow that her powers were not to be used against her own race. That was not her role to play.</p><p>She took a deep breath and unclasped her hands, stretching her fingers, tried to ease the tension. The oddest thing of all was that Mr. Goodwin even knew of the incident in the Dials. After all, in that area of town, violence and murder happened so regularly that it was difficult for the authorities to bring the criminals to justice, if they were even notified of every death or injury\u2014which was impossible.</p><p>I\u2019ve been awaiting your return from Italy for nearly a year now.</p><p>Those words hung in her mind, leaving her with a greasy lump in the back of her throat.</p><p>She had to find out who\u2014or what\u2014Bemis Goodwin was.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Wherein a Highwayman Engages in Social Frivolities</p><p>In Victoria\u2019s mind masquerade balls weren\u2019t so terrible, as far as Society events went. After all, she wore her own kind of mask every day, and she\u2019d only ever attended one other such Society event\u2014shortly after she and Phillip had announced their engagement. The mystery and intrigue reminded her of a safer, more lighthearted version of her nightly hunts on the streets. Certainly, masked dances with many rich-blooded potential victims were liable to attract some of the undead, due to their ability to hide behind a domino or other facial obstruction, but it wasn\u2019t as though a vampire could enter a home uninvited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That aspect did cut down on the number of vampires that crashed these soirees.</p><p>As she alighted from the sleek, midnight blue carriage, Victoria adjusted her mask and slung her small reticule over the other wrist. She\u2019d purposely elected to use a plain carriage and arrive alone so that her identity would remain unknown for as long as possible. Despite her mother\u2019s transparent attempts to engage James Lacy as her escort, Victoria had slipped firmly out of any such mazes, warning her mother not to reveal the nature of her costume to the new marquess\u2014or even that she planned to attend. She didn\u2019t want anyone to know she would be there, particularly George Starcasset and Sara Regalado.</p><p>\u201cIf you do, I promise you, Mother, that I\u2019ll never accept another dance or invitation from Rockley again. And then how on earth will you ever get anyone to believe we\u2019ve developed an attachment?\u201d</p> <p>Apparently, Lady Melly believed her\u2014and the fallacy that there was a chance for the two to form an attachment\u2014 for she clamped her lips and nodded. \u201cBut you must promise to dance with him at least twice, and most definitely once after the masks have been removed.\u201d Victoria had made some vague reply, helped in her attempt to prevaricate by the industrious Verbena, who\u2019d been working on her hair in a most enthusiastic manner.</p><p>Now, as she took measured paces up the steps to Landross House, the residence of Lord and Lady Philander, Victoria felt a little knit of excitement trip down her spine. Unlike a few months ago, during the Carnivale in Rome where the streets were packed with costumed revelers, this would be a bit more sedate. The masks and costumes wouldn\u2019t include long beaks or ungainly papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 animal masks; likely, most of the garb would be gowns or dress clothing fashioned to represent the personage portrayed.</p><p>Because it was a masquerade ball, and the attendees\u2019 identities were to remain secret until midnight, when the masks were removed, the butler did not announce Victoria by name as she entered the ballroom. It was busy, but not thoroughly crowded. Since the fascinating new Marquess of Rockley was due to attend, Victoria knew the room would soon be a complete crush.</p><p>Fortunately, Landross House not only boasted a high-ceilinged anteroom next to the ballroom, where the food and drink had been laid out (along with some chairs for the chaperones and other matrons), but a generous terrace that ran along the entire length of the residence. The doors from the ballroom were opened to the night air, and small lanterns festooned potted fig, lemon, and olive trees throughout the patio.</p><p>Feeling secure behind her large cream-and-silver mask, which covered her from hairline to over the top of her nose, and curved down over the sides of her face like a medieval helm, Victoria strolled through the room. Most of her hair had been twisted into a long coil, then wound in a large, intricate knot at the back of her crown, but a thick wave had been left to hang freely over her shoulder and down over one side of her torso.</p> <p>The dancing had not yet started, and Victoria held her dance card and its little dangling pencil as she examined the other guests. She fully expected George Starcasset and Sara Regalado to be in attendance, and her main goal was to remain unrecognized by them so that she could observe.</p><p>In keeping with the theme of an underwater grotto, lighting was scarce and often obscured by false rocks inside the ballroom. Illumination threaded through the silver and blue strips of silk that hung from the ceiling, glittering and shifting the light as if it were under the ocean. The footmen, butler, and serving girls all wore livery decorated with glittering green, blue, and silver sequins, as though they were fish swimming silently among the guests. Victoria took a small glass of something pink and sparkling from one of them. It turned out to be effervescent water flavored with sugar and grapefruit peel\u2014 rather unusual and delicious, if a bit warm for her taste.</p><p>As she sipped, she turned in a slow arc from her vantage point across from the patio. From here, she could see the dance floor to her left, the orchestra positioned behind a thrush of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 rocks studded with fake seaweed and glittering fish, and beyond, in the anteroom, the long tables of food and drink.</p><p>Her eyes snagged on a man with blond hair that was long enough to just brush the back of his neck.</p><p>Romeo, if his doublet and slashed pantaloons were any indication. His cleft chin and the familiar movement of his shoulders betrayed his identity. As she watched George without appearing to do so, Victoria wondered if, somewhere, Sara was dressed as a matching Juliet.</p><p>As she considered whether to approach him directly or merely to observe, George turned and looked in her direction. Victoria held her breath and forced her attention to move casually away as though she didn\u2019t recognize him. She felt the weight of his attention skim over her and, out of the corner of her eye, watched it settle on one of the Fates, who happened to be holding a pair of shears.</p> <p>The glint of her blonde hair and the puffy pink lips beneath Atropos\u2019s mask, along with her diminutive stature, identified her as Gwen Starcasset. Victoria hadn\u2019t realized that Gwen was going to be in attendance tonight, and she eased back behind a nearby cluster of potted plants disguised as seaweed in an effort to keep out of her friend\u2019s view. Watching as George approached his sister, she strained to see if she could hear anything. Even from a distance, and in the untrustworthy illumination, she recognized the pure delight in Gwen\u2019s smile when her brother greeted her. And the surprise evident in his physical reaction, which gave Victoria something to think about.</p><p>\u201cAh . . . Diana the Huntress,\u201d murmured a silky voice from behind Victoria. \u201cHow apropos.\u201d</p><p>She stepped slightly to the side, angling half toward Sebastian while keeping her attention focused on George. Her left shoulder brushed against the right side of his chest. She smiled. He\u2019d guessed correctly that her flowing, silver-shot gown and Roman-styled hair depicted Diana. But perhaps the small bow and arrow hanging from her heavy belt had given him a clue.</p><p>The whisper-thin fabric of her togalike gown gathered over one shoulder with a wide silver clasp, leaving the other bare. Her skirt, made of the same material, fell in many deep folds to the floor, but wrapped around in such a manner that it split to well above her knee, just below a vee-shaped girdle of silver studded with cabochons. The slit gave her ease of movement when she walked, yet the yards of fabric camouflaged the opening when she was standing, as now. And Verbena, in a moment of brilliance, had created two separate skirts with the frothy fabric. The overskirt could be removed easily\u2014for it was tucked into the belt\u2014to reveal a shorter, less voluminous skirt in the event that Victoria needed more freedom of movement, which happened more often than not, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cYou have the advantage of me. I can\u2019t place your costume. Cupid perhaps? Odysseus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdonis, of course.\u201d His chuckle tickled her ear; he was standing much closer than was proper, and she did not move away. Under the cover of shadow, his arm slid around her from behind, tugging her gently back against him. Her heel stepped between his feet, and her light, silky gown gusted around his legs. The metal fastening on his toga was cold against her bare shoulder.</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t hold back a smile at Sebastian\u2019s boastfulness. Of course the man would dress as a perfect specimen of the male species\u2014he certainly considered himself such. And from what she\u2019d seen, he had the right to do so. She couldn\u2019t help a little flutter in the pit of her belly, and focused her attention strictly on George. He had bowed to Gwen and was leading her to the center of the ballroom for what looked to be the first dance of the evening\u2014a short, traditional line dance. The orchestra slid into the opening notes, led by two violins.</p><p>\u201cWhy does that not surprise me. But what are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSame as you, my dear. Enjoying wearing a mask, and anonymously keeping a watch over our acquaintances Romeo and Juliet. I missed you last evening,\u201d he murmured into her ear.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d she asked, remembering that, according to Max, he\u2019d been in Vauxhall Gardens on a false trail. \u201cI returned early after the dinner party at the Hungreaths\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hunting of vampires?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>\u201cNo, indeed.\u201d She hadn\u2019t yet had a chance to tell him about the events at the dinner party, and at this moment she felt rather like keeping them to herself. As if she would have an assignation with another man in the gardens when she and Sebastian were . . . well, what? She hadn\u2019t allowed Sebastian into her bed for months, and his frustration was becoming evident.</p><p>And truth to tell, she\u2019d begun to wonder exactly why she\u2019d been holding him off. Even now, his strong body eased up behind her and his firm arm around her waist reminded her of their intimacies . . . and of how she missed the touch and affection of a man who understood her. And now that he had joined the Venators, she thought she knew where his loyalties lay.</p><p>There in the shadowy corner behind the clump of fake seaweed, he brushed his lips and then the tip of his tongue along the delicate skin behind her ear. She shuddered lightly, and felt warmth flush through her. Perhaps tonight . . .</p><p>Sebastian smoothed his hand over the silk of her gown, murmuring, \u201cMight I say, your gown is quite\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrafty.\u201d</p><p>Victoria started and turned to find dark eyes looking down at her from behind her right shoulder. Max was dressed as a highwayman; there was no mistaking his garb, from the black cape and high black boots to the white shirt and red leather jerkin. A wide-brimmed black hat covered his thick hair, and a mask completely obscured the top half of his face, stopping just above his upper lip. He hadn\u2019t shaved, and his chin and jaw were dark with stubble. Despite his height, she might not have recognized him immediately if he hadn\u2019t spoken.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t quite the word I had in mind,\u201d Sebastian replied, his arm tightening ever so slightly against Victoria\u2019s belly as he shifted to the right, behind her. \u201cConvenient. That\u2019s more what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless, I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Victoria adjusted her mask and looked at Max. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana? I expected something less . . . obvious. Scheherazade, perhaps? Or even Zenobia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria drew herself up, moving slightly away from Sebastian and aware that her neck was moist from his ministrations. \u201cIt was Verbena\u2019s doing, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlame it on the maid, shall we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who chose your flowing black cape? Surely you wouldn\u2019t have made such an unfortunate choice. Besides, I rather like my costume,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d said Sebastian. His voice was as easy and smooth as the thin fabric, and to her shock and surprise, she felt his hands smooth along the sides of her hips and . . . down. . . .</p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d she breathed, and stepped away, her silk-stockinged leg lunging out from the slit. She turned to face the two men, who were standing at angles to each other.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could save it for later,\u201d Max said agreeably. \u201cThere\u2019s not a carriage in sight.\u201d</p><p>Victoria glared at him from behind her mask. He\u2019d never missed an opportunity to comment on the fact that Sebastian had seduced her in a carriage\u2014although how he had ever found out that bit of information, she\u2019d never been able to learn. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a bit risky for you to be here. Do you think that even though you wear a mask and hat, Sara wouldn\u2019t recognize you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that. No disguise can obscure true love.\u201d He was laughing now, sardonically but also with real humor. It was a rare sight, and one that made her distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cYour theory is wrong, Victoria, for I passed directly next to Sara, and she flickered not an eyelash.\u201d He turned to Sebastian. \u201cAnd how did you find Vauxhall? Such a convenient place for an assignation.\u201d</p> <p>Sebastian looked at him, and then his mouth tightened. \u201cI was not the one engaged in an assignation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Max inclined his head in full mockery. \u201cA case of mistaken identity, perhaps. I was fairly certain\u2014but never mind. Victoria and I had a pleasant chat in your absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do hope I\u2019m not intruding.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was both grateful for the interruption and startled as she realized that James Lacy, the Marquess of Rockley, had somehow approached, unnoticed. Unerringly, he\u2019d found her\u2014despite the fancy mask and her solitary arrival. Unfortunately, she knew just who to blame for that happenstance. She considered\u2014and immediately rejected\u2014the option of prevaricating, but knew it was useless. Her mother would find another way to manipulate them together. Thank God Lady Melly hadn\u2019t planned to attend tonight, although she\u2019d obviously found a way to communicate with James about Victoria\u2019s costume.</p><p>The fact that the three men with whom she was acquainted had found her, recognizing her so quickly and easily when she\u2019d taken such pains to remain anonymous, gave Max\u2019s criticism new credibility. She hoped that George hadn\u2019t seen through her disguise as easily.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my lord,\u201d Victoria said when she realized her two other companions had not responded, and made a brief curtsy. James was dressed as a medieval knight, complete with woolen hose\u2014which had to be stifling in the warm summer evening\u2014and a loose tunic, belted and boasting a wooden sword.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you would grant me this waltz,\u201d James said, giving a disjointed bow. She noticed that he\u2019d positioned himself so that he was between Sebastian and herself.</p><p>\u201cI certainly would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s already promised it to me.\u201d</p><p>Victoria could not have been more surprised if Lilith had walked into the room and asked to be staked. She might have expected Sebastian to make such a statement\u2014 and if the strangled look on his face was any indication, he had intended to\u2014but not Max.</p><p>Max? Dance?</p><p>Max? Engage in social frivolities? It was just as well that Victoria couldn\u2019t speak right away, for that gave James the opportunity to respond. \u201cBut is there another spot on your dance card, Mrs.\u2014er, Lady Rockley?\u201d And before she could respond, he plucked it out of her hand, complete with the tiny pencil and its silvery blue ribbon. \u201cBut there is nothing written on here,\u201d he began.</p><p>Max smoothly relieved him of his possession and glanced at it. \u201cIndeed there isn\u2019t.\u201d Victoria couldn\u2019t see his brows raise in that way he had, but she knew they did, beneath his mask. \u201cMy mistake.\u201d He returned the dance card to James, adding, \u201cBe my guest, my lord. We shall return.\u201d</p><p>Max directed Victoria none too gently to the dance floor. \u201cDo close your gaping mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will begin to think I\u2019ve dragged you out here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have. I never thought you would be one to engage in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSocial frivolities?\u201d</p><p>Had she said those words aloud?</p><p>Max positioned her firmly, his hand at her waist, his legs nearly brushing hers. Their hands clasped, glove to glove, and were angled properly, bent and apart from their bodies. Very correctly, in fact. And the first steps into the waltz, which brought them fairly into the center of the room, he executed so smoothly and perfectly between the other dancers that she could not help but look up at him in surprise. Again.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t look so bloody shocked,\u201d he said as they whirled past another couple. \u201cI may dislike dancing, but I\u2019m quite good at it.\u201d</p><p>Indeed. And as he eased them in and around the other couples as if they were cogs within a well-oiled watch-works, without hesitation, without lurching or shifting, or even coming within inches of anyone else, she realized she\u2019d been foolish to expect anything other than grace and timing from a man who fought like Max. After all, a man who could glide through the air could surely navigate the dance floor.</p><p>In fact, gliding through the air was something she had been unable to fathom ever doing, after having spent only one day practicing her qinggong under Kritanu\u2019s direction. She wondered if Max knew about that. She realized she was gripping his shoulder more tightly than she needed to, and eased her touch.</p><p>\u201cIf you dislike dancing, why are we out here?\u201d she asked impertinently.</p><p>\u201cHow else can we talk without being overheard?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, realizing again how tall he was. She wasn\u2019t a short woman, and she barely reached to Max\u2019s broad shoulder. But he was looking down at her, and she could discern the expression in his eyes. He didn\u2019t look as though this social frivolity was much of a hardship at all. Victoria felt suddenly breathless and flushed, so she spoke. \u201cDid you have something you wished to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had rather hoped the opposite. What have you done about that Bow Street Runner?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to ask how or what he knew of Mr. Goodwin\u2019s second visit and ensuing interrogation. \u201cI\u2019ve set Barth and Oliver on the task to spy on the man and find out what they can. Charley followed him today when he left, and returned with his direction. Now Oliver and Barth are taking turns watching him.\u201d</p><p>Barth was Verbena\u2019s cousin, and the hackney driver who habitually took Victoria to the unsavory parts of town when she was hunting vampires. After all, she could hardly take the Rockley carriage\u2014or any other carriage that might be identified as hers. And Oliver, who was Barth\u2019s friend and the bane of Verbena\u2019s existence, had traveled to Italy with Victoria and her maid. He was a large man who more often than not was cowed by Verbena\u2019ssharply wagging finger and tart tongue\u2014though she barely reached to his elbow.</p><p>\u201cBut he is a legitimate Bow Street Runner? Not that it matters; they\u2019re so bloody corrupt anyway.\u201d</p><p>She nodded as he directed them through an unexpected, complicated maneuver between two other couples\u2014one of which was completely out of step with the music\u2014and felt the surprise of cooler air over her leg when her skirt swirled wide and open. \u201cWhen Charley followed him, he returned to the magistrate\u2019s office. Someone will need to make inquiries about him, however, to see what else we can learn.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded, used gentle pressure at the center of her back to ease them into a spin, and Victoria nearly gasped aloud as she came face-to-face with Sara Regalado. Max\u2019s hands tightened on her, and they twirled again, away from Romeo and Juliet, who were waltzing in a much more structured manner.</p><p>\u201cI wonder,\u201d he said after a moment, breaking into her enjoyment of the elegant flow of their steps and the confident touch of his hands guiding her movements, \u201cif it has occurred to you that the new marquess might be our daytime vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, is it? Such familiarity with a man to whom you have no attachment.\u201d He managed, somehow, to lift his chin while looking down at her, annoying and arrogant even behind the mask.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s occurred to me,\u201d she replied. It was at least partly true. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also occurred to me that it could be you as well.\u201d</p><p>Ah! She\u2019d succeeded in surprising him\u2014she saw it in the sudden glint in his eyes and felt it when one of his steps wasn\u2019t quite as perfectly smooth as the previous. \u201cAfter all, for all I know, you\u2019ve been captured by Lilith, turned undead, and have come to London for some nefarious purpose\u2014drinking the special elixir, of course, so that you can move about in daylight and so that I cannot sense your vampirism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, Victoria.\u201d He nodded gravely, but there was reluctant humor in his eyes. And she swore she saw his lips twitch. \u201cBut I suggest you might keep a closer eye on the man. He recognized you rather quickly and easily tonight, without knowing that you are, indeed, a huntress. Unless, of course, he does know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rather think it was the hand of my mother that assisted him in his recognition of me.\u201d She lifted her chin, but looked over his shoulder. James Lacy was standing near the edge of the dance floor, where they\u2019d left him. \u201cHe knows no one else here, and acts otherwise indifferent to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trolling for compliments? There\u2019s not a man in this room who\u2019s indifferent to you, Victoria. Particularly in that gown.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, startled by his tone. \u201cThen you must include yourself in that group.\u201d</p><p>He gave a little laugh, rare humor lighting his eyes again. \u201cIf you consider the fact that I\u2019ve wanted to wrap my hands around your elegant little neck since that moment two years ago when you mistook me for a vampire then, yes, I am most definitely not indifferent to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have.\u201d His eyes were very dark.</p><p>\u201cAnd you rather enjoyed it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid I?\u201d he sounded amused. \u201cI seem to have forgotten the details.\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt a rise of annoyance, and she tightened her grip on his shoulder. But she made her smile sweet and knowing. \u201cAre you trolling for a reminder?\u201d</p><p>She imagined that, behind the mask, his eyebrows rose in that sardonic manner. \u201cWhat would be the point? Sebastian, Zavier, Beauregard, James Lacy . . . I have no desire to be one of many, Victoria.\u201d And now all humor vanished from his expression. \u201cNo man does.

And most definitely away from the Marquess of Rockley.\u201d</p> <p>Eleven</p><p>Dinner Is Announced</p><p>After their waltz, Max deposited Victoria at the edge of the dance floor where Vioget and Rockley waited. It was a bloody relief to let her go and step away. He bowed curtly and took himself off to investigate whatever the hell he could find to investigate.</p><p>She\u2019d be too damned busy to do so herself for awhile, if the expectant expressions on the faces of her two panting suitors were any indication. It looked as though Vioget might have a bit of a fight on his hands, although Max had no concerns that Victoria would make the same mistake with this Rockley as she had with the previous one.</p><p>Max\u2019s scalp was hot under his hat, and his mask felt stifling. His fingers still remembered the warm, delicate feel of her spine through that scandalously thin gown\u2014if one could call it a gown. Hadn\u2019t she been wearing a damned corset?</p><p>Some years ago, he\u2019d been witness to Parisian women dampening their thin muslin gowns so that they clung to the very outline of their entire body\u2014a Madame Gorhomme and her luxurious form sprang immediately to mind, prompting his tight mouth into a smile. But a glance at the dance floor stopped it. Christ, the fabric of Victoria\u2019s long toga was just as thin and revealing as Madame Gorhomme\u2019s\u2014without benefit of water.</p> <p>Hard to believe, he thought as he sidled his way through the warm crush of guests, that the lithe, light body he\u2019d just handled was the possessor of such power and skill. A man could hardly fathom it . . . yet he\u2019d experienced it firsthand: the strength and grace of her slender arms, the whirl of a powerful leg slamming into a vampire twice her size, the fire in her eyes and the flush of battle reddening her cheeks . . . all of which simply made her more fascinating to men like Vioget and Zavier. And even ones who had no idea who she was, and what she was capable of\u2014like her husband and the new American marquess.</p><p>Even creatures like Beauregard, whom she was bound to slay.</p><p>All thanks to the two vis bullae, hidden somewhere under that gown. And one of them was his.</p><p>While he wore only one, even though it was useless to him.</p><p>Max had an urge for whiskey to cleanse the bitterness in his mouth. He gestured for a sequined footman to pour him one, and turned back to watch the dancers.</p><p>God damn Lilith for taking away his only passion, the single purpose in the life he\u2019d salvaged after Papa and Giulia were gone. When he was done here in London, he was going after the vampire queen. He\u2019d send her to Hell and, God willing, would die himself in the process. And at last he\u2019d find out if he\u2019d paid enough penance for destroying his family.</p><p>He took a healthy swallow of whiskey.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Maximilian.\u201d</p> <p>Damn.</p><p>\u201cSara.\u201d Bloody hell. He\u2019d been so damned distracted he nearly walked into the chit.</p><p>\u201cI knew that had to be you,\u201d she said, her full lips curving under her rose-colored mask. She spoke smoothly, in their native Italian. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten how beautifully you waltz. Shall we, for old time\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sara\u2019s lips formed a generous pout. \u201cWhoever she was, not only did she get you to dance, but you were completely captivated. I shall have to be jealous, Maximilian. Or . . . perhaps it is Lilith who will be jealous.\u201d The pout had disappeared, along with the manufactured teasing in her voice.</p><p>Max\u2019s body drained of heat. Sara and Lilith? Good God. \u201cSo you have allied yourself with Lilith the Dark. A dangerous proposition. She\u2019s not known for constancy to her minions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you concerned for my well-being, then, Maximilian?\u201d She leaned into him, confident and bold. Her fingers wrapped around his arm and her leg brushed against his.</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d He grasped her wrist and set her away. \u201cHave you turned undead?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, looking up at him from under her lashes. \u201cWould you like me to drink from you, Max?\u201d</p><p>The whiskey in his belly churned. Lilith\u2019s bites on his neck had finally disappeared, but the memories assailed him: red, hot, pain, pleasure.</p><p>His mouth dried; his head suddenly felt light. He was weaker now; he had little power and only mortal strength. To be trapped by her fangs and her thrall would be so much worse. He felt for the silver ring that bulked out his gloved finger, and the feel of it steadied him. He\u2019d die before he would submit to her.</p><p>\u201cI see that the idea excites you,\u201d Sara murmured, and he felt her close to him again. \u201cPerhaps I can arrange\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a foolish young girl,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cIf you continue on this path, you\u2019ll end up like your father\u2014a pile of ashes at the other end of a stake.\u201d</p><p>And then he noticed Victoria. Something had caused her to stop in the middle of a waltz. She was looking over the crowd of people\u2014</p><p>Max realized he smelled smoke. Something was burning.</p><p>Victoria was hurrying toward the patio doors, and he saw movement out there, beyond the openings: tiny red lights glowing. Many of them.</p><p>Good Lord. Vampire eyes.</p><p>He started to move, and someone screamed from behind him. \u201cFire!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the hall!\u201d someone else shouted, and suddenly there was a wave of panicked people, pushing and shoving onto the dance floor, toward the patio doors.</p><p>In an instant he realized what was happening, and he looked down at Sara, who\u2019d grabbed his arm and leaned back into him. She had a pleased smile on her face as she looked up.</p><p>\u201cI do believe it\u2019s dinnertime.\u201d And then she moved against him. Something hard and metal poked into his ribs. \u201cBut never fear. I\u2019ve other plans for you.\u201d</p><p>Tearing off her mask, Victoria burst out into the summer night, stake in hand. Immediately, she saw at least a dozen pairs of vampire eyes swimming in the dark.</p><p>As she launched herself at the nearest one, she heard screaming behind her. The first vampire poofed into dust with little fanfare, obviously not having expected an attack. But when she turned, Victoria found herself facing three more undead.</p><p>Her loose gown whipped about her legs as she leaped onto a stone bench near the edge of the patio. The smell of smoke filtered through the air. She was aware of the flood of people coming out of the ballroom, running and shouting, but her attention was on the trio of vampires who clustered around her perch.</p><p>Kicking out with one foot, she caught a vampire in the chin as he lunged for her, and followed the momentum by jumping onto one of his companions. As they tumbled to the stone paving, she slammed the stake down, missed the creature\u2019s head, and found herself rolling onto her back, tangling in her filmy skirt and the loose length of her hair.</p><p>The vampire came with her, his red eyes angry and glowing. He grabbed her by the shoulders, pinning her arms down. His fangs gleamed as he lunged toward her. Victoria gave a great buck and twist and used his own upended weight to set him off balance, then flipped him over on the uneven stones. Her elbow planted against the ground, she made a quick slash. The stake slammed into his chest, blasting a poof of dust and ashes into her face. She took a moment to tear away the long overlayer of her skirt, leaving a shorter, less hampering amount of fabric. Her vision had tinged filmy pink and she was vaguely aware of the harder pounding of her heart, and a sharp, driving anger.</p><p>Before she could rise, something landed heavily on her back. The air exploded from her lungs and her face ground into grittiness. Cheek scraping against the rough patio, she levered her feet up behind her, kicking her second assailant in the small of the back as he lunged on top of her. The force of her heels sent the vampire sprawling toward her head, and she used the moment of imbalance to shove him to the side.</p><p>Quickly she slipped out from under him as he closed his hand over the loose length of her hair, yanking her back to the ground. Pain shot through her scalp as she twisted toward him, her hair wrapping around his arm as he reeled her closer. His eyes were rose pink, and when her gaze flashed over them, it snagged for a moment. She felt a warm tug, and everything began to slow. The agony in her scalp eased, and the stake felt loose in her fingers.</p><p>Victoria drew in a deep breath and jerked her chin in order to strain the thrall. She was able to force her eyes closed even as the vampire\u2019s free hand closed around her throat. She felt his fingers and their sharp nails tighten, clogging her breath. Hers steadied the stake in her hand as she fairly hung there, with him holding her by the throat. She went limp.</p><p>His fingers tightened and that was her cue: she slugged him with a foot, just enough to catch him off guard and force him to turn, and then automatically drove the stake into the target of his chest as it pivoted in front of her.</p><p>Victoria gulped in a breath as he froze, then billowed into a cloud of musty undead dust. Catching herself before her knees hit the ground, she had that split second to take stock. The burning smell was stronger, and black smoke billowed from the upper windows of the house. Seemingly unaware of the battle between mortal and vampire going on behind them, people stared in shock at the building, where, even from the outside, orange flames could be seen licking at the closed doors from the ballroom to the hall behind it. Still costumed and masked, they were shouting and calling out, and many of them were unaware of the red-eyed danger that lurked behind them. There had to be more than a dozen undead, watching, fighting, and attacking in the small clearing as the gardens became thick and dark. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Victoria watched, a duo of vampires lunged forward and snatched two spectators away from the rear of the crowd, dragging them toward those dark garden shadows. One of them was still masked, and looked like a medieval Crusader dressed in a dark red tunic. The other was a woman in a cream-and-gold gown in the Grecian style.</p><p>She started toward them, only to be yanked backward by a fist at the rear of her gown. Stumbling, she twisted around to meet a red-eyed undead.</p><p>She rammed her elbow up under the chin of the vampire that held her gown, and heard the slam and crack as his jaws came together. He tripped back and she helped him with the point of her stake, then turned back as he exploded into dust.</p> <p>Someone whirled sharply next to her, followed by a soft poof of vampire. Sebastian, with bare legs as beautiful and golden as Adonis himself, leaped onto the bench. He glanced at her with a sharp nod, and, as two undead rushed at them, Victoria spun one way and Sebastian leaped . . . and they both found their targets.</p><p>Victoria glanced around, realizing that the pinkness of her vision had eased a bit. People crowded the area, standing on the damp grass and ringing the patio, unaware that vampires lurked in the shadows, waiting to snatch them to feed. What was holding them back from rushing in en masse and grabbing their victims? Or corralling them and marching them off?</p><p>Perhaps it was the realization that she, Max, and Sebastian were there, slinging stakes about. Then Victoria stopped. She was wrong. There was no sign of Max\u2019s tall, dark figure.</p><p>The last time she\u2019d seen him was just as James brought her out to the dance floor. He\u2019d been moving toward the tables of food and drink, far from the entrance to the patio.</p><p>Then she remembered with a pitch of her stomach that he no longer wore the vis.</p> <p>Something shoved her from behind and she stumbled deeply. She used her forward motion to roll over in a somersault\u2014a very unladylike technique that Kritanu had just taught her\u2014then sprang to her feet, stake still in hand. The vampire had lunged after her, and when she steadied herself and turned, she went after him. Fool, she thought as he exploded.</p><p>As she turned back to the crowd of people, she remembered the two partygoers who\u2019d been taken off by the vampires. With a glance at Sebastian, who seemed to have taken to vampire staking with surprising vigor, Victoria dashed off down the brick pathway where the two vampires had dragged their prey.</p><p>Down the dark path she barreled, unfamiliar with the garden. Smoke tinged the air, and large black ashes wafted and swirled like small bats. She tripped over a stone, falling half into a boxwood or some other prickly hedge. Catching her balance, she paused, listening. She\u2019d left Sebastian to handle the group of vampires back there, choosing to go after the ones who were already feeding from their prey, and she wasn\u2019t sure that was the right thing to do.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t leave them to be killed in the shadows of a rosebush.</p><p>And Max could take care of himself. Wherever he was.</p><p>A soft gurgling cry met her ears, and Victoria spun to plow through a thick bush too dark to identify. She rammed her knee into something sharp and metal, felt it gouge and drag over her thigh. She kept going, heedless of the noise as she shoved the thin, sharp branches out of the way. Then she saw the shift of movement ahead.</p> <p>With a cry meant more to distract than anything else, she sprang the last few feet forward. The vampire released his victim, who crumpled to the ground in a puddle of white-and-gold fabric. Victoria launched herself at the vampire, and saw the dark drool of blood from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>The undead was a tall, corpulent female, her arms as bulky as those of a burly man. She smiled at Victoria, her fangs gleaming, and faced her, ready. \u201cThe female Venator,\u201d she grunted.</p><p>The smell of blood tickling at her consciousness, Victoria swallowed hard. And focused. She smiled back at the female, feeling the feral curl of her own lips\u2014but she didn\u2019t have time to waste looking ferocious and confident. With a quick snap, she broke off a wrist-sized branch as long as her leg, and swung out powerfully.</p><p>The female grabbed at it as Victoria expected she would, and Victoria gave a hard yank, pulling the vampire off balance. As the heavy creature lurched forward, Victoria leaped out of the way and tripped the lumbering undead, then spun to slam the stake deep into the back of her evil heart.</p><p>Before the dust had settled, she stumbled over to the victim collapsed on the ground, and turned her over. Her mask was gone and she recognized the shy Miss Melissa Keitherton, who spoke of little but her beloved cat Damian. She was still warm and breathing, and despite the blood oozing from her neck, she wasn\u2019t terribly hurt. It was a small wound, a single bite, with a relatively meager amount of blood. She would live to spoil Damian with catnip another day.</p><p>Victoria ripped a piece of silk from her gown and tied it firmly, but not too tightly, around the neck wound, and she then flung Miss Keitherton over her shoulder.</p><p>When she reached the patio again, she came upon a scene that could only be described as Hell. The house was in orange and red flames, throwing eerie shadows threaded with a dancing golden glow over the figures standing at the horizon of light and darkness. Smoke poured through the eaves and chimney, through upper windows open to the summer air. The ballroom, which appeared to be the last room on the lower level broached by the fire, was filled with black smoke. Flames ringed the far wall, making their way relatively slowly through a room that was fairly empty of fuel.</p><p>Releasing her burden gently to the ground, Victoria turned back and saw that the last pair of vampires, unengaged in battle and seeing that their companions had been vanquished, had turned tail. They bounded into the darkness, slick and dark and fast, and Victoria couldn\u2019t resist. She preferred that there be none to tell the tale to Lilith, or any other creature who might be there.</p> <p>But as she dashed into the shadows again, heedless of the now-tattered gown and the slipping silver brooch on her shoulder, she heard a loud noise behind her. Faltering in her chase, she turned just in time to see the house\u2019s roof fold in on itself. The sound of screams, dulled by the roar of fire and distance, reached her . . . and urged Victoria to return.</p><p>She let the vampires escape, realizing, suddenly, that she hadn\u2019t seen Gwendolyn. Had she made it out of the house? Were there others trapped inside? Max?</p><p>And what about George and Sara? There and at that moment, in the middle of the melee, Victoria realized how this whole tragedy had been executed\u2014and why.</p><p>Panting, Victoria sped back to the clearing in time to hear the tolling of the fire bell as the wagon arrived. It was impossible to pump a large volume of water fast enough to keep the fire from destroying the house\u2014it was too hot and too strong of a blaze. But at least the nearby buildings and fences could be dampened to keep it from spreading.</p><p>But now that the threat of the undead was gone and the house was evacuated, Victoria knew she needed to find George and Sara. It was obviously no accident that vampires had been waiting in the walled garden when a blaze forced a group of rich-blooded partygoers outside. As invited guests with access to the house, and members of the Tutela, George and Sara had obviously had a hand in this.</p><p>She scanned the crowd of people who\u2019d quieted down and were now merely staring with soot-streaked faces\u2014 some even unaware they were still wearing their masks. Shadows of light and dark danced over their smoke-tinted costumes and faces. Many of them spoke quietly to each other, shock turning stoic facial expressions into long, drab ones. The household staff clustered off to one side, some of them still in their glittering livery; others, in plain dress, watching their home and livelihood eaten alive by flames.</p><p>Victoria didn\u2019t see a Romeo or Juliet anywhere, nor an unmasked George or Sara. Nor, come to think of it, did she see Gwen.</p><p>Or Max.</p><p>Her heart thumping hard, she hurried forward, realizing she was limping from the gash on her leg. She shoved through the crowd of people to get between them and the house\u2014the only way she could see their faces and recognize anyone. Sebastian came up next to her. A slight sheen of sweat glistened on his face in the flames, and he put his arm around her, pulling her close.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked, his face in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find Gwendolyn,\u201d she replied, pulling away. \u201cOr Sara or George. Have you seen Max?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, none of them.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked around and left Sebastian. She walked along the inside of the ring of people, looking sharply at the clusters of faces turned to each other. Some were being embraced and others were crying. But there was no sign of Max. Or Gwen.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Gwendolyn Starcasset?\u201d she asked, at last coming upon a matron she vaguely recognized as being an acquaintance. She recalled that she had an odd fascination with science and chemistry, and often spoke endlessly about things that Victoria didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Mrs. Debora Guyette-Foster had tears running down her face, making glistening white lines in gray ash streaks. Her costume appeared to have been that of a gypsy, but her flowing scarves sagged, and her rainbow-colored frock was dark and torn. Glitter sparkled weakly in her straight, dark hair. \u201cShe\u2019s not here. She left before\u2014before\u2014\u201d The woman\u2019s sobs obliterated her words, but Victoria had heard enough to feel easier about Gwen.</p><p>But Max.</p><p>He would tower above most everyone here. She stood on the empty patio, close enough that the heat of the fire from the house blazed against the back of her legs and her one bare shoulder. Looking for the tall dark head.</p><p>A deep unease flowered inside her as she searched in vain. He had to have gotten out of the house.</p><p>But it would be just like him to be a hero, trying to rescue someone.</p><p>Damned man.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he be a hero by staking vampires?</p><p>Then she remembered the vampire that had dragged off the Crusader. Maybe Max had seen him, and gone after him.</p><p>Ignoring the people around her, who seemed to be coming out of their daze and once more were talking in full sentences, she ran into the dark garden again. This time she drove to the left, away from where she\u2019d rescued Miss Keitherton, and found herself abruptly against a tall hedge.</p><p>She smelled blood. Tasted it in the air. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria could have followed the hedge around, but impatience and need won out and she plowed right through it, heedless of the nasty branches. When she stumbled through to the other side, she landed on her knees next to a sprawled dark figure. The blood-iron essence filled her mouth and nose and she found herself struggling to breathe normally.</p><p>Groping frantically at him, for it was a man, she shoved him onto his back and saw vaguely that the dark red tunic of the Crusader merely looked black in the low light, with the dirt and soot and blood.</p><p>Her hands were wet with it, the cooling lifeblood of the man who would never wear another costume, ride another horse, eat another meal. Victoria pushed the hair from her face and pulled to her feet. There was nothing she could do for him. And she knew faintly that she had to leave him and get away from here. Her vision clouded darker in the night as saliva pooled in her mouth. The blood\u2019s essence tugged at her.</p> <p>Her heart pounded, ramrodding through her body so that her fingers trembled and it felt as though her whole chest was moving. Time churned sluggishly.</p><p>All at once, she realized she was not alone.</p><p>Victoria looked over. Three figures had come around the bushes and stood clustered together as though afraid to move any closer. She felt their shock and fear, and her heart pounded more strongly. She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dead,\u201d she managed to say. Gestured to the Crusading knight. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done now.\u201d She thought her words came out normally. But no one replied. They watched her, and she noticed that one had a gun. It wasn\u2019t pointed at her . . . but he had a gun.</p><p>A shout drew her attention. Her name. It was as though her ears were stuffed with cotton. She turned to see Sebastian. Slowly. The blood was so thick, it clogged everything. Even her movements.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d He came toward her, and she recognized the expression on his handsome face: worry, relief. He was soot-streaked and his hair was sticking out in thick waves. Before she could protest, or even think, he pulled her away from the small clearing, back toward the blazing house.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d he said as soon as they were far enough away, almost to the patio. She could breathe now. The blood-smell was gone and her head was a little clearer. The fire had quieted a bit, though the golden light flickered through the trees. The muted sounds from the crowd reached her ears.</p><p>Clarity.</p><p>She sank into his arms, felt them wrap strong around her, buried her head in his sweaty neck. \u201cSo much blood,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. He lifted her face. The kiss tasted like smoky Sebastian and sweat and it chased away the lingering essence of iron. He pulled away and looked down at her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d gone back in the house.\u201d His eyes were tigerish, the blaze turning them gold even in the dark. His fingers curled tight on her arms.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>But she thought of Max. If he wasn\u2019t outside, he had to be in the house.</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d said Sebastian. \u201cI . . . let me take you home.\u201d</p><p>She knew what he meant. But she didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t need to be steadied, didn\u2019t need to be held up, she let him put an arm around her. Moments later they were back with the others, but, by now, the crowd had begun to thin out. Some had been able to find their carriages and had left in disheveled, smoky clothing.</p><p>Others still stood, talking, describing in loud, important voices, what had happened. How they\u2019d escaped the fire, what they\u2019d been doing prior to the alarm, how they\u2019d helped pull out Mr. or Miss or Lady So-and-So.</p><p>She felt clearer now. Stronger.</p><p>Victoria turned toward the house, which had crumbled in on itself in some areas and still blazed angry orange and red. An elegant poplar that grew too close to the building had all its leaves burned off. The heat still blasted, but there was little to be done. The fire would burn itself out; keeping it from spreading was the only reasonable objective.</p><p>No one could get close enough to the structure to even pour water on it. There could be no survivors inside. How many people had perished?</p> <p>Who?</p><p>Victoria turned, not yet ready to leave with Sebastian, still searching, and she noticed a tall, dark, blade-nosed figure. Her heart leaped, and she lurched toward him\u2014 but then he moved from the shadows.</p><p>Mr. Bemis Goodwin.</p><p>He saw her and she felt the ugly weight of his eyes on her, sweeping over her. She could only imagine what he saw\u2014a torn gown, blood streaks everywhere, her hair in dishabille. His gaze narrowed and although he said nothing, did nothing to acknowledge her beyond an arrogant nod\u2014she felt it.</p><p>The animosity.</p><p>Sebastian folded her into his arms; she\u2019d told him nothing about Goodwin, so he couldn\u2019t know. But she felt a wave of foreboding sweep over her.</p><p>\u201cLet me take you home, Victoria,\u201d Sebastian said. His chin brushed the side of her head and she raised her face to look over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, still scanning the darkness.</p><p>At that moment, a dark figure came into view, making a wide skirt from around the front of the house. Appearing not to see her off to the side, he moved quickly, yet unsteadily, disappearing into the crowd of people. There was no mistaking it.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d Victoria breathed, her whole body going soft with relief. Then she felt jittery and warm. \u201cThank God.\u201d She stared after him, trying to determine if he was hurt or wounded. Where had he been?</p><p>\u201cAnd so it goes,\u201d Sebastian muttered, so quietly she wasn\u2019t certain he\u2019d really spoken. Then she realized she\u2019d stepped away from him, toward the crowd of people. And Max.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victoria looked back up at him.</p><p>His face was drawn and hard. His lips formed a humorless smile. \u201cAh, Victoria . . . don\u2019t be a fool. He doesn\u2019t want you. He doesn\u2019t want anyone.\u201d</p><p>Twelve</p><p>In Which Sebastian and Victoria Have an Uneventful Carriage Ride</p><p>The carriage rumbled down the night-dark street. The smell of smoke lingered inside, clinging to all three of its silent occupants.</p><p>Victoria sat next to Sebastian, across from a grim-faced, bedraggled Max.</p><p>But they were all weary, their throats and lungs skimmed with smoke, eyes dry and stinging, clothing torn and soot-streaked. Victoria\u2019s thigh continued to ooze blood, and the scratches on her face still stung.</p><p>She\u2019d had to fairly shove Max into the carriage for the ride back to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s home, reminding him that they were going to the same place. Since he\u2019d settled grumpily into his seat, arranging himself so that no one could sit next to him even if they\u2019d wanted to, he\u2019d remained silent.</p><p>Yet his eyes were not quiet. Still sharp, they scanned over her\u2014yet never met her gaze\u2014and Sebastian, then moved to stare out the window of the vehicle. His mask was long gone, as was the hat he\u2019d worn, and the cape she\u2019d teased him about. Stubble made his face darker and more shadowed. His eyes were sunken in their sockets, and his skin seemed to have tightened in the last hours. Those elegant hands hid in the shadows.</p><p>Sebastian shifted next to her, bringing a gentle waft of smoke and clove, and she felt his ungloved hand settle on her knee. Lightly, half pinned between their thighs . . . but it had eased there stealthily and smoothly. As if to keep from drawing attention.</p><p>Yet it was there. Warm.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want you. He doesn\u2019t want anyone.</p><p>Victoria glanced at Max, who continued to watch out the window. Sebastian\u2019s words had opened whole recesses in her mind. Had he guessed that the great weight, the awful, heavy mood that had settled over her as he encouraged her to come home had been from worry and grief over Max?</p><p>As she was turning to leave with Sebastian, knowing that there\u2019d been no hope for anyone left in the flaming building, knowing that if Max hadn\u2019t been in the house he would have been fighting with them, realizing that this time he had to be gone . . . had Sebastian realized how empty and weary she felt? How lost?</p><p>Would she have felt the same way if things had been reversed\u2014if Max was leading her away from a missing Sebastian?</p><p>And so it goes.</p><p>\u201cSorry to intrude on your carriage ride, old chap.\u201d Max\u2019s curt voice cut the silence. He had shifted and was looking at them. Down at the hand on Victoria\u2019s knee. \u201cBut my lady insisted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you?\u201d Victoria asked.</p><p>He lifted his gaze to her languidly, as though contemplating whether to respond. \u201cAs it turned out, Miss Sara Regalado required my escort. It took some time to extricate myself from the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left with her?\u201d</p><p>One side of his mouth twisted. \u201cThe lady was most insistent, and I do hate to disappoint. She had visions of reacquainting me with an old friend, believing that she\u2019d be rewarded for doing so. However, I found the idea quite distasteful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lilith is here? In London?\u201d</p><p>Max\u2019s eyes gleamed with appreciation. \u201cApparently that is the case, although I cannot confirm it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in what condition did you leave Miss Regalado?\u201d asked Sebastian.</p><p>Max transferred his gaze. \u201cAs I usually do\u2014quite distraught.\u201d His smile was pale and humorless in the shadows. \u201cBut nevertheless mobile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have the pleasure of his company; I assumed he was herding the evening fodder out to the vampires. Did you not see him?\u201d</p><p>Victoria shook her head. \u201cNo, although I was otherwise . . . engaged. He could have been there for some time, and later took himself off once it was clear the battle wasn\u2019t to be won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you bestir yourself to stake some vampires, then, Vioget?\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt Sebastian move. Ever so slightly, tension rippled along the arm and leg that pressed against her side. Then, as the hand on her knee lifted, the tension eased. \u201cA few,\u201d he replied negligently. \u201cWe . . . Victoria and I . . . took care of most of them.\u201d</p><p>She felt a gentle tug on the loose part of her hair and thought it had caught between them . . . but then she realized he\u2019d taken a lock of it and was rubbing it between a forefinger and thumb, twisting it softly around a digit. A most intimate gesture, and one that made her distinctly uncomfortable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before she could pull away or otherwise respond, the carriage gave the fortuitous lurch that announced their arrival.</p><p>Victoria stood quickly, causing Sebastian to release her hair. Max had the same idea and they fairly collided in the center of the small carriage, shoulder to chest.</p><p>\u201cIn a hurry, my dear?\u201d he asked with a grim smile. \u201cDon\u2019t let me get in your way.\u201d</p> <p>He settled back into his seat as the carriage door opened. Barth was there to help Victoria climb down, which she did with little fanfare\u2014and without waiting for Sebastian.</p><p>The dawn had come, and her mind was spinning.</p><p>As she walked up the house\u2019s walkway, she heard the low murmur of a male voice behind her, and the carriage door close again. A quick glance behind told her she was alone, and that Max and Sebastian had remained in the carriage.</p><p>Only hours later, with the sun blasting its heat through a rare, cloudless London sky, Victoria was awakened by a knock on her bedchamber door.</p><p>With bleary eyes, she looked next to her. The bed was empty, but rumpled. No, she hadn\u2019t dreamed it\u2014the warm slide of Sebastian\u2019s body next to hers, the hands on her hair, the gentle kiss before he gathered her close to sleep. He\u2019d murmured something unintelligible into the top of her head.</p> <p>She\u2019d drifted off thinking how unlike him that was . . . and wondering what had transpired between him and Max after she left the carriage.</p><p>Verbena entered at her bidding.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d she said, her lips pursed in a tight circle that barely moved when she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to wake ye, but that Ol\u2019ver claims he needs to speak t\u2019you right away.\u201d She shook her head, tsking in disgust. \u201cI told him you\u2019d only been abed for a few hours, but he \u2019nsists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend him up to me,\u201d Victoria said. An uncomfortable feeling opened in her stomach. Any news from Oliver would likely pertain to Mr. Bemis Goodwin.</p><p>\u201cUp here?\u201d Verbena fairly screeched, her eyes springing wide open. \u201cWhy, m\u2019lady, it\u2019s not proper. That man can wait while I dress ye, for sure, my lady. \u2019E has no call t\u2019be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Victoria shook her head. \u201cNo, it cannot wait, I\u2019m afraid. Call for him to be sent up, and if you\u2019re quick, perhaps you can help me into a day frock before he gets here.</p> <p>Verbena muttered something about Langford, who happened to be the personal maid to Duchess Farnham and who most likely would require smelling salts should her mistress have ordered her to bring a man to her bedchamber. Even, Victoria suspected, the late duke. But Verbena disappeared from the room for a brief moment, and her mistress heard the reverberation of her voice and its direction to Oliver. Then she returned and threw herself into Victoria\u2019s wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cI never heard o\u2019such a thing,\u201d she muttered as she bustled about, pulling forth a clean chemise and a new corset for her mistress. Victoria had bathed the night before, to cleanse herself from the smoke, blood, and soot, so the small ewer of water on her night table would suffice for her to freshen up.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Avin\u2019 a man no better\u2019n a footman into the lady\u2019s chamber! Why, the on\u2019y time I ever knew o\u2019 such a happenin\u2019 was when Lady Meryton was tuppin\u2019 her groom on the sly o\u2019 her husband, y\u2019know. An\u2019 it wasn\u2019t long afore such was all the talk o\u2019 the belowstairs!\u201d</p><p>She pulled the cotton shift down over Victoria\u2019s head, jerking it into place as she emphasized her words. \u201cAn\u2019 the groom, well, \u2019e was no prize, if ye ask me. I seen\u2019im once an\u2019 he had big eyebrows that looked like spiders. I\u2019d not be wantin\u2019 that face too close t\u2019me, ye know, wit\u2019 them squiggly things. An\u2019 on \u2019is ears, too! But\u201d\u2014she pulled on Victoria\u2019s corset to hook it in place beneath her breasts as there came a knock on the door. \u201cYe can jus\u2019 wait a minnit,\u201d she hollered.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Oliver,\u201d Victoria said.</p><p>Verbena straightened in shock, barely missing clipping Victoria\u2019s chin. She fairly flew to the chair over which she\u2019d hung the chosen frock. \u201cDo not come in here, Oliver,\u201d she ordered as the door cracked. \u201cOnly one more\u2014\u201d Her words became muffled as Victoria\u2019s ears were filled with the swoosh of fabric and rustle of lace and other gewgaws. She wouldn\u2019t have chosen such a decorated dress, but it was too late now.</p><p>At last Oliver came in, the large red-haired man half skulking as if in fear of Verbena\u2019s wrath. And rightly so. Victoria wondered what would become of them if they ever admitted their attraction for each other and actually had a normal conversation. He hunched a bit, twisting his cap in his large hands, and gave three bows in a row. \u201cMy lady, I\u2019ve come wi\u2019 some news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2019 course ye have,\u201d Verbena railed, tugging roughly at the buttons lining the nape of her mistress\u2019s neck. \u201cElse why would we let ye in \u2019ere? Now, spit it out, my lady\u2019s not got all the day to wait for ye to figger out what t\u2019say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome in, Oliver,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cWhat have you to tell me about Mr. Goodwin?\u201d</p><p>The process was excruciating, working around Verbena\u2019s bossy interjections and Oliver\u2019s hesitant narrative, but Victoria at last reeled the information from his depths.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the least bit comforting.</p><p>Last night\u2019s events had fixated Goodwin\u2019s suspicions more sharply on Victoria\u2014as if they hadn\u2019t already been sharp enough. The fact that she\u2019d been at the affair had been only part of it. Vague stories of her acting in an unladylike manner had blossomed. As Oliver told it, when Goodwin learned that she had been found crouched next to a ravaged man alone in a sequestered part of the garden with blood everywhere, including dripping from her mouth and an odd expression on a scratched face . . .</p><p>Blood dripping from her mouth?</p><p>It took her a moment to remember pushing the hair away from her face. Maybe blood had been on her hands and smeared near her lips.</p><p>And apparently the scratches on her face had been, not the result of blasting through a hedge of boxwood, but in self-defense from her victim as she\u2019d bent to drink his blood.</p><p>Victoria had a healthy enough imagination to know that was exactly what Goodwin would be thinking.</p><p>\u201c \u2019E\u2019s goin\u2019 to come here an\u2019 take ye right to the magistrate. Today,\u201d Oliver concluded, still worrying his hat. \u201cAn\u2019 he\u2019ll listen t\u2019Goodwin, and put ye in Newgate. M\u2019lady, ye can\u2019t go in there. It\u2019s no place\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of being put into Newgate,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve no fear of the place anyway.\u201d Yet a shiver skittered over her shoulders. Even for Illa Gardella, it would be unpleasant.</p><p>But the worst of it was that she wouldn\u2019t spend much time in Newgate at all, for murderers were tried quickly. She\u2019d be on the scaffold with a noose around her neck within a week, if Goodwin had his way.</p><p>She turned to Verbena. \u201cI\u2019m indisposed for the day. I will see no one. No one, Verbena. Not Max, not Kritanu, nor Sebastian Vioget.\u201d She looked at Verbena sharply. \u201cAnd don\u2019t drink anything with Sebastian\u2014or Max, for that matter. And you\u2019re to tell no one of this conversation\u2014either of you.\u201d She glared at both of them, fixing the strength of Illa Gardella in her gaze. \u201cI cannot risk having any of you carted off to Newgate for trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what will you do, my lady?\u201d</p><p>Victoria stood. \u201cFirst, I will borrow your cloak. And . . . could you perhaps cut off a bit of your hair for me?\u201d</p><p>The short puff of orange hair peeking from the low-hanging hood of Verbena\u2019s cloak easily disguised Victoria out of the back of the house, through the mews, and onto the street nearby. She met Barth in his hackney a few blocks away, feeling as though she was making the secret assignation that Sebastian had suspected of her.</p><p>The ride to Gwendolyn Starcasset\u2019s home gave Victoria a few moments to remove the disguising cloak, and to think about Bemis Goodwin. It wasn\u2019t possible that coincidence kept bringing him to the places where vampire attacks happened.</p><p>Near the Starcasset residence, Victoria alighted from the hack and walked a half block to the walkway. She preferred not to have to answer queries as to why she used a public hackney instead of one of her own carriages. Victoria actually wondered why she even kept her own carriages. She never used them.</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d Gwendolyn shrieked and threw herself into her friend\u2019s arms. In any other case, a young woman such as Victoria would have staggered back under the force of her onslaught . . . but of course one as strong as Illa Gardella did not.</p><p>Gwen\u2019s eyes were red-rimmed and her nose tinged pink. Her face looked as though she hadn\u2019t slept all night. Her embrace included a damp handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn,\u201d Victoria replied with as much heartfelt emotion as the other woman. \u201cI just had to see for myself that you were uninjured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent a message to your house this morning to ensure myself that you\u2019d escaped the tragedy, but had no response! I\u2019ve been simply distraught, Victoria. And George too,\u201d she said, with a covert look at her friend.</p><p>Ah, a convenient opening. Victoria smiled inside but kept a sober expression. \u201cThen Mr. Starcasset is well? I was able to learn that you\u2019d left early\u2014which surprised me, Gwen, for I know how you adore such parties\u2014but I did not see your brother anywhere during the horrible fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it truly frightening?\u201d Gwen asked. She looked sincerely upset\u2014rather than greedy for the sordid details. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that at least eight people are unaccounted for, Victoria, and I so feared that you were one of them. And poor Mr. Ferguson-Brightley was burned so badly, it\u2019s certain he won\u2019t live.\u201d Her eyes welled with tears. \u201cI cannot fathom how I was so lucky as to have been called home early, even if it was a misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were called home?\u201d The pieces clicked into place. Had George made certain his sister was spared?</p><p>\u201cIt was quite Providential that George recognized me, for he had no idea that I was meant to attend last night. I thought . . .\u201d Gwen actually blushed, looking away from Victoria for a moment. \u201cI told no one that I was to attend, for I thought that it would be amusing . . . well, I am to be married in a few weeks, and though I do love Brodebaugh. . . but, Victoria, he is just not quite so handsome and dashing as your Phillip was . . . and, oh, I\u2019m making a cake of this, am I not! You must think so poorly of me, but truly, it was a harmless thought I had . . . to spend one last night as a debutante. I was masked, so no one would recognize me, and I only wished to dance.\u201d Her voice trailed off as Victoria nodded encouragingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now,\u201d she told Gwen soothingly. \u201cHow did it come about that you left the party early, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, George espied me and he told me that Brodebaugh had come to the house looking for me . . . and of course, I left immediately.\u201d She twisted her hands together, looking altogether miserable. \u201cI do love him, Victoria. And I never meant to do anything to harm him. It really was for innocent fun.\u201d</p><p>Innocent fun that nearly got her killed . . . or fed on by a vampire. At least George had had the conscience to send her home before executing his Tutela plan.</p> <p>But that answered one question. A vampire would just as soon walk away from their dying lover or mother as feed on them, should the urge arise. It would be hard to believe that George was the daytime vampire . . . for the one thing the undead didn\u2019t have was a conscience.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Wherein Our Heroine Makes a Telling Decision</p><p>Victoria left Gwendolyn\u2019s house relieved that her friend was unhurt, but deep in thought.</p><p>She\u2019d realized that there could be more than one daytime vampire, as she\u2019d begun to think of the creature. After all, if an undead merely had to drink the special elixir, what was to stop more than one of them from doing it?</p> <p>Or many of them?</p><p>She sat in the hackney, her shoulder slamming against the side every time Barth made a right turn, and her head bobbing every time he urged the horse forward. His vulgar language peppered the air as he navigated them down Fleet Street\u2014a mistake in itself, for the road was clogged with other carriages and conveyances, as well as shoppers, shopkeepers, and street urchins.</p><p>But it gave Victoria a bit of time to consider the situation.</p><p>From what she knew about the elixir, it could only be made from the stamen of a special plant that bloomed rarely\u2014perhaps once per century, or no more than twice. Since little could be made, more vampires must want it than could have it. That didn\u2019t preclude more than one undead from using it, but the supply couldn\u2019t last forever. And there couldn\u2019t be an entire army of undead drinking it, which gave her some measure of comfort.</p><p>Still, both Sara and George could be daytime vampires.</p><p>Of course, as Max had suggested, James could be the daytime undead. She hadn\u2019t missed the fact that the incidents had begun to occur the day he arrived at St. Heath\u2019s Row.</p> <p>Sara and George, as well as James, had been at the Hungreath dinner party, and also at the masquerade ball. And while she\u2019d seen none of them in Regent\u2019s Park when Victoria found the first victim, that didn\u2019t mean they hadn\u2019t been around. She had, after all, spoken with Gwen and Brodebaugh, who could have told them Victoria was in the vicinity.</p><p>Or, it could simply be that the daytime vampire was someone she didn\u2019t know or hadn\u2019t noticed. After all, it didn\u2019t have to be someone she\u2019d seen. It could be any minion of Lilith.</p><p>And, yes indeed, it could also be Mr. Bemis Goodwin.</p><p>Oh, how she wanted it to be him.</p><p>Even now, thinking about how his sharp, angry eyes examined her, searching for something that wasn\u2019t there, she felt tension rise. Her fingers itched for a stake, ready to plunge it into his chest. He had made it clear he wanted nothing more than to see her hang.</p><p>But why?</p><p>Victoria turned the ugly thought over in her mind. It wasn\u2019t easy; the fury tinged her vision, and her mind rebelled at the very thought . . . but she had to consider it.</p><p>Why would a man she didn\u2019t know want to harm her?</p> <p>Several deep breaths later\u2014ones she\u2019d had to focus on, draw in deeply, hold, and then release\u2014Victoria had pared her scattered, berserker thoughts down.</p><p>He either truly thought she was a murderess and wanted to see justice done\u2014in which case, she was innocent and should have nothing to worry about. But that wouldn\u2019t explain his pointed comments about the undead.</p><p>A woman like you.</p><p>No, he knew something about her. He could be a vampire himself and be drinking the elixir. Obviously a vampire would want her, Illa Gardella, to die. But that didn\u2019t follow\u2014for he\u2019d said he\u2019d been watching her for over a year. Since she nearly killed the man in the Dials. The elixir hadn\u2019t been in existence for that long, and he appeared to have been living a normal life as a Bow Street Runner for longer than that.</p><p>She concluded he couldn\u2019t be undead himself.</p><p>He could believe she was a vampire herself, and want to destroy her. If Barth and Verbena had known about vampires before Victoria did, before she became a Venator . . . it was possible that he did too. But . . . if he knew anything about vampires, he would know that hanging her would do no good. So why focus on getting her to the magistrate?</p><p>If that were the case, if he believed she was a vampire, that should be easy to address\u2014after all, then they were fighting on the same side.</p><p>Or . . . this was the most interesting, and worrisome thought: perhaps he wanted revenge. Perhaps he knew someone she\u2019d killed\u2014a vampire she\u2019d staked, who\u2019d once been someone he loved. A wife or a brother, or anyone.</p><p>So that would mean he knew that she was a Venator, and knew that the undead had tried many times to destroy her without luck. And he would try another way.</p><p>After all, bullets, blades, nooses\u2014they would all work equally well to slay a Venator.</p><p>Victoria felt an unpleasant shiver ripple over her shoulders. Whatever the reason, Bemis Goodwin loathed her, and he was essentially an unknown opponent.</p><p>These thoughts settled in her mind, leaving Victoria uncomfortable, but not panicked. After all, she knew she was a formidable adversary herself.</p><p>But when the hackney dropped her off a block from Aunt Eustacia\u2019s house, and Victoria slipped into the mews that led into the small yard behind the house, she found herself confronted by Bemis Goodwin and four burly men. On seeing them, her first thought was that he clearly knew her strength.</p><p>She\u2019d already stepped out of sight of Barth, who\u2019d rattled off in the carriage as soon as her slippers touched the ground. And the thick hedge of the mews, which ran along behind the row of houses, obscured the view from any of the residences\u2014should anyone happen to be watching, which was in itself unlikely.</p><p>Any further considerations evaporated as she braced herself, ready for battle. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked, aware that her heart was racing.</p><p>\u201cCome now, Lady Rockley,\u201d Goodwin said with a supercilious gesture. \u201cIt should be no surprise to you that the magistrate awaits your presence. I\u2019m merely here to see that he gets it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what reason?\u201d She inched to the side, eyeing the thug closest to her as a feeling of urgency began to build, and her heart to pound. He couldn\u2019t be as strong as a vampire. Or a Venator. None of them could be. Confidence surged through her. She was also smaller and could slip through the hedge more easily. . . .</p><p>\u201cIt will do you no good to run, Lady Rockley. You may be quick and strong, but you cannot outrun this.\u201d He pulled a gun from his pocket.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t. But the bullet would have to find her first.</p><p>Red glazing her vision, she ducked and rushed at the first of the burly men, knocking him into Goodwin. The sharp retort of a pistol shot sounded, and something whistled through the air much too close to her.</p><p>Victoria spun and began a mad dash through the hedge\u2014if she made it through, she\u2019d be in sight of the rear windows of the house and there was a chance someone would see her.</p><p>Something yanked hard at her cloak, and she flew backward, landing with the jolt of her skull on the ground. Head spinning, heart pounding, veins pumping, she rolled and leaped to her feet. Rage blasted through her, and she kicked out, tearing into the man closest to her. She felt her nails pare the skin from his face and her foot connect with something soft.</p><p>Her red-hued world became a cyclone of movement and ferocity in that narrow, dark walkway until suddenly something wafted down over her. It was clingy and heavy and she realized a net had been thrown over her. It wrapped around her legs, restricted her arms, and before she could fight her way out of it, the net tightened and Victoria felt herself falling.</p><p>She crashed to the ground, her head slamming onto a rock. Someone shoved her into a spin. She rolled, tangling further in the net, shouting now\u2014hoping that someone\u2014Max, Verbena, Kritanu, someone would hear.</p><p>Something dark went over her head, muffling her voice and smothering her gasps for air, and, like a bundle, she was lifted. The heavy cloth tightened over her face, cloistering her nose and mouth, making her struggle for every bit of air. She struggled, bucking and kicking . . . the red of her vision faded, consciousness ebbed, and she knew no more.</p><p>When Victoria became aware again, she found herself sitting in a hard wooden chair. Her hands were bound behind her and she slumped forward. The only things preventing her from tumbling off the chair were her arms bent over the top of it. They ached, and her fingers were cold and numb. Her feet were in a similar condition, tied to the rung of the chair.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. She kept her eyes closed and listened. It took her only a moment to realize that she\u2019d awakened in the middle of Goodwin\u2019s meeting with the magistrate. Her hearing, such as it were.</p><p>Her mind was fuzzy, and she knew little about the workings of the Bow Street Runners and their responsibility to the magistrate. But she did know that there were few honest magistrates. And fewer honest Runners. Which did not ease her anxiety in the least.</p><p>\u201cI find your evidence against Lady Rockley compelling, Mr. Goodwin,\u201d intoned a voice, presumably that of the magistrate.</p><p>\u201cThe woman is exceedingly strong,\u201d now spoke Goodwin himself. \u201cShe will have to be transported in chains, and in secrecy. She has some fairly able friends.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth went dry. Chains? Good God. But surely they would have to bring her to public trial. And by that time, Max, and Sebastian, and Lady Melly\u2014</p><p>But did any of them know where she was?</p><p>Barth and Oliver would know. They\u2019d still be watching Goodwin. Or they would be able to figure it out.</p><p>She lifted her head. Its throbbing was so harsh it had to be audible. \u201cWho brings the charges against me?\u201d she said. Her voice . . . it was not one she recognized. It was . . . dark, heavy, rough. A shiver rattled down her arms and she pulled on her bonds as rage shuddered through her. \u201cSomeone must charge me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She knew at least that much about crime and punishment in London. A victim or family member must press charges for a trial to occur. There were no representatives, or prosecutors, for the general public.</p><p>\u201cAh, she is with us again.\u201d Goodwin\u2019s face came into her view, blurred and clouded with the red haze. His breath smelled of stale ale.</p><p>\u201cWho charges me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is I who bring the charges,\u201d Goodwin replied.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Victoria blinked rapidly, trying to alleviate the distortion. Her thoughts were scrambled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His face came in front of hers, his long sharp nose shining, eyes dark with loathing. \u201cMy brother. You killed my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother? Who is your brother?\u201d Victoria demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve killed no one.\u201d</p><p>A loud crack sounded, a hammer slamming onto a wooden surface. \u201cTake the prisoner to Newgate. I\u2019ll arrange for the trial to be held tomorrow.\u201d The magistrate\u2019s voice was filled with malice. \u201cThe assizes judge is in my debt and will be happy to hurry things along in this case.\u201d</p> <p>Tomorrow?</p><p>Victoria raised her head to protest, but something hard slapped against her cheek. Her head whipped up and back so hard the chair tottered.</p><p>\u201cI have no sympathy for murderesses, especially those who mutilate their victims first.\u201d Goodwin\u2019s ale breath was hot on her face as he bent in front of her. His eyes glowed with triumph. \u201cCutting them up and tearing them to pieces. What did you do with your husband, Lady Rockley?\u201d</p><p>Her cheek throbbed, and the room wavered, but she fixed her gaze on him. \u201cI\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Goodwin rose upright, crowing. \u201cThe proclamation of innocence\u2014but of course. You\u2019ve used your powers and strength to do whatever you choose . . . and you\u2019ll pay recompense and hang by your lovely neck, dear lady.\u201d</p><p>She would have responded again, but the black hood came down over her face, obstructing her vision. As she breathed, the cloth became more smothering, as if her need for air drew it closer and closer about her face, plastering it to her nose and eyes. Victoria struggled to dislodge the hood, but something tightened about her neck, holding it in place.</p> <p>She heard the clink of chains. Her arms were loosened from the back of the chair, and she fell forward, dizzy and still bound by her ankles. Crashing onto the ground, she realized the ties at her wrists were no longer as tight. Someone moved next to her; she felt the bump of a leg or knee against the side of her hip, and heard more clinking.</p><p>Dragging in a hot, muffled breath, Victoria lurched onto her face and shoulders and, using her legs, raised the sturdy chair, snapped her heels toward the back of her head. The powerful swing whipped the seat onto the man kneeling next to her, and she heard\u2014and felt\u2014it smash into pieces. Chunks of wood splintered, raining down on them. Goodwin groaned as he slumped to the ground, heavy against her.</p><p>Still fighting for air, Victoria pulled at the ropes around her wrists and frantically began to jimmy her hands free. Someone shouted, and she heard quick, hard movements in the room. One wrist popped free and she tore at the hood and its tie.</p><p>Something smashed into her shoulder blades, and she fell face-first down against something warm and soft\u2014 Goodwin, she realized. The other movement must be coming from the magistrate. A heavy weight lunged onto her, and he was shouting for assistance in her ear. One of her arms was captured, yanked up behind her back\u2014but the other one was safely under her, tearing at the tie at her throat until at last it came loose.</p><p>With a guttural cry, she yanked the hood off and gulped in fresh, clean air.</p><p>And then she was ready to fight.</p><p>Able to breathe, and see, she was galvanized by fury. She moved like furious lightning, rolling to the side, striking fast and hard. The magistrate tumbled back under her assault, and Victoria bent to tear the ropes from her ankles. Thus released, the last vestiges of the chair clattered to the floor as she heard the sounds of thundering footsteps.</p><p>Scrambling to her feet, she saw Goodwin dragging himself up under the wreckage of the chair, and the man who had to be the magistrate trying to pull to his feet. Next time she would hit them harder.</p> <p>Victoria dashed toward the dark window, smashing the glass with the chains with which they\u2019d meant to bind her. The ground wasn\u2019t far below, and as she leaped through, a jagged edge of glass sliced the underside of her thigh and she heard the door slam open in her wake.</p><p>Landing on the ground in a neat crouch, she sprang to her feet. The fresh night air was like ambrosia, despite the stench of garbage and other waste. The building from which she\u2019d escaped was on a narrow street, and if she\u2019d jumped at the wrong angle she could have slammed into one the nearby walls.</p><p>Looking at the night sky, Victoria realized how late it was. She must have been unconscious for hours, and it had taken that long for Goodwin to arrange for the meeting with his crooked magistrate.</p><p>She hesitated, warring between the driving desire to go back and destroy Goodwin and his magistrate, and the need to get away. If she left, they would come after her again. She knew it.</p><p>A door opened, spilling light into the darkness, and she saw the tall figure of Goodwin outlined. He held a pistol. Two of his henchmen loomed behind him, and they burst out into the night.</p><p>Hesitation gone, she turned and dashed away. She couldn\u2019t fight against a bullet. Shouts told her they were following, and she ran pell-mell down the dark street, turning onto another, and then another. She realized belatedly that this was not a pleasant area of town, or one that would boast a magistrate\u2019s office. Her suspicion that the magistrate was just as corrupt as Goodwin, and that they had had to meet in secret, solidified.</p><p>Pushing past prostitutes and drunkards, dodging carts and dogs, Victoria slowed her pace when she turned onto a dark street that was curiously empty.</p><p>The thick crescent moon shone high and seemed to beam down the center of the narrow street. Her vision still blurred faint red, and rage bubbled through her.</p><p>And then Victoria realized that the back of her neck was abnormally cold.</p><p>Which could explain why the street was empty.</p><p>Pounding footsteps slapped to a halt behind her, and she turned to see Goodwin, and one of his men, half a block away. He raised his arm, and she saw the gleam of metal in the moonlight, pointing at her.</p><p>\u201cStop there, madame.\u201d</p><p>The chill on the nape of her neck was colder, and she sensed the arrival of an undead. Or two.</p><p>\u201cWho was your brother?\u201d she called back to Goodwin, taking a step away from him. The farther she was from that bullet . . . The prickles at the back of her neck were growing worse. Where was it? Or they?</p><p>\u201cFrederick Goodwin, Baron Truscott.\u201d</p><p>Her gazed darted around as she looked for something to use as a stake, but she saw nothing of use. Then she felt, rather than saw, something shift\u2014just out of her vision.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember him? But of course . . . why should you? He was only one of many that you\u2019ve destroyed.\u201d He took another step toward her, and she backed up slightly. They were separated by perhaps five carriage lengths, but she stood in the center of the street, well lit and unprotected. A bullet in the heart or head would kill her, just as it would any other mortal.</p><p>\u201cI remember him.\u201d She did indeed remember Lord Truscott\u2014a Society man she\u2019d danced with more than a year ago, and then only days later had been forced to stake. In that time he\u2019d turned to a vampire and coaxed Miss Emily Colton from a party and into the dark gardens.</p><p>Victoria had been receiving Phillip\u2019s proposal when she realized what was happening, and had needed to duck away.</p><p>She was not likely to forget Lord Truscott.</p><p>\u201cYou killed him. After all I\u2019d done to protect him.\u201d The chill sharpened, and Victoria spun just as a shadow turned into the figure of a man in front of her. As she ducked the undead\u2019s attack, ramming into his gut, a gun fired. For the second time that day, a bullet whizzed much too close to her head.</p><p>She flipped the vampire over her shoulder and whirled around, still looking for something to use as a stake. The undead crashed to the ground, and she looked up to see Goodwin facing a cluster of vampires. Three of them. That made four total.</p><p>Red eyes glowing, the undead in front of her scrambled to his feet and launched himself at Victoria. As she kicked out, catching the vampire in the chin, she saw Goodwin pitch his firearm wildly at the one closest to him.</p><p>When the creature near her attacked again, she pummeled him back, allowing all of her red rage to burst free with kicks, punches, elbows, and head butts. The last time she smashed him to the ground, he had enough and scrambled to his feet, running away.</p><p>Victoria turned and saw Goodwin pinned to a brick wall by the hand of a vampire. His legs thrashed wildly and anything he might have screamed was reduced to faint gurgles. Two others were closing in on his large companion, who brandished a heavy club.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be long before he was relieved of the club.</p><p>The rest of the street was quiet and empty.</p><p>Victoria looked at them through red vision, heart pounding, hatred surging through her. Then turned her back on the scene and walked into the darkness.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Victoria Faces the Music</p><p>\u201cI never thought to see you in such a state, Vioget. If there\u2019s one woman who can take care of herself, it\u2019s Victoria,\u201d Pesaro drawled.</p><p>Sebastian turned away from the supercilious prick, who lounged long and dark in an armchair, a book open in his lap. Not only was his neck cloth a disgrace, but he looked supremely unconcerned about the fact that Victoria seemed to have disappeared. The hackney driver, Barth, claimed he\u2019d let her off a block away from the house in the early afternoon . . . but no one had seen or heard from her since.</p><p>But what did he expect from Max Pesaro? The man was utterly useless except for slinging insults and veiled comments now that he\u2019d lost his Venator powers.</p><p>He was an unfeeling bastard, but he\u2019d made his opinions clear to Sebastian last night, when Victoria left them alone in the carriage.</p><p>I\u2019ll be gone soon. You\u2019ll need to stay with Victoria. I know you loved Giulia, and though you may not believe it, so did I. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sentiment had been implicit: take care of Victoria without overtly taking care of her. It smacked of Pilate, but Sebastian\u2019s annoyance grew from the fact that Pesaro felt it necessary to make it an order. Yet, the fact that Pesaro had felt the conversation a necessity at all made it clear that Sebastian\u2019s warning to Victoria had been accurate: He doesn\u2019t want anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be better off learning that now,\u201d Pesaro continued, holding a glass of brandy that was as full as it had been when poured. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need to be taken care of. Nor does she desire it.\u201d But take care of her regardless.</p><p>Sebastian took a drink of his own liquor instead of replying the way he wanted to. He was better equipped to know Victoria\u2019s desires than Pesaro was, by God. Once he swallowed the burning liquid and leashed his instinctive response, he replied, \u201cThat may be the case\u2014which remains to be seen\u2014but since I\u2019ve been in such close proximity to her, I\u2019ve noticed that all is not well. She\u2019s acting differently.\u201d</p> <p>Pesaro glanced sharply toward the door, and Sebastian stilled for a moment. Had that been a sound in the front entrance? By silent communion, they waited for another beat, but they heard nothing else.</p><p>Sebastian sipped again, rolling the brandy over his tongue. Unease tickled when he looked at the clock and saw that it was midnight.</p><p>\u201cDifferently?\u201d Pesaro sounded bored, but Sebastian noticed that he was resting the glass on the table next to him.</p><p>He could barely stand the sight of Pesaro sometimes, for the shape and color of the man\u2019s dark eyes reminded him of Giuilia\u2019s, along with the sharp peaks that formed the dip in his upper lip. On her, the Pesaro eyes had been huge and overwhelming in her pale, delicate face, and her lower lip a lush complement to the well-formed upper one. . . .</p><p>Giulia had been a sickly girl, thin and delicate, with a cough that never seemed to ease. Sebastian had fallen completely, foolishly in love with her the first time he laid eyes on her at fifteen. Plagued by illness, she might not have lived to her twenties, but her life had been shortened even further by her brother\u2019s naive decision to bring her to the Tutela. Pesaro had thought vampirism\u2019s immortality would be the cure for her illness, but he\u2019d been horribly tricked.</p> <p>Sebastian steeled his thoughts, returning from the past to the present concern. God help him\u2014he couldn\u2019t bear to lose Victoria as he had Giulia. But he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She was so much stronger.</p><p>\u201cShe reacts to the smell of blood,\u201d he told Pesaro, returning to the conversation. He hated having to share his concerns with him, but there was no one else. And, like it or not, Pesaro had been a fierce, capable, knowledgeable Venator who had given even Beauregard concern.</p><p>Sebastian\u2019s statement snared the other man\u2019s attention. The glass clunked softly as Pesaro released it completely onto the table. Though he didn\u2019t move otherwise, Sebastian noticed that his eyes sharpened in a way Giulia\u2019s never had. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian explained what had happened in the sewers, and also at the masquerade ball when he\u2019d come upon her next to the dead Crusading knight. \u201cShe told me she has moments where she doesn\u2019t feel the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve just now decided to share that important detail?\u201d</p> <p>Before Sebastian could reply, both men cocked their attention toward the door. That had been a definite sound in the front hall. Glancing at the clock, which now read well past midnight, Sebastian listened.</p><p>A low murmur of voices told him someone had arrived, and then the parlor door opened.</p><p>Victoria tottered in.</p><p>Taking in Victoria\u2019s appearance, Sebastian stepped quickly toward her. He wanted to drag her into his arms, but the closed expression on her face held him back. \u201cMy God, Victoria, where have you been?\u201d He settled for taking her hands\u2014they were gloveless. Her hair was a disaster, her clothing\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou do look frightful,\u201d Pesaro agreed.</p><p>Sebastian would have twitched a smile if the moment hadn\u2019t been so tense. Pesaro not only had no taste for fashion, he had no idea how to speak to a woman, no concept of charm. He had the glass in his hand again and remained in his nonchalant position, yet . . . something in his demeanor had changed. It was on edge.</p><p>Sebastian felt it, but he turned his attention back to Victoria. Her face was scraped up\u2014there were long red scrapes along one cheek as if she\u2019d ground it against something\u2014and there was blood everywhere. Her hair was matted and tangled, a bushy black mess hanging in her eyes and face.</p><p>But it was the look on her face that arrested him. Cold, marblelike. Her rich green-brown eyes hard and empty. Long lashes dark against pale skin. Even her lips were pale, almost the color of lavender.</p> <p>\u201cI was taken to the magistrate. They were going to have me hung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink this.\u201d Pesaro thrust a hand between them, shoving his glass at Victoria. \u201cYou let them take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bloody let them take me,\u201d she replied, ignoringthe glass. Her eyes flashed now, hot and furious, at Pesaro.</p><p>The men listened as Victoria explained, quite clearly and concisely despite her obvious anger.</p><p>\u201cThen you left them?\u201d Pesaro said at the end. He rose from his chair, smooth and tall, and stood over Victoria.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell else was she to do?\u201d Sebastian snapped. He had taken Victoria\u2019s hand during her story, and felt the chill in her fingers. \u201cHe was going to have her hung. I\u2019d have killed him myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did this happen?\u201d Pesaro said in a calmer voice than Sebastian had expected, shrugging into his coat. \u201cWhere did you walk away?\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s lips seemed to have a hard time moving, but she replied, giving him the direction of an address in Whitechapel. \u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said, pulling away from Sebastian. \u201cI had to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave them to die?\u201d Pesaro turned back to her, and for a moment they stood, facing each other as if ready to come to blows. Something snapped in the room, tightened, and stretched. He looked as though he was about to wrap his fingers around her throat, and Sebastian closed his fingers into his palm. \u201cI thought better of you, Victoria. It was as good as murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were alive when I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith no chance of survival. Their fate was sealed.\u201d Pesaro turned away, then stopped suddenly, pivoting back to Victoria, his eyes narrow and sharp. He looked at her again, delving long and hard, then he raised his eyes to meet Sebastian\u2019s. The bald condemnation Sebastian expected to see had gone; instead, it was a knowing look, filled with meaning. And then Sebastian understood.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t Victoria\u2014not the Victoria he knew.</p><p>Pesaro pushed between Sebastian and Victoria, marching toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Pesaro didn\u2019t break stride. \u201cTo see if there is anything to salvage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go alone.\u201d</p><p>That insult stopped Pesaro, who turned back, his hand on the doorjamb. Even Sebastian was taken aback by the ferocity in his expression. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want you with me.\u201d He flung the door closed behind him.</p><p>The room settled into quiet again. Sebastian saw Victoria\u2019s stricken face, and familiar discomfort curdled in his belly. The way she looked after him, the way she\u2019d looked when Pesaro had miraculously appeared after the fire . . . Sebastian didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it at all.</p><p>Which was why he was very glad he\u2019d told Pesaro that Victoria knew everything about Giulia, and what her reaction had been.</p><p>A bit of an exaggeration, of course, but all was fair in love . . . and war.</p><p>Victoria dreamed of blood.</p><p>Rivers and ribbons of it, the smell, the thick coagulation . . . it filled her nostrils, settled on her tongue. She bathed in it. Choked on it.</p><p>She opened her eyes to find the sun streaming into her bedchamber. The bedclothes were twisted and wrinkled, cocooning her legs and wrapped togalike around her middle. Her head pounded, and her face felt tight and sore.</p><p>But she had to rise.</p><p>Even knowing that her wounds would heal within a day, seeing herself in the mirror did little to improve Victoria\u2019s spirits. Her face was mottled with bruises, and there was a long scrape on the side of her jaw.</p><p>Downstairs, dressed in a simple gown that was barely more than a chemise, her hair pulled into a single braid, Victoria found Kritanu in the kalari, the room they used for training. It was a large space for the small town house, for Aunt Eustacia had had a wall removed between the music room and a parlor. The chamber was well lit, spacious, and covered by a shining wooden floor, which Kritanu claimed was the best surface for training. There were piles of huge cushions in the corner, used not only for seating or reclining, but also for padding during training sessions.</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect to see Max, but he was there in a mock battle with Kritanu. Both men held long slender swords, blades curved in a gentle arc, and they clashed and slid and gleamed.</p><p>When she stepped into the room, Max stepped away from the exercise, letting the tip of his weapon bump to the floor. He was dressed in loose, ankle-length brown trousers and a cream-colored tunic streaked with sweat. His hair was pulled back like a pirate\u2019s. His large feet were bare, but a slender cord encircled one of his ankles. A small silver cross hung from it.</p><p>\u201cI found nothing last night,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI wonder if you gave me the correct direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no sign of any destruction, nor had anyone heard any unusual disruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it mean nothing that they would just as easily have hung me?\u201d Victoria asked, suddenly wanting a sword in her own hand. She\u2019d like to make Max dance at the other end, and she knew she had the strength and speed, if not the skill.</p><p>He must have understood her desire, for he glanced at Kritanu. \u201cWould you care to surrender the blade to Victoria? I do believe she wishes to stab me.\u201d His smile was nothing more than a flash of teeth.</p><p>Kritanu relinquished his weapon and stepped back as Victoria hefted it in her hand. She was used to the shorter kadhara knives, or a long slender \u00e9p\u00e9e. But this was a much more serious blade. Heavier, and it would move differently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d best don some protection,\u201d she returned, slicing the blade experimentally in front of her, from shoulder to floor. She adjusted the angle of her wrist and felt the weapon balance more comfortably.</p><p>Max snorted. He riposted back at her with a deep swipe that stirred the air. \u201cI look forward to fighting unfettered\u2014for I have no reason to hold myself in check matched against you.\u201d He moved neatly to the side when she brought her blade up again, and the metal weapons smashed together. \u201cAnd . . . to answer your question . . . it does mean something that they wished to hang you.\u201d</p><p>The hem of her chemise would limit her from taking great steps, but it was full enough for her to lunge forward. He skimmed easily aside, his feet leaving the ground in a low glide, and she watched in chagrin. Max landed on the floor, and she saw that he was grinning.</p> <p>Max grinning was a sight that riled her to the core.</p><p>Victoria met his blade and forced him back several steps. \u201cDoes it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replied, surprising her by pressing forward into her space. Their blades slid and then he neatly stepped to the side. \u201cBut you cannot forget\u2014you are bound to protect mortals from the undead, Victoria. You cannot walk away just because one of them angered you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngered me?\u201d She sliced more viciously than she\u2019d intended, and he leaped back under her onslaught. \u201cHe would have shot me on the street. Or hung me at Newgate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unpleasant occurrence, to be sure. I don\u2019t fault you for wanting to save your skin. But . . . it was the manner in which you did.\u201d He slashed and she felt the gust of air next to her face. \u201cVenators have superhuman powers. If we\u2014you\u2014begin to use those abilities to pass judgment on mortals . . . that is wrong. It is nothing more than abuse of the gifts given.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never abused my gift,\u201d she replied, knowing that it was untrue. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Max lunged. \u201cBut you did. Last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about your own foolish actions?\u201d she replied, whipping her blade viciously through the air so that he was forced to leap back. His smile flashed, as if pleased that she\u2019d caught him off guard, and he moved forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat foolish actions do you speak of?\u201d he asked, dipping to the side and bringing his blade up sharply. She reacted and the metal clanged and rang in the room.</p><p>\u201cMax, Lilith is here in London. Clearly, she would love nothing more than to get her hands on you again.\u201d</p><p>She saw his mouth tighten, the glimmer of humor gone. \u201cAnd of course, I cannot protect myself.\u201d He lunged sharply and Victoria dodged, hearing the blade whistle next to her ear.</p> <p>\u201cYou must admit,\u201d she said, starting back toward him, \u201cthat it might be a bit more difficult now.\u201d He met her blade without backing up, and their arms strained against each other before the force of her blade caused his to slide away.</p><p>\u201cI have the means to take care of myself.\u201d He came at her again, this time gliding on the air, and she was forced to raise her blade higher to stop his onslaught.</p><p>\u201cBut if she caught you again . . . and bit you, put you back under her thrall\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t give her the opportunity. She cannot do it with a single bite . . . and it required some participation on my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Victoria stopped, and he caught her unawares, slicing down the side of her arm. The blade brushed along her sleeve, but did nothing more than scrape the fabric. \u201cParticipation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist, Victoria, it wasn\u2019t willing participation,\u201d he snarled. \u201cIf I\u2019d known the salve she was putting on the bites would cause them to never heal, and to bind me to her, don\u2019t you think I would have stopped her?\u201d He slashed violently.</p><p>They fought in silence for a moment, Max\u2019s feet back on the ground, and Victoria aware of the trickle of perspiration down her spine.</p><p>\u201cIncidentally, I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead,\u201d Max commented, easing back after a particularly feisty tip-to-tip dance of their swords.</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Runner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you . . . I found nothing and could locate no one who\u2019d seen or heard any disturbances. And,\u201d he said, shifting to the side, and then suddenly around her, dragging the tip of her blade with him, \u201cI have a recollection that might interest you and may clear up the matter even more.\u201d</p><p>Victoria pivoted after him, striking out with her weapon as he brought his down. Their blades smashed, caught, and with a great jerk, she gave a powerful twist.</p><p>Both blades tangled, their guards twisted, and flew through the air, landing a few feet away with a dull clatter.</p><p>\u201cA draw,\u201d he said, looking down at her, barely breathing hard. He\u2019d pulled his hair back in a short, thick stub at the back of his head, but one strand fell over his face. He pushed it back and planted his hands on his hips. His brown feet spread wide, making him look more like a pirate than ever. All he needed was a gold hoop in his ear\u2014 although Max would probably opt for silver, if he was thus inclined.</p><p>\u201cYour recollection?\u201d she asked, noticing how the vee of his tunic revealed dark hair brushing the curve at the base of his throat. He\u2019d drawn her hand there once, beneath the warm cotton of another shirt, over flesh and muscle, to touch the vis bulla for strength. She stepped back.</p><p>\u201cGoodwin, yes? Frederick Goodwin was the Runner\u2019s brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lord Truscott.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a Goodwin in the Tutela. It may have been him. If so, then I doubt he met his end\u2014he or his cohort\u2014at the hands of the undead.\u201d</p><p>Victoria understood, and a flare of anger sparked. \u201cBut if not, I\u2019m nevertheless absolved from my sin of passivity if Goodwin was a member of the Tutela? Mortal or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was a member of the Tutela, Goodwin would have been safe with the vampires,\u201d Max reminded her. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have been leaving him to his death. If he wasn\u2019t Tutela, it wasn\u2019t your place to determine whether he lived or died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should have let him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Max continued smoothly, \u201cif he was Tutela, it would explain his animosity toward you. The Venator who took his brother\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the train of this conversation, for the condemnation from Max still weighed heavily on her. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have left Goodwin at the hands of the vampires . . . but at that time, it was the only thing she could do . . . wanted to do.</p><p>It was as if all concepts but self-preservation had evaporated from her mind. Leaving only a single-minded need for survival. Red-tinged anger, blind wrath. Conscience-less fury.</p><p>Then she remembered. \u201cHe did say something . . . something about protecting his brother. \u2018After all I did to protect him.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have helped him turn undead to protect him. It\u2019s been done before.\u201d Bitterness.</p><p>Victoria looked at him sharply and recognized that he was speaking of himself. \u201cAs you did with your father and sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Vioget has told you all of the sordid details, has he not.\u201d Max\u2019s voice was staccato and hard, and he turned to pick up the tangle of blades.</p><p>\u201cI know enough from Wayren to be aware that you were young and had been tricked into believing in the promise of the Tutela. You did it to save your father\u2019s life, and your sister\u2019s too. They were both weak and ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmortality. Protection from illness. Power.\u201d He stood, holding the weapons. \u201cOnly a naive boy would believe there was no cost for such a prize.\u201d Max turned, walking toward the cabinet where the weapons were stored.</p><p>Victoria realized that Kritanu had gone, and they were alone. \u201cThe way I understand it, the Tutela is more than a match for a naive boy. Mature and learned people like John Polidori have succumbed to their machinations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever fear, Victoria. I\u2019ve come to terms with what I did. Why do you think I\u2019ve dedicated my life to hunting the undead? I see no reason to wallow in self-pity or flagellate myself. There\u2019s too much work to be done.\u201d Max lifted one of the swords, fitting it onto its pegs inside the cabinet. He didn\u2019t look at her as he latched it into place. \u201cAnd I certainly don\u2019t need your sympathy or pity.\u201d</p><p>Victoria opened her mouth to reply, but Max was already out of the room.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Wherein Victoria Breaks a Trust</p><p>\u201cWe called yesterday,\u201d Lady Melly sniffed, \u201cafter we\u2019d heard about that terrible fire. But that Verbena insisted that you were indisposed.\u201d She glowered at Victoria. \u201cShe made us wait here in this room for an hour. Without tea.\u201d</p><p>Victoria thought it was more likely that Lady Melly and her two cronies had refused to budge for that hour, rather than being forced to sit there . . . but then again, Verbena was just as strong-willed. Perhaps it had been a game of who would blink first.</p><p>Apparently, the ladies had blinked\u2014or perhaps hunger had won out.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling at all up to visitors yesterday, Mama,\u201d she told her with a placating pat on her hand. In reality, Victoria felt a bit guilty for her mother\u2019s worry\u2014 for the lines on her face seemed deeper, and the way she\u2019d gasped upon seeing the scrapes and bruises on her cheeks and chin bespoke her concern. \u201cBut Verbena told me that you\u2019d come, and it made me feel much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do look rather worse for the wear,\u201d Lady Melly said, her tone and her face softening. \u201cFires are terrible things.\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded and squeezed her fingers around her mother\u2019s wrist. Lady Melly\u2019s father had died in a stable fire when she was a young girl, and she\u2019d often described the terror of the furious blaze and the screams of the horses trapped inside. \u201cBut I survived with only a few scars, and all is well.\u201d</p><p>Lady Melly sniffed again, the tip of her nose tinged suspiciously pink. \u201cWhen your maid wouldn\u2019t allow us to see you\u2014and I must say that I am quite offended that she should disallow your own flesh and blood to visit\u2014 we called on Rockley.\u201d She looked at Victoria, the calculation back in her blue eyes. \u201cIt seemed the right thing to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria smothered a sigh. \u201cMama, you must understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>As if to forestall any declaration of her disinterest in the marquess, Melly interrupted. \u201cHe is quite besotted with you, Victoria. There\u2019s no need to feel uncomfortable about it. It\u2019s not as though he and Rockley\u2014your Rockley\u2014 were brothers or any such thing. As I hear it, they\u2019re very distantly related and it wouldn\u2019t be odd at all. And then you would be a marchioness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still a marchioness,\u201d Victoria reminded her dryly. \u201cBut, Mama, you really must cease this matchmaking. I\u2019m a widow now, and I haven\u2019t any real desire to marry again. Nor do I need to.\u201d</p> <p>Even as she said those words, and registered the bald disapproval in her parent\u2019s face, Victoria felt an odd nudge deep inside. Marriage in the way Society expected of her was most definitely out of the question. But there was the fact that she was the last direct descendant of the Gardella line\u2014as far as she knew. If she died, as Max had said, without issue . . .</p><p>And, if she examined things even more deeply, she couldn\u2019t deny that being a Venator, especially Illa Gardella, was a lonely, terribly lonely, life. Even Aunt Eustacia had had a partner, someone to share it with, to sleep next to, to be held by when times became dark and frightening. Someone who understood her, and loved her. After all, Aunt Eustacia had had a brother, who had been Melly\u2019s father, and thus she knew the line wouldn\u2019t die with her. Perhaps it really was time for Victoria to think in that manner, and to stop taking the special potion that kept her from getting with child.</p><p>Sebastian flashed into her mind, and she smiled. He had made it more than clear how willing he was to be with her. Intimately. Whether he loved her or not wasn\u2019t clear, but he certainly cared for her.</p><p>Unlike Max.</p><p>Victoria focused back in on her mother, who had launched into a breathless diatribe about how terrible it was to remain unmarried and alone. She let her go on for a moment longer, then said, \u201cBut Mama, you\u2019ve been widowed for more than four years now and I haven\u2019t heard you speak once of wedding Lord Jellington.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Melly\u2019s barrage of platitudes abruptly stopped and she blinked at her daughter.</p><p>And then, thankfully, before she was able to gather up a full breath to respond, a knock came at the parlor door. Charley opened it and Victoria saw that behind him were not only the ladies Winnie and Nilly, but the tall, rumpled figure of James Lacy.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lady Melly said, standing. The tea table rattled in her wake. \u201cAt last.\u201d</p><p>Victoria realized that the trio of women had implemented a divide-and-conquer campaign. Lady Melly was to ascertain her daughter\u2019s condition, and the two other ladies were to retrieve the prize and deliver him in a timely manner.</p><p>\u201cAnd it was such a frightfully frightening event!\u201d Victoria didn\u2019t know for certain what Lady Nilly was babbling about, but whatever it was, it had been . . . frightening.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mrs.\u2014Lady Rockley,\u201d said James. He smiled warmly at Victoria. \u201cI\u2019m right glad you\u2019re feeling better today.\u201d</p> <p>She returned the smile, but without the depth of warmth. How was she going to make her mother understand that James was not going to be her next son by law? \u201cHow kind of you to call,\u201d she said a bit stiffly.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasure to see you again, Lord Rockley,\u201d crooned Lady Melly. As if she were the hostess, she gestured for him and the others to sit. \u201cVictoria and I were just agreeing that September is a lovely time for a wed\u2014 mmph!\u201d She gasped and jerked her leg out of range of Victoria\u2019s pointy slippers.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite all right, ma\u2019am?\u201d asked James.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, indeed, pardon me, my lord,\u201d she said. \u201cEr . . . a bit of arthritis, and I\u2019m never quite certain when it will kick\u201d\u2014she glared at Victoria\u2014\u201cin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you ought to return home and rest a bit if it\u2019s too painful, Mama.\u201d Her daughter smiled blandly. Then she turned to James. \u201cI see that you recovered from the fire with nary a scratch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was lucky. And it \u2019pears that although you didn\u2019t completely escape injury, you\u2019re feeling better today. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d His blue eyes twinkled. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d be feeling too ill to join me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Victoria opened her mouth to explain that she was, indeed,feeling the renewed throb of a headache. But Lady Melly\u2019s strident voice overruled anything she might say, claiming that her daughter was of strong constitution and had fully recovered from her fright of the previous night.</p><p>Victoria considered whether speaking even louder than her mother would negate her claim of a headache.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite a shame, ma\u2019am, Lady Rockley,\u201d James said, all charm and dimples, speaking easily over the volume of Lady Melly. \u201cMr. Starcasset and his friend Miss Regalado invited me to join them this evening. They claim there is some special comet that can be seen tonight in a certain location, near one of the parks. I confess, I\u2019m not altogether sure I care about stargazing, but I thought it was a splendid excuse to see if you\u2019d join me for a drive later tonight.\u201d</p><p>Victoria closed her lips around the automatic declination. George and Sara had invited James to join them for an evening ride? \u201cOf course I\u2019d be honored to attend with you,\u201d she replied, aware that she had just sent Lady Melly over the moon.</p><p>What more could a matchmaking mother hope for? Victoria was certain her maternal parent was imagining a romantic carriage ride by moonlight, whereas the reality was likely something much more disagreeable. Namely, a ruse to entrap someone.</p><p>But who was the intended prey: James . . . or Victoria?</p><p>\u201cAnd where might your paramour be this evening?\u201d asked Max. His tone implied that Sebastian\u2019s appearance would relieve him of the taxing obligation of conversing with Victoria. \u201cTell me there hasn\u2019t been a lovers\u2019 spat. You do seem a bit . . . distracted.\u201d</p><p>Distracted was one word to describe Victoria\u2019s state of mind, but not the one she would have chosen.</p><p>It was after dinner. They had settled in the only sitting room on that floor\u2014the small parlor that had entertained not only Lady Melly and her friends, but which also held the cupboard wherein the Gardella family Bible was kept. When Aunt Eustacia had been alive, and first acclimating Victoria to the world of the Venators, the three of them\u2014 four, when Kritanu was there, and sometimes Wayren\u2014 had sat here many times.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to inform you that your plans for my future are still intact. Sebastian and I have done nothing but share wistful glances, swoon at the sight of the other, and spout poetry\u2014all since you\u2019ve given your blessing to the match.\u201d Her smile was sweeter than the double-iced pink sugar biscuits favored by Lady Winnie.</p><p>Max\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cAh, if only I had been witness to such a spectacle. I expect it would have provided me amusement for weeks to come.\u201d He stretched his long legs, crossing them at the ankles. \u201cDid Vioget position himself on one knee so as to look up into your crystalline eyes whilst waxing rhapsodic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I shall have a bit of sherry,\u201d Victoria said. \u201cWould you like me to pour you some whiskey? Apparently my aunt had a fondness for it, but I can\u2019t say I share her taste.\u201d She closed her mouth with a snap, realizing how close she was coming to babbling nervously.</p><p>\u201cBy all means.\u201d</p><p>Victoria stood at the sideboard and prepared their drinks, then turned back to deliver the amber liquor to Max. Then she took herself to the chair near a small piecrust table where she\u2019d sat, sharpening stakes, nearly two years ago, defending her decision to marry Philip.</p><p>A glance at the clock told her it was after nine. James was due to arrive at ten o\u2019clock. Victoria took a significantgulp of sherry, despising the watery liquid for its weakness. And herself.</p><p>\u201cAm I to understand that you haven\u2019t any intention of going out tonight?\u201d Max asked. He was looking at her over the rim of his glass. Then he drank, and put the glass back down.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps later,\u201d Victoria replied.</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cNo social engagements? No vampire hunting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames is to call for me later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, is it? And what does Monsieur Vioget think of this? Or are you hunting the daytime vampire?\u201d His eyes narrowed in speculation. \u201cYou believe it\u2019s he, don\u2019t you. I\u2019m not so certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? How odd, since you were the one who suggested that it might indeed be he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you hadn\u2019t considered him before my mention.\u201d He looked utterly pleased with himself.</p><p>She stood abruptly and walked over to the cabinet which housed the Bible. \u201cI have not seen this since the first time Aunt Eustacia told me about the legacy of the Gardellas.\u201d</p><p>Feeling Max\u2019s attention on her, she fumbled the small gold key into its slot. Click, click, clunk. She swung open the bifold doors, heavy and slick.</p><p>Inside the cabinet, on its gently inclining display, rested the elderly Bible.</p><p>It was heavy, with gilt-edged pages that shone stubbornly despite its age. The leather corners were rounded and bumped, but the spine was as rigid as Aunt Eustacia\u2019s own had been. Three faded silk bookmarks fell lifelessly from their places.</p><p>She pulled out the book and placed it on the larger table in the middle of the room. She needed something to focus on, rather than the thoughts and questions running rampant through her mind.</p><p>Opening the front cover, Victoria smoothed her hand over words written in ink of varying shades of black, brown, and sepia. Listed there in the front pages were the names of the Gardellas who had accepted their calling as Venators. She touched one of the last names scribed there: Eustacia Alexandria Gardella. Below it was her own name: Victoria Anastasia Gardella. Seeing it there, its ink relatively fresh and bold, Victoria shivered.</p><p>Would there be any other names beneath hers?</p><p>Feeling the weight of Max\u2019s gaze, she was compelled to lecture. \u201cAunt Eustacia told me that the original pages of this Bible were given to the family during the Middle Ages. Six hundred years ago.\u201d She looked up, saw that he was silently sipping his drink. \u201cA Gardella monk scribed this book in the twelfth century. I wonder if there was any connection to the monks who built the subterranean crypt Sebastian and I visited by the sewers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne could contemplate the beautiful irony of monks scribing a Bible in chambers next to those penning vampire secrets,\u201d Max said gravely. \u201cIt would not surprise me, as the monks and undead have intertwined\u2014usually at odds\u2014for centuries.\u201d</p><p>The Bible\u2019s pages had been bound, and rebound, and more pages added to include the growing family tree as the decades passed. Victoria carefully turned the crisp brown sheets. They crackled like a gentle fire. She saw images on some of them, and fading script on others, line after line. Ornate lettering, patterns, and illustrations in faded colors decorated the first letters of each book of the Bible.</p><p>Turning back to the front, she resumed scanning the list of Venator names. Catherine Victoria Gardella. An image of a vivid redhead with a flashy emerald ring and a saucy expression came to mind, and Victoria nodded to herself. Yes, she\u2019d seen her portrait in the hall at the Consilium in Rome.</p> <p>Another name, faded and further up the list, drew her attention. Rosamunde Joanna Gardella. The mystic who wrote pages of prophecy during her youth in an abbey . . . before she learned of her calling as a Venator.</p><p>A thought struck her, and she turned back to the end of the list. \u201cSebastian\u2019s name isn\u2019t written here,\u201d she said, looking up at Max.</p><p>\u201cNor is mine.\u201d He sipped, swallowed. \u201cThat list in the front is confined to those who have descended directly from Gardeleus, with strong Gardella blood\u2014such as yourself.\u201d</p><p>An odd expression crossed his face and he stopped, blinking hard. Victoria tensed. But then he continued, \u201cI believe the back of the book shows a full family tree, and also every Venator from the extended branches of the family tree\u2014and those of us who can\u2019t claim one drop of Gardella blood. You\u2019ll find Zavier there, I suspect, and Brim, and Michalas as well. Or so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A little shiver worked its way over the back of her shoulders. It wouldn\u2019t be long now. \u201cIf I had looked more closely at the book early on, I would have known the truth about Sebastian much sooner, since you and Aunt Eustacia chose not to tell me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was no point in telling you.\u201d Max shifted in his seat. \u201cAnd Vioget should have been struck from the list years ago. He had no cause to be there.\u201d</p><p>Knowing that this could be the last conversation she and Max ever had, Victoria closed the book and looked at him. \u201cWhy do you hate him so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ask because you know why he loathes me . . . but you can\u2019t help but wonder what possible reason I could have for enmity toward him. I know he\u2019s made his case to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no case to be made, Max. I understand why he . . . dislikes . . . you, and holds you responsible for Giulia\u2019s death\u2014even though it was by his own hand. But I also know that you\u2019ve forgiven yourself for the horrible mistake, and that you didn\u2019t bring her to the Tutela to hurt her. Only because you thought to help her, and that you\u2019ve done everything you can to atone for it. But I do want to know what it is about him that makes you so disgusted.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, and she saw the signs lingering in his gaze. \u201cVioget has the calling\u2014the blood, the innate skills, to be a Venator\u2014and yet he rejected it. For years. I can\u2019t forgive him for that. Nor can I understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I couldn\u2019t either. But I\u2019ve come to realize why he lost the urge to hunt vampires. Knowing that I\u2019m responsible for sending a creature who\u2014no matter how abhorrent he became\u2014was once a mortal, loving and loved, to his eternal damnation, does give me pause sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYet you still do it,\u201d Max said quietly. His words were firm, steady. \u201cAs do I. Because you must; because we\u2019re charged to protect our own race. Do you think it hasn\u2019t occurred to me that not only did I cause Giulia to turn into an immortal half demon, but I also gave her a sentence of eternal damnation? I live with that knowledge every day.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at him, at last realizing why he wore such a cold, harsh persona; why he seemed so brittle and emotionless most of the time. That made what she was about to do all the more difficult. \u201cIt was hard enough for me to slay Phillip,\u201d she said, her heart breaking for him, \u201cbut it was that much easier, knowing that he\u2019d not be sent to eternal Hell because he\u2019d not yet fed on a mortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, echoing words he\u2019d said himself, \u201cyou\u2019ve never wavered from your decision to hunt vampires. Despite knowing the sentence you\u2014we\u2014thrust upon them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. For what choice do we have? If we don\u2019t slay them, strive to put an end to them, what would happen to our race? They\u2019re stronger and faster than we are, immortal, and their instinct\u2014their driving need to survive\u2014is to take from humans. If we did nothing, if all\u2014or even many\u2014Venators rejected their calling as Vioget did, it wouldn\u2019t be long before the undead would take over. We have no choice. As Venators\u2014you especially, as a Gardella\u2014it\u2019s our calling. Our duty and responsibility. But it\u2019s not our role to make judgments about whether the undead should live or die. Or whether there truly is no chance that an undead\u2019s soul might be spared damnation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, lines deep in his face. \u201cIt\u2019s a hope I live with every day, that perhaps . . .\u201d He shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cIt\u2019s not for us to question our calling.\u201d He looked at Victoria. His eyes were bleary. \u201cIf Phillip had drunk from a mortal before you had the chance to slay him, would you still have done it, knowing you\u2019d be sending him to Hell?\u201d</p><p>How many times had she wondered the same thing? Countless times, over the last two years, sometimes waking from a deep, twisting slumber, damp and heart pounding, with her fingers curled around an invisible stake. She knew the answer.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cAnd that is the difference between you and me\u2014and Vioget. We fulfill our God-given purpose no matter how difficult or painful it is.\u201d He raised his glass to drink again and stopped, his hand in midair.</p><p>Their eyes met and, in that moment, a burst of clarity flashed into his. \u201cBy God, you didn\u2019t.\u201d He surged to his feet and swayed. Fury darkened his face, fury the likes of which she\u2019d never seen before. He looked carved from stone.</p><p>Her stomach tipped and roiled as she pulled slowly to her feet. Guilt was plastered all over her face. She remained silent. She had no words.</p><p>He lunged toward her, unsteady from the effects of the quick-working salvi, and bumped into the table. Glasses clinked ominously. \u201cWhy?\u201d His chest moved in quick, hard jerks, as if he\u2019d been running for hours.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t answer; her mouth was devoid of all moisture. She could barely swallow and her tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of her mouth.</p><p>Max slashed out at her, clumsy and slow, and she moved easily out of reach of those strong fingers. \u201cWhat are you doing tonight? Where are you going?\u201d His words were slurred; the salvi, once it took hold, worked quickly.</p><p>Victoria shook her head. \u201cMax, I wanted to pro\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, Victoria . . .\u201d His voice trailed off, weakening, and he turned away, staggering slightly. \u201cI will . . . never . . . forgive. . . .\u201d</p><p>His proud shoulders slumped and she saw his fingers closing into lethal fists. He half fell into the chair he\u2019d recently vacated, the force of his uncontrolled weight shoving it against the wall.</p><p>Max looked up, fixing his dark eyes on her in one last look of loathing before he slumped into unconsciousness.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>In Which the Marquess of Rockley Acquires a Chaperone</p><p>The night still hoarded some of the sun\u2019s warmth, eliminating the need for a shawl or wrap. The moon was a bit more slender than the night before, when Victoria had stood on the empty street and faced Bemis Goodwin, but the stars were twinkling in a great wide swath overhead and helped to light the inky blue sky.</p><p>James sat next to her in the curricle, holding the lines and bumping his solid arm against hers every time he moved. The open-faced, two-seater vehicle rumbled along the deserted pathways of Regent\u2019s Park, the awkward, random shapes of bush and shrubbery adding to a slightly eerie feel. The faint essence of wood smoke sifted through the air.</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t get Max out of her mind. Taking a deep breath, she looked up obediently when her companion commented on the array of celestial bodies, but her thoughts churned like the swill at the bottom of a fishing boat.</p><p>He would never understand, never forgive her. She knew that. But, more than that, she feared what could happen if he followed her tonight. It had been worth taking the chance, knowing she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his safety.</p><p>\u201cOho, and here they are,\u201d crowed James in delight. \u201cOver here!\u201d</p><p>Forced from her unpleasant thoughts, Victoria looked up and redirected her mind to the matter at hand. She had not come on this little excursion without preparation and planning. In fact, as she peered in the dark toward the sprightly vehicle that presumably carried Sara and George, she was actually looking beyond it. If all had gone as expected, Sebastian and Kritanu would be there, somewhere in the darkness, having been delivered by Barth and his hackney. They would be watching and waiting, ready to help quell any problems that might arise.</p><p>As Sara and George moved closer in their vehicular conveyance, Victoria became aware of the telltale chill on the back of her neck. Complacence and anticipation settled over her. She\u2019d been right to suspect something.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lord Rockley . . . and Lady Rockley.\u201d George\u2019s voice held faint amusement, presumably at the linking of their names.</p><p>Behind the other carriage, Victoria saw shadows moving. The corresponding barometer at her nape indicated a fair number of undead in the vicinity. She tensed beneath her skin, careful not to indicate her reaction to James. If he were a daytime vampire, he didn\u2019t need to drink the elixir at night\u2014unless he wanted to keep her unaware of his condition until now. Which would make sense.</p><p>Or, just as likely, he and she were both planned victims. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But now that other vampires had arrived, obviously without masking their undeadness to her sensitivities, why was nothing happening? Sara and George\u2014and whoever else\u2014certainly would know she was aware of the presence of vampires. Unease prickled over her.</p><p>Just then, a third carriage moved into view from behind the one carrying George and Sara. Victoria heard a familiar laugh . . . one that sent horrible shivers down her spine. What was Gwendolyn doing here?</p><p>Indeed, the tableau played out with all of the societal niceties one might have expected, if one were unaware that at least some of those present had a propensity for drinking blood.</p> <p>\u201cI must apologize for our tardiness, but my darling sister and her betrothed insisted upon joining us for tonight\u2019s excursion,\u201d explained George, maneuvering his carriage so that the third one could pull forward.</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d Gwendolyn cried, lurching forward in her vehicle to wave. The moonlight slivered over her blond hair and outlined round cheeks curved in a delighted smile. \u201cIs this not the most delightful thing? A ride in the park at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is most delightful,\u201d Victoria replied, managing to keep the trepidation from her voice. George had sent his sister safely away from the fire two nights ago; why had he allowed her to come tonight?</p><p>\u201cIt was a last-minute decision,\u201d Gwendolyn said, as if knowing explanations were in order. \u201cI do hope you don\u2019t feel that Brodebaugh and I are intruding. George didn\u2019t think I should be out in the cool night air, but I convinced Brodebaugh that it was no worse than sitting in the dinner room with the windows open. And George and Sara simply couldn\u2019t be out without a chaperone.\u201d Gwen couldn\u2019t seem to stop smiling. In fact, she fairly glowed with happiness as she leaned companionably against her fianc\u00e9, who looked down at her with his own indulgent smile.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Victoria replied faintly. She was still waiting for something to happen . . . although what, she wasn\u2019t certain.</p> <p>\u201cSo where is this comet you wanted to show us?\u201d James said, his voice booming.</p><p>Instead of looking up, as the others automatically did, Victoria scanned the darkness. The small glowing eyes, floating like red lightning bugs in the depths of brush and shrubbery, watched them expectantly. One of her stakes was wedged beneath her thigh, inside the hidden pocket Verbena had sewn into her gown. She shifted to adjust it, and to make it more easily retrievable. Her fingers itched to close around the small wooden pike and slam it into the variety of hearts surrounding them.</p><p>Prudence held her back; prudence and discretion. Not until she had to. Gwendolyn and her earl didn\u2019t need to be frightened, or exposed to the violence that would occur.</p><p>But though she waited, nothing untoward happened. The drive through the park went on as though it were nothing other than what it had been put out to be: an opportunity for several young couples to have a romantic interlude.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until nearly a half hour later, after George had pointed out simply every constellation and planet known to man\u2014along with the Comet Encke, as it had been named\u2014that the air changed.</p><p>She sensed an expectation building, a feeling of anticipation. Victoria remained alert, but other than the insistent chill on her neck and the sense of waiting, she felt and saw nothing.</p> <p>She needed to do something to get Gwendolyn and her earl away before whatever was going to happen happened.</p><p>They were trotting along the easy, curving path lit by the moon\u2019s skirt. The odd lumps of dirt and out-of-place boulders, groupings of trees and brush, and piles of paving stones that bespoke John Nash\u2019s ongoing redesign of the park reared up in the dark, sending awkward shadows over the road.</p><p>The three carriages were moving along at a good clip, not quite in a single file, but staggered across the path. George and Sara were in the lead, Victoria and James slightly to the left behind them, and Gwendolyn and Brodebaugh in the rear directly behind her brother, almost next to Victoria.</p><p>She turned in her seat to call back to Gwendolyn, planning to make an excuse\u2014a headache, weariness, something\u2014so that her friend would accompany her home.</p><p>But before she could even hail her friend, there was a great lurch and all at once, everything was falling. The horses shrieked and James shouted, and Victoria felt everything tipping as if in slow motion. Then, as she hit her head, a moment of darkness and pain.</p><p>When she opened her eyes, only seconds later, she heard Gwendolyn screaming. James was heavy atop her and everything was dark and awkward. It took her only an instant to realize that somehow the carriage had tipped or fallen, and that she was trapped beneath James. The vehicle was half on its side so that everything concentrated on her corner of the conveyance.</p><p>She had the wherewithal to grip her stake, and even though she felt discomfort from the fall, Victoria wasn\u2019t injured. But she was fully aware that this could not have been an accident.</p><p>And when she heard the screams growing louder, and saw the flash of red eyes glowering into the curricle above her, she knew she was right.</p> <p>Victoria shoved at James, pushing his weight from hers. He seemed to be unconscious, and his legs were caught under the ledge of the carriage, making it difficult to move him. The awkward pose had fairly trapped her in the corner of the seat. The horses were still squealing, and the carriage lurched and lunged in its place as they struggled to pull loose and run free.</p><p>The vampire grabbed James and yanked him off Victoria\u2014which was a bad choice on his part. No sooner had the weight been extricated and lifted from her than she clambered out awkwardly, her feet fumbling around her skirts. She landed on the ground just in time for the vampire to turn back to her. Meeting him with the point of her stake, she sent him to his destiny in a poof of ash, then spun to take note of the situation.</p><p>Sebastian and Kritanu had already made their presence known. As Victoria looked, she saw that Sebastian was engaged with numerous vampires. Kritanu was making use of his qinggong skills to glide and leap from tree to boulder to tree. He harassed the creatures, swiping at them with a long, gleaming sword as he moved above them and lopped off an undead head when the opportunity arose. Gwendolyn sat in her carriage, screaming, her hands plastered to her cheeks as her fianc\u00e9 attempted to beat off the undead with a whip.</p><p>Sara and George, along with their carriage, were nowhere in sight.</p><p>Gone. Victoria would have thought they\u2019d stay to watch the results of their trap. Her brows furrowed as she pivoted to meet a feral female vampire, blocking the creature\u2019slunge with her arm, then slamming the stake into her chest beneath it.</p><p>Sara and George had left as soon as the battle started. As soon as everyone was flushed out and engaged.</p><p>But Victoria wasted no further time in contemplation. There were at least a dozen vampires about, and she launched herself into the fray, stepping in to relieve Sebastian from a trio that had attempted to corner him near a large boulder.</p><p>With a passing-by poof, she cut his attackers down to a duo, and then continued over to Gwendolyn and Brodebaugh. With a shout meant to draw the attention of the undead, she rushed toward the cluster of red-eyed vampires as Kritanu\u2019s wiry body landed gracefully on the top of the curricle\u2019s roof. His sword whistled, lopping the head from an undead at a distance safe from its inhuman strength, and then he turned to the other side.</p><p>He kicked a particularly insistent undead back so that the creature tumbled to the ground in front of her, and Victoria paused to stake him as she moved into the melee about her friend\u2019s carriage.</p><p>Why would George and Sara have left? To escape?</p><p>Or to attend to some other task?</p><p>And then a horrible feeling rumbled inside her. Max. He was alone, and . . . incapacitated.</p><p>\u201cKritanu,\u201d she cried, her voice rising above the pandemonium. The trainer\u2019s jet eyes found hers amid the battle. \u201cMax! He\u2019s unprotected.\u201d</p><p>With relief, she saw Kritanu immediately leap up, then disappear into the higher branches of a tall maple. She was aware of branches and leaves shaking gently as he moved away, presumably toward the hack that would take him back to the town house.</p><p>For now she could concentrate on the matter at hand. And worry about Max later.</p><p>Despite the tangle of skirts, and Gwendolyn\u2019s screams ringing in her ears, Victoria was quite successful in her endeavors, staking three more vampires before she realized the battle had waned.</p><p>Breathing heavily but by no means winded, she turned and found Sebastian standing behind her. He looked down at her, stake outlined in his hand, blond hair tufted and mussed in the moonlight. He was breathing harder than usual, but he didn\u2019t have more than a sheen of sweat on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t ask\u2014and in light of the fact that while I made no move to help you in your battles, you insisted upon interfering in my fight,\u201d he said, his lips quirking in a smile, \u201cbut, consider it merely a sign of my affection for you when I do ask . . . were you injured when the carriage fell?\u201d His voice, deeper than usual, belied the humor in his words.</p><p>\u201cNot enough to matter,\u201d she replied, suddenly aware that she didn\u2019t mind so much that he cared enough to ask. Max certainly never would.</p><p>\u201cJames?\u201d she called, glad to be distracted by the dark form rising from where he\u2019d been flung by the vampire. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d She hurried to his side, aware that Sebastian watched after her.</p><p>She was finding it easier, more comfortable . . . to be with Sebastian, to trust him, to fight side by side with him. She looked back and saw that he was still watching her, even though he was speaking with Gwendolyn and Brodebaugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d James asked. \u201cThat was one helluva\u2014excuse me, ma\u2019am\u2014hole there!\u201d He glanced cursorily at the carriage, which Victoria now saw had the whole front half sunk into a hole in the ground. His attention focused on the horses, which, although they were still snorting and rolling their eyes, had ceased trying to pull the conveyance free.</p><p>She agreed, and walked over with him to look at the situation.</p><p>The cause of the accident was clear. Someone had taken advantage of Nash\u2019s construction to obscure a deep impression left in the ground with some sticks and leaves. The carriage being wider than the two horses, they had managed to walk on by unscathed, but the left front wheel had slipped off into the hole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The resulting crash had been enough to jar and shock, but not enough to injure. She wondered if that had been the intent.</p><p>Or, she wondered again, had this all been a way to distract her while Sara and George went after Max\u2014after ascertaining that he hadn\u2019t been lying in wait to help Victoria?</p><p>If either one of them were vampires, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get to Max inside Aunt Eustacia\u2019s house, because they wouldn\u2019t be able to enter. But if one of them wasn\u2019t, they could go in after him . . . if indeed that was the intent.</p> <p>She knew that Kritanu and Barth, along with a feisty Verbena, could easily handle one or two nonvampires that might try to break into the house.</p><p>Of course, Max would have been able to handle any such threat on his own . . . if she hadn\u2019t drugged him.</p><p>Victoria ignored the niggle of guilt in favor of the larger matter at hand. Was it that simple? Was all this merely to grab Max for Lilith? Or was there something else going on?</p><p>Maybe Max didn\u2019t figure at all into any of the reasons for these attacks, or the daytime vampire. Maybe she was focusing her attention in the wrong place. After all, she\u2019d been the target of Bemis Goodwin\u2014although there was no definite connection between him and the Tutela, only Max\u2019s recollection of a vampire sympathizer named Goodwin.</p><p>Maybe Max was the daytime vampire himself.</p> <p>That was patently ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get help to pull \u2019er back out,\u201d James said, scratching his head in a way that a London gentleman never would. \u201cGuess that won\u2019 be until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSebastian and Brodebaugh could do it, I venture,\u201d Victoria said. She waved the two men over, and with their combined efforts\u2014especially Sebastian\u2019s vis bulla power\u2014it took only moments before the carriage was righted again.</p><p>Then she and Sebastian looked at each other. \u201cDo you feel any other undead?\u201d he asked privately.</p><p>She grimaced. \u201cYou still sense my presence?\u201d He nodded. But that was neither here nor there at this time. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any undead about any longer. And I don\u2019t know what happened to George and Sara. But, somehow, we must get James, Brodebaugh, and Gwen home safely. I don\u2019t trust this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarcasset whipped his horses into speed as soon as your vehicle fell,\u201d Sebastian told her. \u201cI saw them dash off, and from the looks of it, they aren\u2019t coming back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t all fit in one carriage. I sent Kritanu and Barth back to my house.\u201d She wasn\u2019t ready to give him a full explanation, and, to his credit, Sebastian didn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it would be best if I took the marquess home, and you could go with Gwendolyn and her earl.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s casual suggestion threatened a smile from Victoria.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold it back and looked up at him teasingly.\u201cIs that because you don\u2019t trust the marquess in the moonlight . . . or me?\u201d</p><p>That surprised a smile out of Sebastian. \u201cHe can try anything he likes. . . . I have no concerns that the big, uncivilized oaf might charm you blind, Victoria. He\u2019s not man enough for you.\u201d He looked at her slyly, his smile suddenly hot and promising there in the moonlight. \u201cI miss being with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d</p><p>Gwen\u2019s voice broke into the moment, and Victoria wasn\u2019t sure if she was disappointed or relieved. Sebastian would not be held off much longer . . . and tonight . . . well, tonight, she just wasn\u2019t sure if she was up to it. Although . . . Sebastian was quite adept at distraction of the most pleasant type. An unwilling smile tugged at her lips . . . then faded as she worried again about Max. \u201cYes, Gwen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what happened?\u201d her friend was all aflutter\u2014apparently the shock of the attack had worn off, and what she\u2019d seen had at last penetrated. \u201cWho those people were? Why their eyes were so odd?\u201d</p><p>Oh, how Victoria wished for her Aunt Eustacia\u2019s golden disk! The one that was able to pull select memories from the minds of people who shouldn\u2019t know about the presence of the undead. Which was most of the world.</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I going to tell her?\u201d She looked at Sebastian, and he must have read her mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see them home. You can ride with the marquess and ensure his safe return. Poor devil. I almost pity him in any endeavor he might make.\u201d His grin flashed, cocksure and sexy.</p><p>That was good\u2014St. Heath\u2019s Row was closer to home. She could drop James off and then hurry back to Aunt Eustacia\u2019s to see if Max was all right.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking Gwen home. You spin a better yarn than I do, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll fall for whatever tale you choose to paint,\u201d she said, smiling prettily at Sebastian.</p><p>\u201cFlattery, my dear, will get you everywhere with me.\u201d He pulled her into his arms, strong and warm, fitting his mouth possessively over hers.</p><p>The kiss was long enough that it caught at her breath, so that when he released her, she had to drag in a deep gulp of air. It had been a lovely, perfect melding of lips and tease of tongue, rife with the promise of much more to come.</p><p>And, of course, it had been Sebastian\u2019s clear message to James Lacy that Victoria was spoken for.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Wherein the Smell of Roses Portends an Unpleasant Evening</p><p>Victoria realized, of course, that she still hadn\u2019t identified the daytime vampire . . . and that the man sitting next to her in the scraped-up, creaking curricle could very well be the undead in question.</p><p>It could also be George, Sara, or any one or all of them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really believe it was Max, but he\u2019d taught her to consider all possibilities.</p><p>Oh God. Max.</p><p>Victoria realized she was curling her fingernails into her palms. She didn\u2019t like to imagine the way he\u2019d look at her the next time she saw him\u2014if indeed she ever did. When she\u2019d made the decision to give him the salvi, it had been a single-minded, tunneled response to a very simple, real fear.</p><p>She could not bear for Lilith to have him again. Victoria had never been able to erase the memory, seeing him\u2014always so powerful, so arrogant and in control\u2014 under that creature\u2019s domination. Bare-chested, kneeling at Lilith\u2019s side, a submissive Max with empty eyes and no will of his own . . . then the way he had jerked helplessly, convulsing, his torso shuddering as the vampire queen bent to sink her teeth into his neck. And drink.</p><p>The image haunted her.</p><p>And now, he was free\u2014free of a hold Victoria knew she couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend. Even though he was still brusque and arrogant and commanding, she\u2019d noticed an easing in his face, a lessening of the darkness in his eyes. A few more smiles, even. Being released from the vampire queen\u2019s thrall had\u2014not softened him; that wasn\u2019t the word. Max wasn\u2019t soft in any sense of the word.</p><p>He\u2019d become . . . easier. Just a bit easier.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a rose?\u201d</p><p>James\u2019s voice broke into Victoria\u2019s thoughts, and she realized the carriage had traveled from the park and was now rolling along the street. Other vehicles filled the thoroughfare, and ladies and gentlemen walked along arm in arm, likely returning from Vauxhall or Covent Gardens.</p><p>There was a young woman hawking roses on the corner. Victoria had never noticed street vendors about at night\u2014although orange sellers and the like were thick in this area during the day. But how enterprising of the woman to take advantage of couples out for an evening in the Gardens, or other less innocent assignations.</p><p>James hadn\u2019t waited for her response; he guided the curricle over to the side of the street. The young woman stood under a lantern, where its light gleamed over her blonde hair. Victoria might have been worried for her safety, there on the street by herself, despite the number of other people about. But when she noticed the hulking silhouette of a man propped against a building behind her, her fears eased.</p><p>\u201cWhich one would you like, my lady?\u201d asked the girl, thrusting the bunch of roses in her face.</p><p>As Victoria leaned forward to select one of the blooms, two things happened: she realized that the back of her neck had chilled, and something sprayed in her face from the midst of the flowers.</p><p>She groped for her stake, but it was too late. The sickly sweet smell that had been atomized into her face filled her nostrils and seared the inside of her mouth and throat. She coughed, shaking her head, feeling the increased chill at the back of her neck, struggled to keep her fingers around the stake . . . saw the dark figure from the building move into the lantern light . . . and then everything went black.</p><p>Max forced himself to sit, unmoving. If he dared rise again, he feared what he\u2019d do\u2014to the room, to the furnishings, to the locked and barred door, to himself.</p><p>He kept his mind focused on inane things\u2014counting the lines in the wood-planked floor, the number of neat pleats on the ruffles around the pillow on the bed that had been made so bloody comfortable for him.</p><p>A prisoner.</p><p>Every time he allowed his thoughts even to start in that direction, his stomach tightened and dangerous bile burned the back of his throat. He couldn\u2019t let himself think about why she\u2019d done it . . . or even the fact that she had.</p><p>Locked him here. A prisoner.</p><p>He knew why.</p><p>Oh, he knew why, and the fact that he did made it all the more disgusting and loathsome.</p><p>Bad enough that she\u2019d broken his trust . . . but even worse\u2014so damned much worse\u2014was that she\u2019d felt the need to do it.</p><p>He forced his attention to the pattern of rosebud wallpaper on the wall and began to count the blooms.</p><p>The salvi had not completely relinquished its hold on him, or so it seemed . . . for he began to feel heavy-lidded in the eyes and weary in the muscles.</p><p>The next thing he knew, he was lying on the bed.</p><p>And Wayren was there.</p><p>She stood in the small room, tall and serene. Her beautiful elfin face bore traces of concern and also a hint of challenge. Thick silver-blonde hair hung, for once, unfettered by small braids or leather thongs. Simple, straight, melding into the pale gold of her gown, which seemed almost to glow. Her whole person seemed almost to glow. \u201cWhy do you fight it, Max?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat up, still exhausted. \u201cGet me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen what you can do, Wayren.\u201d His head was splitting and pounding at the same time; it was a wonder he could form words.</p> <p>She smiled, but there was a trace of sadness there. \u201cYou deserve happiness after so many years of darkness and self-recrimination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refuse to, Max.

Smelling of roses. The back of her neck was unbearably frigid and the stone wall close to her nose was immediately recognizable to her. She was in the subterranean abbey Sebastian had shown her, lying in the exact place she\u2019d found Briyani\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cAh, at last. Our guest awakens.\u201d</p><p>Victoria realized she was lying crumpled on the ground, and, from the feel of the intense ache throughout her body, flung there like a sack of grain. Unfortunately, beyond the radiating aches, there was no uncomfortable, hard roundness under her hip or leg that would indicate the presence of her stake. She squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them again, focused . . . and pulled herself up on her hands, then her knees, and then proudly to her feet. The ache and lingering weakness ebbed into nothing, and she felt a surge of power when she concentrated on the vis bullae, groping for them through the special slit in her gown.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t needed to concentrate on the power of the vis bulla for a long time, but now she was flooded with it.</p><p>As her mind started to work more sharply, her first thought was of James. Had he been part of the trap, or an unwitting accomplice?</p><p>She turned to face Lilith, who had been silent since her greeting.</p><p>The room looked much more comfortable than it had when she and Sebastian were there. Fires roared in massive saucers throughout the room, giving off the reddish glow and warmth Victoria had first noticed. There must be some kind of ventilation that allowed the smoke up and out, as in the Consilium. A rug lined the stones in the center of the room.</p> <p>The vampire queen sat on the thronelike chair Sebastian had moved to find the Ring of Jubai. She looked no different from the last time Victoria had seen her\u2014nearly two years ago, when Victoria had offered the Book of Antwartha as a bargaining chip to free Max.</p><p>Lilith was still horribly elegant, still skeletally slender with the whitest skin marked by an occasional blue vein. Her eyelids were onionskin thin, colored bluish-purple, and her lips the gray-blue of someone who cannot get warm. Five dark marks dotted the side of her face, creating the path of a half-moon\u2019s curve.</p><p>But her hair and her eyes . . . they burned, in horrible contrast to the frigidity of her flesh. Brilliant copper, her curls fell about her like a glorious nimbus, and her eyes: Victoria glanced at them just long enough to see the sapphire blue ringed by red.</p><p>\u201cI see that you\u2019ve recovered from the accident of our last meeting,\u201d she told Lilith coolly, wondering if the stake buried in her coiffure had been located and removed. She reached up to feel through the mass of curls there . . . and pulled out the slender stake. Aha. They\u2019d missed that one.</p><p>The vampiress\u2019s eyes narrowed, either at Victoria\u2019s taunt or the sight of the stake. \u201cMy skin healed from the burn of sunlight . . . but even so, you\u2019ll not walk away from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gone to much trouble to bring me here. What do you want?\u201d The stake, no more than the thickness of her thumb, was comforting in her hand.</p><p>Lilith forbore to answer. Instead, she merely watched Victoria from her negligent pose on the throne. Her body angled in the massive stone seat so that one elbow rested close on an armrest, and she positioned her wrist on the other arm. \u201cSo it is you.\u201d She sounded contemplative, but Victoria knew better than to look closely at the vampire to confirm.</p><p>Instead, she scanned the room. Clearly, Lilith meant her no immediate harm\u2014otherwise she would not have been left to awaken on her own\u2014or, even, to awaken at all.</p><p>They weren\u2019t alone in the room. Two Guardian vampires stood like stoic statues at the door through which Victoria and Sebastian had entered less than a week ago.</p><p>Lilith rose from her throne, the pale blue of her long gown whispering over her gaunt figure. \u201cYou are the one. I should have known it from the beginning. Who else could capture him?\u201d She was talking as if to herself, but moving closer to Victoria. The smell of roses accompanied her movements, the cloying sweetness nothing like the delicate tea rose Lady Melly wore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your vis bulla that he wears.\u201d</p><p>Victoria forgot herself, and her gaze snapped to the undead queen\u2019s. Malice burned in those blue-red eyes; she fairly saw flames leap and dart in there. She dragged her eyelids closed even as the vampire\u2019s words rang in the room.</p><p>Max wore her vis bulla.</p><p>She heard the rustle of silk and forced her eyes open. This was not the time to think about it. . . . Lilith stood much too close. Victoria could see each hair of her slender brows and the tiny pores of her skin. She smelled roses as if her face was buried in them. And something . . . malevolent . . . tugged at her\u2014pulled from the center of her torso, as if a rope had wrapped around her rib cage, drawing her closer.</p><p>Victoria let out the breath she\u2019d been holding, and sidled the stake between them.</p><p>\u201cHow brave you are, Venator.\u201d Lilith smiled. The expression was one of such depravity that it sent an ugly, chilling shiver down Victoria\u2019s spine and shooting through her limbs. Her fingertips suddenly felt as though they\u2019d been submerged in icy water for hours. \u201cBut in vain.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s heartbeat struggled, fighting to keep its own rhythm in the face of the vampire queen\u2019s power. Her lungs felt heavy, clogged, paralytic . . . yet she stayed steady, forcing the breaths, focusing on the power radiating from the two holy silver crosses in her navel.</p><p>Lilith moved, and suddenly Victoria felt vises close around her arms, yanking them to the side. The Guardian vampires flanked her, one of them jerking her off balance as the other kicked her legs far apart so that she stood as if straddling a wide river, unable to raise a leg to lash out.</p><p>She still held the stake, though the grip of the Guardian on her left wrist threatened to squeeze it from her fingers.</p><p>Victoria looked defiantly at Lilith, careful not to be ensnared by that enthralling gaze, fighting deep within to remain the mistress of her breath and heartbeat. \u201cSurely you jest. You, the queen of the vampires, cannot face me without assistance?\u201d</p><p>Lilith stepped closer, her breath warm on Victoria\u2019s face. She turned away, but the vampiress\u2019s fingernails closed around her chin and forced her head back to face her. Victoria didn\u2019t waste the energy trying to fight it. Her heart was pounding now, as though ready to leap from her skin . . . toward the sudden gleam of long white fangs.</p><p>\u201cI prefer to feed in peace.\u201d In a sudden, horrific movement, she reached up and yanked the top of Victoria\u2019s head to the side, releasing her chin, and baring her throat. \u201cWe shall see what he thinks of you now.\u201d</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t move; she was held firmly from wrist to shoulder, and her ankles were spread apart and kept immobile by heavy boots planted next to them. Only her hips were unhampered; but she could do little but twist and turn\u2014and even that was ineffectual against the strength of her undead captors.</p><p>Lilith moved closer, her breath hot on Victoria\u2019s bare neck, where the vein lurched and throbbed, pulsing as though ready to surge free. Dimly, she felt her fingers loosen and the stake fall as she struggled minutely, desperately.</p><p>The slide of fangs into flesh is rarely painful. They cut so cleanly and smoothly that the incision is little more than a terrifyingly joyful release . . . the warm blood at last free from its confines, flowing into the waiting vessel.</p><p>Victoria was stupidly conscious of the warmth of Lilith\u2019s upper lip and the chill of her lower one . . . of the way her tongue lapped against her flesh and the fangs bored deeply . . . the suction of cold and heat tugging deeply through her as Lilith drank, swallowing against her in an absurdly gentle manner.</p><p>And, suddenly, the vampire queen pulled away. She stepped back, staring at Victoria with wide eyes. All at once her guards dropped their hands, and she was free.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Victoria lunged for her stake, forcing herself to ignore the warm trickle of blood leaking down her neck. From the corner of her eye, she saw the darkness staining her yellow gown as she surged upright.</p><p>She faced the vampiress, her fingers tight around the stake. \u201cIs my blood too pure for your taste?\u201d</p><p>The shocked look faded from Lilith\u2019s face, to be replaced by one of unadulterated pleasure. \u201cOh no, not at all. It was my error . . . for I discounted the tales told me. I could not believe you could drink from Beauregard, and he from you, and the turning not take place.\u201d Her eyes narrowed with malice. \u201cBut I have tasted the truth. You have vampire blood rushing through your veins, Victoria Gardella.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked back to her throne as casually as if she were entertaining a guest. \u201cI meant to destroy you . . . but there\u2019s no need. If I let nature take its course . . . not only will you become despicable to him, but you\u2019ll become bound to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no vampire.\u201d</p><p>Lilith looked at her again, her full blue-gray lips curling into a smile. \u201cI see it in your eyes. You know that I speak the truth. Already you feel it, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ve been fighting it, likely for months now. And it\u2019s getting stronger.\u201d She shook her head, the smile tickling her mouth like that of a coquette. \u201cBut how could it be?\u201d she murmured, almost to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too strong for it.\u201d</p><p>The laugh surprised her\u2014eerie, high, and yet, like smoke. It curled and disseminated itself through the room, chasing away any other sound for the moment. Filling Victoria\u2019s ears, and her consciousness. It echoed there, and settled itself in place as if to confirm her own deep-seated fears.</p><p>Eighteen</p> <p>Wherein Our Heroine Conducts an Unsuccessful Interrogation</p><p>Settled in her massive stone chair, Lilith seemed to feel far more companionable toward Victoria now. Her odd eyes lit with unholy humor and anticipation, and she seemed almost relaxed.</p><p>As though they were having tea.</p><p>Seeing the vampire queen in such a state unsettled Victoria. Her veins were still humming, though not as violently. But her breathing and heartbeat had eased into a more normal rhythm.</p><p>Could Lilith be right?</p> <p>She drew in a deep breath, the scent of roses and wood smoke filtering into her nostrils and lungs, and calm crept slowly over her. She was obviously in no danger at this moment, nor did Lilith seem inclined to release her . . . so, at the very least, Victoria felt that the situation should be used to its advantage regardless of what was to come.</p><p>Boldly, she walked over to one of the heavy wooden chairs that lined the wall and sat. Lilith\u2019s chin lifted, but with a nod of acceptance rather than condemnation. \u201cOf course . . . do make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will indeed. Perhaps while we wait\u2014for whatever it is you await\u2014you\u2019ll assuage some of my curiosity about the vampires that move about in the daylight. Clearly, the formula for the elixir found its way from Beauregard into your hands . . . but I\u2019m mystified as to how that happened.\u201d</p><p>The queen slanted her an arrogant look. \u201cIt was brought to me by that blonde Regalado girl. She obtained it from one of Beauregard\u2019s followers, who meant it as a token to her as the new leader of the Tutela. Apparently you killed her father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she drinking the elixir then? And what about you, Lilith? Don\u2019t you wish to see the sunlight again?\u201d</p><p>Now the creature laughed again, this time more contemptuously. \u201cI? Drink of that poison? Of course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy, how naive you are, Victoria Gardella. I shall quite enjoy watching your innocent veneer crack and dull.\u201d Lilith sat upright in her chair, her bony wrist resting on the curved arm. \u201cThe plant which makes up a large portion of the formula is very rare, and grows only once or twice per century. It also happens to be poisonous to the undead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot immediately . . . but the benefits of the potion last for only a short time\u2014no more than a few hours. The daytime vampires, as you so quaintly call them, drink it as needed\u2014whenever they wish to move about in the sun, or to remain undetected by you and your comrades. But for every use of the elixir, those who consume it age one year, perhaps more . . . it is not an exact\u2014 science, so to speak. If one uses it enough, one ages, and eventually cannot stop the aging process, even if the elixir is stopped . . . and the undead dies quite rapidly and unexpectedly. Without the unpleasantness of your stake or sword.\u201d She smiled, her fangs dipping gently into her lower lip. \u201cOf course, I did not tell them of the hazards . . . for, as you can see, I had use for undead that could move about in the day. And the elixir is more addictive than opium.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem? Sara and George?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe elixir would do Sara no good,\u201d Lilith admitted. \u201cShe has not turned undead. And as for the others . . . well, I do not feel like being charitable. If you do not know, then I don\u2019t care to enlighten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why not? If I am soon to join your ranks.\u201d</p><p>Lilith made a sound almost like a giggle . . . but more ominous. \u201cAh, you are a clever one. But, no. I\u2019ll divulge no more. I will be amused watching you attempt to figure it out.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria was not about to give up her chance to extricate more information from the vampire queen, even as the back of her mind formulated possible ways of escape. If she could get away, she would send for Wayren and tell her of Lilith\u2019s awful prediction. She\u2019d find some way to stop it.</p><p>\u201cAnd so you have come to London for what purpose? Do you not recall how you fled the last time you were here and believed you had me in your power?\u201d Victoria asked with great condescension in her voice.</p><p>The creature\u2019s face mottled blue and gray, but she responded evenly. \u201cOh, do not think that it was only you, or Maximilian, who drew me to this cold city. I was not even certain he was here until Sara discovered him at that masquerade party. The two of you are only added little trinkets to this business.\u201d Her expression challenged Victoria to ask more.</p><p>\u201cWas it you who set Bemis Goodwin onto me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not that I made the request, but that I gave him leave to do it. He is a valuable member of the Tutela, and though I haven\u2019t all that much use for them\u2014mortals, I\u2019ve found, are not as predictable as undead, to my great dismay\u2014I saw no reason to disallow it. He has kept you busy, and distracted . . . and nearly incarcerated,\u201d she added with a pale smile. \u201cThat has left me free to put my other plans in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare not tell me, for fear that your prediction doesn\u2019t come to pass,\u201d Victoria said dismissively.</p><p>Lilith narrowed her eyes, then they lit with malicious humor. \u201cYou already feel the tug of consciencelessness, Venator. The seed of everything evil begins with self. When one places oneself before every and all, evil sprouts, and spreads, taking over. And already, you\u2019ve done so, even when you knew it was wrong . . . have you not?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, the door behind Victoria opened. She turned to see a pair of vampires dragging in two struggling, crying young women.</p><p>Her heart began to race, and she tightened the grip on her stake as Lilith stood.</p><p>\u201cAh, how lovely,\u201d said the vampire queen. She inclined her head regally and one of the undead prodded his burden forward.</p><p>Victoria knew what was to happen, and braced herself. There was nothing she could do to save the victims . . . it was as if she were at the horrific Tutela meeting in Venice again, watching the starving, thirsty undead feast and ravage several young women. She gripped her stake . . . she could get one vampire, maybe two . . . but then what? There were five, including Lilith.</p><p>The smell of blood permeated the chamber, and Victoria felt her head began to swim as the heavy, iron essence filled her senses. As saliva pooled in her mouth, she swallowed,shook her head, felt her limbs growing loose and weighty.</p><p>The girl\u2019s screaming subsided into soft gurgles and gasps of breath, and Victoria found herself struggling to stay in her chair, to sit upright. Lilith lifted her head from the distended vein of her victim\u2019s neck, looking at Victoria. She ate daintily, and even when she smiled a knowing, horrible smile, her teeth gleamed pure white.</p><p>\u201cYou fight it even now,\u201d Lilith said to Victoria, then waved her hand in dismissal. Her vampire minion dragged away the unconscious girl, and the second one moved forward into her place. As before, the servant held his mistress\u2019s meal steady while she fed. This time, Victoria couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from the long, slender teeth sliding into the whimpering girl\u2019s neck.</p><p>She hardly felt the stake in her hand any longer; all of her attention and focus were gathered up in a net of bloodscent and need. Blood racing, bounding through her . . . her vision blossoming red . . . her fingers trembling as she curled them around the edges of her chair. Only that death-tight grip kept her in her seat.</p><p>Lilith finished eating, and the unfortunate girls were taken away. Now the vampire queen looked at her remaining captive with relish. \u201cPerhaps I should taste you again, my dear. I see that the bloodscent has set your own veins to singing . . . it could certainly help the process along. And I do like the taste of a Venator . . . even if it is swamped with Beauregard\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>Victoria tried to fight them off, even brandishing her stake. But it was knocked from her fingers, clattering hollowly to the floor and rolling quietly away as the two Guardians dragged her to stand once more in front of their mistress.</p><p>\u201cThink about how much easier it will be when you give in,\u201d Lilith sighed like a lover against Victoria\u2019s cheek.</p><p>She strained to break free, but her vision was still colored and the scent of blood and roses from the queen\u2019s mouth beckoned and teased.</p><p>\u201cThink of how much easier when you have only to think of yourself. Only to do what is right for you.\u201d</p><p>This time, she bit into the top of Victoria\u2019s shoulder, at the juncture of neck and collarbone. It was painful, but pleasure seeped into her almost immediately. Liquid, hot, coursing pleasure . . . the delicate touch of lip to flesh . . . the brush of skeletal hands over her hair . . .</p><p>Victoria felt dizzy, the words of Lilith piling into her mind, crushing reality, destroying her conscience . . . she felt her body weakening, the bloodscent filling her awareness . . . and the release of pressure against her skin.</p><p>The last thing she knew was a pair of blood-soaked lips covering hers . . . and then she tipped into a hot, red oblivion.</p><p>When she awoke, Victoria found herself sprawled once again on the floor. She dragged herself up, her head light, but, blessedly, her vision had cleared of all but the faintest pink tinge.</p><p>Slowly, she climbed up onto her hands, then her knees, using the wall for support. As she became more upright, the room shimmered less, her head felt more stable, and her strength returned. The cloying smell of blood had faded to a bare essence, weak enough for her to ignore.</p><p>Turning slowly, she faced the chamber, expecting to see Lilith seated on her throne, watching with those laughing eyes.</p><p>But the throne was empty.</p><p>The room was empty but for a single Guardian vampire, who stood at the door. He looked at her, his eyes ruby pink, his fangs exposed in a lascivious smile.</p><p>Victoria scanned the chamber quickly, spotting her stake not far from the chair on which she\u2019d been sitting. She pretended not to notice the vampire; her mind was working now, and she\u2019d keep it straight and focused in order to make her escape. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Feigning a weakened state and staggering heavily, she made her way toward the forgotten stake, tumbling to the ground on top of it. The slender wood in her hand made her feel powerful again, and she waited, breathing long and deep like Kritanu had taught her . . . long and deep . . . long . . . deep.</p><p>She felt for the vis bullae that, so far, had brought her greater strength than anyone could expect. The cool silver, warmed on one side by her flesh, sent a wave of power radiating through her and Victoria knew she was ready. Keeping the stake hidden in the folds of her gown, she put her plan into action.</p><p>Pulling slowly to her feet again, as if in great pain, she staggered more, slowly, randomly, but deliberately toward the Guardian vampire. She saw through her lashes that he watched her, but with amusement rather than wariness.</p> <p>All the more fool he.</p><p>When she drew near enough and nearly fell at his feet, sliding against the cold, rough wall next to him, he gave a short chuckle. He\u2019d barely wheezed his breath back in when she surged to her feet, stake in hand.</p><p>He had enough time to raise his arm and open his mouth in surprise before the lethal weapon drove into his chest. The stake was a slender thing, but powerful enough to force through the heavy shirt he wore.</p><p>His ruby eyes froze wide before he shattered into ash and dust.</p><p>Victoria stealthily tried the door\u2014who knew what or who was on the other side\u2014but it didn\u2019t move. She dared not try to force it, for there could be too many to fight on the other side\u2014Lilith included.</p> <p>Besides, she had another plan.</p><p>She rushed toward the throne, moving quickly for fear that someone would return before she was able to hide away. Quickly, she unbolted it from the floor and moved it out of the way to reveal the hidden door behind it\u2014a door that she was certain Lilith knew nothing about . . . for she would have retrieved her copper ring if she had.</p><p>Unsure what lay behind the door, Victoria hoped she could at least hide there, giving the impression of an escape . . . and, perhaps if she were lucky, there would be another way out.</p><p>As she worked, Lilith\u2019s taunts echoed in her mind . . . almost as if they were attempting to slow her movements and distract her mind.</p><p>You already feel the tug of consciencelessness. The seed of everything evil begins with self.</p><p>When one places oneself before every and all, evil spreads.</p> <p>Already, you\u2019ve done so, even when you knew it was wrong . . . have you not?</p><p>Involuntarily, as she climbed through the hidden door, Victoria thought of leaving Bemis Goodwin to the vampires \u2014so that she could be free of the disruption he caused; of drugging Max\u2014so that she didn\u2019t need to worry over him or protect him; of early on in her visit to London, speaking with Gwendolyn in her private parlor, and the fury that bubbled deep inside . . . and how she didn\u2019t care to listen or hear about her friend\u2019s plans.</p><p>But . . . those events didn\u2019t mean that she was turning evil. Did they?</p><p>Leaving Bemis Goodwin and his companion to die . . . perhaps. Incapacitating Max? Not evil, no . . . how could it be evil to protect someone else?</p><p>Even when she knew it would destroy him.</p><p>Because it would be easier for her.</p><p>Forcing those dark thoughts away, she huddled in the small space and looked out at the dislodged chair. She had to pull it back into place or her hideaway would be revealed immediately. Then her eyes fell on a metal rod near the door. It had a hook on the end, like a shepherd\u2019s crook. In the narrow slit of light from the room, she also saw a piece of marble; it looked just like the top of the ornate bolt that fastened the throne to the floor. Only, there was no bolt. It would easily sit atop the claw-foot of the chair so that once she pulled it back into position, it would look as though it were bolted down.</p><p>Apparently this door had been used as a hiding place more than once, and the tools were there to assist. The fake bolt in its spot, Victoria squeezed back into the small doorway and used the metal rod to tug the chair back into place. As it moved, the door was forced closed until only a narrow opening was left\u2014just enough to draw the hook back into the room.</p> <p>Satisfied that the room would appear untouched, she closed the door and turned to feel her way around the pitch-black area. Working her way along the wall, she was forced to duck to keep from banging her head\u2014a tactic she discovered after having scraped against rough stone above. She quickly discovered that the chamber was not a chamber, but a passageway.</p><p>And one that, from the faint brush of cool air, she believed would lead to freedom.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Wherein the Marquess Receives a Visitor</p><p>The passage did indeed lead to freedom, and Victoria was able to find her way out of the sewers without confronting any other undead . . . but for one, whom she surprised when he (or she; she didn\u2019t even have the chance to see) came around a bend in the underground tunnel. She staked the vampire and continued on, realizing, to her consternation, that she was able to see better than she should be able to in the darkness.</p><p>A chill that had nothing to do with the portent of an undead crept over her shoulders and trailed down her spine. Vampires could see very well in the dark.</p><p>She slogged through the stream of waste as quickly and silently as possible, and soon found her way to the surface. The dawn was just breaking, which would explain why she\u2019d met a vampire on his way back to the place they obviously gathered. It was a miracle she hadn\u2019t met any others.</p><p>Once out of the sewers, she hurried through the streets, looking for a familiar landmark. As she wandered, she realizedthat she had no idea how long she\u2019d been gone. Was this the dawn that had come after the carriage ride in the park . . . or the next one? Or the next?</p><p>Victoria arrived at her town house when the bottom edge of the sun rested on the horizon. She raised her fist to knock on the door, but it was drawn wide before she had the chance.</p><p>\u201cKritanu,\u201d she said in relief. He was alive and well.</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d He was as pleased to see her, if the wide spread of white teeth was any indication. But his delight faded almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cBefore I tell you my story,\u201d she said, moving into the house and closing the door behind her, \u201cis Max well? Is he still . . . here? How long have I been gone? Did anyone\u2014 George and Sara\u2014anyone try to attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the second morning after you left. There were no attacks here,\u201d Kritanu replied. His face had sobered when she mentioned Max, and she felt a thrill of apprehension. \u201cMax is . . . the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same?\u201d Victoria went cold. \u201cHe is unconscious? For two days?\u201d She started to dash off, but the older man grabbed her arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, he is awake. Has been. I meant to say that he is where you left him.\u201d The accusation in his face was unmistakable. \u201cAs you ordered. Victoria,\u201d he said, his voice turning harder than she\u2019d ever heard it, \u201cyou are Illa Gardella . . . but never ask me to do such a thing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t release him.\u201d She wasn\u2019t certain if she was relieved or terrified that Max was still safely where she\u2019d put him.</p><p>\u201cI was prepared to do so if you had not returned today.\u201d His eyes carried concern and admonishment. \u201cYou should never have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll release him now,\u201d she said, turning away. It had been for the best. She didn\u2019t expect Kritanu to understand; he didn\u2019t carry the same burdens she did.</p><p>For all of her hurry to get to the sturdy wooden door surrounded by silver crosses and blessed with holy water, Victoria found herself frozen when it came time to lift the bar that had blocked Max in. What would he say? What would she say?</p><p>She took a deep breath. The heavy slab of wood had been wedged tightly in its brackets; a sign that someone had violently shoved at the door, and its moorings creaked as she forced it from its place. Automatically, she stepped back, half expecting Max to come blasting out.</p><p>Nothing happened, so with clammy hands she opened the door.</p><p>He was sitting on the bed, his long legs spread out in front of him.</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her voice, he moved. With the grace of a jungle feline, he swung his feet onto the floor and stood, then strode toward her. Not particularly quickly, nor casually. But with general purpose.</p><p>Victoria braced herself for the onslaught\u2014the railing, the anger, the accusation.</p><p>He walked past her and out into the hallway without a word, without an acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she said again, turning after him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pause, but continued on his way down the hall.</p><p>She would have thought him deaf or blind if it had not been for the expression in his eyes: dark and angry.</p><p>The hackney lurched to a violent halt, and Victoria heard the clatter and subsequent roll of a wooden stake by her foot. She looked across the dark interior, catching Sebastian\u2019s eye. \u201cShall we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMost definitely,\u201d he replied, bending to retrieve his weapon. There was relish in his voice and amusement in his eyes, and she knew that the carriage ride home would be far more interesting than the one they\u2019d just completed. Perhaps, at least then, he would keep his stake well in hand.</p><p>The pair slipped silently from Barth\u2019s vehicle, well hidden by convenient shrubbery that lined the wall of St. Heath\u2019s Row most distant from the house. Shadows, in concert with the sliver of a waning moon and dark clothing, made them invisible.</p><p>Victoria led the way along the wall to a particularly dark corner. A robust oak spread its shadow over the area, and blocked any view from the rear of the house. Sebastian stood flush against the tall stone relief and she climbed up to stand on his shoulders; then, once atop the wall, she reached down to pull him up.</p><p>Once over the cross-studded wall, she led the way to the second servants\u2019 entrance, where she knew the door would be unlocked. Verbena had been playing match-maker with the lower footman at Grantworth House and the belowstairs maid at St. Heath\u2019s Row, both of whom were taking a postmidnight stroll through the gardens at this very moment.</p><p>Verbena had assured her mistress that the footman and the maid would be much too busy examining the night-blooming pink primroses to notice any trespassers. She had also ascertained, when arranging the assignation, that the Marquess of Rockley was expected to dine at home that evening and intended to remain in residence that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had, in fact, declined any invitations for dinner or parties since the ill-fated carriage ride during which they\u2019d gone to view the night sky.</p><p>When Victoria had returned from her brief captivity this morning and begun to attend to matters other than Max, it had been with great skepticism and suspicion in regards to James. Either he had been fully aware and involved in her kidnapping\u2014which would make him a vampire or, at the least, a member of the Tutela\u2014or he had been ignorant of it, as he claimed.</p><p>According to Kritanu, James had called on her home the morning after the nighttime carriage ride, explaining that there had been an accident, he\u2019d been knocked unconscious, and when he came to, Victoria\u2014Mrs. Rockley, as he\u2019d called her\u2014was missing. According to Kritanu, the marquess had appropriately wrung his hands and paced the parlor as he accepted the blame for whatever had happened to her, begging that word should be sent to him the moment there was any news.</p> <p>Victoria listened to Kritanu\u2019s description of the man\u2019s agitation with a skeptical ear, and decided that, instead of returning his call or sending word of her return, she would find out the truth her own way tonight. Unlike Max, Sebastian had been delighted to see her, and more than delighted to join her in the excursion.</p><p>Max she had not seen since he stalked past her, and she had no need for his company anyway. She\u2019d kept herself busy the rest of the day, and had sent an urgent message to Wayren by pigeon. She prayed that the wise woman would have some advice or information about Lilith\u2019s prediction.</p><p>The unobtrusive servant\u2019s door was well oiled in preparation for late-night assignations, and Victoria led Sebastian through the narrow hallway. She\u2019d never had occasion to traverse the backstairs area of St. Heath\u2019s Row, but she obviously knew the layout of the portions of the house common to the marquess and marchioness.</p><p>When they came to a hallway that gave an option for right or left navigation, Victoria started off to the right . . . but a firm hand on her arm drew her back. \u201cThis way,\u201d Sebastian whispered, close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d she whispered back. \u201cYou haven\u2019t spent as much time here as I have.\u201d She pointed. \u201cThe stairs are to the right.\u201d</p> <p>An amused smile tipped his lips and she thought he was going to kiss her right there, to which she would have put an immediate stop. But he resisted, simply responding, \u201cYou might recall that I visited your maid in the servants\u2019 quarters while you were still staying here. She did, in fact, sleep four floors directly above us here. To the right is the kitchen. To the left are the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Chagrined, and reminded that Max had also had to correct her navigation more than once\u2014she always seemed to get turned around when inside a building\u2014she followed Sebastian as he swiftly moved down the left passage. And soon they came upon a narrow, steep staircase. He glanced down at her, but she sailed past him, nose in the air. Even Illa Gardella wasn\u2019t perfect. Once they were on the third floor, Victoria knew her way around the bedchambers.</p><p>Somewhere in the house, a floorboard creaked. A clock hummed, gearing itself up to toll the hour, and moments later, as they reached the third floor, Victoria heard the rolling strokes of two o\u2019clock.</p><p>And she realized that the back of her neck was cold. She smiled in the dark.</p><p>He was here. He wouldn\u2019t need to drink the elixir at night, unless he expected to be near her.</p><p>Which he obviously didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Stake in hand, holding it close to the loose black trousers she wore when she moved about at night, Victoria continued on her way. A myriad of thoughts ran through her mind as she, with Sebastian close enough behind that she felt the brush of his coat, eased through the rear hallway.</p><p>Of course James could be lying in wait for her, expecting such a visit. Or the undead she sensed might not be the new marquess at all. But there were ways to find out, and tonight she would do so once and for all. She knew he was in the house; the only question was what condition she might find him in.</p><p>When she and Sebastian reached the door to the marquess\u2019s dressing room, she opened it and slipped in. Once inside the chamber filled with clothing and the smell of male grooming, Victoria turned to Sebastian and planted a hand against his chest in a clear message. She\u2019d already told him that this was her task, and that he needed to be watching for any unforeseen problems. This was a reminder that she expected him to stay put.</p><p>In the darkness, he grasped her wrist and she thought for a moment that he was going to silently demand to go with her. Or to tell her to be careful, or to try to kiss his way into changing her mind. None of which would be effective. He drew a breath, his chest expanding under her hand, and squeezed his fingers around her skin in a quick little caress. Then he reluctantly released her.</p><p>Good. At least the man had learned something.</p><p>Victoria cracked the door from the dressing room to the bedchamber. The back of her neck was frigid, and unless James had company in his chamber, she knew she had found her daytime vampire.</p><p>Silent as a spirit, sticking to the shadows, she moved across the floor. The thin soles of her black slippers slid across polished wood, and then found the cushier texture of a fringed rug. When she stood at the side of James\u2019s bed and heard his even breathing, she had a moment of doubt.</p><p>What vampire would be sleeping soundly during the night?</p> <p>She\u2019d at least expected to find him awake, watching her with those red eyes.</p><p>But he was actually snoring.</p><p>Victoria looked down at him, adjusting the stake in her grip. She could shove it into his chest with a quick thrust, and it would be all over. If she wasn\u2019t mistaken.</p><p>But why should she be? The last time she\u2019d tried to stake someone who wasn\u2019t a vampire\u2014not counting the time Sebastian had inserted himself between her and Beauregard\u2014had been more than two years ago, when she\u2019d mistaken Max for an undead. It had been her first time, and she\u2019d been misled by the stereotypical description of a vampire that came from Polidori\u2019s novel.</p><p>Victoria raised the stake.</p><p>Then she pulled it back. If she was wrong, the stab would kill a mortal James.</p><p>She sighed. There was no help for it. She\u2019d have to awaken the man.</p><p>Fumbling in the deep pocket of the tunic she wore over her trousers, she pulled out a small vial of holy water. This was as good a way to awaken him as any.</p><p>The splash on his forehead sent up a soft sizzle and a curl of steam, and his eyes flew open\u2014wide and red.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, James,\u201d Victoria said calmly. She had placed her hand around the front of his throat, using her weight to hold him down. She held the stake fisted directly over his chest. \u201cI do hope I didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d He growled in a voice that sounded deeper and more guttural than the one she was accustomed to. His fangs shot out, pale in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cBefore I drill this into your heart and send you to your fate, I do hope you\u2019ll answer one question for me.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond, and she tightened her hand around his throat. He coughed, but an undead couldn\u2019t be strangled, so it was merely a discomfort, not a threat. \u201cAre you really James Lacy, Kentuckian?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shifted suddenly. She allowed him to throw off her hold, to let him think he might have a chance to escape. He\u2019d probably tell her more if he did. They eyed each other; he had risen onto his knees on the bed, and she\u2019d stepped back as if cowed. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cI think not. You were much too gullible.\u201d She glanced at his nightshirt and her lip curled. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of meeting an undead dressed for bed.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened, and those fangs poked into his lower lip. \u201cIf I had known you were coming, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered. Perhaps you\u2019d like to join me?\u201d</p><p>He lunged, and yanked her onto the bed next to him. She sprawled for a moment, then rolled onto her back, keeping the stake behind her hip. \u201cNo thank you. What did you do to the real James Lacy?\u201d</p><p>The undead reached for her tunic, grabbing a good handful of the material, and jerked her up as if she were a doll. Victoria sagged, yet she was ready beneath her feigned weakness. It was a game, now. How much information could she get before he became suspicious or bored?</p><p>\u201cIt was our plan from the beginning\u2014caught him when he got off the ship from America. Insisted that he take a ride, and relieved him of his papers and clothing. Then we fed on him.\u201d He laughed. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m feeling a bit hungry at the moment, Victoria Gardella. Did you think you could sneak in here and get away without me knowing?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYou were snoring. I could have turned you to ash before you even awoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d His eyes burned bloodred, and his fangs gleamed sharply.</p><p>She pulled her arm from beneath and met him as he lunged, shoving the stake into the center of his chest. \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d she told him as he froze, and then poofed into dust.</p><p>There was movement behind her, and she whirled to find Sebastian standing there. His stake was at the ready.</p><p>Victoria frowned. \u201cI told you to stay back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Mostly.\u201d He smiled, and her anger could do nothing but sap away. This was Sebastian, and either he wasn\u2019t as confident in her abilities as Max was . . . or he cared more.</p><p>She thought she knew which one it was.</p><p>\u201cShould we clean up the ash?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt stinks.\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s. And then there will be another strange disappearance of the Marquess of Rockley.\u201d</p><p>They brushed the dust onto a pillowcase. Then he poured it into the cold fireplace.</p><p>Victoria was waiting when he finished. The back of her neck was normal; there were no other vampires in the vicinity. The daytime vampire\u2014at least, one of them\u2014 was dead. And so was the real Marquess of Rockley.</p><p>The hackney was parked at the prearranged location, and they made their way back to the vehicle without incident. No sooner had Victoria clambered in and settled in her seat, the door closing firmly behind Sebastian, than Barth started them off with a great leap. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whether it was by accident or design, she\u2019d never know, but the lurch sent Sebastian onto her side of the vehicle instead of the bench politely across from her. Once gracefully settling into his seat, he turned to face her. His knees bumped gently against her right leg and his arm sidled along the back of the cushion behind her. His gloveless fingers jutted into the long, simple braid she\u2019d tucked into the back of her tunic, his thumb smoothing over the sensitive skin at the nape of her neck.</p><p>The carriage was very dark, and there was only the ambiguous illumination from the lantern that swayed at the front of the vehicle. She didn\u2019t have the chance to speak, or even to think\u2014for, all at once, Sebastian was there, kissing her.</p><p>His kiss was hungry, one that surprised her with its intensity. One moment they were climbing politely into the carriage, and the next, it was a tangle of lips and tongue, and hands that seemed to be everywhere.</p> <p>Hot and sleek, his mouth covered hers as he held her face steady so he could delve and taste. Warm fingers settled at the base of her jaw, and Victoria raised her chin to gasp for a quick breath before slipping back into the kiss, fighting to keep back the red-edged memories threatening the corner of her mind . . . the lull of pleasure snapped by the sharp thrust of fangs . . . the pull of her blood as it coursed through her veins . . . the bizarre sensation of cold and warm lips against her skin.</p><p>She moaned softly, half in horror at the remembering, at the inability to stop it . . . half with melting pleasure, for this man knew where to touch her.</p><p>Battling back the horrific images, she forced herself to explore Sebastian, to remind herself that it was he, and not Beauregard. . . . She wove her fingers desperately through his thick curls, arching up against his hard belly and insistent erection as he straddled her thigh, the edge of the bench slicing into her skin from beneath. His weight pressed gently against her hips, and she moved her hands so they eased up over the smooth muscles of his chest to curl at the top of his shoulders. Wide, strong shoulders beneath the coat, and under the dark linen . . . smooth, golden skin. Sebastian.</p><p>A light brush of hair stroked her cheek when his lips lifted, then fell to trace the curve of her jaw, nibbling and licking. His breath puffed hot and hard against her neck, and Victoria was aware of her own breath rising to meet his as she focused on the moment . . . the man. The sensations. Not the memories.</p><p>Barely aware of the carriage wheels rumbling beneath them, at last she allowed herself to fall into a spiral of urgent, slick kisses and to feel the skim of fresh air over bare skin as her tunic was lifted . . . warm, sure, possessive hands smoothing on her flesh, exploring and coaxing as she closed her eyes. The sensations mixed and whirled, and the coach seemed small and intimate as he stripped off his coat. She pulled his shirt from the waist of his pantaloons, at last feeling the warmth of flesh and the pull of muscle beneath a light dusting of hair. Her fingers slipped around, rediscovering the unyielding silver of the vis bulla that dangled from the hollow of his navel.</p> <p>Release, relief, pleasure slid through her, loosening her limbs, making her feel liquid and warm. His mouth settled over a breast, bared by the tunic piled over her collarbones. The way his lips closed over her tight nipple, sucking gently and drawing it deep into slick warmth sent her shuddering and shivering on the bench.</p><p>He pulled away, settling himself over her, his face close. His linen shirt brushed over the tips of her breasts and she could see, just so, the half smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cAnd so,\u201d he murmured, his mouth close, \u201cit is yet another carriage ride for us.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and then gave a little gasp as his hand moved down between them, sliding beneath the band of her trousers. He watched her, his face jolting and swaying with the motion of the hackney as his fingers, sure and firm, found the place they sought. Victoria\u2019s breath caught at the first touch, and then she felt herself gathering up, tight and ready, as he stroked and slipped and slid down in the heat.</p><p>\u201cNow this,\u201d he said, his voice filled with amusement, \u201cis the perfect way to end a night on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, fell into the pleasure that surged and opened inside her, pushed away the worries, the memories, the image of dark, angry eyes . . . She tensed, and reached between them to lift his hand away.</p> <p>Then there was a sudden lurch and near tip as the carriage barreled around a corner and Sebastian, half on top of her, lost his footing and nearly sprawled on the floor. The unexpected motion brought her back to reality, and when he would have pressed back down against her, she placed her hands on his chest. His heart raced beneath her fingers; she felt it through the linen shirt.</p><p>\u201cSebastian,\u201d she said as he would have bent to her again. \u201cI . . . it\u2019s . . . I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stilled against her, and she felt his chest rising and falling, as though he had to decipher her words. \u201cWhat?\u201d His voice was . . . wounded. He didn\u2019t sit back, but remained poised next to her, nearly on top of her. \u201cWhat is it, Victoria? What\u2019s changed?\u201d He gave a little laugh; it sounded forced, she thought. \u201cYou always made it a bit of a challenge, of course, and it was fun for both of us . . . but this is . . . different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t like that she sounded weak, but she knew . . . she couldn\u2019t continue on the path they were going. She was confused, and frightened . . . and empty. She couldn\u2019t banish the image of those black, furious eyes.</p><p>Then, suddenly, before she could think of how to respond, Sebastian said something in French, so violent and sharp that she knew it was filthy. He grasped her shoulders now\u2014not in a gentle, loverlike way, but with the need to know. \u201cBeauregard. Was it Beauregard? Did he . . . touch you?\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes, he had . . . but she remembered few details. She didn\u2019t want to remember them, didn\u2019t want to know enough to be able to answer his question. Victoria closed her eyes; what had happened with Beauregard had been ugly, horrific . . . but it wasn\u2019t the reason.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t because of Beauregard that she felt empty and lost.</p><p>\u201cMy God, you\u2019re shaking,\u201d he said softly. \u201cVictoria, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He gathered her into his arms there on the bench, pressing her face to his chest, and wrapped her tightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, before she could stop it, her emotions burst forth and the tears came. The sobs of worry and angst, of fear and horror . . . what was happening to her . . . what had she done . . . loneliness . . . sorrow . . . confusion . . .</p><p>Sebastian held her, let her weep into his shirt until it was sopping. His face pressed into the top of her head, the warmth of his body comforting. The strength of his arms, and the feel of his hands, cupping the back of her head.</p><p>He murmured something into her hair, and pressed a soft kiss onto her scalp.</p><p>So unlike Sebastian . . . to be serious, to hold her without wanting more, to be silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she said, pulling away and swiping angrily at her tears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a handkerchief, but I still have your glove,\u201d he said, giving her a rueful smile. \u201cThe one I tricked from you at the Silver Chalice.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, her eyelids swollen and her nose streaming unattractively. \u201cMy glove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve kept it, and the other one I took later, too. Unfortunately,\u201d he said, his smile wavering in the uncertain light, \u201cthey aren\u2019t a matched set. I seem to have a penchant for baring your left hand. Among other places.\u201d He brushed the hair from her face. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you. I think I have been ever since you showed me your vis bulla in order to find out where the Book of Antwartha was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tricked me into showing you,\u201d she said. Her mind spun.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a trick . . . I gave you what you wanted. Even though\u201d\u2014he chucked her lightly under the chin\u2014 \u201cyou still haven\u2019t given me what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>Her heart thumped madly, and she curled her fingers around his hands, nestled there in her lap. She nodded. \u201cI think I do. But . . .\u201d She drew in her breath. There were so many things. . . . \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen . . . to me.\u201d Her voice caught, but she forced herself on. \u201cI may not be . . . myself . . . much longer.\u201d She couldn\u2019t put the thoughts into words.</p><p>God, please let me hear from Wayren soon!</p><p>\u201cLilith may be right,\u201d he said, \u201cbut she lies well. And either way, Victoria . . . it would not be the first time I have loved a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Wherein Lady Melly\u2019s Machinations Meet an Unexpected End</p><p>Victoria woke late the next morning with swollen eyes and the remnants of dreams she didn\u2019t care to recall.</p><p>There was no word from Wayren, and Max had not made an appearance. Sebastian had reluctantly left her at the town house early that morning to return to wherever it was that he was staying.</p><p>Kritanu gave her the impression that he was aware of Max\u2019s whereabouts. But when Victoria broached the subject, she was met with a gentle shake of the head and closed lips.</p><p>Well, if Max wouldn\u2019t give her the chance to apologize, to explain why she\u2019d been so certain\u2014and that she\u2019d been right!\u2014that the evening had been a trap meant for her as well as him, so be it. He could sulk and brood and stay away.</p><p>Victoria had more important things to concern herself with. Besides, if Max were around, she\u2019d be forced to confess the whole situation to him, including Lilith\u2019s frightening prediction. Which she felt no real need to do. She hadn\u2019t forgotten the fact that he\u2019d been holding a stake, ready to put it to use when she woke up back in the Consilium.</p><p>And that was what she kept telling herself, over and over. And over.</p><p>Max was out of her life. For good.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t want anybody.</p><p>Instead, she had to face the facts. Her night vision had become much clearer. If Lilith was right, and the vampire blood was taking over inside her . . . was it something she could fight? Something she could stop? Or was she destined to become undead?</p><p>The possibility was simply too horrific to consider. It just couldn\u2019t happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>The fact that Wayren hadn\u2019t responded to a message sent by pigeon caused Victoria even greater trepidation. Wayren\u2019s pigeons were trained to find her anywhere, and always seemed to do so, and to provide a response within twenty-four hours regardless of where she was. Thus Victoria began to fear that the wise woman had abandoned her as well.</p><p>Late that afternoon she sat grumpy and fidgeting in Lady Melly\u2019s parlor, listening to the three cronies discuss the details of George IV\u2019s coronation ceremony, which was to be held in a matter of days.</p> <p>It was no surprise that the topic dominated their conversation, for the coronation of the man who\u2019d been known as Prinny, nearly eighteen months after he\u2019d ascended to the throne, was to be the greatest, most expensive and flamboyant crowning of an English king.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you wear, Victoria?\u201d asked Lady Nilly, leaning forward as if in anticipation of some great fashion secret.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been invited,\u201d she replied tartly, unconcerned with civility today. \u201cAnd I do not plan to attend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course you have been invited! The only person of Quality in all of the land who is not to attend is the queen herself,\u201d Lady Melly chided her. \u201cAnd if you stay away, you may be aligned with her in the eyes of the ton. That would not be fitting for the Marchioness of Rockley, Victoria, to take the side of Queen Caroline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is abominable that the working and trades cheer that disgusting creature whenever she goes about the City, giving her false support,\u201d Lady Nilly said, her nose raised as if she smelled something objectionable. Perhaps it was the bouquet of daisies on the table near her tea. Victoria had always disliked the smell of the sunny flowers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only because they despise Prinny\u2014er, His Majesty\u2014that they love her. Or claim they do, which I freely doubt. If any of them got within a king\u2019s yard of that smelly sow, they should run the other direction and reexamine their thoughts,\u201d Lady Melly said primly.</p><p>\u201cIf the woman would wash or change her undergarments, or even comb her hair, perhaps His Majesty would allow her near him . . . but she does not.\u201d Duchess Winnie\u2019s multiple chins trembled, but she was not in danger of being accused of living in a glass house. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple matter of grooming,\u201d she said, smoothing her perfect skirts pointedly. The duchess, who was also a woman of large proportion, was always supremely clothed and coiffed before she stepped from her chamber. \u201cI vow the queen\u2019s goats are better groomed than she.\u201d</p><p>The other ladies laughed, and even Victoria couldn\u2019t hold back a little smile. The gossip about the queen wasn\u2019t completely mean-spirited. The woman had made no friends from the moment she arrived from Germany to wed the man who at the time was the Prince Regent.</p><p>Victoria remembered the story of Caroline of Brunswick\u2019s first meeting with Prinny, in which the prince had come face to face with the sloppy, putrid woman and said, quite loudly, to the Baron of Malmesbury, \u201cHarris, I do not feel well. Pray get me a glass of brandy.\u201d He\u2019d not ceased drinking for the three days up to and including the wedding. He\u2019d passed out on his wedding night, and Caroline had left him on the floor.</p><p>It was no wonder there was enmity between the two.</p><p>A knock came at the parlor door, and Lady Melly straightened expectantly. Victoria tightened her fingers around an innocent teacup, knowing that her mother\u2019s anticipation could bode no good for her.</p> <p>But then she recalled that it couldn\u2019t be James. He\u2019d been turned into a pile of dust and would no longer be at the mercy of her mother\u2019s machinations.</p><p>Thus, Lady Melly was bound to be disappointed\u2014in more ways than one. The Grantworth House butler entered the room on command, carrying a silver tray, on which rested a thick white paper, folded and sealed with a blob of yellow wax and an unidentifiable crest. \u201cThis missive for Lady Rockley,\u201d he intoned.</p><p>Victoria nearly knocked over a vase of sweet-smelling lilies in her alacrity to seize the message. An excuse to leave, she hoped, before the droves of afternoon callers began their never-ending influx.</p><p>The message was simple, and in an elegant hand that Victoria recognized with relief: Your carriage awaits without.</p><p>\u201cI must go,\u201d she said, without sitting back down.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Lady Nilly. But she was overrun by Lady Melly.</p><p>\u201cSurely not now!\u201d exclaimed that genteel lady. \u201cIt is too early.\u201d</p><p>Victoria fixed her gaze on her parent. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mother, but it is of an urgent nature.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you cannot,\u201d Lady Melly started, but this time Victoria was more firm.</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>Her mother stood. \u201cSurely it has nothing to do with that Monsieur Vioget you insist upon allowing to stay around,\u201d Melly said, her voice sharp. \u201cHe is no better than those clinging vines that we have to cut away from the chimney top.\u201d</p><p>Victoria blinked in astonishment that her mother was even aware of such a mundane occurrence.</p><p>\u201cI must say, Victoria, that it is just too ridiculous that you encourage him! Why he has no title and isn\u2019t even British, and rather a bit slick in the tongue, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>That was one way to describe it, Victoria thought as her lips threatened to twitch.</p><p>\u201cHis tailor is quite excellent,\u201d Lady Nilly offered. \u201cAnd he does rather remind me of a kind gentleman who once saved me from a vampire . . . or at least, I dreamed he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo hush, Nilly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, I suggest that you become used to seeing Sebastian about,\u201d Victoria said firmly. \u201cFor it is quite possible\u2014quite possible\u2014that he will someday become your son by law. And now,\u201d she continued rapidly, shocked that she\u2019d actually said those words, let alone thought them through, \u201cI really must leave. Don\u2019t try to stop me.\u201d Why had she said that?</p><p>\u201cVictoria Anastasia!\u201d Lady Melly shot to her feet. Teacups rattled and brown liquid slopped merrily. \u201cHow dare you take that tone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood-bye, Mother. I\u2019ll be in touch soon.\u201d And with that, Victoria whirled out of the parlor, fairly sprinting down the hall to the front door.</p><p>The sounds of screeching voices and gasping breaths faded as she darted out the front entrance in a most undignified manner. Her carriage was indeed waiting, its midnight blue paint sleek and shiny under the late-afternoon sun. Gold and silver trim gleamed when the coachman opened the door, and Victoria climbed in.</p><p>She didn\u2019t expect to actually find Wayren in the carriage, but there she was. The woman was of an indeterminate age\u2014she appeared older than Victoria, but younger than Lady Melly. Yet she had been there when Aunt Eustacia had taken up the vis bulla. The satchel that always seemed to contain more books and manuscripts than appeared possible sat like a lumpy toad next to her.</p><p>A brittle brown-spotted scroll open on her lap, Wayren looked up from behind perfectly square glasses, squinted, and then removed them as Victoria settled in her seat. \u201cHello, Victoria. How are you?\u201d</p><p>The words, so simple, and often spoken\u2014and responded to\u2014without regard to their real meaning, were said with such sincerity, and the expression in her gray-blue eyes was so kind, that Victoria felt the threat of tears sting, and the inside of her nostrils tingled with emotion. She blinked hard, and then answered with pure honesty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think . . . perhaps not so well.\u201d</p><p>Wayren nodded. Gravity rendered her face smooth. \u201cAye, I can see that is so.\u201d</p><p>The carriage started with a gentle lunge, and Victoria looked at her companion. \u201cYou received my message. Can you tell me . . . is Lilith correct? Will I . . . am I . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe reason I did not arrive sooner\u2014for I received your missive yesterday, of course\u2014was that I spent some time with Ylito to see if he was aware of anything that might stop . . . or slow . . . the effect of the undead blood. That would, you see, give us more time to determine a cure. If there is one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Wayren shook her head slowly. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he can do. But Victoria,\u201d she said, and to her surprise, the older woman reached across the space and clasped her fingers around Victoria\u2019s wrist. Her hand was bare, and her grip closed over the skin above Victoria\u2019s gloves. The touch sent warmth and ease flowing through her; Victoria felt steadier than she had in some time. \u201cYou have already shown the strength to fight back the impulse of the immortal blood that threatened to take over. You are well armed, and you are strong. Though Ylito has nothing in his laboratory that might protect you, I believe that it is possible . . . more than possible . . . that you are strong enough to conquer this trial.\u201d</p><p>A deep wave of disappointment and fear washed over her, despite Wayren\u2019s comforting grip. There was nothing. Nature, in the form of tainted undead blood, would take its course. There was nothing that could be done.</p><p>Victoria drew back, and in spite of the warm summer afternoon, her flesh felt chilled when Wayren released her arm. Nausea churned in her belly. She\u2019d expected, she\u2019d believed, that Wayren would be the answer to her problem\u2014that the mystical woman who seemed to know everything, or at least where to find out about it, would arrive with a potion or a serum that would wash away the vampire blood.</p><p>But of course. How could she be so foolish? If there were such an elixir, she could have ingested it after her experience with Beauregard.</p><p>She could have given it to Phillip.</p><p>Victoria blinked hard. So it would come full circle then. Her mistakes, her selfishness back to haunt her. Her fate would be the same as Phillip\u2019s, the innocent man. She just hoped someone staked her before she did something terrible.</p><p>The memory of Max, holding the stake when she\u2019d awakened at the Consilium, refreshed in her mind. He would have done it without hesitation.</p><p>Wayren watched her with steady eyes, soft with worry. She didn\u2019t speak, as though knowing that Victoria had to assimilate it all on her own. She merely waited as the carriage rolled through the streets. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill I . . .\u201d she began, then had to start again. It was better not to think of herself . . . but to keep the thoughts removed. \u201cA vampire who drinks from a mortal is damned for eternity. Will you ensure that I . . .\u201d Her voice clogged. All of a sudden, her future was becoming real to her. The possibility that she\u2019d forced away, refused to consider, disbelieved . . . its reality was reflected in the expression of Wayren\u2019s eyes and in her thinned mouth.</p><p>\u201cVictoria.\u201d The other woman\u2019s voice, stern and sharp, penetrated the fog of pink that threatened the edge of her vision. \u201cYou cannot let the power of evil slide into you. You cannot succumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut vampirism isn\u2019t a choice; it\u2019s not something that can be fought off. I know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Wayren said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t. Once the vampire blood is ingested, it overtakes the mortal blood in the human and . . . you know what happens. The person becomes undead. But that didn\u2019t happen with you, Victoria. Against every odd, and every expectation, it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Her eyes were serious. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the two vis bullae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we suspect, yes,\u201d Wayren replied. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know for certain. Ylito and I have discussed your situation, and there is no real explanation for it, other than the two vis bullae, and the power and strength\u2014both physical and mental\u2014that goes along with them. That\u2019s the only thing it could be. But there\u2019s something else to consider, and this is why I think there could be more hope than you think.\u201d</p><p>Victoria was almost afraid to ask, so she remained silent.</p><p>\u201cNormally when one is turned undead, when they awaken, as you did, the vampire blood has already taken over the entirety of the body and made the mortal immortal. But when you awoke, that wasn\u2019t the case. You were still mortal. You\u2019d been spared. But now, that vampire blood is still within you, fighting to take over. That is what makes your situation different, Victoria. You\u2019re awake, and aware, and the battle for your soul is waging within you. The two strength amulets you wear have bought you the time . . . time for you to fight the urge to become immortal, and evil. Both physically and in your soul. Your mind.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria shivered. \u201cIs there a chance, then? With this evil growing inside me . . . is there a chance?\u201d</p><p>Before Victoria knew it, Wayren was next to her on the seat. She grasped her shoulders with strong, slender fingers and looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cEvery mortal has the portent for evil deep inside them. Every man and woman makes choices for his or her self, for self, Victoria. It is only when those decisions outweigh all others; when they become the driving force, the normal state for that mortal, does evil win. Self-service drives all malevolence\u2014but it will only succeed in winning if you allow it. Do not allow it.\u201d She gave her a little shake, and the red mist faded. \u201cI believe you can fight this away . . . physically. And spiritually. Do not allow it to take over, Victoria. I believe you can stop it.\u201d</p><p>Despite her nebulous information, Wayren showed no indication that she meant to leave London. In fact, she told Victoria that she\u2019d sent for two of the other Venators, Brim and Michalas, to come immediately to London from Paris, where they\u2019d been investigating some heightened demon activity. Victoria knew the two men well, and rather than being annoyed by the wise woman\u2019s presumption, she was relieved that she\u2019d done so. They should arrive within a week, and would be able to provide extra support in light of Lilith\u2019s presence in London and whatever her plans were.</p><p>And although Wayren took her own quarters when she stayed in London, she remained with Victoria into the evening and they dined together with Kritanu. They had just finished dinner when Sebastian was announced, and, despite the fact that the Venators rarely paid attention to the rules of polite society, Victoria and Wayren met him in the parlor.</p><p>If Wayren was surprised at the way Sebastian greeted Victoria\u2014with an embrace and a lengthy, well-placed kiss on the back of her hand\u2014she gave no indication. Even when he took his place next to Victoria on the sofa, as if he were a love-struck swain\u2014which was so far from Sebastian\u2019s persona that Victoria chuckled to herself at the thought\u2014Wayren didn\u2019t appear to notice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just recalled something that I believe you will find very interesting,\u201d Sebastian told Victoria.</p> <p>She sipped from the blush-tinged sherry she had poured, feeling the comfort of his warm thigh brushing next to hers. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked, throwing aside the gloom that had threatened her since Wayren\u2019s arrival. \u201cHave you found a new way to tie a neck cloth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course not,\u201d he told her lightly . . . yet there was a bit of real affront in his voice. That surprised her, and she looked more closely into his tigerish eyes. A prickle began to worm its way down her spine. He\u2019d been more . . . sensitive? serious? . . . as of late, and while Victoria had been deft at keeping their kisses to little more than kisses, and her corset fastened, she knew something was going to change. Soon.</p><p>She felt as if the decision had been made for her that afternoon, when she confirmed their engagement to her mother.</p><p>After all, he loved her. Or claimed he did . . . there was still a niggling suspicion about Sebastian; she\u2019d refused to trust him for so long.</p><p>The only problem was the uncertainty of her future. Victoria felt a chill wash over her, and the unpleasant roiling return to her belly. She took a bigger gulp of the sherry than she\u2019d intended, and realized that Sebastian had continued.</p><p>\u201cWhen George Starcasset was in Italy this last year, not only did he make the acquaintance of Queen Caroline . . . but he became one of her favorites.\u201d He raised an eyebrow and gave Victoria a complacent smile. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a bit convenient that he and Sarafina Regalado have returned to England at the same time the queen has . . . after having been fairly banished for years.\u201d</p><p>Understanding burst over her, and she caught her breath. \u201cAnd how telling that she should return from her self-exile in Italy just in time to see her husband crowned King of England.\u201d They looked at each other, and Victoria grasped his hand.</p><p>That was it. It had to be Lilith\u2019s plan: to invade the coronation of the king, where all of the most powerful men in England, the most powerful country in the world, would be gathered at one time.</p> <p>But why?</p><p>Twenty-one</p><p>Wherein Our Heroine Takes a Swim</p><p>If Lady Melly found the evaporation of Victoria\u2019s reluctance to attend the coronation odd, she was too well-bred to say anything in regards to the change of heart. Most likely she assumed her sage motherly advice had achieved the appropriate influence. Moreover, her attention was taken up by the equally sudden disappearance of her favorite candidate for son by law.</p><p>Victoria, of course, remained mum on the topic of James Lacy, except to promise her mother that if the man attended the coronation, she would allow Lady Melly to finagle a seat for her in the presence of the marquess. And that she would be her most charming.</p><p>She felt that was a safe promise to make.</p><p>While Melly and her cronies dithered and dressed, gossiped and coiffed, Victoria was making plans.</p><p>She\u2019d seen no sign of Max this last week, and although she almost missed his arrogant, all-knowing comments related to her plans, she realized she didn\u2019t need him there at all. Her feelings were bruised and raw, but there was little she could do but focus on now, and then the future. She reminded herself that, although Max had walked away from her and the Venators in the past, he had done so only temporarily. He\u2019d always returned.</p><p>But this time, she suspected he would not. He had no reason to; he was no longer a Venator. And he\u2019d made it clear he wanted nothing to do with Victoria in any respect. And apparently, with Kritanu and Wayren\u2019s blessings\u2014if their reticence in discussing the subject was any indication.</p><p>Wayren, Sebastian, and Kritanu had talked with Victoria about their suspicions and what the threat could be, and how it might be carried out. They\u2019d all agreed it was likely not so much a plan to control members of the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of England, as to kill some or all of them. Queen Caroline (who, Victoria suspected, based on her interaction with George, was either a member of the Tutela or a vampire herself) certainly hated her husband enough to do so. Perhaps the queen had offered Lilith protection. After all, that was the purpose of the Tutela, was it not? To protect, and serve, vampires.</p><p>But nothing was certain, so all they could do was be in attendance at the festivities, and be prepared for anything.</p><p>The day of the coronation was a hot, sticky one, as is common in July.</p><p>Victoria abhorred the fact that she was expected to dress as befit her station instead of in something more comfortable for fighting vampires or other threats. At least she wasn\u2019t counted among the king\u2019s closest advisers and compatriots, for they were required to follow his majesty\u2019s example and dress in the style of his predecessors, the Tudors. They would be wearing heavy brocaded and laced ensembles with sleeves slashed to show different fabric beneath, neck ruffs, and abominably wide and stiff farthingaled skirts. Not for the first time, Victoria wondered how her ancestor, Lady Catherine Gardella, could ever have been an effective Venator with such fussy and heavy gowns.</p><p>Yet Victoria\u2019s own dress had to be not only fitting to her wealth and title, but also serviceable in the event that she had to be more active. In this case, Verbena had come to her aid by supervising the creation of a frock that had a skirt split into wide trousers. The trouser legs were full enough to be mistaken for the bell of her skirt, and there were two flaps of fabric in the front and the back that fell like aprons over the split of the gown. They looked like embroidered decorations, they blended so cunningly with the rest of the dress. If necessary, Victoria could remove them to give her greater freedom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Brim and Michalas haven\u2019t yet arrived\u2014Wayren expects them any day now\u2014but I don\u2019t expect anything to happen at the coronation itself,\u201d Victoria said to Sebastian and Kritanu in the foyer of the town house. She pulled on her gloves and checked to make certain the several stakes were arranged on her person. Her kadhara knife she slipped into its sheath under her skirt. They were waiting for the carriage, which would take them to Westminster Abbey. \u201cBut it\u2019s best if we\u2019re prepared in any case.\u201d She glanced at the crossbow Kritanu carried, and counted more than a dozen wooden bolts in the quiver he would wear under a cloak. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d said a peremptory voice. \u201cThe vampires won\u2019t be able to enter the holy space of the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s stomach flipped and she felt, to her great mortification, warmth flush over her cheeks. But one look at Max, who\u2019d materialized from the back hallway near the servants\u2019 quarters, served to destroy her surprise and delight.</p><p>Although he was dressed appropriately for attending the coronation\u2014in a splendid ruby-and-garnet brocade waistcoat, with a crisp white shirt and black neck cloth, and a coat that rivaled Sebastian\u2019s perfectly tailored attire\u2014he didn\u2019t acknowledge her presence by even a supercilious glance down his long, straight nose. Instead, he directed his comment to Wayren, who, to Victoria\u2019s surprise, had appeared along with him.</p> <p>\u201cNormally, I would agree with you, Max,\u201d she said coolly, determined to force his attention to her. \u201cBut with the use of the special elixir, the vampires have been able to do many other things that they normally cannot. I prefer to make no assumptions in this case.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her then, his expression carefully blank\u2014even his eyes. They remained flat and dark, without even the hint of anger from before. His mouth was hard and thin. It felt odd\u2014as though they were the only two in the space, as though some subtle struggle was happening . . . something that she couldn\u2019t quite identify.</p><p>\u201cI hardly think that Lilith has allowed her entire army to partake of that dangerous serum,\u201d Max replied loftily. \u201cIt would rather be like cutting off one\u2019s nose to spite one\u2019s face. But, nevertheless, to the abbey we will go. And, after that, to Westminster Hall where the feast shall be held.\u201d</p><p>He turned as though by some magical means he\u2019d sensed the arrival of the carriage. Or perhaps he simply faced the door, whose glass sidelights exposed the sight of the vehicle.</p><p>To Victoria\u2019s surprise, Wayren joined them in the carriage. \u201cI am not able to fight,\u201d she told Victoria. \u201cBut I will ride there to learn the direction and survey the area, and then return to the house in the event that Brim and Michalas should arrive.\u201d</p> <p>Not for the first time, Victoria wondered about the ageless woman, but now was not the time to allow her mind to be clogged by questions she\u2019d never have answered. Instead, she and Wayren sat across from Sebastian and Max, while Kritanu insisted on riding on the exterior jump seat, serving as footman. Because of the potential threat, Barth had been asked to play coachman today, which was evidenced by the abrupt launch of the vehicle.</p><p>Sebastian had been uncharacteristically quiet, and Victoria felt his attention settle on her, lift, and then return. He looked magnificent, with his rich golden neck cloth tied in a ridiculously intricate knot and a bronze-and-copper waistcoat beneath a chocolate coat, and dark trousers. Rich leonine curls, tighter in the sticky heat, contrasted with the dark squabs of the interior of the coach, gleaming like honey on the window side, and lush brown on the other. He looked like a burnished topaz statue, but the mischievous smile that usually lit his eyes and tweaked his full lips was gone.</p><p>Victoria glanced at Max, who was glaring out the window. Taller in the seat than his companion\u2014though just as broad of shoulder\u2014he was a dark foil, with his sharper features, swarthy skin, and slash of dark brows. He\u2019d pulled his hair back in that unfashionable club, rather than letting it fall in thick, unruly waves; perhaps it was too long for him to let it hang free. His jaw appeared hard and set as usual, but he\u2019d relaxed his mouth since their exchange in the foyer. Victoria felt a little shiver run through her belly at the sudden, unexpected reminder of the one time he\u2019d kissed her, against the cold, wet stone wall. He\u2019d barely looked at her since, and certainly hadn\u2019t tried to repeat it.</p><p>Unlike Sebastian.</p><p>She looked between the two men without appearing to do so, a strange prickling rolling down her spine. Odd to see them, next to each other, facing her\u2014as though to showcase their contrasting personalities, appearance, history. They were so different, and yet . . . much alike.</p><p>Her heart was beating harder and she didn\u2019t know why.</p> <p>Or perhaps she did.</p><p>Her stomach filled with butterflies, and she looked away.</p><p>The speed of the coach had slowed because of the crush of spectators. They surged and waned like ocean waves, held back from the canopied walkway that had been erected for His Majesty. \u201cTwo million yards of Russian duck fabric to cover it!\u201d she remembered hearing Lady Winnie screech, her small eyes round with disbelief.</p><p>As a peer, Victoria should have been part of the coronation procession, but of course it was more prudent for her to remain apart and prepared to engage. No doubt Lady Melly would have something to say about her absence, but that could be attended to later.</p><p>They arrived at Westminster Abbey more than an hour before the king was due to arrive. This gave them time to look around and observe the site. Wayren left with Barth shortly after, promising to send him back with the carriage as soon as she returned to the house.</p><p>Victoria and Sebastian happened to be near the main entrance to the abbey when a large, ornate coach arrived, thirty minutes before the king was due to make an appearance.</p><p>\u201cHer Majesty, Queen Caroline!\u201d</p><p>Exchanging looks, they hurried over and watched the corpulent queen clamber heavily down from her conveyance.</p> <p>\u201cGood God, she looks ill,\u201d murmured someone next to Victoria.</p><p>She and Sebastian hurried closer, stakes at the ready.</p><p>As the queen approached the massive entrance to the abbey, the crowd falling back to allow her passage\u2014or, perhaps, to move upwind\u2014the doors slammed closed. Five burly men, dressed as pages, stood in front of them, barring her way.</p><p>\u201cAs Queen of England, I demand that you remove yourselves,\u201d proclaimed Caroline in her heavy German accent.</p><p>\u201cBy order of the sovereign king, we refuse to allow you entrance.\u201d The five men, much too large to be pages and who were later admitted to be prizefighters, stood nearly as wide as they were tall, effectively blocking her entrance.</p><p>Victoria and Sebastian moved closer, swiftly pushing through the crowd, heedless of civility. They were in time to see the queen beckon to her cortege, and six members of her party moved forward. \u201cRemove them from my path,\u201d ordered the queen. \u201cNo one shall prevent me from attending my husband\u2019s coronation.\u201d</p><p>Her guards did as they were bid, and when Victoria saw the ease with which they shoved away and held back the five massive prizefighters, she looked at Sebastian. Clearly, they were undead, complete with superhuman strength and the benefits of the special elixir.</p><p>The queen had planned well.</p><p>Victoria needed only a moment to decide what to do. Taking advantage of the tumult caused by the queen\u2019s insistence, she darted off to the side. There was another door near the front of the abbey, and she was able to slip through quickly.</p><p>Smiling grimly, Sebastian was close behind her, and they made their way to the inside of the main entrance.</p><p>The doors were opening, and those inside the abbey didn\u2019t realize it was the queen attempting to gain entrance. Victoria and Sebastian hurried over to the door, pushing through throngs of people talking and choosing seats as they awaited the king and his procession.</p><p>When the doors at last surged open, Victoria stood on the side of the threshold. She was close enough to see the details of the queen\u2019s heavily beaded robe as she put one foot forward, onto the holy ground.</p><p>And then stopped, as though struck.</p><p>Shock and surprise flashed over her face, and she tried again . . . but the pain must have been too much, for she could move no further. Her face twisted in a horrible grimace, and her porcine eyes squinted in pain.</p><p>Max was right again. Of course.</p><p>Victoria eased forward, facing the queen, for everyone else had fallen away and was watching in horror and shock. Keeping her stake hidden in the folds of her skirt, Victoria said in a low voice, \u201cYou cannot enter here, Your Majesty.\u201d This was not the time or place to engage openly with an undead.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Caroline looked at her, and Victoria knew at once what was happening. At this close proximity, she could see the way the queen\u2019s skin sagged, as if dripping from her skull. In fact, the entire massive person of the royal sagged, looking gray and quite unhealthy. She was dying, and Victoria knew it had to be because of the elixir. She\u2019d probably been taking it for months while in Italy. It was just as Lilith predicted.</p><p>Would her other prediction come true?</p><p>Victoria pushed that unpleasant thought away, and remained facing the queen. As she looked at her more closely, she saw the flash of a shadow in her eyes. She\u2019d seen a glimpse of something similar in James\u2019s irises on occasion, but had thought nothing of it until now, when the same look flickered in Caroline\u2019s. The sign of an undead, noticeable only at close proximity . . . there one moment, and gone the next. A look she thought she\u2019d seen somewhere else as well. But where?</p><p>She could worry about that later; now Victoria moved slightly, showing her stake to the queen. \u201cStep back, Your Majesty, or I will be forced to use this.\u201d Again, she kept her voice low, and only for the ears of the royal.</p><p>Assassinating the queen, vampire though she was, would be difficult to explain.</p><p>Caroline focused her eyes on her. They were burning red now, and the very tips of her fangs were revealed, poking into her lower lip. But there was nothing she could do.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot enter,\u201d Victoria said again, and moved closer. Glancing at the gathering crowd, she added, \u201cThe king has decreed it.\u201d</p><p>The queen had no choice. She stepped back, her face a mask of fury and pain. There was no grace in her movements as she turned and lurched heavily down the stairs to her waiting carriage. No one dared approach her, and as the crowds watched and whispered behind cupped hands, Victoria felt Sebastian\u2019s arm slip around her waist.</p><p>He urged her off quickly before anyone could ask why and how she had managed to keep the queen from entering Westminster Abbey when five prizefighters had not been able to.</p><p>And, as it turned out, the official report published in the papers and letters described the altercation as happening outside of the abbey, on the steps, with the five men holding off the queen\u2019s procession on their own. There was never any mention of a beautiful young woman with dark hair and a stick in her hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shortly after the queen\u2019s disappearance came the news that the king was to be delayed due to a torn piece of clothing, and after that, the rest of the coronation ceremony\u2014though horribly long and boring in Victoria\u2019s opinion\u2014passed without incident.</p><p>Not until nearly three o\u2019clock did the party move from the abbey to Westminster Hall, with the newly crowned king and his twenty-seven-foot train. The train was embroidered with gold thread, and the pages (real pages, not the prizefighters) who managed the long length of fabric kept it spread wide so that all of its glory could be admired.</p><p>The king tottered a bit when he at last left the abbey; sweat streamed down his face and he looked pallid and gray. However, Victoria knew that was not due to anything other than an excessive amount of fancy clothing\u2014 including unseasonable ermine fur\u2014and an extremely long, hot day. The king of England was not a vampire.</p> <p>Nor was he dead.</p><p>But Victoria was quite certain that he, and possibly others of his trusted advisors, were in great danger.</p><p>In the hall, three hundred people ate from long tables that traversed the length of the vast, high-ceilinged space. Victoria consumed little in her attempt to move about and keep her attention honed for any unusual happening. Still, it was daylight, and the more she thought about it, the more she realized that if anything else was planned, it would happen after the sun went down.</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun goes down,\u201d said a deep voice in her ear, almost an echo of her thoughts. Victoria nearly jumped and turned to find Max behind her. He still wore that hooded expression, and refused to meet her eyes. He seemed, instead, to be fascinated by her earlobe . . . or, more likely, something beyond her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Victoria replied stiffly. \u201cLilith wasn\u2019t foolish enough to think that the queen could enter the abbey, even if Caroline herself thought she could. I don\u2019t believe for one minute that that was the extent of Lilith\u2019s plan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe king,\u201d Max continued as if she hadn\u2019t spoke, \u201cshould be leaving the hall shortly to return to Carleton House. The sun will just be setting. I suspect that will be the time we\u2019ll need to be our most vigilant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already come to that conclusion,\u201d Victoria snapped, then realized he\u2019d gone, slinking away into the crowd before she could reply. \u201cWe?\u201d she added in the direction to which he\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>She turned away and found herself face-to-face with Lady Melly, who wore a forbidding expression. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d she asked with a smile on her face and a bite to her voice. In fact, the pleasant smile necessitated that her teeth remained ground together, and the words came out rather . . . clenched. \u201cI\u2019ve hardly seen you since we sat for dinner, and you certainly didn\u2019t attend us during the procession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Mother, my slipper became soiled and I had to return home just before the procession started in order to change it. You wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to attend the coronation with soiled slippers, would you?\u201d Victoria lied blithely.</p><p>\u201cGwendolyn Starcasset has been looking all over for you,\u201d added Lady Melly in a slightly mollified voice. \u201cDo come and make your greeting to her so that she will stop prattling to me about her wedding plans. I daresay,\u201d she continued over her shoulder as she started off, towing Victoria behind her, \u201cit\u2019s as if no one has ever married an earl before. And Brodebaugh isn\u2019t all that is, but she certainly can say nothing but praise for him.\u201d</p><p>Victoria allowed her mother to drag her through the crowds to their places at the long table. To her surprise, she found Sebastian present, with Gwendolyn and Brodebaugh. He appeared to be fully enjoying his meal, and Victoria realized how hungry she was, despite the bit of food she\u2019d already had. It had been a long day, and, if she and Max were correct, it would be even longer before the night was through.</p> <p>Thus convinced to ease on her vigilance for a time, Victoria sat next to Gwen and proceeded to field questions about where she\u2019d been and what she thought of the ceremony . . . and had she seen Rockley?</p><p>Victoria could only answer in the negative, and instead turned the conversation back to her friend\u2019s favorite topic: her nuptials, which were to take place in three days.</p><p>\u201cI daresay, I\u2019ve slept nary a wink, between plans for the coronation and my wedding,\u201d Gwen said, smiling. Victoria thought her expression still looked a bit weary, and she wondered if all was well with Brodebaugh.</p><p>Or George. He and Sara were conspicuously absent.</p><p>But before she had a chance to ask Gwendolyn about any of them, she caught sight of Kritanu. He was in a balcony overlooking the diners, and he tended to stand out due to his darkly complected appearance. He seemed to be gesturing to her.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Mother,\u201d Victoria said, leaning toward Melly. \u201cI thought I saw Rockley.\u201d The excuse was guaranteedto justify her exit, and when Lady Melly\u2019s face snapped toward the direction Victoria indicated, her daughter took the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Kritanu met Victoria and said, \u201cThe king is readying to leave.\u201d She glanced toward the table where George IV sat, and her companion continued, \u201cI heard the order given moments ago. I\u2019ve managed to obtain a position as footman to one of the coaches in the procession.\u201d</p><p>Victoria nodded. \u201cBe safe,\u201d she told him. \u201cDo you know where Max is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be there.\u201d Kritanu disappeared in the crowd of people, leaving Victoria to try to catch Sebastian\u2019s attention.</p><p>Outside of Westminster Hall, the sun had dipped to the edge of the horizon. As the king was climbing into his coach, the news came floating back to the bystanders: two overturned carriages had created a great accident, blocking the route by which the king usually drove to Carleton House.</p><p>He would have to take a different course, through the slums of Westminster.</p><p>Victoria caught Sebastian\u2019s eye and nodded. This had to be it.</p><p>With Barth\u2019s assistance, they obtained saddled horses and started off in the direction the king would be traveling, able to move faster and more easily than a coach and procession.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there first and scout out the area,\u201d Victoria said to Kritanu as they rode past him and down a smaller side street so as to escape notice from the crowds. The sight of a lady riding astride\u2014thanks to her split skirt\u2014 would cause just as much attention as the king\u2019s cortege; possibly more.</p><p>Victoria hadn\u2019t ridden astride in a saddle for years, and doing so immediately reminded her of Phillip. The summershe\u2019d first met him, long before either were old enough to be thinking of marriage or courting, he\u2019d been riding haphazardly through the meadows between their families\u2019 adjoining estates. She\u2019d met him when he fell from the horse and he received a scolding from her . . . and then, later, he promised to take her riding.</p><p>At any rate, Victoria was a confident enough horse-woman to make her way through the streets, although Sebastian was far ahead of her. Since the attention of those who were interested in such things was on the king\u2019s path, the side streets were deserted of bystanders and the riders were able to move swiftly and attract little attention.</p><p>But when they arrived in the dirtiest, most dangerous part of Westminster, where the crowds had already formed in anticipation of their sovereign\u2019s unprecedented trip down their streets, Victoria felt nothing out of place. No sign of undead, no prickling of the neck . . . nothing.</p><p>She and Sebastian traversed the streets, too high in their saddles for pickpockets, and not nearly interesting enough for other thieves in light of the coming procession. They heard shouts in the distance, behind them, heralding the approach of the royal cortege.</p><p>Just then, the sound of pounding horse hooves drew Victoria\u2019s attention. She turned, and around the corner flew Max, barreling toward them on a large mount.</p><p>\u201cThe bridge!\u201d he shouted, galloping past them.</p><p>Of course! The Thurgood Bridge, which spanned one of the canals. Old and dangerous, and in a particularly dark section at the edge of Westminster, the bridge stood near the end of the king\u2019s route. It would be the perfect place for a royal catastrophe.</p><p>Victoria slammed her heels into her mount and raced off after Max, Sebastian thundering behind.</p><p>When they reached the bridge, the back of her neck iced over almost immediately. Dark shapes filtered beneath the rickety structure, which wheezed and creaked even when no one crossed on it. Tiny red orbs glowed in the night, mostly beneath the edges of the bridge.</p><p>It was a narrow span, just wide enough for a single vehicle. Built over a canal barely two wagon lengths wide, it was made of wooden trestles that created a web of dark beams above and below the bridge. The underpinnings cleared the canal\u2019s flowing water by only a few feet. Brick buildings in various stages of disrepair staggered near the bridge and along the canal, looming like awkward shadows. They seemed to be converging on the narrow crossing, keeping it dark and close.</p><p>Max was already off his horse, and Victoria tore off the apronlike coverings to her skirt as Sebastian roared up and leaped off his own mount.</p><p>The vampires were taken by surprise by the sudden onslaught of stake-bearing Venators. Victoria clambered down the mucky slope at the side of the canal, feeling cold mud ooze into her slippers as she came face-to-face with an undead.</p><p>She kicked and caught the vampire in the chest, sending him falling back onto two others that had been climbing up the bank behind him. As they struggled to right themselves, she turned to another undead that had leaped down from the bridge. Her stake found its mark, and the female poofed into dust.</p><p>\u201cUnder the bridge,\u201d she heard Sebastian shout, and turned to see him and Max disappear into the darkness under the span.</p><p>In the melee that followed, Victoria was barely aware of the hordes of undead; she focused only on staking and stabbing as she worked her way along the mucky bank toward the inky shadows under the bridge. Once she found her way there, even in the dark she could see what was intended. The undead were clambering up and around the trestles under the bridge, ready to swarm the rickety structure when the carriage crossed over. The span\u2019s weakness would allow for the weight of only one vehicle at a time, leaving the king\u2019s coach to cross without its guards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Victoria could only guess at the vampires\u2019 plan, but when she saw a low, flat shape in the shadows below, thanks to her improved night vision, she recognized it as a boat. Then it made sense: when the carriage was unprotected on the bridge, the undead would take that opportunity to seize the king and make off with him via the water below, taking him, no doubt, to Lilith, where he would be killed.</p><p>Hanging by one arm over a rough wooden beam, she kicked out at a vampire, propelling herself toward another in time to stake him. He exploded in a satisfying puff of ash, and Victoria was able to swing her feet and pull herself up onto one of the trestles.</p><p>She turned in time to see Max struggling with a vampire across the underside of the bridge. He was crouched on a beam, holding onto a rafter above him while battling a red-eyed undead with one free hand, and his powerful legs. As Victoria watched, a second vampire landed behind Max, effectively trapping him between the two undead.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, but swung herself toward the altercation just as Max knocked the first vampire off the trestle. The undead splashed into the canal below, and was carried away by the sluggish water.</p><p>Max turned in time to see Victoria slam her stake into the second vampire, leaving her panting on the shaft next to him. He whirled on her furiously, his dark face close to hers. \u201cI don\u2019t need your bloody help.\u201d Then he leaped away to knock another undead from the bridge, putting distance between him and Victoria.</p><p>The sounds of the approaching procession reached Victoria\u2019s ears, which were ringing from battle and from Max\u2019s unpleasant words. She stared after him, fury pounding in her ears and her knees shaking\u2014not with fear, but with pure anger.</p><p>Suddenly, something shoved her from behind, and she lost her grip on the wooden trestle. The next thing she knew, she was tumbling through the air, and landed with a splash in the water below.</p><p>Twenty-two</p> <p>Wherein a Taut String Snaps at Last</p><p>When Victoria broke through the surface, she realized the gentle current had carried her away from the bridge. Her clothing was heavy and clinging, and though the water\u2019s temperature wasn\u2019t a shock, it was muddy and smelled unpleasant.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a strong swimmer, but the summers she\u2019d spent wading and splashing in the small lake at Prewitt Shore came back to her, and she was able to keep afloat and paddle awkwardly toward the edge.</p><p>She\u2019d hardly gone far downstream, however, when her foot struck the mucky bottom of the canal near its bank. One of her slippers was gone, and the other one sank into the sludge. Her stake had disappeared when she fell, but she half swam, half slogged her way to the shore, knowing that she had others hidden. When she clambered to the top of the sloping bank, her split-skirted attire was plastered to her body, making movement awkward and slow.</p><p>By the time she got back on land, and rushed as quickly as her sodden clothing and bare foot would allow, the king\u2019s cortege had reached the bridge. Crowds of people surged toward the carriage, and she could hear frantic shouts from the center of the procession.</p><p>\u201cKeep close! Keep close, by God!\u201d</p> <p>She recognized the king\u2019s voice ordering his guards. He was known to be leery of large crowds, especially ones that verged on moblike behavior, for he didn\u2019t want a repeat of the kinds of horror toward royalty that occurred during the French Revolution. She couldn\u2019t blame him in this case, for the entire environment of close, looming buildings shadowing a narrow bridge, and the thronging crowds, would have made anyone nervous\u2014 especially someone like herself, who knew there were more than mortals to be leery of.</p><p>Victoria hurried toward the crowd, stones and sharp-edged bricks cutting into her foot. She saw that the king\u2019s carriage was broaching the bridge, ready to cross. The mob was pushed away and the coach started over the span. Even from her vantage point, Victoria could hear the creaks and groans of the wooden trestles as the royal vehicle rumbled across.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t see any gleam of red eyes, either above or below the bridge. The back of her neck was no longer chilled, and despite the fact that she was soaking, nor was the rest of her body. It was a warm night, and the sludgy, rank mud had already begun to dry on her skin.</p><p>About the time the carriage reached the other side of the bridge, Victoria felt a presence behind her, and heard the long, deep breaths of someone who\u2019d been working hard. She turned to see a dripping Max standing there, also watching the coach traverse the canal.</p><p>\u201cSafe,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI can swim,\u201d she said tartly. \u201cEven in a gown. I didn\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was speaking of the king, Victoria. He\u2019s safe. We can go home now.\u201d</p><p>Pressing her lips together in annoyance, she looked at the bridge. Now that the king had crossed, the crowd was beginning to disperse. The threat did appear to be over, for the remainder of the route to Carleton House was through safer, more well-lit areas. And it wasn\u2019t more than a short ride.</p> <p>Then she recognized a familiar silhouette as he hurried toward her. He was not wet.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, Victoria?\u201d asked Sebastian as he approached. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. The ones we didn\u2019t get have run off.\u201d He looked at Max. \u201cGet a bit wet, Pesaro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelt good,\u201d Max replied. Then, with a curt nod, he walked away.</p><p>Victoria turned to Sebastian, fully conscious of the smell emanating from her person and the press of stones against her bare foot. \u201cI have to return the horse Barth borrowed for me.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cWill you bite my head off if I suggest that you go home with Barth in the carriage so you can divest yourself of those wet clothes? The horses are Brodebaugh\u2019s; Kritanu and I will take them back. Much as I\u2019d like to be there to assist you with your toilette . . .\u201d His head tipped to the side, blocking out the moon behind him. It had waxed into a new quarter in the last week, and it shone bright and bold, casting a silver gilt over his curls. \u201c . . . I think I shall pass on the opportunity this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do smell rather rank,\u201d Victoria agreed. \u201cI daresay the canal water isn\u2019t much cleaner than that of the sewers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI daresay you are right.\u201d They both chuckled, and Sebastian moved toward her for a kiss. Then he thought better of it and straightened. A wry smile ticked at the corner of his mouth. \u201cGood night, then, Victoria,\u201d he said, something like regret tingeing his voice.</p><p>She felt him watching her as she walked away.</p><p>The dried sludge from the canal made Victoria\u2019s skin itch, and had saturated her hair, which had fallen in smelly, dripping strands about her shoulders. The special frock with the split skirt would have to be burned, and her remaining slipper was so stained that it no longer showed a hint of pink.</p><p>By the time Verbena had finished bathing her mistress and washing the stench from her thick mass of hair, it was past midnight. She toweled the hip-length curls as dry as possible, then coiled them into a loose, sagging knot at the back of her neck so that it would be able to dry without tangling too much. Victoria dressed, not in a night rail, but in the loose trousers and tunic she wore when training, along with soft slipperlike shoes. She had a suspicion that Sebastian might come to the house with Kritanu after they brought the horses back, and she thought it might be best if she weren\u2019t in her bedchamber if and when they did.</p><p>After dismissing her yawning maid for the night, Victoria went down to return the kadhara knife to the cabinet in the kalari training room. She was surprised to find it lit by a lamp that cast a golden glow over the area, and thought she might find Wayren within. But it was Max.</p><p>He was standing at one of the cupboards, apparently also returning a weapon to its rightful place. At first he didn\u2019t hear her enter, and she noticed that he was garbed in clean clothes similar to her own\u2014trousers and a tunic in undyed linen, bare of foot, his dark hair loose and making damp marks on the back of his shirt.</p><p>Victoria felt short of breath, and realized that her stomach was coiling and loosening with nauseating speed. She stepped into the room, letting the door close silently behind her.</p><p>Max turned. She saw his attention flicker past her. \u201cWhere is Vioget? And Wayren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you cannot deign to speak to me if no one else is present?\u201d Victoria countered, stepping into the room. For some reason, she felt as though she was in control . . . despite the fact that his face still bore that flat, empty expression.</p><p>But the rest of him . . . Her mouth went dry and, suddenly, her heart was thumping so hard she was certain it was audible. The sleeves of his hip-length tunic were rolled halfway up his arms, showing an expanse of swarthy skin and muscle that would never be revealed in polite dress. And the loose neck of the shirt made a vee below the hollow of his throat, exposing the same dark hair that grew on his legs and scattered over the tops of his long, elegant feet. He was still wearing the leather thong and silver cross she\u2019d noticed around his ankle before, but no other adornment. Except, perhaps, a vis bulla\u2014her vis bulla\u2014beneath the shirt. Her lungs tightened.</p><p>\u201cI was just leaving.\u201d He started toward the door, and she remained in place. He\u2019d have to brush past her to go.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you.\u201d Anger darkened his eyes and for a moment she was almost afraid of his expression. It was so cold . . . she\u2019d never seen such blatant loathing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine, for you need say nothing. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>He exploded then. \u201cI don\u2019t give a bloody damn what you want, Victoria. I want nothing to do with you. Stay away from me until I leave. Which won\u2019t be soon enough.\u201d Max stalked toward the door, passing her in a swish that stirred the air like a miniature cyclone.</p><p>But Victoria was angry now as well. She lashed out and grabbed a muscled arm, yanking him back before he could touch the door handle.</p><p>He whipped from her grip, and now they were face-to-face. His eyes blazed and his mouth compressed with fury. \u201cLeave it, Victoria. You\u2019ve done enough.\u201d</p><p>She closed her fingers around his wrist. She was strong enough to hold him, and he knew it. \u201cMax, let me explain\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is no explanation for what you did.\u201d He was facing her now, and he grabbed her shoulders so hard she knew his fingertips would leave little black bruises above her collarbones. \u201cYou had no right to imprison me. No bloody right.\u201d He was nearly shaking her, and she raised her arms between them to break his hold, shoving his hands away.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid for you\u2014\u201d She grabbed at him once more as he turned, and this time when he whirled, she saw that he was no longer holding back. His face was black with fury, and his teeth were bared in a nasty smile.</p><p>\u201cAfraid. For me.\u201d He slashed down and broke her hold on his wrist, sending a numbing shock along her arm. \u201cPoor helpless Max. You had to lock me in a goddamn room while you and Vioget and Kritanu went out to fight vampires? Damn you, Victoria. I\u2019ll never forgive you for that.\u201d</p> <p>She shoved at him, hard enough to send him stumbling backward. \u201cListen to me, you bloody lout.\u201d</p><p>He caught himself and lunged back up at her. \u201cYou want to fight, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can best you, Max. Then you\u2019ll have to listen to me, instead of running away from it\u2014as you always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d His smile returned, hard and unfriendly. His eyes glinted with challenge.</p><p>She kicked out suddenly, and he blocked her thrust with an angle of his powerful thigh, then responded with a shove that knocked her back two steps. Furious that he\u2019d taken her by surprise, she twisted around and grabbed his arm, slipping it over her as she neatly flipped him to the thick mat on the ground. He yanked her leg, pulling her off balance so that she was forced into a somersault that loosened her knot of hair.</p> <p>Then he was up, breathing easily, as though he\u2019d just stood from a chair, dark hair loose, brushing his shoulders and falling in his eyes. He crouched, ready for her, and she matched his stance as they circled in the room. It wouldn\u2019t be a battle of pure strength, but one of timing and the unexpected. In that, they were evenly matched.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want anything to happen to you, you blasted fool,\u201d she said, lunging.</p><p>He sidestepped and kicked around from behind to trip her. She caught herself and staggered backward, pulling him with her. Max tumbled and rolled neatly to his feet, turning once again to face her. \u201cYou bloody castrated me, Victoria. You did me no favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilith wants you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she wants you, damn you. Even more than she wants me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t drug you. And lock you up. For two days.\u201d He blocked her blow with his arm, using the momentum to twist her around.</p><p>Victoria spun back to face him. \u201cNo, you simply paid Sebastian to kidnap me last fall.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Max had asked Sebastian to abduct Victoria to keep her from questioning his seeming loyalty to the Tutela, and thus ruining his plans to get close to Nedas and his demonic obelisk, had continued to be a bone of contention between them. That had also been the first time she and Sebastian became lovers, in a carriage, of course\u2014a fact about which Max never hesitated to remind her.</p><p>She balled up her hands into fists that, small though they might appear, held inhuman strength. \u201cTo keep me safe,\u201d she said, punctuating her words with spars that slapped violently against his raised palms as he blocked her, \u201cas you claimed.\u201d She whirled around suddenly with a solid kick toward his abdomen, which connected with his side as he lunged out of the way. \u201cHow dare you claim injury when you did nothing less to me.\u201d</p><p>Max laughed coldly, ducking her blows and responding with one of his own that spun the air by her ear. \u201cYou talk as though it was some great tragedy,\u201d he said, backing up into a crouch again, \u201cthat you ended up in a carriage with him. The way I heard it,\u201d he said, taking a swipe at her, \u201cit was no hardship for you after all.\u201d</p><p>She kicked out, clipping the edge of his jaw. She heard his teeth snap shut and she tossed him a tight grin. \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t act the coward and pay someone else to do my dirty work.\u201d She leaped at him; he blocked her lunge and caught her by the arm. Ducking under her, he flipped her over as she\u2019d done to him moments before.</p><p>She flew through the air and landed on her back, the breath knocked out of her for the moment before she sprang to her feet, brushing a long strand of hair from her face. He was already halfway to the door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she demanded, throwing herself toward him. Her leap knocked him to the floor, and they tumbled there in a tangle of limbs. She landed on top of him, but he gave a great twist and she flipped onto her back with a loud smack, pulling him with her. \u201cCoward!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the hell away from you,\u201d he said, rearing over her. His head blocked the lamp and left him half-shadowed. \u201cBecause if I don\u2019t, God help me, I\u2019ll be doing this.\u201d And his face swooped down toward her, fingers once again digging into the soft spots on her shoulders.</p><p>It was a furious, ferocious kiss; a desperate smashing and grinding of mouths pressing against teeth, a slip-sliding of lips, the deep, long swipe of tongue . . . and then more and more, so that she became completely breathless . . . but unwilling to stop to breathe. Victoria\u2019s fingers grasped the sides of his face as if to keep him there, even to pull him closer, feeling the throb of veins in his temples, and the slight dampness of his warm skin, the rough stubble under her palms.</p><p>His hair was as silky and heavy as it looked, and she curled her fingers up onto his skull, the tendrils wrapping around her hands as she arched beneath him, feeling the pull of her hair trapped beneath his hands, pressing her belly up into his, curling one of her ankles around his hips to pull him down closer. Their legs shifted and moved, trousers crumpled, rough hair scraped against warm flesh, toes and heels thumped against each other and the mat as they rolled and continued their battle in the most elemental way of man and woman.</p><p>Victoria tore at his tunic, pulling it up, slipping her hands under the linen to feel the slabs of muscle on his back. Warm, they shifted and rippled beneath her fingers as he lifted onto his elbows and dipped to move his face along her jaw and to the hot, sensitive part of her neck. She turned her face away, eyes closed, as he kissed, devouring her skin with his firm mouth, sending exploding sensations through her as she tried to keep from moaning like a cat in heat.</p><p>Then suddenly, he stilled, as if caught. Poised over her, his face against the side of her neck, buried in her curls, his breath moist on her skin. She felt the brush of his lashes, the sift of his hair over her cheek, the thump of his heart reverberating in his body, so close to hers . . . but his lips had lifted. His rough breathing mingled with hers in the silence.</p><p>She tightened her hands on his body beneath the linen shirt, folding her lips together, ready to speak his name.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said sharply, his mouth moving against her neck. \u201cDon\u2019t . . . say . . . anything.\u201d</p><p>Tension radiated; she felt it trembling beneath her fingers on the smooth skin over his ribs, in the deep, long breath he took, expanding under her touch.</p><p>She felt it when he gathered up, ready to pull away, and she tightened her fingers on him.</p><p>And then, after another long moment, as though released, excused, sanctioned . . . something . . . he moved again with a little shudder, a release of stilled breath. He brushed her hair away, and kissed her neck, gently now, languidly, with the same skillful lips that had done so three months ago. The tension eased beneath her fingers and, when he moved again, it was to find her mouth once more with his.</p><p>Her lips were swollen and pounding from the previous onslaught, but he took his time here. It wasn\u2019t tender, the way he kissed her now, nor desperate and angry, as before,but . . . long and slow and thorough, slick and deep, drawing so much from her that she moaned quietly behind it all.</p><p>There was no mistaking his desire for her; as their bodies arched and moved, the loose fabric left little unsaid between them. She pulled at his shirt, and he lifted away long enough for her to yank it over his head. Bare skin, at last. As he bent back to kiss her again, she saw the expression in those dark, oft unreadable eyes: burning and intense.</p><p>There was no mistaking what shone in them now.</p><p>She felt warm and heady when he lifted again, and before she could protest, or worry that he meant to leave, he picked her up, settling her against his bare chest, and brought her to the pile of cushions in the corner. Her hands smoothed over the square of his shoulders, down over the dark hair and muscle, and to the silver cross that hung from one areola.</p><p>He stilled when she touched the vis bulla, almost as if he waited for her response. The last time she\u2019d seen it, Nedas had ordered it to be torn from her skin. She could only imagine how Max had retrieved it from the vampire. When she brushed her fingers over the silver, her amulet . . . the one forged specially for her . . . she felt a leap of power sizzle through her. A clean, familiar rush.</p><p>She flattened her hand against him, the tiny, ornate cross pressing into her palm, and remembered doing the very same thing last autumn after having been disarmed. Max had forced her hand there, under his shirt, grasping her wrist with impossibly strong fingers, risking his life as he forced her to take power from his vis bulla.</p><p>It was either her, or you.</p><p>That was what he\u2019d said when she\u2019d demanded to know why he\u2019d slain Aunt Eustacia. She\u2019d been filled with hatred and the same loathing for him she\u2019d seen in his eyes earlier tonight, directed at her. At that time, he hadn\u2019t told her the other reasons\u2014that he\u2019d been ordered to by Eustacia herself, that it was the only way to save them all from Nedas\u2019s power, that he\u2019d had no choice\u2014 for if he didn\u2019t slay her, Eustacia would have died anyway. And Victoria too.</p><p>It was either her, or you.</p><p>How had it taken her so long to realize?</p><p>Unwilling to wait any longer, to give him any chance to walk away as he\u2019d done after that kiss . . . that first kiss against the stone wall . . . she pulled away and stripped off her own tunic, and then the light chemise she wore beneath it, letting her damp hair fall over her shoulders and back. Max wasted no time; his dark hands were on her immediately, large and capable over her slender torso. They pressed her back into the mound of cushions, then smoothed down below her breasts over the gentle swell of her belly. To the two silver crosses there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He fingered them gently above the waistband of her trousers, shifting the vis bulla that had been his against that of Aunt Eustacia, then releasing them back into the hollow of her navel. Still silent, but for the quiet rasp of breath, he spread his hands wide to cover her belly, curling long fingers around her hips and sliding them gently up her sensitive skin to cup one hand under each breast.</p><p>His touch raised little bumps on her flesh and sent tingles through her limbs, curling into the center of her belly. She arched up into his palms, her hands back on his shoulders, her hair tangling under and around them, as he bent down to her. Her breasts were tight, her nipples gathered into little round peaks, and when his mouth closed over one of them, she sighed. Closed her eyes.</p><p>Sharp pleasure-pain arched down from where he sucked and teased, coiling in her belly, then shooting lower between her legs. Victoria felt the gentle burn, the gathering of desire there, and when one long-fingered hand moved down beneath the band of her trousers, she gave a soft sigh of pleasure. He found what he was looking for, and slipped in and around languidly until she had lost all shame and was moaning beneath him, pressing closer, demanding what they both wanted.</p> <p>After that, there was no more waiting, no more teasing. Trousers were ripped away, and his long, strong body covered her equally bare, ready one. She wrapped her legs around him as he settled against her, and they both gasped when he moved that first time. The fullness, the long, deep stroke made her mouth dry again, her eyes flutter closed, her fingers close over his shoulders, nails digging deep.</p><p>He lifted away just as slowly, then back again, and again, and more quickly and desperately, over and over, long and filling and deep . . . and suddenly the build exploded, leaving her shuddering and gasping and arching up again in a wave of pleasure and sunlight and stars. He groaned deep in his chest, and she felt him tense and tremble against her with one last, sharp movement.</p><p>He sagged over her, his face down, eyes closed, dark lashes and brows only a breath away from hers. One hand rested on the cushion next to her shoulder, the other cupped into the curve of her neck and shoulder, fingers curled around her neck . . . as though he had to hold on to her.</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>Wherein Our Friends Are Horrified by Multiple Locks of Hair</p> <p>Christ Almighty, what a bloody weak fool, was Max\u2019s first thought. The second was, absurdly, Where the hell is Vioget?</p><p>Yet he had to touch her hair again. So dark and heavy, it was a wonder Victoria could hold her head up when it was piled on top. It spread over the pillows and coverlet of his bed, curling down over and between their bodies.</p><p>Good God . . . in his room?</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t pretend not to remember how they\u2019d come to be here, how, in the back of his lust-fogged mind, he\u2019d decided to carry her to the bed in the small chamber reserved for servants. Not to hers. Not to the one she\u2019d shared with Vioget.</p><p>And the rest of the night . . . for once in his bloody life, he\u2019d not listened to conscience. In for a penny, in for a pound had been one vague thought as he went to her again. And again.</p><p>Now, early morning sun filtered through the window, here in the servants\u2019 quarters on the upper floor where he\u2019d cloistered himself for the last weeks. It brought reality, regret . . . uneasiness. And it cast enough light for him to see the curve of her ivory shoulder, the peek of a pink nipple, the rise and swell of her hip next to him. The glint of his vis bulla at her belly. Full red lips, swollen and crinkled in the aftermath of a passionate night.</p> <p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Bloody damned hell.</p><p>He eased away from her, cold and furious.</p><p>She opened her eyes. Surprise, pleasure . . . and then her lashes swept down to hide the flush that colored her cheeks. Devil take it, had she seen the bald fear in his eyes?</p><p>\u201cI trust you\u2019re still drinking the potion from Eustacia,\u201d he said calmly. His fingers didn\u2019t want to release the thick curl they rubbed between their pads.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d She sat up and he looked. Christ, how could he not? All that dark hair fell forward and around, obscuring the details . . . but he knew every rise and fall of them. \u201cOh, yes, I forgot. You know everything. Yes, I\u2019m still drinking the potion to keep me from conceiving. But I had already decided to stop taking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it a wise decision. You are Illa Gardella, the last of the direct line.\u201d He drew subtly away, released the lock of hair. \u201cAnd I think it best if we keep this . . . to ourselves.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him, her brown-green eyes all too shrewd. It was too blasted hard to hide anything from them. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean there\u2019s no bloody need to tell Vioget. Or anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax, you\u2019re being obtuse. You can\u2019t think I\u2019d . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off, understanding dawning. Thank God she was smart, and caught on quickly. It would be much easier if he didn\u2019t have to explain. \u201cThis is like the time you kissed me, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re going to walk away and pretend nothing happened. Pretend I goaded you into it.\u201d</p><p>She was too bloody damned smart. Dammit. \u201cVictoria, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>And forever after, he wasn\u2019t certain whether the knock on the door was a godsend or misfortune.</p><p>Regardless, the interruption catapulted their attention far from the matter at hand. A wiry orange puff of hair preceded the maid\u2019s eye peering around the corner. She didn\u2019t appear surprised to see Victoria there; in fact, Max was struck by the combination of satisfaction warring with trepidation on her face.</p><p>\u201cVerbena? What is it?\u201d Victoria must have sensed it too, for her voice was sharp. Or maybe the hardness was for him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m begging yer pard\u2019n, my lady, but I foun\u2019 this on the front stoop. I don\u2019 know when it came, as there was no one to answer the door . . . Charley\u2019s day off, y\u2019know . . . an\u2019 so I foun\u2019 it when I went out to see . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she offered a small paper packet around the corner of the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Kritanu?\u201d Victoria mused, reaching for the envelope. Of course she wouldn\u2019t be uncomfortable being undressed in front of her maid . . . but here, in his bed? Perhaps this circumstance was more common than he thought. The maid seemed to have known where to find them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not \u2019ere.\u201d Verbena shrugged, spreading her hands. \u201cOl\u2019ver said he didn\u2019t return last night.\u201d And Wayren was . . . well, Wayren. She was likely closed up wherever she chose to be, studying an old manuscript or scroll. She appeared when she needed to. Obviously, Brim and Michalas hadn\u2019t yet arrived.</p><p>Victoria snatched the packet from her maid. It was thick, tied with a red ribbon and sealed by a familiar wax blob. And . . . \u201cChrist,\u201d he said at the same time as she drew in her breath.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blood.\u201d Victoria tore off the ribbon and flipped the seal open. When she saw what was inside, she drew in her breath sharply.</p><p>Pressed into the folds of the stiff paper was a thick lock of shiny jet-black hair. And beneath it, a matching lock of tawny gold curl. Both were sticky with blood.</p><p>The folded piece of paper accompanying them was unmarked but for an ugly brownish streak. It was stamped with the seal of the Earl of Brodebaugh.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>The Stakes Are Raised</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t plan to go haring off\u2014\u201d Max began in that tone of his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to go haring off,\u201d Victoria replied sharply. All of the pleasure and contentment with which she\u2019d awakened had evaporated. Now she was cold and angry . . . but most of all frightened.</p><p>She looked at Max, who\u2019d moved away from her and was already dressing, building the wall back up, brick by solid brick. Pressing her lips together, she looked away from his tall, muscular body. Later. She\u2019d deal with him, with this\u2014whatever this was\u2014later. But for now . . .</p><p>\u201cI have no plans to go haring off, Max,\u201d she said in a calmer voice. \u201cThat\u2019s what they want me to do, and that\u2019s what put me in Beauregard\u2019s control three months ago. He offered an exchange as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut his copper armband was the deciding factor in your downfall,\u201d he said in an ironic voice.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had the copper armband to weaken me if I hadn\u2019t brought it along. I left the Consilium withoutrealizing, haring off as you would say . . . but,\u201d she said, frustration coloring her voice, and grief, for the reminder that Zavier\u2019s life had been the casualty that time\u2014quite possibly along with her own soul. She shivered. \u201cWhat are they doing to Kritanu and Sebastian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should think it\u2019s quite clear: holding them for ransom, so to speak. The only thing I\u2019m not certain of is who it is they want to lure there. And,\u201d he added, picking up a shirt, \u201cI use the term \u2018they\u2019 simply because I cannot believe Brodebaugh is acting alone. Or if he is even willingly involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere we agree.\u201d Victoria stood from the bed, neglecting to cover herself, and couldn\u2019t help a bit of smugness when he had to tear his gaze away, his jaw clamping suddenly shut. He wasn\u2019t a bad sight himself, standing there in only untied trousers that settled at his hips. \u201cIt must be your scorned lover Sara behind all of this, and George too.\u201d</p><p>Max stopped suddenly and looked at her. \u201cVictoria, Sara and I were never lovers . . . in the true sense of the word.\u201d He pitched the bundle of cloth at her. \u201cYou\u2019re cold. Put this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not cold. And in regards to Sara\u2014you made a good case for the contrary,\u201d she retorted, catching the shirt. Did that mean he hadn\u2019t loved Sara, or that he\u2019d never been intimate with her? \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. But I knew you wanted to know. And . . . you should.\u201d He pulled out another shirt and shook it out, preparing to put it on. Then he stopped. \u201cVictoria.\u201d</p><p>She had started to pull on his shirt, ready now to return to her own room and dress, but his voice halted her. His hand was on the silver cross that pierced his skin. \u201cThis is yours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her fingers touched the one at her navel that had belonged to him; she was able to identify the difference between the two by feel. \u201cAnd this is yours.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, he gave a little twist, then a pull, and slipped the dainty vis bulla from his skin. \u201cWear it now. It might help.\u201d</p><p>Her attention flashed to him. Had Wayren told him about the internal battle for her soul? Or was this merely a way to rid himself of any attachment to her and the Venators? \u201cOnly if you wear yours again.\u201d She looked up. \u201cLilith is aware of our . . . exchange. She was not pleased.\u201d</p><p>His mouth settled into a thin line again, drawing deep grooves. \u201cShall I help you?\u201d he said when he saw that she fumbled with the little silver hoop. His fingers were quick and skillful, warm on her bare skin\u2014but they were impersonal, and didn\u2019t linger\u2014as he removed the simple cross. Then he pulled taut the little lip of skin at the top of her navel and slipped her own vis bulla into place.</p> <p>It was an oddly intimate gesture\u2014odd considering what had passed between them last night. Victoria felt a twinge of remembrance and her stomach did the silly little flip it tended to do when she was surprised . . . or discomfited. But then the feeling ebbed, and she realized that having her own vis bulla back in place was . . . cleaner. More pure and solid.</p><p>Max moved away, holding his vis, hesitant. Then, with ease she\u2019d not shown, he replaced it in his areola and breathed deeply. Perhaps he wondered if his Venator powers would be restored once he wore his own amulet. He turned back to the neat table on which his personal items were gathered, and Victoria watched as he slipped the heavy silver ring onto the middle finger of his left hand. As if girding himself for battle.</p><p>\u201cTell me how the ring will protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you\u2019ve already figured it out, but . . . there is a catch which, when moved correctly, opens to reveal a sharp blade dripping with venom. A simple prick will do the trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you . . . or to Lilith?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo me. Now, why are you still here? Should we not be planning how to save your lover?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d suspected it . . . but now she knew for certain. Max was withdrawing again. He meant to foist her upon Sebastian again so that he could walk away. And use that bloody silver ring whenever he chose.</p><p>What about me?</p><p>She bit her tongue, holding back the questions, the demands, the comparisons. After all, hadn\u2019t he despised Sebastian for turning his back on the Venators? There would be time for that later, time to force him into a conversation he wished to avoid. She wasn\u2019t about to let anything happen to Sebastian and Kritanu.</p><p>The rest of Max\u2019s comment brought to mind something he\u2019d said earlier. \u201cWhat do you mean, you aren\u2019t certain who they are trying to lure? It\u2019s you, of course. Lilith wants you back and Sara nearly delivered you to her. Two in exchange for one. Which is why there can be no \u2018we\u2019 about this.\u201d</p><p>Max raised a brow. \u201cIndeed? I happen to disagree. I believe Lilith wants you more than she does me. After all, you\u2019re still a threat to her, unlike me\u2014as you\u2019ve made quite clear so recently. And you\u2019ve escaped her for a second time, only days ago. I can only imagine how much ash exploded after that\u2014and after last night, when we foiled her plans to kidnap the king. And if she believesyou are some sort of rival for my . . . affections . . .\u201d His expression and tone indicated how absurd that thought was.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Is this some kind of twisted way for you to try and take control?\u201d She realized she was still standing there with the shirt in front of her. She yanked it over her head. It smelled of him. Her knees weakened.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gestured to the packet, which lay on the mussed bed, open to show the glint of two shades of hair. \u201cApparently you didn\u2019t notice that the message was unaddressed. It\u2019s not clear for whom it was intended.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, then closed it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Max. You\u2019re not as well equipped to face her as . . . as you used to be.\u201d</p><p>If she expected anger from him at her statement, she was disappointed. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing you\u2019re forgetting.\u201d His lips stretched in a humorless smile. \u201cNo one would ever think that I\u2019d be moved to save Vioget\u2019s life. It\u2019s a game. And you\u2019re meant to be the prize.\u201d</p><p>Victoria would have laughed if the situation hadn\u2019t been so horrible. In fact, she did give a snort of disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s just it, Max. You would be moved to save his life. The life of anyone, even someone you hate\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven someone for whom you have a great amount of antipathy. Because it\u2019s the noble thing to do,\u201d she added sharply, remembering her own poor choices. Leaving Bemis Goodwin and his companion to die. Drugging Max. Hating Gwen for her happiness. \u201cEver the hero, aren\u2019t you, Max? Always selfless. Do you never do anything just for you?\u201d</p><p>She realized suddenly that the red haze was nudging the frame of her vision. Her heart was racing, and she felt a surge of ugly anger bubbling inside her. Automatically, she took a deep breath, touched her vis bullae, and shook her head as if to clear it. Yet that nobility, that steadiness, was what she loved most about Max. The strong, impassable line drawn between right and wrong, black and white.</p> <p>Loved.</p><p>Her knees trembled anew.</p><p>It was the reason she\u2019d been able to forgive him for Aunt Eustacia\u2019s death. The reason she\u2019d never stopped trusting him. Had known he wouldn\u2019t forsake the Venators, even once stripped of his own abilities.</p><p>In her own mind, that stark black-and-white line had always leaked a bit into charcoal, or to fog . . . but that had recently begun to bloom into a wide stretch of gray. . . . Was that why he retreated from her? Because she wasn\u2019t as good?</p><p>By now the rosiness had faded, her pulse had slowed. The surge of malevolence had gone. Was it getting easier to fight it back? Or was it her imagination, wishing and hoping?</p><p>It also hadn\u2019t escaped her that last night, when she and Max were fighting . . . that vulgar evil hadn\u2019t attempted to take her over. That reddish haze and surge of wickedness hadn\u2019t teased and fought to control her. Why?</p><p>Was it because she hadn\u2019t been fighting for self-preservation, as she had other times? Her self hadn\u2019t been in jeopardy; she\u2019d not been battling for her life? She\u2019d not needed to be selfish to win.</p><p>The seed of everything evil begins with self.</p><p>When she felt steady, Victoria looked up and saw that Max was watching her. His attention scored her, as though trying to decipher what it was that had sent her off into the whirlwind of her mind.</p><p>Before he could speak, there was another knock at the door.</p><p>It was Verbena again, and she held a small white box.</p><p>A red ribbon tied it closed, and when Victoria accepted the container, an awful feeling of foreboding rushed through her. Max took one look at the brownish streaks on the outside and swore. It bore the same seal of Brodebaugh.</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t get it open fast enough, and when she did, she nearly dropped it. \u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>Inside were two fingers, their bloody stumps sticky and oozing into the sides of the container. One had skin the color of coffee, and the other a few shades lighter. This second one bore a small golden ring that Victoria recognized. She didn\u2019t need to say anything; the look of revulsion on Max\u2019s face mirrored her own.</p><p>The message was perfectly clear. Time was running out.</p><p>Victoria arrived at the Brodebaugh residence as though making an early social call. The house wasn\u2019t as large as St. Heath\u2019s Row, but grander than Grantworth House. Situated near Hyde Park, the grounds of the home were walled but the rear was adjacent to a small finger of the park. Neighboring houses were far enough away to give privacy, due to the unusually wide side gardens.</p><p>The moment the door opened, she smelled blood.</p><p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d It was Gwendolyn, her eyes wild and her face tinged gray and streaked with tears. Her hair fell in ungainly clumps, and she was still dressed in the gown she\u2019d worn to the coronation yesterday. \u201cYou\u2019ve come! I was afraid . . . I\u2019m so afraid!\u201d She clutched desperately at her, pulling her into the house. \u201cYou have to help us!\u201d</p><p>Victoria\u2019s heart was pounding. She\u2019d suspected, but now she knew for certain.</p><p>As Gwendolyn closed the door, Victoria fought to ignore the heavy iron scent in the air, and to keep her mind steady. Instead, she focused on the comforting stake deep in her pocket, her own vis bulla beneath her clothing, and her surroundings. The foyer of Brodebaugh Hall was empty, fairly ringing with its silence. The whole building was silent.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d she asked, battling the smell of blood, the horror that now gripped her, the edge of pink at her vision.</p><p>\u201cDid you . . . you came alone?\u201d Gwendolyn sniffled, looking around wildly. \u201cHow could you . . . how . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it myself,\u201d Victoria told her firmly. \u201cWhere are the servants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all gone,\u201d Gwendolyn said fearfully. \u201cThey\u2014 she\u2014took them all away.\u201d She looked again, over Victoria\u2019s shoulder, out the door, as if expecting to see an army there. \u201cThere\u2019s no one but you? But, Victoria\u2014\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had enough with the hysterics. The stake was out of her pocket and Victoria had slammed Gwendolyn up against the wall before the girl took another breath. Or made another fake sob. Her hand closed in a tight vee under Gwen\u2019s throat, and she poised the stake against her chest. \u201cTell me where they are, or you\u2019re dust.\u201d</p><p>Gwen dropped all pretense. Her pretty face, which had turned gray and tired from the overuse of the elixir, curdled into a malignant expression. Her eyes bulged, and turned from blue to red in an instant. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d suspected for awhile,\u201d Victoria told her, realizing that the back of her neck had cooled. Gwen wasn\u2019t the only vampire in the house. \u201cYou were always there when a daytime attack occurred. I could see the elixir taking its toll on you, in your face, but I just thought it was exhaustionfrom your wedding plans.\u201d She tightened her fingers around Gwen\u2019s throat, causing the girl to cough and to scratch at her hand, trying to tear it away. \u201cBut when I saw the queen yesterday, I realized there\u2019s a certain shadow in the eyes of a daytime undead. They all had it: James, Caroline, her guards. And you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJames.\u201d Gwen kicked out, but Victoria was ready. The little pointed foot, strong with undead power, merely grazed the side of her target\u2019s leg. \u201cYou killed him too! You killed my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that was it.\u201d Victoria knew she was taking up valuable time . . . but she had to know more. And why. \u201cYou helped set him in place as the new Rockley heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no choice, since the first one was dead. I wanted to marry Phillip and you stole him from me. I\u2019d seen him first, and then you made your debut, and immediately he was stumbling all over his feet for you. I didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d Gwen\u2019s voice was rough from the hand at her throat, but her tone was petulant. \u201cAnd now James. We were going to be so happy together. Eternal youth! And wealth.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria looked at the girl who had been her friend and wondered how such a lovely young woman could have turned so evil.</p><p>Self. The seed of everything evil begins with self.</p><p>\u201cYou never intended to marry Brodebaugh?\u201d</p><p>Gwen gave a squeaky laugh. \u201cOh, yes, we were to wed. And then he would die a sudden death, and I would find solace in the arms of the Marquess of Rockley. We\u2019ve been planning this for months!\u201d she ended on a shriek.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been undead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly since George returned from Italy. He brought Malachai\u2014you knew him as James. And when I met him, I knew the Tutela wasn\u2019t enough for me. I wanted immortality.\u201d Her laugh was grating and malicious. \u201cI wanted revenge on you for years, Victoria Gardella . . . since you married the man I desired. I planned for you to die when you came to the house party last summer . . . when the vampires came for Polidori. But you fought them off. You and that blond Frenchman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying from the elixir, Gwen. Did Lilith tell you that?\u201d</p><p>Victoria felt, rather than heard, the front door open silently behind her. The gasp of fresh air was a relief.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see you\u2019ve confirmed your suspicions,\u201d said Max. \u201cThere\u2019s no one about on the grounds; all the servants appear to be gone. And I wasn\u2019t seen, for the windows are shrouded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Victoria.</p><p>\u201cYou lied!\u201d screeched Gwen. \u201cYou didn\u2019t come alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo sorry.\u201d Victoria gave her a cold smile, and slammed the stake home. Dusting her hands off\u2014gloveless, of course\u2014she turned to Max. He\u2019d pulled his hair back into a tight queue, and his countenance was tight with focus. \u201cI probably could have gotten more information from her, but she was becoming tiresome. There are other undead here. Five or more.\u201d</p><p>He gave a sharp nod, and they started off down the main hallway, following the smell of blood.</p><p>Just as they reached the end of the corridor, facing two massive wooden doors, Max stopped. He took Victoria\u2019s arm and turned her to face him. Her heart started to pound. \u201cI know you\u2019re in charge, and we have a plan,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cbut listen to me.\u201d His eyes burned with determination, and Victoria\u2019s mouth went dry. She knew what he was going to say.</p><p>\u201cMax, no,\u201d she began, anger surging.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d he said, his voice still soft, but with sharpness. His hand tightened on her arm. \u201cYou have to get yourself and Vioget out of here. You\u2019re Gardellas. That\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a plan,\u201d she began, but her protest was cut off by a man\u2019s agonized cry. It came from beyond the doors. They both turned, and Max released her.</p><p>There was no more time for talk.</p><p>As before, Max remained out of sight, sticking for now to their plan. Victoria was the one who threw the doors open and stood boldly in the entrance.</p> <p>The stench of blood hit her like a wall, filling her nostrils, slogging into her lungs.</p><p>\u201cAt last. Our guest has arrived. Benvenuto.\u201d</p><p>Sara, of course. She stood directly across the room from the doors. Her smile was beatific, her hair properly coiffed, her day dress a simple yet stylish pale green lawn. There was blood on it.</p><p>\u201cCara mia, Victoria,\u201d she said in a shocked voice, looking at her tunic and trousers. \u201cWhatever are you wearing? It is abominevole!\u201d</p><p>Victoria scanned the chamber quickly. What she saw made the red blossom over her vision, coloring her whole world for a frightening moment. She focused on the feel of the stake in her hand: its square edges, the smooth wood, the inlaid cross on the top. With her focus, the haze ebbed, leaving only the faintest tinge.</p><p>The room would have been used as a small ballroom, or for a musical performance. It was large, with little furniture, and a polished wooden floor. The windows were shrouded, blocking the sunlight. Several lamps burned, however, so the chamber was not the least bit dark, revealing every detail of the garish scene.</p><p>To the left were several creatures: Brodebaugh and George Starcasset, along with four or five vampires with blazing red eyes\u2014she didn\u2019t have time to count. George and the earl were sitting in facing armchairs. Brodebaugh\u2019s face was streaked with blood and his clothes were mussed. George, on the other hand, appeared patently uninterested in his surroundings, and had adopted a look of boredom on his boyish face. Two vampires stood near them. But that wasn\u2019t the image that would later give Victoria nightmares.</p><p>On the other side of the room, just out of sight until she stepped in, were Sebastian and Kritanu, also flanked by undead. The two men were seated in chairs at either end of a rectangular table. Their bodies faced the doorway, immobilized by a labyrinth of crisscrossing restraints. Kritanu slumped in his seat, sagging forward, held in place only by the straps around his torso. The vampire next to him held a heavy knife. Its blade was bloody.</p><p>Sebastian was looking at Victoria, fury in his face. There were fang marks, many of them, on his neck and the part of his arm bared by a rolled-up sleeve. He was pale. He, as well as Kritanu, had the hand closest to the table strapped onto it. Blood pooled on its surface, dripping from the edge to plop onto the rug below. Victoria tore her eyes away, but not before she saw the stump where Kritanu\u2019s hand had been. It was still bright with fresh blood.</p><p>\u201cGet out of here, you damned fool,\u201d Sebastian shouted, veins bulging in his temples. Gone was the charm, the confidence, the irrepressible gleam in his eyes. He was bloody and dirty, his clothes were torn, his hair hung in his face but for the space where the lock had been snipped in the center of his forehead. The hand fixed to the table rested next to a dark stain.</p><p>\u201cSilenzio,\u201d Sara said with a coy smile. \u201cBe grateful that she arrived to keep you from the same fate as your compagno eccellente.\u201d She glanced at Kritanu, who appeared to have fainted from pain or blood loss, moving her lips into a little moue and tsking. \u201cHe has been so quiet since the last stroke of the blade.\u201d</p><p>Victoria swallowed hard, choking on the bitter taste at the back of her mouth. Calm. Breathe deeply. Fight the red. Remember the vis. Your vis. \u201cI\u2019m here. What is it you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrazie, for you to respond to my message,\u201d Sara replied ingenuously, her brown eyes wide. \u201cOh, and . . . mi dispiace . . . for the lack of servants. And there was no one to greet you at the door? They all have been dismissed. Permanently. Lilith wished to have them . . . for dinner.\u201d She giggled, but Victoria didn\u2019t see a hint of humor\u2014or even madness\u2014in her eyes. She was very lucid and very determined. Cold fear gripped her. \u201cIt has made the preparation of our meals rather difficile. For we who don\u2019t dine on blood, naturalmente.\u201d Then Sara made a point of looking around as if in confusion. \u201cBut where is your dear friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are my friends,\u201d Victoria said. She looked at Sebastian and Kritanu. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll pay for what you\u2019ve done. Release them or you\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about your amica Gwendolyn? That silly chit was to greet you at the door. She could not have failed in her task. It was so simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret to inform you that Gwen is a pile of ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed my sister?\u201d George cried. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilencio,\u201d Sara ordered. \u201cHave I not told you she slays at will? After what happened to mi papa . . .\u201d Her eyes narrowed at Victoria. \u201cDavvero. You are a smart one. It is no wonder he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so are you. Smart enough to know when you\u2019ve overstepped. Release them now, and it will go easier for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you\u2019ve come charging to the rescue\u2014da solo.\u201d Sara chuckled as she walked over to the vampire near Kritanu. \u201cHow difficult it must be for fusti such as these to know that you\u2014a mere woman\u2014must save them. A shame, that. But you neglected to bring anything for barter. Now I shall be forced to continue with mio divertimento. And it may be quite an . . . inconveniente . . . for your friends.\u201d She took the large knife from the vampire and, smiling at Victoria, moved to stand next to Sebastian.</p><p>Her hand moved to touch the top of his head, as if she were caressing a pet . . . then slid down to his shoulder and along to grip the arm fixed to the table. She looked up at Victoria, her brown eyes gleaming with pleasure. \u201cHave you ever heard him scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. You needn\u2019t play the game any longer. I\u2019m here. What is it you want?\u201d Victoria\u2019s mouth was so dry she could hardly form the words. The stake hung uselessly in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou fool, Victoria!\u201d Sebastian shouted suddenly, urgently. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d</p><p>The blade flashed as Sara raised it. She was still watching Victoria. \u201cWhat have you to offer me? Pronto! Before my patience is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Rings of Jubai,\u201d said Victoria quickly. \u201cLilith will be delighted for you to return it to her. She will reward you greatly.\u201d</p><p>The blade wavered. A trickle of perspiration rolled down Sebastian\u2019s face, yet he glared at her. The room was silent. Where was Max? If he didn\u2019t make the disturbance soon . . .</p><p>\u201cI know not what it is.\u201d But Sara was interested, and Victoria was glad to have her attention. Just keep the blade up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are five of them, made of copper.

After his outburst, George had remained silent. This was, clearly, wholly Sara\u2019s game.</p> <p>One of the undead, a woman ironically, nodded when Sara looked at her. \u201cDescribe the ring,\u201d said the vampire.</p><p>Victoria did, quickly, her eyes on the blade the whole time.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this ring?\u201d asked Sara.</p><p>\u201cSebastian retrieved it. He knows where it is.\u201d What was the delay?</p><p>Sara looked at her with distaste. \u201cYou expect that I shall release him to enable you to retrieve the ring?\u201d</p> <p>Just then\u2014at last!\u2014a sudden boom from the next room startled the occupants. The two windows near that wall shattered, sending glass shards scattering. Sunlight streamed in through the torn curtains, and chaos followed. A nearby vampire fell to the floor in agony, his skin peeling off in angry strips as he writhed in the sunbeam.</p><p>Chaos reigned\u2014Sara was shouting, half in Italian and half in English, waving the knife, giving sharp orders. Two vampires launched themselves at Victoria as she started toward Sebastian, pulling the stake out of her pocket. She stabbed one, missing his heart but slowing him nevertheless, and vaulted over the table as the knife blade flashed.</p><p>As Victoria slammed Sara to the floor she felt the knife slice along her arm. Blood burst from her skin\u2014 her blood\u2014filling her nose and turning her vision scarlet. The small woman beneath her had no chance to withstand Victoria\u2019s strength; it took only a single blow to the chest for her to release the blade and slump to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>Panting heavily, Victoria tore herself away from the woman she hated, blinking the red away, willing it away, as something heavy landed on her back. It smashed her to the floor, and it was alive.</p><p>Galvanized, Victoria rolled over, grabbing the vampire from behind and tearing at his grip even as he tore at her with claws and teeth. Her blood . . . Sebastian\u2019s . . . Kritanu\u2019s . . . filled her nose, her vision, sat on her tongue . . . It became a whirlwind, a maelstrom of kicking and fighting, of driving fury. She slammed and staked and scratched and elbowed until at last she was free. She grabbed the knife Sara had dropped, pulling to her feet.</p><p>Max was there at last, panting, his hair loose from its queue. He appeared to have done some damage if the streaks of blood on his face were the sign of a victorious warrior. As Victoria moved to free Sebastian, she saw Max lunge for the last remaining vampire and place a stake in the center of its chest. Even without the power of the vis bulla he was lethal.</p> <p>As she sawed away at Sebastian\u2019s bonds, she heard a soft oath behind her. Her skin prickling, she turned to see Max, frozen, wearing a stricken expression. He was looking beyond her, and Victoria turned slowly.</p><p>Sara could barely stand, but the gun in her hand was steady. It was pressed into Kritanu\u2019s back, at precisely the location where neck met shoulder. \u201cNow, we will negotiate.\u201d The fact that she spoke in Italian indicated the level of her distress. But, still, she held the gun, and Victoria was powerless unless she wanted Kritanu to die right then.</p><p>\u201cThe Ring of Jubai. You will bring it to me, if indeed it exists,\u201d Sara said, her voice warming. \u201cMaximilian will accompany us. I\u2019m certain Lilith will be delighted to see him. And will be appropriately appreciative to me. George.\u201d She looked over at her companion, who\u2019d risen from his chair during the altercation, presumably in an effort to remain out of the way of violence, as he was more of a gentleman\u2019s Tutela than an adventuresome one. \u201cYou take him.\u201d She gestured to Max with a jerk of her head.</p><p>Now, Victoria noticed that Brodebaugh sat slumped in his chair, his head at an unnatural angle. He would be no help to anyone, ever again. George rose from his seat, moving toward Max with alacrity. \u201cI\u2019ll tie his wrists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sara said, her eyes crafty. \u201cNo, he will carry his friend. As added insurance.\u201d She smiled that cool smile. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t risk harm coming to the old man, though he might not care what happens to himself.\u201d</p><p>For once Victoria was in agreement with Sara, disagreeable as it might be. For a man who was willing to take his own life rather than be subjected to Lilith\u2019s will again, it would be nothing for Max to risk trying an escape, even with a gun on him. But he would not endanger anyone else, especially Kritanu.</p><p>Victoria was ordered to give the knife to George, who then gave it to Max\u2014presumably so that she and Max would have no chance for private communication\u2014and it was he who cut Kritanu free. Under Sara\u2019s watchful eye and gun barrel, he hoisted the elderly man up over his shoulders as gently as possible. He, too, had vampire bite marks on his neck and on any exposed flesh. Blood still streamed from the stump of Kritanu\u2019s arm, and the man groaned quietly. He had lost a lot of blood . . . and he hadn\u2019t the Venator powers, although he wore a small amulet that gave him some protection from the undead.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Sara positioned herself with the gun next to the two men and faced Victoria. \u201cYou have two hours to bring the ring to Lilith, if indeed it does exist. I need not tell you to come alone, need I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd if I bring the ring, then you will give me Max and Kritanu?\u201d Victoria asked, knowing full well that Lilith would never willingly release Max.</p><p>\u201cYou need not be so greedy. You may choose one of them to free, in exchange for the ring. Although I cannot guarantee either of them will remain unscathed. Two hours is quite a long time.\u201d She smiled again and, as before, she seemed calm and lucid. Not a hint of madness. Just cold calculation. \u201cAnd the old man is likely to attract quite a bit of attention upon arrival.\u201d</p><p>The message was clear, and Victoria\u2019s stomach contracted. The vampires would be on Kritanu the moment he arrived. She looked at Max and read the comprehension in his expression. He, on the other hand, would be relatively safe.</p><p>Until Lilith got her hands\u2014and fangs\u2014on him.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s mouth dried. The determination on his face told her he would use the silver ring at the first opportunity. Even before she had a chance to arrive with an item to barter. And even then . . . it was impossible to believe that Lilith would release all of them, even for the ring.</p><p>\u201cTake me instead,\u201d Victoria said, suddenly calm. She was the one who wore two vis bullae; she was the one best equipped to hold off the vampire queen. She was the one fighting for her soul. And the one who knew of the secret passageway. \u201cTake me to Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The single syllable exploded in tandem from Max and Sebastian.</p><p>But Victoria ignored them, even as Sebastian jolted the table and chair to which he was bound, trying to use brute force to pull free. She looked at Sara. \u201cI am more valuable than he is,\u201d she said with a nod at Max. \u201cHe\u2019s useless and weak now. Lilith won\u2019t want him without his power. And I am Illa Gardella.\u201d</p><p>Sara was staring at her, consideration lighting her eyes. \u201cAn interesting idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria, no!\u201d Sebastian jerked harder at the table. A pool of blood splattered to the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t be a fool. Victoria.\u201d His last word was an agonized command, and it rang there in the room, in the taut silence that had descended.</p><p>Then . . . \u201cDamn you,\u201d Max said. Very quietly, as though he had no breath. His eyes were black pits, and she could see the renewed tension in his arms as he steadied Kritanu there. \u201cYou cannot . . . be so foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot retrieve the ring without your assistance,\u201d Sebastian added suddenly. \u201cYou must come with me. I\u2019m too weak to get to it.\u201d</p><p>Victoria could see the calculation in Sara\u2019s eyes, could fairly hear her mind whirring. Which would put her in the best favor with Lilith, which combination had the highest likelihood of obtaining the greatest leverage . . .</p><p>Refusing to look at either of her two comrades, Victoria waited.</p><p>\u201cIf you are so eager to be traded for them,\u201d said Sara at last, looking at her with a delighted gleam in her eyes, \u201cthen I am content that you will indeed come, bearing the ring. And at that time, I\u2019m certain we can accommodate your wishes to be traded.\u201d Her dimple flashed. \u201cYou have two hours.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked directly at Max, though her words were meant for Sara. \u201cI will bring the ring. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>After Sara and George left, with Max carrying his burden between them, Victoria returned to Sebastian\u2019s side to cut away his restraints. Long before he was loose, his unmaimed hand whipped out to grab her arm. \u201cWhat in the bloody hell did you think you were doing?\u201d he said, gripping hard, shaking her. \u201cHow could you do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work, did it?\u201d she replied sharply, still cutting ferociously.</p><p>My God, they had been taking no chances with him getting free. The bonds were so tight, she was surprised he could breathe. And all the blood, oozing from his skin. Her stomach twisted, remembering the look in Sara\u2019s eyes. She would have butchered each of them, piece by piece. She released Sebastian\u2019s left hand, bloody and missing half of the last finger. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sebastian.\u201d She raised it to her face and his fingers closed around her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t get the parts that matter.\u201d His smile was a bit lopsided, but genuine all the same. \u201cMerely a badge of my long-questioned heroism.\u201d He looked up at her, his ravaged face already showing a mottle of bruising. \u201cYou don\u2019t really mean to bring the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, Sebastian!\u201d She was horrified that he would even suggest such a thing that she stepped away. \u201cI should have gone in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you addled? You\u2019re Illa Gardella!\u201d He pulled to his feet more smoothly than she\u2019d expected, standing over her. His eyes burned golden as he took her shoulders. \u201cWhat will happen to the Venators if you\u2019re killed, or captured? You can\u2019t.\u201d He wrapped her against him, smelling of blood and sweat and Sebastian. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd as such it is my duty to protect.\u201d They bumped the chair. A leather restraint fell to the floor with a soft whump as those words echoed in her mind.</p><p>Duty to protect.</p><p>Indeed . . . a duty to protect even when it wasn\u2019t easy. When the choice wasn\u2019t simple. In fact, when the choice was impossible. That was what mattered.</p> <p>Could she do it? Could she be selfless in protecting the mortals she was charged to save? Even one for whom she might be bound by hatred and loathing?</p><p>It had been easy . . . so easy . . . to offer herself for Max and Kritanu. She\u2019d seen the flash of expression on Max\u2019s face when Sara produced the gun: sick with fear. He\u2019d known his fate then. Not fear that he would die, but knowledge that Lilith would have him once again. And this time, without the strength and power of his vis bulla to help him fight her thrall.</p><p>Victoria knew that Kritanu would not last. Lilith had no use for him, and the blood would be too much for the vampires to resist. When Kritanu was dead, would Max use the silver ring to join him? She had to get there before he did.</p><p>Sebastian seemed to read her thoughts. \u201cVictoria, Kritanu is as good as dead. And so is Pesaro. He\u2019ll make certain of it himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the ring?\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, tightening his arms, and then released her. His damaged hand smoothed along her cheek as he tried to smile. But it faltered. His fingers trembled. \u201cI knew better than to hope you\u2019d listen to me. This is who you are. This is who you\u2019ve become: changed from the selfish, superficial Society girl, poorly disguised in man\u2019s clothes and playing at a double life . . . to this. And . . . I love who you are, Victoria. I\u2019ve never met a more fascinating, intelligent woman.\u201d</p><p>A wave of guilt and affection overwhelmed her, and at that moment she drew in her breath to speak. But he shook his head sharply, the same way Max would have. \u201cDon\u2019t. Let\u2019s get the ring. And hope that Brim and Michalas arrive soon.\u201d He released her and stepped back, that charming smile unsteady on his lips. \u201cBut perhaps we should think of a plan first.\u201d</p><p>Relieved that she could concentrate on the rescue, Victoria returned his smile with a grim one. \u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>The Vampire Queen Receives Her Guest</p><p>When Victoria and Sebastian left the Brodebaugh home, there was an additional surprise, and something that gave Victoria an even greater sense of urgency. They found Kritanu in a heap on the front stoop. He\u2019d been left there for some reason\u2014a happenstance that was both relieving and terrifying. She couldn\u2019t imagine why or how, and assumed that Max\u2019s cleverness had somehow achieved it.</p> <p>Thus they would be able to save Kritanu\u2019s life; but that left Max on his own, with no one to protect. No one to stay alive to protect.</p><p>He knew she was coming. She\u2019d told him. But, would he wait? Could he, in that hell?</p><p>Should she expect him to?</p><p>Do you never do anything for yourself?</p><p>This might be the one time he did.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be able to blame him.</p><p>During the retrieval of the copper ring from the rooms Sebastian had rented, and the trip back to Victoria\u2019s town house, Sebastian tried to argue with her. He wanted to approachLilith in her stead, or at least, with her. But Victoria was adamant.</p><p>\u201cYou and Brim and Michalas\u2014if they\u2019ve arrived at last\u2014will come in through the secret passageway, which, God willing, they\u2019ve not yet discovered. If you have to fight your way in, at least they won\u2019t be expecting three Venators.\u201d</p> <p>When they reached the town house, they were relieved to find Brim, the mountainous, coffee-colored man with barely a brush of wiry hair and a vis bulla in his eyebrow. Michalas, the lithe, whip-slender Venator with tight, burnished curls, had also arrived. They, in fact, had been making ready under Wayren\u2019s direction to travel to the Brodebaugh residence and provide their assistance.</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t have been happier to see them. Her confidence surged as she told them her plan.</p><p>\u201cI need not tell you to take care,\u201d said Sebastian, a short while later, as the hackney left Victoria off near the entrance to the sewers. His face looked marginally better, for he\u2019d washed away the blood and sweat, and had changed clothes. However, nothing could hide the mottling purple and red on his skin, and the strain in his eyes. The last knuckle of his maimed finger was bound and poulticed, thanks to Wayren. \u201cAnd I need not tell you why it is important that you return.\u201d</p><p>Brim and Michalas nodded. But they said nothing.</p><p>Indeed, there was nothing left to be said.</p><p>Victoria slogged through the sludgy underground canal as she and Sebastian had done weeks earlier.</p><p>The back of her neck was cold. Red\u2014and some pink\u2014 eyes burned, glowing in the darkness of the sewer tunnels, but none made a move toward her. They blinked, and there was impatient rustling in the shadows, but Victoria ignored it. Lilith was too smart\u2014and complacent\u2014to rush things.</p><p>When she came to the dead end of the sewer, where the rush of water fell down into darkness below, she easily found the narrow walkway that led up and along the side of the tunnel to the underground abbey. To her uneasy surprise, she realized she didn\u2019t need a light. Her eyesight in the darkness continued to improve: a morbid reminder of her tenuous hold on mortality.</p><p>Once at the top of the ramplike walkway, Victoria slipped through the narrow crevice. She slunk across the small space, then faced the first door, which led to the antechamber that had been empty during her first visit, and where she\u2019d fought with the vampires while Sebastian hid the secret door. To her surprise, the door that had been bolted when she and Sebastian came was unlocked and easily swung open. But that made sense . . . for Lilith was expecting her.</p><p>This chamber was still empty but for a pile of rags in one corner and a broken wooden chair. The back of her neck was frigid and her heart slammed in her chest. She walked across the room and pushed open the heavy door to the throne room.</p><p>At first, it seemed as though her entrance had gone unnoticed. There were few occupants in the space\u2014a small cluster of vampires sitting in chairs. Sara, standing nearby like a lady in waiting. Lilith, who sat in her large stone throne with her long, slender fingers curled over the arms, was talking to Sara.</p><p>And Max. Thank God, Max.</p><p>He sat next to the vampire queen on a low stone stool. His shirt was missing, his feet were bare, but he still wore the same trousers he\u2019d donned this morning. Unbelievably, his skin was unmarked, though she saw a faint sheen of sweat on his forehead. The silver vis bulla glinted uselessly in the midst of the dark hair on his muscled torso.</p><p>Victoria looked at him, willing him to notice her. To see that she\u2019d come, and would get them out of there, or die in the process.</p><p>But then Lilith looked directly at her with red-blue eyes, and Victoria had to blink away in surprise before the thrall trapped her.</p><p>\u201cNearly two hours, Venator. We\u2019d begun to think you weren\u2019t going to come.\u201d Lilith smiled and reached over with a slender white hand to touch Max. He didn\u2019t move. Languidly, she laced her fingers through the thick dark hair that fell in straggling waves around his face. He still hadn\u2019t looked at Victoria, and that made her uneasy. Very uneasy.</p><p>He didn\u2019t appear to be restrained; his capable hands rested on his knees. Her palms became sweaty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought the Ring of Jubai for you. I want Max.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, he shifted, as if it were a casual move, as if he hardly noticed her presence. Or cared about it. He looked straight at her, and she was struck by the look in his eyes: fury, frustration. He was angry that she\u2019d come.</p><p>She could almost guess his thoughts: Bloody hell, Victoria. It would all be over by now if you weren\u2019t so damned bullheaded and let me die in peace.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t understand. She would never leave him to this, or to die. She wouldn\u2019t let him go.</p><p>Lilith smiled, her fangs fully extended. \u201cI thought that might be the case. I see that you\u2019ve given him back his vis bulla. But,\u201d she added thoughtfully, \u201cfirst we must see how you are faring, Victoria Gardella.\u201d</p><p>She had been prepared for it, had known it was inevitable. But when Lilith grasped Max\u2019s head and tipped it to the side, bending to the tendon at the junction of shoulder and neck, Victoria felt the slam of her heart vibrating crazily through her, suddenly taking over. As though it struggled to be released, to control her.</p><p>This was the same scene she\u2019d witnessed before, the same scene that still haunted her, which, she knew, was only the edge of what he\u2019d suffered: brilliant coppery hair spilling over his bare torso, next to his dark head, the grimace of pain mingled with shameful pleasure that flushed his face, parted his lips in a silent groan.</p><p>And the sounds: the soft gulps, the faint whistle of suction. The palpable alertness of the other undead in the room.</p><p>Victoria had expected it, steeled herself for it . . . but the blood. The smell of it.</p><p>Max\u2019s blood.</p><p>Her vision went hazy and pink, and she swallowed back the saliva that surged in her mouth.</p><p>Lilith looked up at that moment, daintily wiping a drop of crimson from the corner of her mouth. \u201cI see,\u201d she said. Laughter and delight tinged her voice. \u201cYou\u2019re further gone than I\u2019d imagined.\u201d</p><p>Victoria couldn\u2019t look at Max; she could barely breathe. Oh God, help me. Her fingers trembled, the stake lay untouched in her pocket.</p><p>Lilith swiped a finger over the marks on Max\u2019s skin, bringing away a fingertip tipped with red. Victoria could see it glistening from where she stood, and swallowed again. \u201cCome, taste,\u201d said the vampire queen.</p><p>Victoria\u2019s stomach rebelled, lurching sharply . . . yet she couldn\u2019t draw her eyes away from the crimson trickling from Max\u2019s shoulder. Her heart beat strong vibrations to her fingers.</p><p>And then Lilith\u2019s laugh, echoed by Sara, trilled over the back of her mind, and she used its horrible sound to pull out of the depths . . . of wherever she\u2019d been. Her heart still pounded, her fingers trembled . . . but the tug had loosened enough for her to regain control. For the moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to negotiate,\u201d she said, aware that her voice was perhaps not as strong as it could be. \u201cDo you want the Ring of Jubai? Or shall I leave?\u201d She swallowed, and the saliva did not return in the same salacious manner as before. The red in her vision eased to the edges, lingering, but no longer burning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course I want the ring . . . but I\u2019ll get it eventually. Soon, you won\u2019t be able to deny me anything. And this is so much more entertaining. Are you quite certain you don\u2019t wish to join me?\u201d Lilith moved her hand possessively over the front of Max\u2019s chest, her long nails threading through hair and over the plane of muscles, carefully avoiding the vis bulla on one side . . . then back up into the thick strands that brushed his neck.</p><p>He remained unmoving, stoic, but unwilling to meet Victoria\u2019s eyes. Yet she saw the pulse in the veins of his throat, and the visible tension in his arms as they tightened, the press of his lips. She felt the revulsion and horror emanating from him, and yet he displayed no reaction.</p><p>She realized in that moment that whatever had happened with Beauregard three months ago, whatever he\u2019d done to her\u2014and she\u2019d accepted\u2014during his attempt to turn her, had been nothing compared to what Max experienced at the hands of the vampire queen. Her stomach pitched at the thought of such ugliness.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were willing to share,\u201d Victoria replied, trying a different tack, concentrating on her breathing. Keeping it easy, slow, smooth. Trying to ignore the smell of blood.</p><p>\u201cFor a Venator turned undead, I may perhaps make an exception,\u201d Lilith admitted. \u201cYou are very close, Victoria Gardella. Can you not feel it burning inside you? The need? I see it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see nothing,\u201d Victoria told her, wondering how much time had elapsed. Sebastian and the others should have been able to find the entrance to the secret passage behind the throne by now . . . they could be nearby. She simply needed to kill more time. \u201cYou merely see what you want to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lilith sat straight in her chair. \u201cLet us find out about that.\u201d She stood abruptly. Her long emerald gown, which was more in the style of Wayren than her cohort Sara, cascaded to her feet.</p><p>The vampire queen gave a subtle jerk of her head, but Victoria was ready. She whirled as two undead swarmed behind her. Stake in her hand again, she knocked away the hands that grasped for her, grabbing one of the vampires and shoving the creature toward the other. Then, quickly, before they could regain their balance or react, she stabbed one. He poofed into ash, and the other stumbled backward. Victoria followed him with her own lunge, pushing him to the ground then following through with her stake.</p> <p>Standing in the pile of ash, she faced Lilith. \u201cKeep your goons away from me.\u201d</p><p>The tall vampiress looked at her with burning red eyes. The blue had narrowed to the thinnest circle. \u201cThat was incomparably rude, Victoria Gardella. But don\u2019t worry . . . I won\u2019t allow you another chance to misbehave. Come with me, or I shall take out my frustrations elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Max stood as though pulled by a puppet string, and Victoria did not miss Lilith\u2019s implication. She watched him move, still smooth and graceful, yet reluctance be-laboredevery step. The vampire queen was tall, nearly as tall as he, and she circled his wrist with her skeletal fingers.</p><p>Sara moved toward Victoria, and she saw that the blonde woman still carried the pistol that had stopped their escape earlier. Using its barrel, she pushed Victoria toward the door at the opposite side of the chamber.</p><p>Victoria hadn\u2019t been in this room before; in fact, she\u2019d hardly noticed the entrance to it the two previous times she\u2019d been in the throne room. The smell of blood was stronger here, and the space was lit, unlike the other, by two massive fireplaces\u2014one at each end\u2014and wall sconces. The flames danced black shadows on the stone walls so that they seemed to undulate in every direction. This chamber was much warmer than the other, nearly stifling with its heat.</p><p>Or perhaps it just felt that way because of the thick bloodscent, the leaping shadows, and the warm light.</p> <p>The furnishings in this room included a long, low divan piled with cushions, tables and chairs, and, in the center, a dark shadow in the floor. On the other side of the shadow was another doorway.</p><p>A low growl caught Victoria\u2019s attention, and she turned to see three pairs of red eyes burning near the floor in front of one of the fireplaces. Six pointed ears cocked toward them, and then the three dogs rose, massive nostrils quivering.</p><p>The hair on the back of Victoria\u2019s arms lifted. They were huge wolflike canines with vampiric eyes and long fangs that curved outside their muzzles when closed. The head of the smallest one would be as high as her waist.</p><p>They streaked over to Lilith, who commanded them with a mere flick of her fingers. The dogs sat promptly, but their attention, Victoria now saw, was focused on Max . . . on the fresh blood that oozed down his skin. One of them was furiously licking, half biting, at the finger Lilith had drawn through the blood moments before, but the other two sat at attention: eyes sharp, ears perked, mouths closed, fairly vibrating with bloodlust.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d said Lilith almost kindly. \u201cWe shall see how strong you are, Victoria Gardella. And then it will be all over.\u201d</p><p>A cold web of fear covered her as she breathed hot, bloody, sluggish air and felt a drop of perspiration roll down her back.</p><p>Everything happened very quickly, but Victoria could have done nothing to prevent it. Sara\u2019s gun barrel poked her in the side, and the dogs sat sentry in front of her as three vampires moved forward at Lilith\u2019s command. They placed heavy, clinking manacles on Max\u2019s wrists, crossing them together at his lap. When they first approached, he stepped back, his teeth baring ferally . . . but when Sara prodded Victoria with the gun, he acquiesced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, Maximilian. Don\u2019t put an end to the experiment before it begins,\u201d said Lilith. \u201cAnd you need not worry, Victoria Gardella. I have no intent of harming your lover. This is merely a precaution so that he does nothing foolish.\u201d</p> <p>Victoria looked at Max. His stony face gave no indication of what was in his mind. Even his eyes were flat and emotionless, and though he met her gaze, he gave her nothing else.</p><p>Nothing for her, but also nothing for Lilith.</p><p>The shadow in the middle of the floor turned out to be not a shadow at all, but a pit. As she realized this, Victoria turned cold again. She knew what awaited her.</p><p>Before she could think further, the three vampires who\u2019d chained Max came toward her. She fought them with stake and foot and red-clouded desperation, but in the end she was subdued by two of them. She took little satisfaction in the pile of ash that the other had become. Red burned her vision and her body trembled. Her mouth salivated. It took them all of their might to hold her steady when Lilith approached.</p><p>Her fangs dipped into her thin lower lip. It was purplish in color and the incisors left little dark dents, revealed when she smiled. Victoria held her breath, expecting anything . . . but not the sudden swipe of nails over her cheek and neck.</p><p>She felt the three claws dig into her face, and the burst of blood that followed as though it had been simmering below the surface . . . waiting.</p><p>And then, before she knew what was happening, she was flying through the air, falling down, down, down . . . into the black pit.</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>A View from the Stands</p><p>Max saw the scarlet weals of blood erupt on Victoria\u2019s skin. It would be over very soon. Whatever it would be.</p><p>Damn her. Why in God\u2019s name did she come here?</p><p>At the scent of such fresh blood, the dogs surged to their feet, heedless of their mistress\u2019s command. They snarled and drooled and tore after Victoria, leaping into the hole where she\u2019d been flung.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, my dear Maximilian,\u201d crooned Lilith near his ear. Her breath was hot over his flesh, almost liquid in its promise . . . and malignance. The scent of roses was nauseating. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry that she\u2019ll die down there. I have the utmost confidence in her abilities. Now, come closer, so you can watch her at her best. She truly is magnificent.\u201d</p><p>She prodded him forward, and he obeyed. He understood what Lilith meant to do, and his palms grew damp as his insides churned. Hot tears burned his eyes. The silver ring was heavy on his finger, yet useless, dammit. Bloody useless.</p><p>If there\u2019d been one chance to get close enough to Victoria, he\u2019d have lashed out, sliced her with it, eradicating Lilith\u2019s opportunity for entertainment.</p><p>Damn you, Victoria. Why didn\u2019t you stay away? It could have been over by now.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to look in the pit, yet he could not keep from doing so. You\u2019d be safe. It was a mass of snarling teeth and writhing fur, slender white limbs, flashes of pale skin and fabric. Victoria had her stake; he saw it rise and plunge, awkward and desperate, even as the dogs snapped and bit and surged. He cringed at her gasps and cries, and hoped when there was a canine squeal or shriek. God, he hoped.</p><p>Rather than mauling her all at once, the mastiffs seemed to come in waves . . . one after the other, lunging, biting, snarling, scratching, then rolling or dodging away in the pit to let the next come. The attack was so fast and relentless that Max could make out no details . . . only that Victoria had not been able to rise from beneath them. And her stake had not yet been effective.</p><p>He didn\u2019t realize he was jumping forward, down, until a horrible jerk on his wrist manacles whipped him through the air, then slammed him back onto the ground, fairly yanking his arms from their sockets. Rough stone tore his skin raw as he skidded across the dirt and rock. Blood oozed from his wounds as he crawled rapidly back to the edge of the pit, feeling the strain of hard breathing coursing through him. If he could get down there, he needed only a moment, and the ring would do its job.</p><p>But another powerful drag pulled him back, sending him sprawling onto his spine, head whipping back hard onto the stones. He breathed heavily, looking up into the furious face of Lilith. \u201cDo not try such a foolish thing again,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll release them fully.\u201d</p><p>Max clambered to his feet, head pounding, fists clenched. He wanted to beg, his mouth formed the words, he drew in the breath to plead . . . but he knew it would do no good. Lilith would lap it up like her vampire dogs and stroke him like the pet he was . . . and she would do what she wanted anyway, reveling in his pain and using his weakness to control him, to destroy them both. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christ Almighty, his weakness was two bloody women. The vampire and the Venator. The seductive evil incarnate and the feminine warrior.</p><p>There was a sudden sharp squeal and a soft explosion. Then quiet.</p><p>He surged to the edge again, looking back down into the blackness, hoping. . . . Her white fingers were there, bloody, digging into the small cuts on the side of the pit, pulling her battered body up . . . not so far from the edge, and Max plunged his chained wrists down to help drag her up, heedless of Lilith standing behind him, of her triumph in seeing his weakness. There were no dogs left . . . only the smell of vampire dust on the air.</p> <p>Victoria collapsed onto the ground at their feet. Her clothing was bloody and torn, her eyes glazed, her loose hair in a long, witchy tangle about her, red-streaked fingers still clutching the stake. Yet she pulled raggedly to her feet and blinked hard; Max could see her struggling to maintain her composure, to clear her vision.</p><p>He saw it . . . he recognized the struggle going on beneath her skin, deep within. The need to go on, to destroy, to annihilate. His fists tightened. There was nothing anyone could do for her. She had to fight through herself. Wayren had told him all of the details that Victoria had not.</p><p>Holy God, let her be strong.</p><p>She drew a deep, shuddering breath and faced Lilith. Her eyes burned with anger, yet there was no red. Not yet.</p><p>Thank God, not yet.</p> <p>Then, suddenly galvanized and hopeful, he fumbled with the ring, reaching toward her, ready to end it before she had to make the fatal choice . . . before she was battered any further, tortured, maimed, beaten . . . pushed over the edge.</p><p>But his chains were yanked again and he lost his fingering on the ring as he was forced out of reach of Victoria, tripping and stumbling into a heap. He closed the signet quickly before it cut his own flesh. There was only enough for one of them.</p><p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d said Lilith, speaking to Victoria. \u201cAbsolutely marvelous, but nothing less than I\u2019d expected from you. And quite efficient as well. I rather thought you might take longer than you did. Although I shall grieve for the loss of my companions, the outcome will be so much more valuable. And besides,\u201d she said, her fangs pressing into her lip as her smile returned, \u201cI have more to spare.\u201d</p><p>As if that were a signal, the door on the other side of the pit opened and in walked the man Max recognized as Bemis Goodwin. He was holding the leashes of four more slavering canines, their ears pricked forward, their eyes burning red as they scented the blood.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we shall finish this,\u201d said Lilith.</p><p>Her eyes burned with excitement, and Max felt as though he were going to vomit. The room shifted and he tried one more time to lunge toward Victoria, releasing the tiny lethal blade of his ring . . . he needed only one small cut, just the barest nick. . . .</p> <p>But something caught around his foot, pulling back, and he slammed into the ground.</p><p>And then a woman screamed.</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>The Choice</p><p>Victoria was barely aware of Max slamming to the ground at her feet. She felt the need, the anger pulsing through her . . . red burning her eyes, blazing through her.</p><p>Her heart still pounded, sweat poured down her back and underarms. Lilith\u2019s red eyes glowed at her knowingly. Reveling in the battle as it billowed and surged inside her. She drew in a deep breath, touched the amulets beneath her torn tunic, and gasped with the power: pure, clean power.</p><p>The red faded, the rampant violence eased, she felt as though control was in her grasp. Triumph blasted through her. Lilith had been wrong. She\u2019d underestimated Victoria, and now she\u2019d come through whatever this test was\u2014</p><p>And then she saw the four dogs. And Bemis Goodwin, standing on the other side of the pit. The dark, deep, horrible space. Slicing teeth and deep claws, the smell of evil, wet dogs as they came at her again, and again. Not to kill . . . to maim, to torture, to tear into her, but not enough for relief. Not enough to kill. Victoria couldn\u2019t hold back a shudder. It rattled her, made her weak-kneed and dizzy and dry in the mouth as she remembered fighting them back, and back, and back. . . .</p> <p>She felt the brush at her feet as Max tried to lunge back at her, and she focused on him, saw the blood and scrapes on his shoulder and chest, the torn flesh at his wrists. Yet her world was vague, and she moved as if in a dream . . . as though underwater, fighting through heavy waves, struggling to breathe . . . and then a sharp scream cut through the air.</p><p>Victoria whirled in time to see Sara shoved off the edge and tumbling into that horrible pit. The four dogs lunged after her, leaping down into the darkness. The scream filled her ears and Victoria raced to the edge of the pit. The dogs were on the woman, tearing into her as she tried to fight them off. The report of the pistol echoed in the small space, eerie and useless against vampiric canines.</p><p>Victoria inhaled bloodscent, felt the rush of fear, heard the screams, and fought it. She turned back to Lilith and found her watching with a slight smile on her face. A smug expression.</p><p>Screams, howls, barks . . . Victoria did not want to go back into that horrible place. Those sharp teeth, tearing and mauling . . . Sara begging and crying . . . the soft squeal of a dog hit by the butt of her pistol . . .</p><p>The red burned . . . images warred . . . Sara with the knife . . . sharp teeth . . . Sara standing over Sebastian, smiling . . . the blood . . . the smugness . . . cold calculation . . . the tearing of teeth into her flesh, she knew what it felt like . . . the pain, the release of blood. . . . She couldn\u2019t do it. She couldn\u2019t. . . . Kritanu\u2019s severed hand . . . the snarls filling her ears and face . . . pain . . . Victoria felt herself moving away from the pit. . . . She couldn\u2019t go back there . . . pain . . . but Sara . . . her screams . . . she couldn\u2019t bear it . . . she deserved it . . . she would have cut them all . . . teeth, scoring . . .</p><p>Victoria leaped, praying and sobbing, falling down, down . . . she fought the fear, battling the red that threatened to overtake her . . . she landed on a furry back and barely had the presence of mind to use her stake. She heard a shriek above her, the fury of Lilith . . . and somehow that penetrated and gave her strength. She\u2019d won.</p><p>By God, she\u2019d won.</p><p>As she battled those monsters, slashing and fighting, praying and slashing, the red eased . . . it released her from the tension. She felt purity blaze through her, white and clear, pushing away the drive to kill relentlessly . . . the pleasure in pain.</p><p>The dogs seemed to sense her renewed purpose, and they became more feral, no longer holding back. They no longer teased and tortured as they had done before, but lashed out, all at once, pulling at her, tearing into her flesh. Her stake tumbled from her hand, rolling to the ground and Victoria felt the soft paws pressing into her face as teeth and claws tore at her legs and arms, pulling at her hair. She rolled and kicked, thrusting at them, struggling to pull her other stake from beneath her trousers . . . and at last it was in her hand, heavy and solid, and she lashed out with it.</p><p>She was Illa Gardella.</p><p>Power blasted through her, and she kicked and fought, free now, free to be as savage as she could, for she no longer feared the evil. It had dropped its hold, broken by her sacrifice, bleeding from her wounds, pouring out of her with each strong exhalation . . . stronger and purer. . . .</p><p>At last . . . silence.</p><p>Silence but for gasping breaths, and Sara\u2019s soft sobs and keening cries.</p><p>Victoria staggered to her feet and looked up.</p><p>Max\u2019s handsome face, still dark and taut, scraped and bloody, stared down at her. She saw the expression in his eyes, read what was there, what he\u2019d tried so hard to hide . . . and then he was gone.</p><p>Victoria wasted no time. She heaved Sara\u2019s mutilated body up and over the top of the pit, on the side away from Lilith, clambering quickly after her before the vampiress could act.</p><p>Sara groaned, and cried out in agony as she collapsed on the ground, a torn, mangled mess. Victoria pulled herself up over the edge. On the other side of the pit\u2014 nothing more than a long jump\u2014she saw Lilith, fangs bared, teeth long and lethal.</p><p>\u201cYou were wrong,\u201d Victoria said, triumph in her voice as she leaped over the pit. She landed solidly on the other side, steady, her feet planted on the ground. Sure. For the first time certain of her power. Knowing she had won.</p><p>From nowhere, from some invisible signal, came a horde of vampires, streaming into the room, swarming toward her. Victoria readied her stake, and the last thing she saw before the red-eyed creatures attacked was Lilith bending to Max.</p><p>Her world became a melee of fangs and claws, of pain and thrusts and stakes. She caught glimpses of the room around her as she fought to keep them away, from tearing her . . . but she was no longer afraid of the red and the blood and of herself.</p><p>And Max had his ring. He would be safe.</p><p>They covered her, as the dogs had, but larger and heavier, though no less feral. She screamed once, when she collapsed on the ground beneath tearing fangs.</p><p>\u201cThe ring . . . Max!\u201d she cried, shoving her stake up into the red eye of an undead.</p><p>She rolled over and glimpsed Lilith\u2019s green gown and white body against Max\u2019s dark one . . . and the impression of blood and lips and tongue, and then the burn of red-blue eyes as the vampire queen turned to look triumphantly at Victoria.</p><p>Then her view was cut off when a large undead closed his hands over her throat, squeezing, as another captured her legs, pinning them down as she writhed and fought for air, her stake flailing . . . and suddenly her legs were released and the smell of vampire ash poofed through the air.</p><p>A war cry filled the room and she was free. There stood Sebastian, his golden eyes furious and horrified, finding hers from behind the shoulder of an undead . . . the vampire vanished and there he was again, reaching to touch her\u2014just once, a quick caress\u2014and then turning away to fight the undead.</p><p>Brim let loose another battle cry, and now he lunged and leaped, throwing vampires out of the way with his massive arms. The silver vis bulla glinted in his dark eyebrow against his black skin, his muscles bulging as he took an undead by the legs and swung him around, knocking vampires to the ground. Michalas was there too, his stake slashing and moving. Victoria and Sebastian backed up to each other, battling the vampires, cutting them down into piles of ash. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At last . . . there was nothing but the smell of foul air and heavy breathing. Victoria looked over and saw that Max was gone . . . and so was Lilith. She cried out and started toward the door, the only way they could have gone, but Sebastian pulled her back. She stumbled against him, her hand flattening over his chest, and saw that he was pointing her toward the other side of the pit.</p><p>Max was there, freshly bloody, his hands still chained. He knelt next to Sara, bending close to her.</p><p>He turned away and looked at Victoria, then pulled to his feet. Her stomach rebelled for a moment, and then she saw what he\u2019d done. The silver ring was gone from his hand. Sara, a mutilated, torn, agonized bundle, curled her fingers around it. She made a jerky move, one hand against the other.</p> <p>And then she slumped, relaxed, her hands falling to the stones beneath her.</p><p>Max carried Sara\u2019s body over his shoulder, perhaps, Victoria thought, as a last tribute to a woman he\u2019d cared for . . . at least to some extent.</p><p>\u201cLilith\u2019s gone,\u201d said Brim. \u201cShe slipped away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t get the ring,\u201d said Victoria. Nor did she get Max.</p><p>They left in silence, necks warm, filing out through the throne room where the chair was tipped over from the Venators\u2019 entrance . . . and out into the empty antechamber.</p> <p>Victoria was last, and it happened when they were walking down the narrow ramp that led to the sewer canal. She noticed, to her great relief, that she could see nothing in the darkness without the torches Brim and Michalas carried. The rush of water echoed around them, and suddenly she felt something moving through the air, rushing down from above her.</p><p>It crashed onto her, something warm and human, and she lost her balance.</p><p>They fell, tumbling off the walkway, down . . . down to where the water splashed below.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>A Battle Is Lost</p><p>Sebastian heard the noise behind him. He turned in time to see the dark figure land on Victoria, falling with her down into darkness.</p> <p>\u201cVictoria!\u201d he cried, and jumped after them.</p><p>The fall wasn\u2019t as deep as he\u2019d expected . . . yet far enough to be fatal if rocks were hidden there.</p><p>He heard the other splash moments before his own, heard a struggle in the water, gasps for air, but he couldn\u2019t see anything. She was already weak, dammit, and she\u2019d been taken by surprise . . . if she\u2019d hit her head on anything, or crashed onto the rocks that he kicked against . . .</p><p>He couldn\u2019t see, but heard . . . he could hear, and he fought his way through the rush of water to the sounds of struggle, unsure who or what he was swimming toward because it was so dark.</p><p>Where were the others? There\u2019d been no other shouts, no other splashes. Did they even know he and Victoria had fallen? The others had been quite a bit ahead of them.</p><p>Groping in the water, at last he found hair, strands of hair, and from the soft glow of light, saw Victoria\u2019s white face, eyes closed. She wasn\u2019t moving and he pulled at her. There was something dark on her face, dark and sticky. Oh God.</p><p>\u201cMax!\u201d he shouted, his voice echoing in the darkness. \u201cBrim! Down here!\u201d</p><p>Then he felt another body bump against him, but before he could say anything\u2014was it Pesaro? Brim? There\u2019d been no other splashes\u2014strong hands pushed him underwater. Then he felt the slice of something sharp scoring his arm, then down his leg. His blood surged into the water.</p> <p>Above he heard the faint echo of a responding shout, and managed to bellow out another call for help as he fought and struggled in the rank pool. He was weaponless against this mortal with the blade and feeling renewed pain from his missing finger. At last a new beam of light from above\u2014finally!\u2014illuminated the man\u2019s face. He recognized him.</p><p>Bemis Goodwin, damn him. Bemis Goodwin.</p><p>Rage sliced through him, rage and hatred for the man who would take her from him. He held onto Victoria while battling the man back, grappling in the water, protecting her from the knife that slashed into him. She slipped from his grip, from the slippery hold, and disappeared.</p><p>Sebastian cried another warning aloud, choking in a mouthful of water, just as he noticed a light moving near the edge of the pool. Pesaro, and Brim, at last.</p><p>He pushed Goodwin underwater, holding him there until the man stopped slicing and kicking. Sebastian released him then, splashing toward the faint white he saw in the distance. At last there was another splash behind him. He heard Michalas call out and could barely respond.</p><p>At last his hand touched something warm and human again . . . and then hair. He pulled, felt her come up against him. She wasn\u2019t moving, she wasn\u2019t breathing. He pulled, keeping her face from the water, dragging her to the side, onto the bank where Pesaro and Brim were clambering down the rocky edge.</p><p>Light danced behind him as he turned her onto her stomach, her face to the side. Blood everywhere, her face bruised and cut, her hair a mat of curls, her body cold and white. \u201cNo, Victoria, dammit,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>He felt the others come up behind him, down from the rocky wall, carrying torches. He kissed her cold face, brushed the hair from her eyes, willing himself not to think of Giulia . . . not to think of losing yet again.</p><p>Not to Bemis Goodwin. By God, not to the likes of Bemis Goodwin.</p><p>He struck her hard between the shoulder blades, and gave her a desperate shake.</p><p>Victoria coughed, and Sebastian rolled her to the side. Water spewed forth and she coughed more, her body wracked and shaking. Someone\u2014Brim\u2014handed down a dry coat and he wrapped it around her. The golden light encircled them, illuminating her face, the bruises, the three slices down her cheek, the myriad of other, smaller ones.</p><p>Her closed eyes were shadowed but at last fluttered, opening. Sebastian breathed easier. . . . She opened them, looked up at him. She looked at him, and he smiled, feeling the tug to one side of his mouth.</p><p>And then her gaze moved on, beyond, her eyes falling somewhere behind him. Her lips moved.</p><p>Sebastian recognized the look. Read the word, the simple name on her lips. Saw the expression on her face. It was his hand she clutched, her cold fingers gripping tightly. But the look was not meant for him.</p><p>He\u2019d suspected . . . for far too long. Perhaps he\u2019d always known, and that was part of the reason for the animosity, the discord, the enmity. He\u2019d hoped, simply hoped he was wrong.</p><p>Hope drained away, leaving him empty.</p><p>He\u2019d lost.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>An Au Revoir</p><p>Wayren embraced Victoria, sending the warmth of something like maternal comfort washing over her . . . then pulled away to look into her eyes. Searching. \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d she said, relief in her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Victoria looked at her. \u201cYou could see it?\u201d</p><p>The woman nodded. \u201cA shadow . . . perhaps not so different than what you saw in the eyes of the daytime vampires. I admit, it\u2019s more obvious now that it\u2019s no longer there.\u201d</p><p>It was late that night after they returned from Victoria\u2019s near drowning in the sewers. Aunt Eustacia\u2019s parlor was crowded with an unusual bulk of Venators: Brim, who was by far the most massive, Michalas, Sebastian, Max . . . and also Kritanu, who, despite the loss of his hand and the number of vampire bites, still seemed almost more complete than the latter two. He sat in the chair that had been Eustacia\u2019s, near the piecrust table, silent and watchful.</p><p>Victoria looked at Michalas and Brim, then turned her attention to Sebastian. He watched her steadily, as though gulping in the sight of her. She wanted to flush. \u201cIt took you long enough to arrive,\u201d she said, humor in her voice, trying to sound light . . . when inside she was a turmoil. She ached; her body ached and burned and still oozed blood. She\u2019d easily be dead if she weren\u2019t a Venator. \u201cI\u2019d begun to wonder if something had happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew we were coming,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was your plan, and it worked flawlessly . . . except that that blasted carriage of Barth\u2019s broke a wheel and delayed us.\u201d</p><p>Brim laughed. \u201cSebastian was fit to kill the man, as if it was his fault that the wheel broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way he drives, it likely was,\u201d said Max from the corner. \u201cIt nearly cost us everything.\u201d His bitterness settled in the air.</p><p>There was a charged silence, and then Victoria spoke. \u201cBut it did not,\u201d she said smoothly. \u201cNot only did we ruin Lilith\u2019s plan to assassinate the king, but I\u2019m certain she\u2019s not foolish enough to stay here in London any longer. Nor did she get the Ring of Jubai, which, thanks to Sebastian, Wayren can now add to the collection at the Consilium.\u201d</p><p>The others nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd so the Queen of England is a daytime vampire,\u201d Brim said, disbelief in his voice. \u201cHow has no one realized this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been taking the elixir since she turned, I venture to say, which can\u2019t have been very long ago. So she\u2019s dying,\u201d added Victoria simply. \u201cI doubt she\u2019ll last another week or two.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cWe could find a way to help her along, I\u2019m certain . . . but I see no point in doing so. Why should we take the chance of being involved?\u201d She frowned grimly. \u201cI had a bad enough experience with the Bow Street Runners and Newgate that I wish to remain anonymous for awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Gwendolyn. How long had she been undead?\u201d asked Michalas.</p><p>Victoria suddenly felt impatient with the questions. She wanted everyone to leave . . . she needed time alone. So much had happened, so much had changed. She could hardly keep from looking at Max, gauging every scratch and scar and bruise on his face. And the rough bites on his neck . . . the ones that wouldn\u2019t heal nearly as quickly as hers. But at least they were merely bites from Lilith, and nothing more.</p><p>And he, for his part, brooded in the corner, saying little. Sending her black looks that certainly did not bespeak affection. He was furious with her. Dark and angry . . . in a way he\u2019d not been before.</p><p>It made her question what she\u2019d seen in his eyes in Lilith\u2019s lair. Had she imagined it?</p><p>And Sebastian . . . Victoria felt her stomach squeeze. He\u2019d become aloof. Still cocksure and engaging, but . . . aloof. Since he\u2019d pulled her from the water and rescued her from Bemis Goodwin, something had changed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Affection surged in her . . . and apprehension. She had to talk with him. Her eyes fell to her scarred hands and she let Sebastian answer Michalas\u2019s question with his own conjecture.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not certain how long she\u2019d been undead, but she couldn\u2019t have had the elixir for very long, of course. She must have begun taking it as soon as her brother returned from Italy\u2014with the queen, and the serum.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to need to speak, whereas Max did nothing but glower from the corner. Victoria could feel his impatience, his need to get away.</p> <p>\u201cI have the suspicion,\u201d Sebastian continued, \u201cand perhaps we\u2019ll never know for certain, that Gwendolyn was already part of the Tutela when Victoria and I were at her house party with John Polidori. She must have been planning something for a long time\u2014and then she had to wait until we returned from Italy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she sent her brother after you,\u201d said Max.</p><p>Michalas nodded, his eyes light with humor. \u201cIt was all the women, wasn\u2019t it? Lilith, Caroline, Sara, Gwen . . . all stymied by our Victoria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weary,\u201d Wayren said, standing suddenly. Perhaps she sensed the undercurrents, perhaps she merely understood that Victoria was, indeed, exhausted. Heart-sick, worried, weary . . . yet hopeful. Ridiculously hopeful. \u201cWe can discuss this at another time.\u201d</p><p>No one argued with Wayren; Max was the first one out the door. He limped, moving a bit gingerly, but still graceful. And he was gone.</p> <p>Sebastian stayed when Victoria closed her fingers around his wrist.</p><p>The door shut and they were alone.</p><p>He said nothing, just looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI . . . Sebastian,\u201d she began, but he raised a four-fingered hand . . . whether he used that one purposely or not, she didn\u2019t know. It would be just like him to, as he put it, play up his heroism. She smiled. She did love him.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t. Please.\u201d He gave her a crooked smile, one that still had the power to send a tingle to her belly . . . just not the right tingle. \u201cMy pride cannot handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . . did you know?\u201d</p> <p>He settled his golden hands on her shoulders, one finger stretching up to caress the side of her neck. \u201cIt\u2019s been there for all to see . . . for whoever cared to look. I chose not to . . . and so has he. Victoria.\u201d His voice became urgent, his fingers tightened. \u201cHe\u2019s not worthy of you. He hasn\u2019t the ability to . . . feel. I don\u2019t want you to be hurt. And yet\u2014no.\u201d He shook his head sharply. His sensual lips firmed so that a humorless dimple appeared. \u201cI can\u2019t wish you well, or wish you to be with him. I simply cannot. He\u2019s made it clear to me that\u2014\u201d He stopped, squeezed her shoulders, bent to kiss her.</p><p>It was a farewell kiss\u2014she read that much in it. Or, at least, an au revoir kiss . . . rather than an adieu. An \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you\u201d kiss, rather than a good-bye.</p><p>When she pulled away, he was breathing unsteadily, and so to be honest was she. Sebastian made her feel . . . yes, he did. He turned up the spark, he curled her insides, he made her soft and liquid . . . but it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>And as he looked down at her, she saw the understanding in his face. And she knew that in this, as always, he\u2019d be the gentleman.</p><p>Victoria knew where to find Max.</p><p>She knocked, but didn\u2019t wait for his answer before she opened the door to the small bedchamber. The same room in which she\u2019d awakened only this morning.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d His voice was sharp. Annoyed.</p><p>She\u2019d surprised him. He was sitting in a chair, reading a book.</p> <p>Reading a bloody book, the bastard.</p><p>The skin on his face and neck, and what little she could see under the loose shirt he wore, was scraped and raw. The bite marks from Lilith were no longer oozing, but the marks were there, angry purple-red ones, despite the salted holy water Wayren had poured on them. At least they would heal.</p><p>When he looked at her, his eyes were flat, devoid of emotion, even anger.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>That was the wrong thing to say; she realized it as soon as the words came out. His eyes went darker and his face became even stonier.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have gone there, Victoria. You should have bloody well stayed away and let things happen.\u201d He stood, anger rolling off him in waves. \u201cYou were nearly killed, you stupid, addled woman!\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and her throat squeaked. \u201cI told you I would come. I wasn\u2019t about to leave you with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have taken care of myself,\u201d he thundered, slamming a hand down onto the table. A glass and carafe rattled against each other. \u201cWhen will you learn to do what\u2019s right for everyone\u2014not just what you want to do? Blasted stubborn, infantile woman. You take risks for no bloody reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should speak,\u201d she said, just as angry now. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Illa Gardella,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI\u2019m no one!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never seen him angry like this . . . it was different from the cold, deep fury when she\u2019d drugged him and locked him up. That was silent and deadly anger. This was . . . uncontrollable. Almost uncontrollable. And laced with desperation.</p><p>That was it . . . desperation. And . . . fear?</p><p>And that gave her the impetus to push further.</p><p>\u201cMust you remind me constantly?\u201d she said. \u201cIf you had it your way, I\u2019d be locked up in some blasted tower while the rest of the Venators fight and risk their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no longer a Venator, Victoria.\u201d Bitterness. Oh, such bitterness.</p><p>\u201cYou are in every way that matters,\u201d she said. If she thought that sentiment would ease him, she was deluded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want your damned pity, Victoria. Just go away. Leave me be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you alone, Max.\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want. Vioget can. He can protect you, take care of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect me?\u201d Now she was shrieking. She took a deep breath, pulled back on the anger. Calmed her voice. \u201cI don\u2019t need anyone to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria,\u201d he said, moving toward her. He grabbed her, then shoved her away as if remembering what had happened the last time he\u2019d gripped her in anger. His fingers closed into fists. \u201cYou nearly died . . . or worse. Didn\u2019t you see it? Didn\u2019t you see what she was doing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pushing you . . . she nearly pushed you the wrong way. And, Christ, look at you! And those bloody dogs, tearing you to pieces.\u201d His voice was rough, unsteady. \u201cShe\u2019ll do it again. She\u2019ll be after you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I had to watch her put her hands on you, drink from you, Max. I saw it, saw the look in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019ll be after me again . . . and again. And she\u2019ll use you, Victoria. She\u2019ll use you to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Max, after what happened . . . what happened between us\u2014\u201d</p><p>He reared away from her at that, literally took two steps back. \u201cDon\u2019t be a bloody fool. I told you we needn\u2019t mention it to anyone and we won\u2019t. Vioget need not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m sorry for him, but it won\u2019t matter. The man is so damned infatuated with you, you could put him last in the line of your lovers and he\u2019d not care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She took a step toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictoria, you\u2019ll do nothing but cause your own bloody embarrassment if you keep on this route.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to give me your ring, your only chance of escape from Lilith . . . so that I\u2019d die before I turned. I saw you, Max.\u201d</p><p>He sneered. \u201cI\u2019d have done it for anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the look in your eyes when I saved Sara. You can\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then shutters came over his face, cutting off all expression. He breathed deeply and there was a charged silence.</p><p>\u201cMax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want from me, Victoria? A declaration of undying adoration?\u201d</p><p>His face was suddenly close to hers, his eyes flashing with anger and frustration. His fingers dug into her shoulders, and then he shoved her away, turning his face for a moment. Then, hands on his hips, a great space between them, he looked at her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, glaring. \u201cI\u2019ll say it.\u201d His face grew even darker, burning with impatience. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to love you, but I can\u2019t help it. I don\u2019t want to be without you, but I bloody well will. Victoria, I\u2019ll not go through this again. I\u2019ll not risk your damned neck again. It\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d</p><p>Relief seeped through her, then was replaced by annoyance and raging frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re mad! What about Kritanu and Aunt Eustacia? Did he walk away? Did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could lock you up, and know you\u2019d always be safe . . . and I know that can\u2019t bloody well happen. But I won\u2019t be part of it, I won\u2019t make it any worse than it has to be. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d His voice was rough.</p><p>\u201cI never took you for a coward, Max.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoward?\u201d His laugh was sharp and humorless. And a little crazy. \u201cWhen it comes to risking your life, yes, yes, dammit, yes, I am. I\u2019m a bloody damned coward.\u201d</p><p>He spun away, slamming the door behind him. The glasses on the table rattled.</p><p>Victoria looked at the door and a slow smile pulled at her mouth. Now that she knew the truth, she was determined.</p><p>That would be the last damned time Max walked away from her. </p> </body></html>"]
